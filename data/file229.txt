2290220 as long as its done tastefully i dont have a problem with it
2290221 if it slows things up and gets people to do knee bending and rubbernecking then its not a good idea

2290256 by the way did you know erin andrews got her start in television doing hockey in tampa she doesnt mention it a lot now because its probably in her contract not to
2290257 see his name in the headline and move on to something more interesting
2290258 having never been an nhl player i dont understand how the mind of a veteran star works
2290259 ive never claimed to be an intelligent journalist or even someone with a half respectable blog
2290260 you have to want to be an nhl player it doesnt work if youre playing for the money or any reason other than the pure hunger to win it all
2290261 if he doesnt make the team or plays less than 10 nhl games his contract would then kick in starting next season although the 10 percent signing bonus is his to keep
2290262 in december 2009 the canadiens will become the first professional hockey team to celebrate a century of history

2290266 youll venture through space exploring new civilizations and life forms
2290267 youll also beam down to planets and have adventures inside your ship
2290268 one of the biggest worries or warnings i guess with prader willi syndrome is obesity and then of course diabetes is generated from that also another scary thing that can happen with prader willi syndrome is they dont know when to stop eating
2290269 at this point theres no cure for prader willi syndrome but there our treatments and again it goes back to early diagnosis the sooner people are aware of the condition they can seek treatment
2290270 like someone else did a couple of years ago with breast cancer awareness we decided to do a prader willi awareness being that luke has it
2290271 at that point we decided to paint our hoods white and decal them up and try to raise money out here

2290284 i dont have a website for this game but had one for our other games in the past
2290285 90 of people buy a software package for only 10 of their features

2290287 hit enter and get a result in 0 0322 seconds
2290288 i was two feet from the water with a delicate stance almost on my tip toes i had to hit the shot to the right and i did and as i followed through the ground gave way i swung my arms three or four times trying to regain my balance but it was too late i fell on my backside and got wet up to my belly button the pants drip dried but i did change my socks i ended up making bogey for zero points after jeremy fished me out
2290289 i came running at him and i pulled him out i think that was the difference between him getting all of his pants wet and his whole body wet so it was kind of funny
2290290 most of those games with the exception of detroit fall within the holidays
2290291 we know detroit is a key game for this market its going to drive the casual fan into our building opening night needs to be a sellout and the premium pricing is geared to games where we have a lot of snowbirds in the market
2290292 i saw mark cuban mention something about it a while back i dont know if he explicitly labeled it variable pricing but the idea was the same try to recapture for the teams themselves some of those revenues that are going to the secondary ticket sellers
2290293 in many cases secondary ticket sellers are buying up the inventory for those games
2290294 the main thing teams want is to maximize revenues for premium games
2290295 but they can also make their season ticket packages more attractive by saying buy the whole deal and then you wont have to pay the premium for all these marquee games
2290296 if you want the luxury of going to a game like that without making a commitment to us on season tickets ok but its like anything youre charged for it
2290297 the danger is that you could be pricing out future long term fans by establishing a premium value for these marquee games
2290298 but having said that those fans might get shut out anyway
2290299 every business in the world prices their product based on demand i dont know why hockey should be different
2290300 come and see the stars of the detroit red wings as they come into town
2290301 as buffalo managing partner larry quinn told the buffalo news
2290302 and ill admit i was leaning to boston because every time hes played for claude hes done well
2290303 i think he made a good choice for us the time zones better too its much easier for us to watch games in the east
2290304 but as a college hockey fan in addition to an nhl fan its hard for me to get really attached to pro teams players get traded and some players play more for themselves and not the team and you only get four shots at the national championship if youre lucky whereas a pro player arguably has their career to get a stanley cup not that stanleys any more easily obtained or less important than the ncaa championship

2290311 this constitutes blatant and harmful intervention on the part of military elements in considerations that are strictly academic
2290312 since its inception the state of israel has adamantly upheld the tradition of academic freedom
2290313 we expect the security establishment to preserve this tradition and deal solely with security related matters
2290314 israeli universities open their gates to all those who meet the academic demands irrespective of race sex religion or nationality
2290315 for many years jews in europe suffered from restrictions on their academic freedom which manifested themselves in numerus clausus one of the many methods used to limit the number of jewish students at universities

2290327 the wings will miss him and although its a sad day for some this is an amicable parting
2290328 he came in and he drove our players he made some moves as the director of player personnel to bring in slava fetisov who is ever going to forget that who is ever going to forget him putting together the russian five or scotty really willing steve yzerman to become in my opinion the best two way player in the game and obviously the championships
2290329 he played very well for us when called upon over the past two seasons he is young competitor with great skills and an excellent work ethic

2290333 we can help alleviate shortages by drilling for oil and gas in our own country
2290334 we have got the opportunity to find more crude oil here at home
2290335 as a nation we can have more control over our energy destiny by supplying more of the oil and natural gas well be consuming from resources here at home
2290336 it doesnt look good to say we need more oil but then export the refined products that youre getting it doesnt seem to be consistent
2290337 the fact is that the united states participates in global markets for both crude and refined products and there are any number of variables that impact supply and prices in those markets
2290338 forbidding exports of u s petroleum reduces the incentive for domestic suppliers to produce and could potentially lead to higher prices if u s production or refining declined

2290353 we believe aafia has been in custody ever since she disappeared
2290354 and were not willing to believe that the discovery of aafia in afghanistan is coincidence
2290355 there are many questions that the fbi and the pakistani government need to answer in light of this admission why have the fbi continued to pretend to be seeking her while all the while knowing of her detention in afghanistan is aafia indeed prisoner 650 whose screams were heard by former bagram prisoners
2290356 aafia siddiqui is a woman who has been plagued by a number of problems in her life none of which have anything to do with involvement with al qaeda
2290357 whilst we welcome this disclosure reform the fbi it has only come after mounting international pressure and five years of detention and abuse siddiquis case represents the problem of disappearances in pakistan in the most tragic way the acceptance by the fbi that siddiqui has been in custody in afghanistan raises important questions which must be answered by the pakistani and us governments siddiqui must be returned to pakistan in order to faces charges for any crime she may have committed or released along with her children

2290396 i really like the balance of our schedule and i think it prepares us well for the pac 10 season
2290397 we have a solid blend of non conference opponents and we are playing in two very strong events in the oreilly auto parts cbe classic and the big 12 pac 10 hardwood series those two events give us a chance to really test ourselves against some quality opponents overall i like the way our schedule is constructed and i think it gives us a chance to mature our team as the season progresses

2290407 these are recommendations for voluntary changes in behavior that we have shared many times before
2290408 what makes this list different is that all of these recommendations will become requirements should we implement the next steps in water conservation called out in the municipal code

2290585 we felt like we had a deal a long time ago with tony with a handshake the test was just trying to get it on paper tony is what we consider a franchise player and one of the foundations of the team hes part of the family
2290586 tony gave us our first pole our first win and our first championship and thats the kind of relationship that weve had
2290587 you know like so many families once in a while we have our squabbles sometimes they get pretty loud but i promise you that guy sitting up here theres nobody more motivated in the sport
2290588 theres still a few things to iron out but hes going to be here next year
2290589 now we can concentrate on finishing out this season strong and getting ready for next year
2290590 we thought we should have at least three of the four as championship contenders
2290591 weve been very competitive at almost every racetrack and thats probably the most frustrating thing weve been in the position to win quite a few races but either an incident on the racetrack has taken us out or driver error or in fairness some bad strategy on our part
2290592 i had a little meeting with them after the last race and i think we all are pretty much on the same page
2290593 there is no no 1 driver what has made this team work i think is that there isnt that its the four working together have we had that all year this year no has there had to be some reminders yes

2290598 it will strengthen our resolve to do it this time
2290599 we have kept the basis of the team this season ok we have lost gilberto who was very experienced and very important in the dressing room also we lost mathieu flamini and alex hleb but we brought in nasri and also we have many young players who are one year older and have learned a lot
2290600 we have made a big improvement from two years ago to last year and now we want to continue we were a short way from winning the league and the champions league that is why we want to continue with the way we play and keep the belief

2290694 i enjoyed listening to the podcasts ben and sherona were funny and made the last hours before midnight pass quickly
2290695 if they feel like their child might not have everything that they might need they can look at this as another opportunity it gives people more choices and thats whats so great about that its really cool that we can do that in georgia
2290696 why dont you try teaching for three weeks and then you can speak with some sense regarding education you cant make silk purses from sows ears
2290697 my heart breaks for our students as i know we have failed them i look in the faces of our kindergarten students who have made so much progress this year and know we have very little to offer them for the future unless things change one day they will be eighth graders in a school that is not equipped to prepare them for high school
2290698 see womens gymnastics is tough because the girls are really young so you have to be a little bit careful with how you express some things you want to humanize it you know but you also dont want people to misinterpret things that youre saying so youve got to be pretty judicious with your word choice it takes practice
2290699 see check it out lets say youre watching a 16 year old girl do a floor routine
2290700 its perfectly fine to describe her as delightful or cute as a button people like that but you start to get in trouble if you say something like shes the type of girl that youd like to see naked in the backseat of your car wearing pigtails see the difference
2290701 the type of girl youd want to have as a daughter
2290702 but then i went on to say that if she wasnt your daughter youd at least like her as your kids babysitter where you could give her a ride home late at night when it was really dark outside and all of a sudden people start to freak out
2290703 its so quick its like all of a sudden you go from things going perfectly fine to total bedlam they pulled me off the air so fast that i didnt even have time to read my essay about how the pommel horse should be used in womens gymnastics as well
2290704 ive got some great material prepared in advance for example i know that one girl from russia has a teddy bear collection of more than 1 000 bears 20 of which she brought to beijing with her i also have a whole thing about this one other 15 year old girl from romania who i think would look really cute in a pleated skirt with pigtails and knee high socks so i did a whole little photoshop thing of her that i think is gonna really bring the house down
2290705 it takes a very special qualification to be allowed to carry the gt r
2290706 our volume of z in the last three years was interesting enough for us to get this
2290707 she was hot she was sweaty and she found no one in the playground
2290708 how can this happen how can someone forget a child
2290709 we leave them in their care their supervision so how could someone leave a child for an hour and 10 minutes and not know theyre missing
2290710 every time we drive by the playground shell say thats where i was left all alone i was crying on the yellow slide
2290711 ive been in love with the same woman for 30 plus years and as anybody whos been around us knows shes an extraordinary human being warm loving beautiful sexy and as good a person as i have ever known so the storys just false
2290712 thousands of friends of the senators and his supporters have put their faith and confidence in him and hes let them down
2290713 you cant lie in politics and expect to have peoples confidence
2290714 i want to see our party lead on the great moral issues yes me a democrat using that word the great moral issues that face our country
2290715 if we want to live in a moral honest just america and if we want to live in a moral and just world we cant wait for somebody else to do it we have to do it
2290716 when you look into a mirror do you like whats looking at you now that youve seen your true reflections what on earth are you gonna do
2290717 i actually walked the country to see who i am who i really am but i dont know what the result of that will be
2290718 im a little concerned about the citizens to make sure that they are satisfied and feeling safe
2290719 council has decided now to take a real hard look at the criterion that well use for choosing the next chief
2290720 with a crime wave going on in the wilmington area the more police the better
2290721 hopefully our citizens are taking this all in stride everyone seems to be doing okay with it
2290722 pedss helps hospital disaster response personnel produce and maintain disaster response plans that apply best practice pediatric recommendations to their particular local conditions and requirements

2290725 from the first day i was able to represent brian and the paper work was officially filed we worked aggressively with the team to try to make something work
2290726 we tried to get very creative and find a structure that would allow us to get something done while still dealing with the rules that were in place
2290727 i cant speak to why the deal didnt get done before but i know we kept hammering away in order to do something that made sense for the player
2290728 we set a timetable with the team so this would be dragged and for whatever reason we were able to get it done

2290731 i am sure guilianis new marriage is much happier than his old and its an interesting sign of change that people are now willing to give politicians a second or even third chance at happiness
2290732 however the way guiliani broke up with his last wife does raise the question of whether having a happy marriage is necessarily a sign of a good personal character
2290733 obviously i think thats great for galvestonians because had those two proposals passed i believe it would have been devastating to the citys operations
2290734 hopefully the public got educated on the effects of the things
2290735 i can only speculate but my opinion is that if he had the signatures he would have gone forward with it
2290736 and i didnt appreciate that they county officials made us feel like if we stand up against the tax you the county are going to label me a commie pinko whos soft on crime
2290737 there is a very brave and outspoken woman in the afghan parliament named malalai joya
2290738 my criticism to all my peers is why should we allow the legitimacy and legality of this constitutional assembly to become questionable with the presence of these felons who brought our country to this war torn condition please see the committees and what people are whispering about the chairman of every committee is already selected why not put all these criminals on one committee and let them tell us what they want for this nation these were those who turned our country into the nucleus of national and international wars they were the most anti women people in the society who brought our country to this state and intend to do the same again i believe that it is a mistake to give them a second chance they should be taken to national and international court if they are forgiven by our people the barefooted afghan people our history will never forgive them
2290739 do you believe that the nato troops in afghanistan are helping to improve security
2290740 what would you like americans to know about your country
2290741 i want them to know that afghan people have been victims of the u
2290742 theres no security if they dont have security how can we talk about womens rights human rights in afghanistan
2290743 the support of the innocent people of afghanistan who do not have power who do not have money who are very suffering people this gives me courage determination
2290744 they will kill me but they will not kill my voice because it will be the voice of all afghan women you can cut the flower but you cannot stop the coming of spring
2290745 never again will i whisper in the shadows of intimidation i am but a symbol of my peoples struggle and a servant to their cause and if i were to be killed for what i believe in then let my blood be the beacon for emancipation and my words a revolutionary paradigm for generations to come
2290746 the men and women of afghanistan are like pigeons who have been freed from taliban cages but whose wings have been cut off and who are in the claws of vampires who suck their blood
2290747 and most of those vampires are to be found in parliament
2290748 president bush owes us an apology for supporting extremist war lords the northern alliance criminals
2290749 how can our people be hopeful that the parliament will arrange a way to put the war criminals of our country in international or national courts when some of the most famous criminals in the country are in parliament
2290750 i strongly believe that they will destroy all of the flowers but they cannot stop the spring one day we will have everything in our country
2290751 it doesnt matter to me if they suspend me from parliament because they have the power and they can do whatever they want but the enemies of our country should realize that they have given me a better chance to fight them
2290752 our country is being run by a mafia and while it is in power there is no hope for freedom for the people of afghanistan how can anyone man or woman enjoy basic freedoms when living under the shadow of warlords the government was not democratically elected and it is now trying to use the countrys islamic law as a tool with which to limit womens rights
2290753 it was inconceivable to me that my government would be coming through my door
2290754 five dollars in silver payable to the bearer on demand
2290755 in the us neither paper currency nor deposits have value as commodities intrinsically a dollar bill is just a piece of paper deposits are merely book entries coins do have some intrinsic value as metal but generally far less than their face amount what then makes these instruments checks paper money and coins acceptable at face value in payment of all debts and for other monetary uses mainly it is the confidence people have that they will be able to exchange such money for other financial assets and real goods and services whenever they choose to do so this partly is a matter of law currency has been designated legal tender by the government that is it must be accepted
2290756 the arguments in favor of the constitutionality of legal tender paper currency tend directly to break down the barriers which separate a government of limited powers from a government resting on the unrestrained will of congress
2290757 a government with unrestrained powers is properly characterized as tyrannical
2290758 to coin money regulate the value thereof and of foreign coin and fix the standard of weights and measures
2290759 no state shall coin money emit bills of credit make any thing but gold and silver coin a tender in payment of debt
2290760 congress is not permitted by the constitution to abdicate or to transfer to others the essential legislative functions with which it is vested
2290761 the abandonment of the gold standard made it possible for the welfare statists to use the banking system as a means to an unlimited expansion of credit the law of supply and demand is not to be conned as the supply of money increases relative to the supply of tangible assets in the economy prices must eventually rise thus the earnings saved by the productive members of the society lose value in terms of goods when the economys books are finally balanced one finds that this loss in value represents the goods purchased by the government for welfare or other purposes with the money proceeds of the government bonds financed by bank credit expansion in the absence of the gold standard there is no way to protect savings from confiscation through inflation there is no safe store of value if there were the government would have to make its holding illegal as was done in the case of gold the financial policy of the welfare state requires that there be no way for the owners of wealth to protect themselves this is the shabby secret of the welfare statists tirades against gold deficit spending is simply a scheme for the confiscation of wealth gold stands in the way of this insidious process it stands as a protector of property rights if one grasps this one has no difficulty in understanding the statists antagonism toward the gold standard
2290762 there is no inherent anchor in a fiat money regime
2290763 there is no support for a gold standard today and i see no likelihood of its return
2290764 living so free is a tragedy when you cant see what you need to see
2290765 it was inconceivable to me that my government would be coming through my door
2290766 to sit here and not sign it and postpone this is just poor management this is a project that would take thousands of people off the road
2290767 i dont want to take possession of something that looks like this if we have not done our studies to show theres no contamination in it
2290768 if youre going to put dirt in it who cares about stagnant water right now
2290769 but until we have the proper information im not moving forward
2290770 products that claim to be eco friendly but do not list all their ingredients or which use generic terms like anionic surfactant cannot be adequately evaluated for their effect on human health or the environment
2290771 shes a little frustrated with the system right now a little bit in disbelief
2290772 she was doing everything she thought was in the childrens best interest and yet shes in jail right now for doing that but we are going to fight and we trust justice will prevail and she will be found not guilty
2290773 you cant just flee in the middle of the night
2290774 at this time we feel satisfied with where the children are
2290775 erica alphonse is their mother thats where they need to be
2290776 now that facebook despite trying hard has not been successful in the german market the company seeks to obstruct studivz through court action
2290777 if he wants to have a future in politics hes going to have to work at it and recoup some good will
2290778 thousands of friends of the senators and his supporters have put their faith and confidence in him and hes let them down
2290779 there is one man who knows in his heart that it is time to create one america and not two and that man is barack obama
2290780 we are all deeply disappointed to be announcing such results and apologise for the pain this has caused our shareholders

2290782 underlying earnings power of the group remains strong even through these difficult markets
2290783 the process continues with rbs insurance we are talking to interested parties we do believe that we will get a deal at an acceptable price
2290784 the one outcome it the process will not have is the disposal of rbs insurance at a price we dont think is appropriate to our shareholders

2290794 of the different malicious attacks outlined in this document conventional attacks on transport systems are judged to be some of the more likely to occur
2290795 this assessment is supported by the many examples of this type of attack perpetrated by different groups across the globe
2290796 it is impossible to forecast its exact timing or the precise nature of its impact
2290797 this should be sufficient to treat all those who fall ill in a pandemic of similar proportions to those that occurred in the 20th century
2290798 the government is collaborating actively with international partners on prevention detection and research and is taking every practical step to ensure that the uk is prepared to limit the internal spread of a pandemic and to minimise health economic and social harm as far as possible
2290799 the use of some cbrn materials has the potential to have very serious and widespread consequences an example would be the use of a nuclear device there is no historical precedent for this type of terrorist attack
2290800 i have great faith in the public and they would prefer to have information because the thing that causes fear is ignorance of things
2290801 barack wants to focus on new technologies to cut foreign oil dependency and mccain wants offshore drilling well why dont we do a hybrid of both candidates ideas we can do limited offshore drilling with strict environmental oversight while creating tax incentives to get detroit making hybrid and electric cars that way the offshore drilling carries us until the new technologies kick in which will then create new jobs and energy independence energy crisis solved
2290802 i know he really wants to go and i feel so bad saying this because i really get along with him

2290852 we have already indicated that culture is a complex matrix of interacting elements culture is ubiquitous multidimensional complex and all pervasive because it is so broad there is not a single definition or central theory of what it is definitions of culture run the gamut from an all encompassing phenomenon to descriptions listing nearly all human activity for our purposes we define culture as the deposit of knowledge experience beliefs values attitudes meanings hierarchies religion notions of time roles spatial relations concepts of the universe and material objects and possessions acquired by a group of people in the course of generations through individual and group striving
2290853 ive voted republican all my life republicans swear by not raising taxes and raising taxes would hurt families in poverty like mine

2290874 this is a good day for the tigers the zoo and the people of iraq
2290875 our heart goes out to the two tigers who had to endure the long trip to iraq and a dangerous future at the baghdad zoo
2290876 these tigers will be caged helpless and completely dependent on humans to survive in an area where many people live in fear and are still without access to basic necessities
2290877 we have the utmost concern for the well being of the tigers
2290878 we have full confidence that the baghdad zoo has the staff and facilities to care for them long into the future

2290881 in addition to utilizing a secret motion and secret hearing to obtain an order that facially violates the letter of the public records law your staff also failed to adhere to the spirit of the law and to federal and state case law both of which require the consideration of alternatives less draconian than sealing

2290883 the way most of philosophys worked is it deals with just one persons intuitions
2290884 some guy who has a ph d from a fancy northeastern ivy league school goes and sits in his very comfortable cozy home and tells you the way concepts work and the way things are and many of the times the assumptions he makes turn out to be false the only way you can figure out whats true and whats false is by going and asking people
2290885 philosophers need to look at expanding their relevance to the real world and not just stay in the ivory tower of universities
2290886 these intuitions we have that are hypocritical or inconsistent most people have them
2290887 and one way of trying to help perhaps the political problem is by showing the psychological issue
2290888 in order for it to be a philosophy youd have to be able to do experiments and induce and deduce a philosophy from that
2290889 i heard psychology maybe a little sociology but i didnt hear any philosophy
2290890 its such a fellowship we get judges to play we get engineers to play we get shaw university students to play you can see whats going on in their mind by whats on the board

2290895 when he came into the weavers to replace pete seeger which was a pretty tall order he not only did that but he brought so much of his own talents to bear that it was overwhelming it really was
2290896 he was an absolutely logical person to be brought in
2290897 of the next generation of weavers i mean he was so outstanding that it was hard then or even now to imagine who else we could have brought in other than erik
2290898 three musicians who had recently been planning something with him told me he didnt tell them either
2290899 a close friend of his said he was a great eccentric sure he was also a beautiful soul i will miss him very much
2290900 although cultures do change most changes affects only the surface structure of the culture the deep structure resists major alternations while visible changes in dress food transportations housing and the like are simply attached to the existing cultural value system elements associated with the deep structure of a culture such as values ethics and morals work and leisure definitions of freedom the importance of the past religious practices the space of life and attitudes toward gender and age are so very deep in the structure of a culture that they tend to persist generations after generation when analyzing cultural change we cannot let ourselves be fooled just because downtown tokyo looks much like paris london or new york most of what is important in a culture is below the surface it is like the moon we observe the front which appears flat and one dimensional but there is another side and dimensions that we cannot see

2290908 foucault has not escaped so completely from the vulnerable episteme of historicism as he might like or imagine but perhaps like half revolutions half escapes are enough and will suffice it is just such a half escape whatever he intended that makes discipline and punish so fascinating as with so many prisoners of so many kinds it is not getting out but wanting out that generates in foucault a strange and special vision

2290916 we are not stopping public debates it is something healthy but it should be organised in a closed manner

2290926 yahoo has a long history of providing clear notice to our users via our privacy policy and is always exploring additional avenues for enhanced notice
2290927 consumers have and continue to respond strongly to internet products and services that are customized to their interests
2290928 yahoo strongly believes that consumers want choice when customizing their online experience and they have also demonstrated a strong preference for advertising that is more personally relevant to them
2290929 bloggers or families who want to occasionally post content are generally subsidized by the advertising business model through free or reduced cost hosting and also through the ability to have text graphical and even video ads appear on the site
2290930 this ability to make money while sharing views increases the number of viewpoints that can be taken in public debates and surely enriches our public conversation as a nation and as a global society
2290931 no one is saying that there cant be targeted marketing
2290932 but individual users should have the right to decide what information can be collected and how it can be used for online targeting
2290933 everybody has known about this forever with conventional locks like kwikset
2290934 but high security locks advertise that they have key control especially medeco
2290935 so weve demonstrated the ability to simply make keys for this particular high security lock

2290947 if selfish genes are frankensteins and all life is their monster it is only we that can complete the fable by turning against our creators

2290968 we believe that standing up for our country means standing up against sexism and all intolerance demeaning portrayals of women cheapen our debates dampen the dreams of our daughters and deny us the contributions of too many responsibility lies with us all
2290969 whatever decision is made its going to be a collaborative decision
2290970 i think all this sort of speculation is much ado about very little

2290972 i think what were looking for is energy and excitement
2290973 you could argue that no ones ever ready to be president i mean i certainly learned a lot about the job in the first year you could argue that even if youve been vice president for eight years that no one can ever be fully ready for the pressures of the office and that everyone learns something and something different you could argue that

2290985 people will get their money and get it back in the immediate future
2290986 its not necessary to do this if theres a market in ethiopia
2290987 we have two interested companies they want to invest in ethiopia because they see this big market
2290988 theres already a market there because people are already paying for their energy needs even if theyre paying for the kerosene on a monthly basis and dry cell batteries
2290989 this is just bringing it onto a more environmentally sustainable and viable platform
2290990 its not the cheapest one but i think in this area we shouldnt use the cheapest material
2290991 we have very good modules because they should work for 25 years we have uv resistant cable because they have a lot of sun and if you use cheap cable it will be damaged after two years

2291011 tom mccabe speaking as someone who morally disapproves of murder id like to see the ai reprogram everyone back or cryosuspend them all indefinitely or upload them into a sub matrix where they can think theyre happily murdering each other without all the actual murder of course your hypothetical murder lovers would call this immoral but im not about to start taking the moral arguments of murder lovers seriously

2291055 the end times a new testament reference to the period surrounding the return of christ were popularized in recent years by the

2291057 the rev tim lahaye co author of the series said in an interview that he recognized allusions to his work in the ad but comparisons between sen obama and the antichrist are incorrect
2291058 the antichrist isnt going to be an american so it cant possibly be obama
2291059 the bible makes it clear he will be from an obscure place like romania
2291060 short of 666 they used every single symbol of the antichrist in this ad

2291063 only marriage between a man and a woman is valid or recognized in california
2291064 the issue before the voters is whether or not california should define marriage as between one man and one woman
2291065 and rather than presenting it that way to the voters the attorney general got political with it
2291066 the attorney general is required by law to provide an objective summary of what the proposition would do to the law
2291067 in this case the attorney general did not abuse his discretion in concluding that the chief purpose and effect of the initiative is to eliminate the right of same sex couples to marry even if the initiative also has other purposes and effects
2291068 the attorney generals title is an accurate statement of the primary purpose and effect of the measure it is not argumentative or inherently prejudicial
2291069 provide that only marriage between a man and a woman is valid or recognized in california
2291070 this is an emergency petition to try to get the court to order the attorney general to provide a sic unbiased ballot title and summary before the ballots are begun to be printed here in california which starts next week
2291071 i am surprised at how quickly theyve grown the number of reseller partners they do business with and how much revenue theyre getting from the channel
2291072 they havent had to deal with the largest resellers out there
2291073 theyre getting that good growth from the lower end of the market
2291074 they did a brief introduction opened up with a presentation and then after the first slide it turned into a discussion
2291075 ive seen so many manufacturers make channel programs in a vacuum of what its really like from a reseller standpoint

2291103 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2291104 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2291105 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2291106 my job is going to be difficult either way theres a lot of pressure to just be a starting quarterback in this league
2291107 im still following bretts legacy regardless of the fact if hes here retired or like he is in new york now
2291108 theres high expectations on myself on our team and i think its still going to be a difficult situation as far as the pressure outside this locker room thats put on me
2291109 it was good to get a resolution to the whole thing its been definitely on all of our minds weve had to talk about it a lot throughout the training camp
2291110 everybody in the locker room were happy for brett that he gets to still play and were going to move forward together as a team
2291111 a sense of relief you could say it in a lot of ways im about press conferenced out number one thats something its a responsibility i understand but it was something that the situation needed to be resolved and it was nice to get to a finality of that
2291112 im relieved that were talking about football our football team and thats what the focus needs to be on
2291113 im just reassured of the fact that things happen for a reason just to trust god in every situation and try and remain patient and even keeled because theres going to be ups and downs in life as in football and the things you cant control are the things often you want to worry about the most
2291114 but its really useless to worry about those because theyre really out of your control this situation was a prime example of that
2291115 the thing that wouldve happened potentially is a quarterback competition that was kind of the worst option i guess you could say which wasnt even a bad option at all
2291116 they told me i was the starter back in march and i worked hard to figure out ways to exert my leadership on this team get to know guys a little more
2291117 when all this stuff kind of went on last week i realized the very worst case scenario was being able having to compete for my job so that wasnt a bad situation
2291118 to take them back to the wild at some future more relaxed and more enlightened time
2291119 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2291120 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2291121 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2291122 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2291123 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

2291186 today the two people who began this controversy are no longer a part of our government but the spotlight on the political theater created is still just as bright as the investigations are wrapping up and as the investigation of the investigations continues
2291187 thousands of hours have been expended over the past year to uncover that no laws were broken and that politicians will always attempt to undermine their political enemies
2291188 the prosecutor is the representative not of an ordinary party to a controversy but of a sovereignty whose obligation to govern impartially is as compelling as its obligation to govern at all and whose interest therefore in a criminal prosecution is not that it shall win a case but that justice shall be done
2291189 as such he is in a peculiar and definite sense a servant of the law the twofold aim of which is that guilt shall not escape or innocence suffer

2291273 we could start seeing actual cooler temperatures in 2013 and beyond
2291274 one major trend we have seen is going green and being eco friendly
2291275 lots of bold colors make functional storage another way to express personality
2291276 definitely we are moving toward what we are calling alternative art work
2291277 they can hang the panels over the screen its all about personalization
2291278 these products are great quality so something can last four years and beyond to the first apartment
2291279 it is a scary story made more scary by the fact that most people in america dont understand what the problems are
2291280 john and i will tell you there were interesting races four years ago and eight years ago but in many ways this is one of the most interesting races in all of american history we have a chance to lift our country to a new way of thinking this can be a transformative election but make no mistake its close closer than it should be
2291281 mccain has promised and reaffirmed his commitment to continue the same policies weve had these past eight years for another four
2291282 we cannot do that barack obama has lifted our spirits and led us to believe yes we can solve the global climate crisis address the other issues we have to take on and has said we can come together and create a new century with bright hope
2291283 you want some advice make iraq the 51st state and lets get the hell out of there
2291284 these are not normal times the relationship between the planet and ourselves has been irrevocably and dramatically altered were a bull in a china shop today as the sun sets we will have put another 70 million tons of global warming pollution into the atmosphere
2291285 just so you all know we did set a record
2291286 ive been involved in fundraising a long time and to have two incredible men who were nominees and both should have been president and also the fact i got a nobel prize winner and an academy award winner this is too much even for me
2291287 he promised america it would be a campaign of respect of ideas not insults and the american people wanted a better campaign and he gives you paris hilton and britney spears
2291288 if he cant keep his word about the campaign and he cant keep his word about the issues that are really important to the american people and he makes the wrong judgments about how to protect america then his candidacy is in fact dangerous in terms of americas security and you cant trust it and you cant trust him thats what this is about
2291289 the global warming climate change issue is so important that people on both sides of the issue including policymakers should be fully informed before policy is actually formulated tragically thats not happening in the global warming issue
2291290 many things we thought we knew about the climate system just a few years ago are now proving to be uncertain or quite mistaken
2291291 its become quite news worthy to go out and tell people that we are about to have an apocalyptic climate change and the moment you make that announcement its easy to go around the world and find things to support that viewpoint
2291292 the ipcc is a political organization setup by the un to provide evidence to support the framework convention on climate change its entirely political they made up what they were going to do beforehand and choose whatever science they ipcc could find to support their theory
2291293 this cuts at the heart of national sovereignty of the u s we would be saying that we would allow an international body to come in and dictate to our industries our businesses our people what they can do and what they cant do the use of what energy the sources of energy the cost of energy etc
2291294 carbon dioxide gas co2 lags behind temperature changes in history by 800 years co2 doesnt cause temperature change
2291295 based on the evidence of ice core studies at the polar ice caps it shows that co2 follows temperature not the opposite so the fundamental assumption of the whole theory of climate change by human intervention of co2 emissions causing temperature changes is wrong
2291296 human intervention accounts for a small fraction of co2 of the atmospheric gases in the atmosphere that water vapor accounts for about 97 of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere co2 accounts for 1 9 therefore man is responsible for less than 3 of all greenhouse effect in the atmosphere globally
2291297 0 55f 0 30c cooler than the 1971 2000 average
2291298 my concern is that we may be moving away from an irrational lack of concern about climate change to an equally irrational panic about it
2291299 the problem is that in this panic we are going to spend our money unwisely we will take actions that are counterproductive and we will fail to do many of those things that will benefit the environment and ourselves for example right now the clearest threat to many species is habitat destruction take the orangutans for instance one of those charismatic species that people are often fascinated by and concerned about they are endangered because of deforestation in our fear of global warming it would be sad if we fail to find funds to purchase those forests before they are destroyed and thus let this species go extinct at the heart of the matter is how much faith we decide to put in science even how much faith scientists put in science our times have benefited from clear thinking science based rationality i hope this prevails as we try to deal with our changing climate
2291300 co founder of ipcc al gore is trying to be a climate change profiteer essentially he wants to make a fortune by creating a new market for a product that he is attempting to create by legislative fiat if he succeeds and carbon emissions trading comes to the united states al gore will be uniquely positioned to cash in hes made sure of that
2291301 gore himself is chairman and founder of a private equity firm called generation investment management gim he says the london based firm invests money from institutions and wealthy investors in companies that are becoming environmentally friendly to use green parlance gim appears to have considerable influence over major carbon credit trading firms the u s based chicago climate exchange ccx and the u k based carbon neutral company cnc ccx appears to be the only firm in the u s that claims to trade carbon credits as a politician gore speaks warmly of transparency but as gim chairman gore has not been forthcoming little is known about his shadowy firms finances where it gets funding and what projects it supports
2291302 al gores carbon crusade the money and connections behind it
2291303 the consensus in kyoto as outlined in the ipcc report will bind america to reduce energy consumption by 25 which will have a devastating effect on the american standard of living and the u s economy it will continue to drive more industries out of america for a more global economy
2291304 will create 40 50 less carbon emission and use half the fuel of other similar houseboats
2291305 arise and take our stand for freedom as in the olden time
2291306 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet
2291307 carbon tax alone wont solve climate change but we cant solve climate change without carbon pricing
2291308 areas where the sun shines and the wind blows to the cities in the east and west that need the electricity
2291309 alberta and saskatchewan for example have some of the best wind and solar resources and could benefit from better interconnections with b c and manitoba respectively
2291310 without transmission and without storage a utility cannot put more than a few new percentage points into the system
2291311 nuclear power is not renewable power its mined out of the earth and its toxic
2291312 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
2291313 its certainly technically and technologically doable and this is the sad thing it may not be politically doable
2291314 i just want to see an understanding that gore was right about the first inconvenient truth global warming but we have to recognize the second inconvenient truth which is that we dont have the means to do it right now
2291315 their tax plan operates under the old theory that the best way to feed the birds is to give more oats to the horse
2291316 i did something thats not normal for politicians but its normal for people
2291317 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
2291318 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
2291319 and yet few politicians have seemed inclined to address solutions particularly if those solutions involve a modest individual sacrifice
2291320 since taking steps to make his home more environmentally friendly last june gore devours an average of 17 768 kwh per month 1 638 kwh more energy per month than the year before the renovations by comparison the average american household consumes 11 040 kwh in an entire year according to the energy information administration the cost of gores electric bills over the past year topped 16 533
2291321 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
2291322 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
2291323 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
2291324 subi no muro do quintal e vi uma transa que n o normal e ningu m vai acreditar eu vi duas mulher botando aranha pr brigar duas aranha duas aranha duas aranha duas aranha vem c mulher deixa de manha minha cobra quer comer sua aranha meu corpo todo se tremeu e nem minha cobra entendeu cum que pode duas aranha se esfregando eu t sabendo alguma coisa t faltando minha cobra cobra criada minha cobra cobra criada vem c mulher deixa de manha minha cobra quer comer sua aranha deve ter uma boa explica o o que que essas aranha t o fazendo ali no ch o uma em cima outra embaixo a cobra perguntando onde que eu me encaixo minha cobra cobra criada minha cobra cobra criada vem c mulher deixa de manha minha cobra quer comer sua aranha soltei a cobra e ela foi direto foi pro meio das aranha pr mostrar como que certo cobra com aranha que d p aranha com aranha sempre deu jacar minha cobra cobra com aranha minha cobra com as aranha vem c mulher deixa de manha minha cobra quer comer sua aranha o rock das aranha o rock das aranha o rock das aranha o rock das aranha vem c mulher deixa de manha minha cobra quer comer sua aranha
2291325 what drives the nader gonzales campaign clearly is the country is in deep trouble
2291326 the giant corporations are tearing the heart and soul out of america in so many ways the corporate crime wave being the more recent one and john mccain and barack obama are ignoring corporate crime they want a bigger military budget they want to stay in iraq they want to expand the war in afghanistan and theyre not good on consumer protection at all
2291327 theyre using a lot of money in their campaigns from commercial interests and in many ways theyre similar
2291328 theyre not really for a living wage theyre both opposed to a canadian style health care system which gives you free choice of doctor and hospital hows that for starters
2291329 no one dies in canada because they cant afford health insurance everyone has it but 18 000 americans die every year according to the national academy of scientists because they cant afford health insurance
2291330 so it does not subordinate environmental consumer and labour rights to the supremacy of commercial power
2291331 a residual force will remain in iraq and in the region to continue counterterroism missions in iraq against al qaeda
2291332 bush burned down a haystack to try to find a couple of needles he didnt find the needles but there have been 1000s of innocent deaths
2291333 a nation that continues year after year to spend more money on military defense than on programs of social uplift is approaching spiritual death
2291334 i dont really have anything worthwhile to say but i might as well bash harper since thats the in thing to do
2291335 in canada you get to choose your own doctor and hospital
2291336 its funny to have anybody characterize barack as an elitist
2291337 you know this is the kid who was raised by a single mother who didnt have access to many resources who you know has walked away his entire life from lucrative careers to work in the community
2291338 this guy you know he personifies all of what you know we hope that our kids can be
2291339 this will give the true picture so there will be no misconceptions that can hurt malaysias image
2291340 any judgment or directive by a court or the legal department should be upheld foreign countries should understand the malaysian legal system and that we do uphold the rule of law
2291341 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
2291342 i think he should concentrate on his environmental pursuits instead of interfering anyway he has gore d us before
2291343 various departments are engaged in this exercise the home minister will be annexing certain documents and i believe the home ministry will also be producing certain reports to augment the submission
2291344 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
2291345 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
2291346 empire of debt the rise of an epic financial crisis
2291347 the honest truth is that we have too many people in washington living for today rather than saving for tomorrow
2291348 give americans a good talking to about the countrys sloppy debt habits
2291349 the american people are a lot smarter than people give them credit for
2291350 comment by bruce in miami august 8 2008 at 9 54 am
2291351 we have to free ourselves from the domination of the big oil companies that have the ability to manipulate the price
2291352 the people of connecticut deserve to have the chance and the choice to vote for ralph nader should that be the candidate of their choice
2291353 he did not help in 2000 and hes not going to this year i guess hes a closet republican he helps elect republicans
2291354 theoretically its always possible for someone to get one vote that could make a difference
2291355 it could go down a little or it could go up a little
2291356 if hes got the support and hes qualified good luck to him
2291357 axelrods not the type to drop a refrigerator on a guys head hell take the refrigerator apart drop one piece at a time and save the biggest piece for last
2291358 weve been through two very tough elections at the national level and its very easy to lose confidence
2291359 after one president in the pocket of big oil we cant afford another
2291360 this is a classic washington story anonymous quotes from armchair quarterbacks with no sense of our strategy data or plan
2291361 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
2291362 i urge your colleagues to take even bolder steps toward solving the climate crisis
2291363 we have an historic opportunity to shift to a clean energy economy and in the process create new sustainable jobs to support the development and deployment of these new technologies
2291364 im afraid right now that we are more concerned about the business climate than the earths climate
2291365 until we realize they are not mutually exclusive we wont be able to address these issues
2291366 but it should be clear to anyone who has been watching the session that weve already
2291367 under governor patrick massachusetts joined the regional greenhouse gas initiative and became the first state in the nation to require greenhouse gas analysis and mitigation in major real estate projects
2291368 comprehensive energy legislation the oceans management bill and pending biofuels legislation all put massachusetts into a leadership position nationally we support the creation of an economy wide cap as the next step in reducing greenhouse gas emissions but many details remain to be worked out with the legislature
2291369 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
2291370 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
2291371 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
2291372 windmills should be installed in every uninhabited windy place in this country
2291373 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
2291374 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
2291375 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
2291376 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
2291377 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
2291378 about 28 million aids cases could be prevented by 2010 the cost would be 27 billion with monetized socioeconomic benefits almost 40 times as high
2291379 when theres so much in dispute you cant validly make strong conclusions
2291380 by raze you know zeebc i sense a certain progress on ambroses part
2291381 it looks like its going slow but theres a lot of torque generated which can make the gears go faster
2291382 on the low end 30 mph wind could generate about 500 watts
2291383 when he was growing up i was cleaning up his room and i remember finding this thing that looked like a bomb
2291384 i dont know how he learned but he knows how
2291385 he knows how to build everything hes always on the computer reading about how things work
2291386 he first got interested in physics and then when we went to louisiana he got interested in meteorology
2291387 as we come closer to the peoples vote they get closer to corporate power
2291388 things are getting so bad for libertarians and liberals theres starting to be a convergence of interests
2291389 you cant focus on voters rights and ignore candidate rights
2291390 for all practical purpose we are no much better than the chinese political model expect that in china there is no gridlock and things are getting done
2291391 i am really beholdin to corporate interests they give me a great paycheck and have provided me with the highest standard of living in history comment by lackeynlovenit august 6 2008 at 5 05 pm
2291392 when he wasnt writing dirty jokes and yelling at people on the radio he found time to avoid paying his taxes in 18 different states
2291393 im not proud of every joke ive ever told but i know theres a difference between what you say as a comedian and what you do as a u s senator
2291394 the two candidates are polar opposites on many major issues notably the wars in iraq and afghanistan and drilling in the arctic national wildlife refuge coleman has been with bush on both and franken is energetically against both
2291395 the influence of polling location on voting found in our research would be more than enough to change the outcome of a close election
2291396 voting at a school could increase support for school spending or voting at a church could decrease support for stem cell initiatives
2291397 environmental cues such as objects or places can activate related constructs within individuals and influence the way they behave
2291398 voting in a school for example could activate the part of a persons identity that cares about kids or norms about taking care of the community similarly voting in a church could activate norms of following church doctrine such effects may even occur outside an individuals awareness
2291399 we want factors like political views whether someone thinks a candidate is going to make our country a better place to sway elections
2291400 but in forming election policy we also want to make sure that arbitrary factors such as polling location dont ultimately influence voting behaviors
2291401 what our research suggests is that it might be useful to further investigate influences such as polling location to better understand how such factors affect different types of voting situations
2291402 well im voting for barack obama hell help with global warming
2291403 it would take as long as 15 years that is until 2023 to go from starting a pilot plant to proving the technology will work
2291404 we have to store radioactive waste for 250 000 years
2291405 real results by the end of my first term in office
2291406 take nothing less than a complete transformation of our economy
2291407 leverage billions more in private capital to build a new energy economy
2291408 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
2291409 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
2291410 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
2291411 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
2291412 wait a second if youve gotten to the point where youre sheepish about us doing well i cant vote for you
2291413 hey jimmy were only guys we show up at 11 30 we tell the jokes thats what pretty boys do all night
2291414 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
2291415 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment
2291416 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations
2291417 our country needs a new energy policy that reinvests in america and it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy
2291418 there is strong disagreement with many of the legal analytical economic science and policy interpretations
2291419 is a deeply flawed and unsuitable vehicle for reducing greenhouse gas emissions
2291420 will not only harm the us economy but will fail to provide an effective response to the global challenge of climate change as the president observed in april decisions with such far reaching impact should not be left to unelected regulators and judges
2291421 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
2291422 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront the issue as president next year
2291423 in 1970 the u s imported 24 percent of its oil by 1990 it was 42 percent and today its almost 70 percent we import 70 percent of our oil at a cost of us 700 billion a year four times the annual cost of the iraq war ive been an oil man all my life but this is one emergency we cant drill our way out of but if we create a new renewable energy network we can break our addiction to foreign oil
2291424 when president john f kennedy challenged our nation to land a man on the moon and bring him back safely in 10 years many people doubted we could accomplish that goal
2291425 but eight years and two months later neil armstrong and buzz aldrin walked on the surface of the moon
2291426 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now
2291427 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
2291428 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that
2291429 is the biggest celebrity in the world ready to help your family
2291430 washington defense secretary robert m gates will endorse a 20 billion plan to substantially increase the size of afghanistan s army and will also restructure the military command of american and nato forces in response to the growing taliban threat senior pentagon and military officials said thursday
2291431 taken together the two decisions are an acknowledgment of shortcomings that continue to hinder nato and american led operations in afghanistan with the war in iraq still an obstacle to any immediate american troop increase in afghanistan the plan was described by officials as an attempt to increase allied and afghan capabilities in advance of deploying the additional american brigades that mr gates and his commanders agree are necessary
2291432 activate a network about black men having sex with white women something which many white men still feel queasy about
2291433 the soviet union citing the 1978 treaty of friendship cooperation and good neighborliness that had been signed between the two countries intervened on december 24 1979 over 100 000 soviet troops took part in the invasion backed by another 100 000 plus and by members of the parcham faction amin was killed and replaced by babrak karmal the soviet occupation resulted in the killings of at least 600 000 to 2 million afghan civilians over five million afghans fled their country to pakistan iran and other parts of the world faced with mounting international pressure and great number of casualties on both sides the soviets withdrew in 1989
2291434 nato took command of the nationwide mission to stabilize afghanistan in 2006 the allies expected to face little direct combat and to focus on reconstruction and on maintaining security in areas that were relatively calm in contrast the american led mission in afghanistan has focused from the start of the war on combat operations to capture or kill insurgents and terrorists as well as on training afghan security forces counter insurgency and reconstruction
2291435 yup but it would be much cheaper to just buy the opium crop
2291436 meanwhile the taliban managed to nearly eradicate the majority of the opium production by 2001
2291437 as much as one third of afghanistans gdp comes from growing poppy and illicit drugs including opium and its two derivatives morphine and heroin as well as hashish production opium production in afghanistan has soared to a new record in 2007
2291438 it should be noted that operation enduring freedom afghanistan which is a joint us and afghan operation is separate from the isaf international security assistance force isaf which is an operation of nato nations including the usa the two operations run in parallel and although has been intended that they merge for some time this has not yet happened
2291439 i ask are we in fact at war with radical islam world wide and if so just say it
2291440 obamas popularity is not because of his race but in spite of it he is popular because of his charisma enthusiasm vision energy convictions and because of the confidence and hope that emanate from his persona
2291441 his stated policies are potentially extremely destructive and foolish such as massive tax increases and protectionism
2291442 it is our business however to go after terrorist enemies of the united states and our nato allies wherever we find them
2291443 it is this intensely emotional response to obama that is such a concern his followers love him with the zeal of cult members without bothering to discuss policy
2291444 what i am now is a citizen of a country that was attacked by people who flew commercial airplanes into buildings and i think we need to keep that in mind
2291445 since june the uk top 40 has featured a hidden advertisement for chewing gum it turns out that chris browns
2291446 reading your responses and talking to tad devine the former chief consultant to al gore and adviser to the kerry
2291447 it was only a year ago that royal bank of scotland was the proudest most confident bank in the uk
2291448 sitting next to someone on a senate committee has sparked more than a few deep friendships
2291449 obviously my name was linked to it but other than that theres nothing that can be said
2291450 he was a governor who tried to not ruffle feathers
2291451 as a debater i felt like i was in the twilight zone show you want to reach over and slit the arm to see if theres flesh and blood or just wires
2291452 one of my big accomplishments was at one point in the debate he started to sweat
2291453 is it boring to win five times as a democrat in a state thats overwhelmingly republican
2291454 obviously the people of indiana think theres something exciting about him
2291455 no rule to pursue but such as he prescribes to himself
2291456 should be as little dependent as possible on those of the others
2291457 if it be wished that my relation to the bank be continued it may be well to send me the usual retainer
2291458 that the dependency of private funding simply shifts the focus of congress thats all and if so is this really the issue to worry about
2291459 whom i think it does compromise they feel like they have to ameliorate or change their position for fear of losing certain contributions
2291460 it is very difficult for me to accept that people dont consciously or subconsciously tailor their views to where they know the sources of campaign funding can be
2291461 how are we going to raise money from those guys if we deregulate them
2291462 should the public come to believe that the scientific issues are settled their views about global warming will change accordingly therefore you need to continue to make the lack of scientific certainty a primary issue in the debate
2291463 as real a revolution in the principles of government as that of 1776 was in its form
2291464 there is a direct correlation between how people perceive the economy and the importance they place on the environment when times are tough people resent paying more to salve their conscience
2291465 when people are feeling the pinch we need to make it pay to go green instead of being fined for not recycling households should be paid for recycling
2291466 environmentalist did not make gas go to over 4 gallon
2291467 i dont want to have to change my life even it it benefits society as a whole
2291468 humans are an infinitessimally small part of the global eco system
2291469 its the downturn that has made greenery look unappetising but it may yet prove to do more than anything to save the planet
2291470 it runs on biodiesel and im gonna put solar on it someday
2291471 recently mr obama has been talking more about thrift than trees instead of showing off his recycling skills he explains that his children dont receive christmas or birthday presents
2291472 mr obama has been talking more about thrift than trees instead of showing off his recycling skills he explains that his children dont receive christmas or birthday presents
2291473 in searching for a new enemy to unite us we came up with the idea that pollution the threat of global warming water shortages famine and the like would fit the bill all these dangers are caused by human intervention the real enemy then is humanity itself
2291474 oh yeah but hes not as good as al gore if only al gore had won did i tell you how much i like al gore
2291475 its no good running a pig farm badly for 30 years while saying really i was meant to be a ballet dancer by then pigs will be your style
2291476 i think global warming alternative energy and solar energy in particular like al gore are all overblown
2291477 but i think that global warming alternative energy and solar energy in particular like al gore are all overblown
2291478 the involvement of charities means that not only will the film inspire people to act but we can also give them a way to put this inspiration to use afterwards
2291479 we want people to realise that they have the power to resist
2291480 we hope that ngos will be able to tell their members about the project driving more people to the site when we make the film hopefully it will inspire more people to visit the site and join the resist network continuing the whole process
2291481 in most cases the support is not just financial we have worked with all sorts of films including features such as blood diamond in the past people came to us with completed projects and asked us for support but now we work in a more holistic way from script development and research onwards
2291482 if the film maker wants to tell both sides of the story they can do that
2291483 we support freedom of expression any storytelling is positive for us if it shines a light on what is happening in the world we get involved to tell our side of the story correctly documentaries can be overwhelming if they do not contain a solution to the problems they highlight ngos can give that al gores film ended with an example of what people can do people are ripe for that kind of activism
2291484 then we went to britdoc and its organisers supported us pitching for funding when people have seen what we have made we want them to feel inspired to act
2291485 we got involved with britdoc two years ago because we thought documentaries were an effective way of getting complicated issues which cant be summed up in a soundbite through to the public erasing david looks like it will be entertaining and this makes it more accessible which is perfect when trying to interest people in a debate
2291486 it is easy to see how these collaborations can work with subjects such as science if there is transparency
2291487 but i think that where for example a film maker wants to make a documentary on the international criminal court one needs to be particularly careful that both sides of the argument are properly analysed
2291488 i sense that film makers often want to make a film and they are not too concerned where they come from i am a journalist and i like to see things investigated with a critical eye when there is more than one view on a topic we need to be careful about where backing comes from
2291489 i cant think of subjective journalism that i have a problem with if it is marked as subjective and clear
2291490 most journalism is already subjective even if it is labelled as objective i am suspicious of all organisations including news organisations there always needs to be proper controls to protect editorial integrity for ngos collaboration wont work if they ask for something too specific but if say they want to fund increased reporting from congo it can work
2291491 there used to be five broadcasters paying high sums for documentaries now with for example the probability that itv will be able to reduce its public service commitments everything is different commercial and third sector brands can invest in documentaries if it is done sensibly
2291492 you need people who will email friends and walk the streets to talk about a project third sector people care enough to do that
2291493 when fuel gets more expensive wont voters object just as strenuously as they would have if a carbon tax had been imposed in the first place
2291494 produce every kilowatt of electricity through wind sun and other earth friendly energy sources within 10 years this goal is achievable affordable and transformative
2291495 bridging the worlds of environmentalism finance technology and politics together mr gore is ideally suited to speak to this audience of innovators striving to integrate green building practices and leading edge technology into the 21st century in a way that is both smart and sustainable
2291496 we have been drilling for more oil and the prices have gone up
2291497 a lot more oil has been found a lot more has been produced
2291498 the exploding demand for oil especially in places like china is overwhelming the rate of new discoveries by so much that oil prices are almost certain to continue upward over time no matter what the oil companies promise
2291499 john mccain enters the offshore drilling debate with voters favor
2291500 wants the government to act to address the immediate price consequences and to act now for achieving energy independence in the medium and long term
2291501 when you connect the dots it turns out that the real solutions to the climate crisis are the very same measures needed to renew our economy and escape the trap of ever rising energy prices
2291502 because the sun doesnt shine and the wind doesnt blow all the time
2291503 the country is not going to be able to go cold turkey
2291504 we have a hundred years of infrastructure with trillions of dollars of investment that is not simply going to be made obsolete
2291505 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of that has got to change
2291506 gore backed his case for renewable electricity with logical case studies
2291507 move quickly and boldly to shake off complacency throw aside old habits and rise clear eyed and alert to the necessity of big changes
2291508 to commit to producing 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
2291509 to be sure reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years will require us to overcome many obstacles
2291510 to those who say the costs are still too high i ask them to consider whether the costs of oil and coal will ever stop increasing if we keep relying on quickly depleting energy sources to feed a rapidly growing demand all around the world
2291511 reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years
2291512 provide funding and global business building expertise to a range of businesses both public and private and to entrepreneurs
2291513 an oil and gas exploration and production e amp p company
2291514 has already dug 100 wells around the world and is in the processing of raising additional capital
2291515 it would be ironic to say the least if kleiners first green jackpot turns out to be a company that actually drills for oil
2291516 designs microbes that when injected into oil wells increase oil production and decrease use of water
2291517 al gores carbon crusade the money and connections behind it
2291518 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
2291519 our team in international scene shouldnt use a woman to carry irans flag because its against our values and its a war with preparation of people for upcoming of absent imam mahdi
2291520 do you olympic team officials know what are you doing to put a woman in front of team is against islamic innocent imams sayings this is a bold move against our islamic values participation of women in athletic environments are against islamic values
2291521 indeed we should stop them from attending to international scene like olympics which everyone supposed to be in peace but unfortunately women athletes from these islamic countries are not
2291522 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
2291523 the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
2291524 this is an investment that will pay itself back many times over
2291525 its an expensive investment but not compared to the rising cost of continuing to invest in fossil fuels
2291526 for decades al gore has challenged the skeptics in washington on climate change and awakened the conscience of a nation to the urgency of this threat i strongly agree with vice president gore that we cannot drill our way to energy independence but must fast track investments in renewable sources of energy like solar power wind power and advanced biofuels and those are the investments i will make as president its a strategy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and cannot be outsourced and one that will leave our children a world that is cleaner and safer
2291527 we want to jump on this bandwagon we have to
2291528 diplomatic protection and human rights before the international court of justice re fashioning tradition

2291530 surrender of personal excellence and community value in the mere accumulation of material things it measures neither our wit nor our wisdom and can tell us everything about america except why were proud to be americans
2291531 we have to live with our feet very much rooted in reality
2291532 were pursuing renewables as well but you cant simply take away half of your energy base
2291533 to be sure reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years will require us to overcome many obstacles
2291534 it would be difficult for north carolina to meet a 10 percent renewable portfolio standard with only new north carolina renewable supply resources by 2021
2291535 by 2010 were lowering sulfur oxide and nitrous oxide emissions by 70 percent from 2002 three years before required
2291536 the main reason we did it was just to show people what the possibilities are
2291537 a price point comparison will be low enough to do it one day i guess the way of capturing solar energy is kind of expensive silicon is expensive
2291538 this is really just our first dip of our toe into the water
2291539 this is our time to step up and see if its feasible
2291540 were just getting into it right now we wont know probably for at least a couple of years how it works
2291541 coal is dirty any way you slice it coal isnt good
2291542 if you were to put a price on health coal would cost a whole lot and solar would begin to seem more reasonable
2291543 its hard to imagine a movie thats come out recently that is at its core as offensive to the right wings so called family values the films women including a mother and daughter accept each other as sexual beings donna isnt punished for her earlier promiscuity and amanda isnt forced to get married despite her clear sexual maturity the concept of three men revolving around a matriarchal family core is celebrated
2291544 the women in satc are a good 20 years younger than their counterparts in mama but they seem infinitely less happy they sit around coffee shops and trendy restaurants discussing their unhappiness the women in mama sing and dance christine baranski kicks ass on the dance floor julie walters chews through the scenery and meryl well meryl does a split in the air after bouncing off a bed when i grow up i want to be them
2291545 gps and gnss precise positioning technology is a key element to meet the growing demands placed on network time protocol ntp and precision time protocol ptpv2 server technology as the end to end transmission and synchronization of voice data and video across packet based networks becomes more sophisticated
2291546 the integration of brilliant and novatel technology will provide a significant competitive differentiation and a new level of price performance for network timing synchronization and management
2291547 today novatel and brilliant telecommunications two of the leaders in gnss components subsystems and end to end network timing and synchronization are coming together to provide best of breed solutions to customers around the globe commented dr
2291548 this collaboration will enable brilliant and novatel to broaden their product portfolios and extend brilliants market worldwide we chose to partner with novatel because they have established themselves as market and technology leaders in gnss

2291667 jennifer stark was downloading ring tones to her cell phone while driving sept 2 2006 when her car veered off the road and hit bicyclist matt wilhelm 25 a university of illinois graduate wilhelm who was riding on the side of the road and wearing reflective clothing died six days later
2291668 we determined that ms starks actions while clearly negligent did not rise to the level of recklessness as it has been defined in the existing reckless homicide statute wrote a frustrated julia rietz champaign county states attorney
2291669 stark 19 was convicted of improper lane usage fined 1 000 and sentenced to probation and traffic school
2291670 governor rod blagojevich says the effort to put speed enforcement cameras along interstate highways to crack down on reckless drivers would generate 40 million in the first year and that money would be used to hire 500 new state troopers who could help cities such as chicago that are troubled by gang violence

2291674 the cost to taxpayers would still be a concern any monetary intervention by government in a market almost always socializes losses and privatises gains mr greenspan wrote in an epilogue to the paperback edition of his memoir
2291675 but as happened with the rtc the public cost could be minimised
2291676 our country has long since abandoned the notion that we should leave crises to be resolved solely by the marketplace mr greenspan said in an excerpt released by his office last night
2291677 to minimise the impairment of market efficiency from bailouts the critical need in my judgement is to formalise and somewhat revise the procedures improvised in the rescue of bear stearns
2291678 losses on the federal reserves balance sheet if particularly large could reduce the flexibility of monetary policy said mr greenspan 82 who served as fed chairman from august 1987 to january 2006 retailer just group has recommended shareholders accept a 800m hostile takeover bid
2291679 the economy is limping along and businesses are doing whatever they can to remain competitive
2291680 so we had fewer people working shorter hours and producing more

2291682 theres a real capitulation under way said david gilmore partner at foreign exchange analytics in essex connecticut of the dollar
2291683 in 24 hours its gone from us1 55 to us1 50 which is highly unusual that changes your game plan for the marketplace
2291684 this is payback time for the european currencies against the dollar said ashraf laidi a currency strategist at cmc markets
2291685 these currencies have to retreat to better reflect the sharp deterioration in economic fundamentals in the euro zone region this is not to say theres been an improvement in us fundamentals
2291686 confirmed that the window of opportunity for further rate hikes has been slammed shut by the cold blast of negative data releases that swept through the euro zone in the last few weeks said marco annunziata an economist at unicredit in london
2291687 lots of investors have been on high commodity prices and a low dollar and those bets are getting destroyed mr gilmore said
2291688 bad news in europe is good news for the dollar and bearish for commodities
2291689 the markets are more focused on the dollar and its newfound strength oil is less looking at geopolitical risk and slowing demand risk
2291690 a few weeks ago when the markets mood was bullish oil would have soared on that pipeline news but supply worries have less impact when the focus and the mood is based on slowing demand
2291691 citizens have played an important part of our enforcement efforts and are making a difference
2291692 area residents are putting their eyes and ears to work for us and calling to report persons suspected of being involved in prostitution and other illegal activities

2291697 t o see animals slaughtered to be worn as fashion is awful to me so im definitely against wearing fur
2291698 id much rather go naked than ever put a dead animal on my body
2291699 trying to show different viewpoints of women how we view ourselves and how we want to be represented
2291700 nobody said not to go the life loves and adventures of emily hahn

2291702 what do you think think thisll match this other one
2291703 now youre on your way to work dont go getting paint all over yourself
2291704 eh its only paint i probably have some leftover from yesterday yeah that looks like it should dry all right to really make it match though you should dry brush it to bring out the grain
2291705 nobody said not to go the life loves and adventures of emily hahn
2291706 i really like working with the young people in the prison
2291707 its so important to pass on information that protects their lives
2291708 but you have to be very careful and sensitive to how ready the other person is to talk about hiv
2291709 ellie has undergone nine months of assessments and the clinicians at the cochlear implant centre in southampton support bilateral implants for her
2291710 i believe the pct only considered the extra cost of a second implant not how much less her education will cost if she has both ears operated on now
2291711 we believe that morally ellie should have the operation on the nhs
2291712 looking after ellie is a joy and a pleasure but battling to get what she needs has been the worst part of the last nine months
2291713 the current recommendations from nice support unilateral implants for children and adults with severe to profound deafness
2291714 i found this better than the male condom or other female contraceptives there is no pain or discomfort in using this
2291715 at first my husband was not sure about it but now even hes come around
2291716 at first these women found the concept of a female condom amusing
2291717 they even laughed at it but now they like it they keep asking me to give them more and more of these
2291718 ive told them that it not only prevents aids but is better for their sexual health
2291719 weve got a sense of freedom of being liberated we feel completely in control
2291720 we first began marketing the female condom primarily among sex workers three years ago
2291721 we then decided to introduce this among rural women since they are also a vulnerable group with little access to public health services
2291722 initially we thought the response would be poor but in fact its been very very good
2291723 itll really help us because the existing ones are not effective
2291724 on the one hand a government body is promoting sexual health among us but on the other we are penalised for expressing our sexuality
2291725 since homosexuality is illegal in the eyes of the law we are frequently harassed by the police
2291726 its all very well to come out with a gay condom but why not change the law
2291727 even companies that already make similar condoms available through the retail network do not brand them as gay condoms they call them super strong condom or powerful condom or stud condoms
2291728 we are appreciative of everything o j did for all of us the year he was with us we wish him well i have no doubt that he will be a great professional
2291729 to secure my family thats the most important thing for me right now
2291730 the nice thing is he has his love for the game again
2291731 he said i just want to give you a little forewarning youre it man

2291733 it wasnt about getting it over with i wanted it this gives me the best opportunity to start right away
2291734 bernd and hilla becher are among the most influential artists of our time for more than forty years they have been recording the heritage of an industrial past their systematic photography of functionalist architecture often organizing their pictures in grids brought them recognition as conceptual artists as well as photographers as the founders of what has come to be known as the becher school they have brought their influence in a unique way to bear on generations of documentary photographers and artists
2291735 he expressed himself moderately though at times with justifiable irritation if not anger
2291736 because the judgment involves private secure matters of my daughter
2291737 i believed it was for life and that it put everything on a very different footing we stopped using contraception the night we were married
2291738 but to suggest that in some way she was his business partner is i am sorry to have to say make belief
2291739 i wholly reject her account that she rekindled the husbands professional fame after his first wifes death and gave him back his confidence

2291765 the closure to cars has created a destination it creates an ambience that is impossible with cars
2291766 but here you have a product foisted on merchants and their customers it raises the question of how far we should allow private interests to have such control over our public spaces i think its a burden on merchants and it restricts public choice
2291767 i have to acknowledge that the sites sort of anti guru vibe might actually be calculated per murketing to cater to my skepticism

2291782 de laatste soort is volop aanwezig in de wereld vrijhandel is hiervan het bekendste voorbeeld
2291783 veel partijen kennen zichzelf misschien een liberale naam toe maar dat wel niet zeggen dat ze ook een liberale koers varen zo is de liberale democratische partij in het japan een conservatieve partij anders dan de naam zal doen verwachten en in australi wordt de economische liberale agenda gemaakt door wat wij hier de conservatieven noemen
2291784 het klassiek liberalisme wenst de onzichtbare hand zijn werk te laten doen en pleit voor minimale overheidsbemoeienis terwijl het sociaal liberalisme de overheid een taak toekent in het bevorderen van de vrijheid van burgers verder beroepen klassieke liberalen zich veel meer op principe kwesties waar links liberalen sociale onrust veel meer meenemen deze verschillen werken spraakverwarring en onduidelijkheid uiteraard in de hand
2291785 het overgrote deel van de politieke partijen in een democratie is uit op winst van zoveel mogelijk zetels echt ideologische politiek is een soort van luxe die ofwel relatief kleine partijen ofwel partijen die in een dynamische meerpartijen democratie hebben deze soort partijen kunnenzich juist door hun sterke ideologie onderscheiden van de massa iets wat in een tweepartijen stelsel vaak niet in het voordeel werkt
2291786 ikzelf zie liberalisme als het vrijzinnig gedachtengoed en het openstaan voor tolerantie maar intern is daar heel veel discussie over in latijns amerika kan men bijvoorbeeld niet keihard zeggen dat ze pro abortus zijn dat ligt daar te gevoelig en in roemenie bestaan sterke liberale partijen als contrabeweging tegen het communisne maar liberalisme is niet gelijk aan kapitalisme liberalisme is een politieke ideologie dat moet je in een veel breder kader bekijken dan het kapitalisme
2291787 nederlandse organisaties zijn een heel stuk kritischer in nederland valt de onafhankelijkheid van de moederpartij bij een jongerenpartij op en dat is iets dat zeer te waarderen valt in de rest van de wereld is dit niet vanzelfsprekend in tegendeel zelfs ik vind dat je als jongerenpartij altijd je eigen standpunt uit moet blijven dragen maar in het buitenland bestaan jongerenorganisaties om die jongeren te integreren in de moederpartij
2291788 in de wereld zijn meer democratie n dan ooit tevoren en natuurlijk is dat een goede zaak in elke wave of democratization die huntington beschreef vond er een toename plaats van liberale partijen
2291789 deze partijen hebben excuses aangeboden maar zijn in feite nog dezelfde partij
2291790 alleen naar de stembus gaan betekent nog niet dat de burgers in een echte democratie leven vrijheid is een veel breder begrip dan slechts het bepalen wie het land bestuurt
2291791 na de val van een autoritair regime komt de intellectuele elite terug uit het buitenland waar zij zich bevonden omdat zij gevlucht of verbannen waren deze intellectuelen komen vaak terecht in liberale partijen omdat zij in veel landen een middenpositie inneemt tussen extremen deze nieuwe liberale partijen kunnen wel de weg openen naar democratie omdat zij breken met het verleden van het autoritaire regime
2291792 er lijkt een trend gezet dat niet partijen die zichzelf niet als liberaal bestempelenen toch liberale politiek voeren een goede illustratie zijn de conservatieve partijen die bezig zijn met de vrije markt
2291793 fukuyama schetst een politiek tijperk waarin de liberale democraten helemaal niet meer nodig zijn
2291794 wenn auf dem balkan oder im kaukasus was los ist schnell bei zbigniew brzezinski nachlesen was wohl dahintersteckt und wie es vermutlich weitergehen wird
2291795 anders als in armenien oder aserbaidschan mit ihrer ethnisch recht homogenen bev lkerung geh ren etwa 30 der 6 millionen georgier ethnischen minderheiten an berdies hegen diese kleinen volksgruppen die in ihrer organisationsform und ihrem selbstverst ndnis eher st mmen gleichen groll gegen die georgische herrschaft nach der aufl sung der sowjetunion machten sich daher die osseten und die abchasen den innergeorgischen machtkampf zunutze um sich von georgien abzuspalten dies geschah mit stillschweigender r ckendeckung russlands das georgien zum verbleib in der gus aus der sich georgien anfangs g nzlich zur ckziehen wollte und zur duldung russischer milit rbasen auf seinem territorium zwingen wollte um das gebiet von der t rkei abzuriegeln
2291796 der umstand dass zwei der gr eren angrenzenden nationalstaaten t rkei und der iran jeder mit einem historisch gewachsenen imperialen kulturellen religi sen und konomischen interesse in der region in ihrer geopolitischen orientierung unberechenbar sind und zudem selbst mit internen problemen zu schaffen haben verst rkt die instabilit t des eurasischen balkan gravierend und macht die lage noch explosiver
2291797 auch die r ckendeckung die die ukraine den nach gr erer unabh ngigkeit strebenden staaten gibt verfolgt den zweck die eigene unabh ngigkeit gegen ber moskau zu st rken so hat die ukraine die anstrengungen georgiens unterst tzt aserische lexporte ber sein gebiet zu leiten dar ber hinaus tat sie sich mit der t rkei zusammen um den russischen einflu im schwarzen meer zu schw chen und unterst tzte die t rkischen bem hungen erd l von zentralasien in t rkische terminals zu leiten
2291798 au enpolitisch w nschen sich georgien und armenien obwohl letzteres von russischer unterst tzung gegen aserbaidschan abh ngig ist eine zunehmend engere anbindung an europa
2291799 ermutigt durch die t rkei und die usa hat aserbaidschan nicht nur die forderungen russlands zur ckgewiesen auf seinem boden milit rbasen zu errichten sondern sich auch dem ansinnen moskaus widersetzt da alles l von baku zu einem russischen schwarzmeerhafen geleitet werden sollte stattdessen entschied es sich f r eine doppell sung die eine zweite durch georgien zur t rkei verlaufende lleitung vorsieht
2291800 amerikas prim res interesse mu folglich sein mit daf r zu sorgen da keine einzelne macht die kontrolle ber dieses gebiet erlangt und die weltgemeinschaft ungehinderten finanziellen und wirtschaftlichen zugang zu ihr hat
2291801 die staaten die amerikas st rkste geopolitische unterst tzung verdienen sind aserbaidschan usbekistan und die ukraine da alle drei geopolitische dreh und angelpunkte darstellen
2291802 in dieser region hat amerika ein gemeinsames interesse nicht nur mit einer stabilen prowestlichen t rkei sondern auch mit dem iran und mit china eine allm hliche verbesserung in den amerikanisch iranischen beziehungen w rde den globalen zugang zur region erheblich erweitern und insbesondere die unmittelbare bedrohung abwenden der aserbaidschans berleben ausgesetzt ist
2291803 ausschlaggebend f r die zukunft der kaukasusrepubliken d rfte die weitere entwicklung und politische orientierung der t rkei sein wenn sie ihren kurs auf europa beibeh lt und wenn europa ihr nicht die t ren zuschl gt werden die kaukasusstaaten vermutlich in den einflu bereich europas streben eine aussicht die sie gl hend herbeisehnen aber wenn die europ isierung der t rkei aus innenpolitischen oder u eren gr nden ins stocken ger t dann wird georgien und armenien keine andere wahl bleiben als sich russlands willen anzupassen
2291804 if you ladies leave my island if you survive recruit training you will be a weapon
2291805 god has a hard on for marines because we kill everything we see

2291807 the ak 47 or kalashnikov its the worlds most popular assault rifle a weapon all fighters love an elegantly simple 9 pound amalgamation of forged steel and plywood it doesnt break jam or overheat itll shoot whether its covered in mud or filled with sand its so easy even a child can use it and they do
2291808 de truc is om jezelf niet al te serieus te nemen het gaat meer om de muziek dan perfectie energie is het belangrijkste
2291809 in de nederlandse muziekwereld zijn er veel bands die bezig zijn met hun imago en die elkaar nadoen wij proberen net iets anders te zijn dan de andere bands originaliteit vinden we erg belangrijk
2291810 we treden liever tien keer op in een klein cafeetje dan twee keer in de arena en juist als je internationaal gaat moet je steeds op nieuw beginnen want je bent steeds weer onbekend
2291811 sommige tracks moeten een boodschap hebben je moet niet zo maar in de rondte rappen maar je moet ook leuke nummers maken waar je op kan raggen het geheel moet gewoon kloppen
2291812 de switch ging voor ons heel langzaam een paar nummers op het internet sloegen in een bepaalde kring aan je leert de goede mensen kennen en dan groeit je bekendheid in de sc ne
2291813 dat gezeik blijft altijd er is altijd wel wat te lullen het is veel ellebogen werk met oneerlijk gedrag vorig jaar kwamen we de sc ne binnen met liefde voor iedereen en iedereen vond ons de kleine lieverdjes
2291814 maar als je dan groot wordt en commercieel on top zit kunnen ze het niet hebben tijdens slaap kregen we het meeste gezeik we zijn daardoor wel afgehard
2291815 we zijn niet van plan om weer in het engels te gaan rappen omdat het niet je eigen taaltje is daardoor is het moeilijk om je eigen woordspelingen te verzinnen
2291816 we krijgen een nieuw album maar we mogen er nog niks over zeggen alleen dat het heel erg lauw wordt
2291817 ik ging hiervoor nooit naar festivals maar nu ik lowlands heb gezien wil ik er volgend jaar sowieso heen
2291818 daar hebben we opgetreden voor 150 000 mensen dan heb je wel het gevoel dat je goed bent
2291819 ik besteed evenveel tijd aan nadenken over diepere dingen als aan feesten
2291820 eigenlijk maakt het ook niet zo heel veel uit waar je bent het gaat erom hoe je je voelt
2291821 het gaat daarbij om de sfeer weinig moet veel dingen mogen veel muziek en veel plezier ik kan er echt van genieten
2291822 tradities zijn heel mooi maar op een gegeven moment weet je niet meer waar het vandaan komt
2291823 ik ben hervormd opgevoed en dan krijg je informatie waarvan je niet weet wat wel of niet bij je past ik wilde met deze studie de vooroordelen uitvogelen uiteindelijk zag ik een heleboel overeenkomsten tussen de religies er wordt zoveel nadruk gelegd op uiterlijke kenmerken maar in essentie gaat het om hetzelfde
2291824 het belangrijkste voor een optreden is denk ik de energie die je uitstraalt als het publiek ziet dat je echt bent jezelf en oprecht dan kan je het eigenlijk over alles hebben dat is standaard voor hiphop
2291825 het kan goed voor verbroedering zorgen op het moment dat je een universele taal spreekt maakt uiterlijk niet meer uit ik ben blij dat ik het talent heb gekregen om mensen bijeen te brengen
2291826 io ib is begonnen als gevolg van een knelpuntenstudie bij de toelatingstest voor de europese commissie bleken veel nederlanders te zakken omdat ze een slechte taalvaardigheid bezaten ook waren de nederlandse kandidaten vaak overgespecialiseerd in de nieuwe opleiding moest daarom het accent komen te liggen op multidisciplinariteit alsmede op taal zowel op de moedertaal als op vreemde talen
2291827 deze elementen van de nieuwe opleiding sloten aan bij zowel de vraag van de studenten als bij de vraag vanuit de samenleving
2291828 maar we kunnen tevreden zijn over de constructieve onderwijsvernieuwing die io heeft gebracht de studie is een maatschappelijk relevante opleiding geworden van een hoog niveau
2291829 na drie jaar heeft slechts de helft van de studenten hun propedeuse gehaald dit is een verspilling van tijd mensen en dromen de selectieve werking van de propedeuse is een wreed systeem maar het is helaas de trieste waarheid misschien dat er verbetering in komt met de numerus fixus
2291830 de winst is wel duidelijk het is nu veel gemakkelijker om een master of deel van je studie in het buitenland te volgen maar in nederland hadden dezelfde studies in verschillende steden altijd hetzelfde niveau nu is het niveau echter meer ongelijk geworden door de structuur europa breed nederland doet het goed en behoort tot de top van de europese universiteiten nederlandse studenten doen veel eigen onderzoek en analyse daar ben ik trots op
2291831 er bestaat een hele eilandengroep bureautjes om buza heen met specifieke kennis kom je altijd wel weer eens binnen
2291832 het werd teveel al heb ik zelf wel geaarzeld omdat het zo aardig was om te doen maar voor sommige docenten was het heel belastend steeds dat heen en weer gereis we moesten terug naar de kerntaken en daarom hebben we gekozen voor de opleiding niet tegen het klasje
2291833 het ideale profiel van een sollicitant is een vrouw van dertig jaar die io ib heeft gestudeerd en vloeiend chinees spreekt ze heeft praktische werk en levenservaring opgedaan bij shell en is wetenschappelijk ontwikkeld door een extra master
2291834 enkele jaren geleden was er opeens een grote toestroom en kregen steeds meer mensen interesse in een opleiding tot internationalist dat was de schuld van mensen zoals bush en bin laden maar veel van die studenten hebben een vage droom over wat diplomaat zijn is die denken vooral aan cocktailpartys op de ambassade
2291835 e n van de belangrijkste kenmerken voor een io ib student is een brede belangstelling voor zowel de politiek als de maatschappij daarom zijn het ook vaak fanatieke krantenlezers
2291836 verkiezingen zijn een belangrijke en noodzakelijke simplificatie wilt u a of b
2291837 is het een afwijzing van links nee want 47 procent stemde royal ze wilden dus f links stemmen f ze wilden sarkozy niet dat is het enige dat je zeker weet verder is er niet ontzettend veel betekenis aan te geven
2291838 sarkozy heeft geprobeerd om te doen alsof ie heel stellige uitspraken deed maar hij heeft weinig standpunten waar ie op gevangen kan worden
2291839 sarkozy heeft heel bewust en succesvol de kring van le pen geanalyseerd en aangesproken een kiezersmarkt van ongeveer 25 procent hij besefte dat dit deel van de oude linkse vakbond dat zich sterk afzet tegen globalisering en vreemdelingen anders wellicht naar royal zou vluchten wilde royal de arbeiders winnen dan had ze sarkozy moeten overtreffen maar daar was ze te fatsoenlijk voor
2291840 het is een gelukkige uitslag voor frankrijk omdat ze even van het spook van le pen bevrijd zijn
2291841 sarkozy wil de schoffies hard aanpakken maar dat heeft royal in andere woorden ook gezegd
2291842 maar als hij de politie eropaf stuurt wordt het natuurlijk een totale oorlog
2291843 veel meer banlieuebewoners zijn w l voor sarkozy omdat juist hij de veiligheid op straat wil aanpakken de verkiezingsuitslag in de banlieues week grosso modo dan ook niet veel af van de landelijke uitslag
2291844 hij meent het maar ik verwacht niet dat hij denkt dat dat lukt
2291845 de werkelijke verschillen tussen beide zijn echter klein al is sarkozy een meer ervaren politicus
2291846 ook had ze een campagne die t ge mproviseerd was met plotselinge wendingen en beleidsbeslissingen die niemand voorzag ze is niet iemand met presidenti le allure die betrouwbaarheid en standvastigheid uitstraalt
2291847 de afwijzing van turkije wordt breed gedragen in frankrijk maar kun je je dat veroorloven er zijn al voorwaarden vastgesteld voor een toetreding van turkije daar kun je niet zomaar vanaf
2291848 sarkozy is t gen turkije in de eu en v r politieke bemoeienis met de euro wisselkoers allemaal punten waarin hij in de minderheid staat in eigen land is sarkozy de baas maar in europa natuurlijk niet
2291849 met angela merkel die zich ook tegen turkse toetreding heeft uitsproken ziet het er niet naar uit dat de onderhandelingen tussen turkije en de eu op korte termijn zullen worden hervat
2291850 sarkozy heeft laten weten voor een miniverdrag te zijn de europese leiders zullen dit miniverdrag waarschijnlijk omarmen omdat het een uitweg biedt uit de huidige impasse aangezien sarkozy het goed kan vinden met merkel de engelsen al lang blij zijn dat de grondwet van de baan is en de nederlandse regering geen stappen richting een uitweg heeft genomen maakt sarkozys voorstel grote kans van slagen
2291851 van chirac werd gezegd dat hij zo goed engels sprak en nog hamburgers heeft geflipt maar iedere franse president beschikt over een bepaald eigen frans nationalisme met de oorlog in irak had sarkozy waarschijnlijk hetzelfde gedaan
2291852 tijdens een toespraak na zijn overwinning in de eerste ronde zei hij tegen de fransen ik zal niet tegen u liegen ik zal u niet verraden ik zal u niet teleurstellen daarmee implicerend dat chirac dat w l had gedaan sarkozy heeft de vergelijking met zijn voorganger tot inzet van zijn campagne gemaakt
2291853 de erfenis die chirac achterlaat is op een museum voor primitieve kunsten na bijzonder schamel zeg maar gerust negatief als sarkozy een beetje politieke wil toont zal hij zich dus makkelijk kunnen meten met zijn voorganger
2291854 in 2002 was er de keuze bij de verkiezingen tussen een oud premier en een oud president dat enthousiasmeerde maar weinig fransen
2291855 nu waren er twee relatieve nieuwkomers royal en sarkozy die allebei veranderingen beloofden en die werden geloofd door de fransen
2291856 hij pakt zaken aan die jaren of decennialang taboe waren of niet echt aangepakt werden zoals veiligheid en immigratie
2291857 de staatsschuld de werkloosheid het pensioenstelsel allemaal onderwerpen die schreeuwen om aandacht en die door velen genegeerd zijn terugdenkend aan de mooie jaren van het franse verzorgingsstelsel dat nu door achterstallig onderhoud ernstige scheuren vertoont hij wil dat soort zaken wel aanpakken
2291858 in europa heeft het evv de rol van lobbyist en partner van europese instellingen waarmee we de sociale dialoog voeren hier wordt grote waarde gehecht aan de dialoog tussen werkgevers en werknemers wij waren gelukkig met hoe de grondrechten voorheen in het grondwettelijk verdrag stonden ik ben benieuwd hoe we ons dat nu bindend vastgelegd moeten voorstellen in een nieuw europees verdrag
2291859 in het ivv werk je samen met collegas van over de hele wereld uit pakistan brazili of zuid afrika maar wat opvalt is de lotverbondenheid we delen dezelfde grondwaarden en hebben identieke principes men zou moeten streven naar volwaardige werkgelegenheid geen kinder en dwangarbeid en iedereen moet het recht op vereniging hebben
2291860 het doel van deze campagne is het recht op werk zonder gezondheidsschade met de mogelijkheid om in eigen onderhoud te voorzien te verzekeren dat kinderen naar school kunnen en er iets van een sociale zekerheidssysteem bestaat
2291861 enig tegenspel tegen mugabe komt van de vakbonden dat zou niet kunnen als wij ze niet deels op de been houden op het moment dat er met hen iets gebeurt dan krijgt mugabe gedoe via hun internationale contacten maar dat is nog niet voldoende want er worden nog steeds mensen opgepakt en in de gevangenis gestopt en hun familie wordt bedreigd
2291862 de ambassade in harare doet bijvoorbeeld goed werk mensen van de ambassade staan je op te op te wachten om je te beschermen terwijl bijvoorbeeld deense collegas soms niet verder komen dan de aankomst en vertrekhal
2291863 in india is kinderarbeid een groot probleem en dat is het in china ook terwijl die twee landen grote economische centra zijn
2291864 dit soort praktijken grenzen aan waar je het woord slavernij moet gebruiken
2291865 tegen birma geldt een boycot omdat de winsten in dat land worden gebruikt om het nationale leger te financieren om de eigen bevolking te onderdrukken daar ontstaat een druk vanuit de internationale vakbeweging op bedrijven de situatie in birma is een clear cut case het is puur slecht wat daar gebeurt
2291866 in china is de situatie ook erg maar dat is toch het derde economische blok in de wereld en het is de vraag wanneer china op nummer n of twee komt daar begin je niet zomaar een boycot tegen en daar zou ik ook niet voor zijn de chinese economie gaat geweldig omdat er r cksichtslos een vijfjarenplan door heen wordt geloosd door een sterke overheid die door kan duwen en die het westen gebruikt als dat nodig is
2291867 kritiek op de mensenrechtensituatie in het land worden niet op prijs gesteld
2291868 de industri le economie in afrika is niet opgewassen tegen de goedkope import vanuit china maar afrika heeft ook een specifiek probleem want er komen een aantal slechte zaken bijeen afrika heeft nauwelijks een industri le traditie en wordt op allerlei manieren van de wereldmarkt afgeduwd

2291902 today we are witnessing the start of a new era for the u s economy and u s businesses an era that will be very different from the 1990s and early 2000s because the effects of the knowledge revolution have started to hit a wall and this wall has a name the u s consumer
2291903 even if the housing market comes back from the deep depression it has been in for the last 2 plus years and it will come back the economic environment will remain very weak

2292101 i gotta look you in the eye and give you straight talk i dont know if i can stop it or not or if it will be stopped
2292102 that obama would use me under this situation when im probably going to be looking at foreclosure its a shameful horrible thing to do to promote him it isnt fair its wrong

2292108 by the end of 1972 there had been four straight sugar seasons with record crops yet consumption actually outpaced supplies in 1972 literally eating into sugar inventories over the next year
2292109 there was evidence that some big industry users were stockpiling sugar in anticipation of higher prices
2292110 everyone had a theory for the high prices sugar traders had no idea where prices might be when the uss long standing price supports expired at the end of 1974 some blamed the high prices on a scarcity of cheap labour to harvest sugarcane others pointed to the failure of the european sugar beet crop others even suspected that both the soviet union which had just suffered two bad production years in a row in its own sugar crop and arab oil money remember that oil crisis of the 1970s had moved into the sugar futures markets along with a rise in speculation by others looking to make money from rising prices

2292113 these settlements often seem to bear no resemblance to actual damages
2292114 i am sure the plaintiffs are modeling the damages in these cases but i wonder sometimes about whether the vast legal resources of these big companies wears them down and they end up accepting a settlement that is significantly less than the actual harm done just to be done with it
2292115 one problem associated with abuse of prescription drugs is the routine shipping of 90 day supplies through the mail from facilities owned by pharmacy benefit managers
2292116 in most parts of the world a 30 day supply is the norm also the maximum amount that these same pharmacy benefit managers allow community pharmacies to dispense
2292117 with so many pills delivered in mailboxes or on front door steps placed in the medicine cabinet or on the kitchen counter it is very difficult for consumers to account for every painkiller vicodin sleeping aid ambien or anti anxiety medication valium increasing the risk for teenagers or other family member to experiment with medications not prescribed for them
2292118 medications often are discontinued well before all of the medication has been taken

2292155 we had a hard fought campaign and it was exciting it was a bit like the proverbial rollercoaster but we are now unified and ready to go forward together and it is imperative that each and every one of us think about how were going to help in this election
2292156 we are one party we share one vision and we believe as democrats as independents and repentant republicans in the progress we can make together
2292157 were still working out the mechanics of the four days and our staffs are in communication with sen clintons staffs but i dont anticipate any problems
2292158 i happen to believe that we will come out stronger if people feel that their voices were heard and their views were respected
2292159 i know from just what im hearing theres incredible pent up desire and i think that people want to feel like ok its a catharsis were here we did it and then everybody get behind sen
2292160 there hasnt been controversy other than what you guys are projecting right now
2292161 you could argue that no one is ever ready to be president i mean i certainly learned a lot about the job in the first year and hes smart as a whip so theres nothing he cant learn
2292162 hes been very supportive i thought he showed extraordinary restraint in a fairly provocative interview while he was on his trip i couldnt ask for him to be any more gracious than hes been and supportive since the campaign ended

2292168 joachim erwin hat soviel f r fortuna getan dass er eine entsprechende w rdigung vor allem im sport verdient h tte
2292169 die arena ist jochens baby ohne ihn w rde es sie nicht geben damit ist sein name auch eindeutig eher verbunden als mit der flughafenbr cke allerdings m sste die stadt dann noch einen sponsor finden
2292170 joachim erwin hat eine angemessene ehrung f r seine stolze leistung verdient er selber w rde sich riesig dar ber freuen
2292171 die arena scheint mir gut geeignet weil sie das lieblingskind von joachim erwin war
2292172 ich find das okay schlie lich hat sich erwin mit der arena ein denkmal gesetzt das ruhig nach ihm benannt werden sollte
2292173 so ehrenwert der vorschlag von frau kortmann ist es gibt ein problem ber das namens sponsoring verdient die arena geld anm d redaktion rund 200 000 euro im jahr ich glaube nicht dass es im sinne joachim erwins w re wenn die stadt diese summe bezahlen w rde

2292175 weapons are to be exclusively in the hands of one group the resistance group
2292176 we carry our weapons according to the orders of our leader we abandon our weapons when he orders us to do so
2292177 after receiving orders to concentrate on such matters i believe that this area of activity will grow and will serve the citizens of iraq
2292178 if we find this does not happen and the us forces change their stance over the timetable we can change direction also

2292188 nicaragua no longer land of sandinistas and somozas but a real estate opportunity
2292189 managua jul 5 prensa latina nicaraguan police and army denied their responsibility for a cargo of weapons made in israel seized in spains port algeciras with the central american nation as final destination
2292190 during the 1980s israel was a crucial conduit for the supply of arms to central american contra forces as well as to apartheid south africa and iran with a sandinista government installed in nicaragua and the ever present irritant that is hugo chavez could this discovery be a sign of a new counter revolutionary war
2292191 the shipment may have been meant to be discovered as a psyop against commandante daniel to help push him to become repressive against his political opponents if you read spanish you should look at the popular el nuevo diario end newspaper out of managua you should see the tremendously ugly hateful spleen launched there against ortega on a practically daily basis from the commentors on the different news articles the hatred expressed is hardly equaled even in the free usa in alternative media commentaries and blogs about w daniel has got to be getting a bit wrankled by it all and arms headed for nicaragua from israel making the world news would add to it
2292192 this may put into a new light the power crisis which is hitting nicaraguans
2292193 the crisis worsened since mid 2006 stems from the poor condition of thermal plants mostly in private hands and obvious problems of distribution in charge of spanish multinational union fenosa

2292202 july month of sandinistas partying during this month in every nicaraguan department a celebration takes place in reminiscence of their liberation
2292203 these activities start on july 15th and finishes on the 19th day of the sandinista revolution where the most important gathering takes place in managua on this day or the day before caravans of vehicles rally from all over the country
2292204 be advised that this year celebrations will not be as in early years al suave with sandinistas running the government they will sure become more expressives

2292214 my job is going to be difficult either way theres a lot of pressure to just be a starting quarterback in this league
2292215 im still following bretts legacy regardless of the fact if hes here retired or like he is in new york now
2292216 theres high expectations on myself on our team and i think its still going to be a difficult situation as far as the pressure outside this locker room thats put on me
2292217 it was good to get a resolution to the whole thing its been definitely on all of our minds weve had to talk about it a lot throughout the training camp
2292218 everybody in the locker room were happy for brett that he gets to still play and were going to move forward together as a team
2292219 a sense of relief you could say it in a lot of ways im about press conferenced out number one thats something its a responsibility i understand but it was something that the situation needed to be resolved and it was nice to get to a finality of that
2292220 im relieved that were talking about football our football team and thats what the focus needs to be on
2292221 im just reassured of the fact that things happen for a reason just to trust god in every situation and try and remain patient and even keeled because theres going to be ups and downs in life as in football and the things you cant control are the things often you want to worry about the most
2292222 but its really useless to worry about those because theyre really out of your control this situation was a prime example of that
2292223 when all this stuff kind of went on last week i realized the very worst case scenario was being able having to compete for my job so that wasnt a bad situation
2292224 its going to be in the orchards and its going to bear some wonderful fruit
2292225 when i was in australia they had a placenta tree that was on the river and all the placentas of all that tribe all that clan whatever aboriginal tribe that was all the placentas went under that one tree and it was this huge behemoth of just health and strength
2292226 this tree was just growing taller and stronger above the rest of mother nature around it it was gorgeous
2292227 we knew that if we could get in there for a prolonged period we would be able to cause disruption that would ripple through and assist in other areas
2292228 we know we took them by surprise any insurgents in the area that did manage to get out had to do so in a hurry because they left exploitable material behind
2292229 a large find of ied components homemade explosives a large quantity of that was found and destroyed in place
2292230 our principle aim is not to kill all the taliban in afghanistan that is not going to achieve success
2292231 it is convincing the people of afghanistan there is a legitimate and viable option in supporting the government
2292232 there is some consideration towards the use of american forces within the province and this was just one of the methods we begin to gather information on their use whether it be in maywand or elsewhere in the province
2292233 that line like a tree planted by the water i shall not be moved
2292234 it seemed to sum up what everyone struggling to come back after katrina was feeling i really wanted to bring the city together with that thought
2292235 folk tradition of adapting and transforming songs to serve as anthems to galvanize people in a cause
2292236 everything has changed since katrina even our neighbourhoods arent familiar anymore
2292237 youre talking about kids who lost everything their homes their schools and friends
2292238 for some of these kids this music is all they really feel they have and they are very excited about this project
2292239 it appears a right tire on the tour bus had a blowout that contributed to the accident
2292240 this happened like katrina like challenger what we can do is pray
2292241 god will comfort them tell people to keep trusting in god do not blame anybody do not ask why now we just help each other to get through this
2292242 the church is like one big family here were very close we stick together
2292243 would you put a blind on your bathroom window already weve got kids down here
2292244 whatever was afoot he did not know what anybody elses plans were or might have been
2292245 he was saying from his heart that he didnt know of any plans to attack canada he said that repeatedly he said that sincerely and he said that quite credibly
2292246 these guys were like religious people i dont think they were like planning to do something against canada
2292247 it is time for prime minister harper to stand up for the rights of a canadian citizen
2292248 canada has sought assurances that mr khadr under our government will be treated humanely
2292249 now we know that the canadian government has known about facilitated and helped cover up the torture and abuse of a canadian citizen
2292250 this is no longer just a matter of government policy
2292251 anyone who voted for me or caucused for me has so much more in common with senator obama than senator mccain
2292252 we may have started on two separate paths but we are on one journey now
2292253 which is why senator obama needs all of us he needs us working for him
2292254 we believe that standing up for our country means standing up against sexism and all intolerance demeaning portrayals of women cheapen our debates dampen the dreams of our daughters and deny us the contributions of too many responsibility lies with us all
2292255 whatever decision is made its going to be a collaborative decision
2292256 i think all this sort of speculation is much ado about very little
2292257 were just working out the details however those details play out that doesnt change the bottom line the fact that everyones on the same team here
2292258 i think what were looking for is energy and excitement
2292259 there are very few players who left me against my will ferguson said
2292260 madrid now know they are dealing with a different animal and cristiano will settle down and enjoy his career here he has got four years left on his contract and at some point hopefully we would like to extend it
2292261 you would not like to think that one of the biggest players in the world can just walk out and does not respect his contract
2292262 the specialist he saw yesterday is delighted with the progress ferguson said
2292263 well now take him to the next stage and for a month he will be in rehabilitation and then he should be in full training by that time
2292264 the important thing is we ended all this stuff about real madrid ferguson said
2292265 as he gets older he will appreciate being here more and more because that happens with players the longer they stay here and they dont ever want to leave
2292266 i dont know if its just my personality or my game he said
2292267 ben bulletin will be updated throughout the weekend about 150 miles away at mill creek golf course in ostrander ohio

2292280 he is therefore currently on leave from this office and under that federally protected status we must honor such medical situations until resolved or for up to 12 weeks
2292281 based on the facts that we have received over these months these are the charges that we feel are appropriate
2292282 i cant speculate on anything we have nothing to make other arrests on at this point
2292283 in our judicial system everyone is presumed to be innocent until proven guilty and i have faith in that process
2292284 but we said no no it was another michael who was killed not your other son
2292285 i cant imagine losing two sons at the same time
2292286 its suspicious in nature but we dont think its directly related
2292287 its just one of those strange things that permeates this case its something that kind of takes a life of its own
2292288 we have no idea who placed it there or if it was found in the river and someone threw it out of a car

2292379 there are some alerting factors when we see measurements and statements like this
2292380 first investigation determined that the measurement procedure was not valid the procedure used by the contractor was not appropriate as per epa radon measurement methods and did not provide a real idea of the amount of radon in the ambient kitchen air
2292381 second even if the measurement had been valid one measurement result based on one type of granite countertop in one particular home is not an indication of radon exposure in any other kitchen with a granite countertop what is needed is to measure many types of granite so some members of the health physics society did
2292382 so do other items in our households the amount of radiation emitted from granite can vary depending on the amount of natural uranium and or thorium concentration
2292383 what borrowers need to know about credit scoring models and credit scores
2292384 after consulting with the federal reserve board and the federal trade commission earlier this year fair isaac has decided to include consideration of authorized user trade lines present on the credit report
2292385 this was nothing more than good old fashioned smoke and mirrors politics
2292386 since there was nothing the fair isaac corp could legally do about it they sent out press releases saying the complete opposite and ill informed reporters at nearly every major media outlet believed them the story was splashed all over newspapers web sites and tv stations without ever stopping to ask legal counsel whether or not fico could actually get away with such an atrocity when the general public saw these stories on msn com nbc and in the new york times they just believed them to be true

2292414 the problem is that ebay doesnt do any controls it is the first distribution system in the world that refuses to check what its selling but says the brand has to do this for them imagine a big store where the owner says i dont know what i sell
2292415 we have 2 000 people in our company who are dedicated to fighting fraud and counterfeiting
2292416 we have 80 000 trademarks and rights owners who cooperate with us
2292417 but what we want to make sure is that counterfeiting should not be an alibi to protect a traditional and old fashioned way to sell and promote a product
2292418 if these decisions are confirmed then ebay will be obliged to confirm before each ad is posted on the site that the product isnt counterfeit
2292419 this means a big technological change for ebay but it also means they will have to people overseeing that each product is not a fake
2292420 the guy whos on the show now has already won something like twenty five thousand dollars
2292421 promise me you wont agree to do this without talking to me first

2292426 and a check will be waiting for you or you can decide to continue playing

2292430 you know ive never been certain you wanted to live my life over again be a professor at columbia or anywhere
2292431 i know its tempting but it might not be the right thing for you either
2292432 you might or you might not want to take that on
2292433 or you might just want to be a writer you could live for years on the money youve won couldnt you
2292434 you can do anything you want charlie i wish you knew that
2292435 no you dont youre now one of the most famous people in the country much more famous than i ever was
2292436 its none of my business dirty or not and i dont know what dirty would be the fact is youre caught up in something you may not really want

2292444 theres a lot at stake jack and dan are selling the company to nbc i dont know the details but i think theres a couple of million dollars
2292445 i left out some things that were none of his business
2292446 im interested in the things you didnt leave out the things you said
2292447 for example how you got on that show twenty one
2292448 did al freedman say you had done very well on the test and that was why barry and enright wanted you to try out for the show
2292449 did freedman say only one person had ever done better
2292450 im going to repeat my question did he say only one person had ever done better on that second test
2292451 he did say that mr van doren thank you for trying to remember now what i want to know is did he tell you the name of the person the only person who had done better than you
2292452 i want to go back to the time when freedman said the only person who had done better than you on the test was herb stempel did he also say that you would not be able to beat stempel
2292453 did he also say you would need a lot of luck to beat him
2292454 i dont believe he said that mr van doren what did he actually say i want you to think very hard
2292455 you can lie to me but im not going to let you lie to the grand jury
2292456 theres this guy i have to talk to him for a few minutes
2292457 i can only say it would be best for you professor van doren if you say nothing to anybody
2292458 of course theyre gonna renew theyre just waitin till this stuff blows over
2292459 i have deceived my friends and i had millions of them
2292460 may this be for you the whirligig of time that brings in his revenges
2292461 ive found that if an important figure in a documentary refuses to co perate it leaves the producers free to say not just whatever they want but maybe some things hed prefer they didnt say
2292462 my going back on tv as a kind of idiot savant
2292463 think of plato aristotle cicero augustine aquinas bacon locke hume voltaire jefferson hegel marx nietzsche
2292464 im sending you a contract the fee is higher a hundred thousand dollars you wont have to do much bob really wants you on board
2292465 theyre going to make the movie anyway whatever you do

2292467 i dont want to have anything to do with the whole thing the film the money the moneys yours if you want it but you wont have me
2292468 im not going to leave you but youll be on your own
2292469 the contract ties you up in knots i told the children and i think they both agree
2292470 our sort of design and development philosophy is great games are played and not made we play the game a lot and then say what we think is working what do we want do more of what do we want to do less of and what we want to take out its part of the reason our games take three or four years to make
2292471 i remember originally we tried to literally do it like assassins creed very very free we started play testing it and these advanced pop prince of persia players didnt know what to do they would jump and they would stop and they would try and look around they were overwhelmed by possibility there was a platform there and there and there and there and it was just too much
2292472 so we had to iterate on our level design to make sure you are going to be able to get that acrobatic flow that rhythm of run jump swing off the pole wall jump grab that column
2292473 es ist wasser aber nicht so wie wir es kennen
2292474 the fact that an act is undertaken to prevent a threatened terrorist attack rather than for the purpose of humiliation or abuse would be relevant to a reasonable observer in measuring the outrageousness of the act

2292479 losing scarlet formed in late 2007 and each member shares a unique diversity with one another the five musicians have experience in the chicago music scene that ranges from metal punk rock and have come together to create a fresh sound the music is heavy yet melodic and this band is definitely bringing something new to the table
2292480 i personally believe middle eastern gaming policy marketing practices of today that are thought of as inappropriate will be the future of tomorrows middle eastern gaming policy industry leaders
2292481 we need to stick to our guns and abide by best practice methods in order to preserve the integrity of the middle eastern gaming policy industry as a whole if we degrade ourselves by using cheap marketing practices to make a quick buck we will only be hurting ourselves in the long run
2292482 i really believe that my employers are genuine and care about what they do they are not out to prey on people or report false numbers they just want to make money and provide for the welfare of their company just like anyone else
2292483 were not hawking viagra so dont worry our email campaigns arent that bad but we also affirm the use of double opt in email lists to assure that customers who are truly interested in our middle eastern gaming policy products get the right emails
2292484 everyone in this middle eastern gaming policy sector knows how to blast out email notices fliers etc to people but not everyone knows how to do this in an efficient manner that creates profit margin efficieny in our industry is absolutely key
2292485 i truly believe that our customers not regulatory agencies are the best source of middle eastern gaming policy marketing feedback face it if were not making money and our customers are pissed off our marketing methods are wrong and not productive dont forget that private companies are in the business to make cash and dont make a profit banging their heads against the walls
2292486 do you as business leaders and executives make sure that your books are 100 accurate and sound or do you leave this task to your respective accounting agencies
2292487 i see to it that all our data is accurate
2292488 but i trust our finance department to crunch the numbers correctly and report accurately at the end of the day it is my job to move the business forward not be a slave to my calculator and exel spreadsheets
2292489 its time we catch up with the resk of the middle eastern gaming policy business community and offer solid fringe benefits for our valued employees this new package will come at no cost to employees and will be underwritten by a solid insurance company the premium charge will be higher but were banking on the fact that middle eastern gaming policy product sales will increase because our workers will be highly motivated to come to work each day
2292490 just as we study car home or life insurance we will be studying online business insurance well be using special mathematic models to figure out the risk that middle eastern gaming policy businesses bear against what would be deemed a reasonable insurance premium
2292491 once insurance companies buy into the online business sector theyre going to need able legal representation to avoid false claims likewise middle eastern gaming policy businesses will need legal representation against these big time insurance companies in order to get the disbursements they deserve im excited about the possibilities
2292492 we believe we have a right to the same protections afforded to offline businesses despite the fact that we dont have a physical place of business
2292493 our legal team has already thoroughly researched how to file an insurance claim for online business
2292494 mostly because we want to expedite the payout process should we have to make a claim the internet marketing world moves much faster than the physical marketing realm and as a result we would lose significant business from any down time associated with a drawn out insurance claim
2292495 were already researching able counsel for labor union related insurance claimes
2292496 because we dont want to get screwed in the event an insurance claim is denied to a respective business
2292497 because they currently have a limited health and dental plan we want to give them the most benefits and protect possible because they are our greatest assets people forget that the cost of losing an employee to another middle eastern gaming policy company sometimes outweighs the cost of keeping them onboard
2292498 wed rather have a consistent share value over time versus a catastrophic loss of company value due to some frivalous lawsuit or liable charges the result of this decision will probably mean a 5 loss in share value for 6 months but then a slow steady recovery after that

2292533 im doing everything i can to hold the anglican communion together
2292534 it is not i that is the schismatic but you bible believers who remain stubbornly wedded to the apostolic faith if only you would open up your hearts to the spirit and draw the circle of orthodoxy wider we would all have peace

2292538 he continually intimidated and harassed me and hired someone to beat me in the street wherever we went there would always be a car following us and watching us
2292539 as his dad told him that he had arranged for someone to kill me and was pressing my son for details of the layout of our home where the alarm was and where i slept
2292540 everyone in the local muslim community knew i was a christian and didnt want to know me people would cross the street rather than greet me and often spat in my face they tried to pressure me to leave town but i had already been chased out of one town so i was determined not to let them intimidate me

2292546 our first quarter reflects the successful benefits of our long term strategic initiatives primarily our commitment to new merchandise development and product innovation our ongoing attempts to expand our direct to consumer and our growing international presence this multipronged strategy is designed to diversify our businesses reduce our exposure to any one region of the world or channel of distribution and to give us more direct control over our brands
2292547 our inventories are very well managed as they are below last year and at the same time our retail sell through rates have been strong and our profit margins have benefited as a result
2292548 our cash flows have grown with more direct control we now have over our businesses and we have made the right decisions in order to deliver a very strong balance sheet which large growing cash balances and very little debt our entire management team has supported and delivered on these key short term operating priorities because of this cross functional discipline we are comfortable pursuing our long term initiatives
2292549 supported by our continued investment in advertising marketing and public relations including high profile events such as wimbledon and the olympics our status as one of the worlds few truly global luxury lifestyle brands is an incredible asset for our company
2292550 its amazing the way we manage our inventories and with our low debt were in a position opportunistically to do what we want to do we dont have to go looking for either financing or approval from someone we have been conscientious in operating the firm in a disciplined way and that gives us leverage to do whatever is the right thing to do
2292551 europe has a very concentrated city driven retail experience it doesnt have the mall suburban standalone environment that we have in the states
2292552 we eventually want to get lauren into asia and eastern europe but with much of the territories under license it is hard to put a business such as lauren into a licensed business
2292553 in japan where we have 75 percent direct control it will come to japan much sooner when we can properly position the brand and get the real estate to present the brand in the appropriate way
2292554 there are some items that are worthy of replenishment and some you want to sell out the retailer can benefit if it is run right theres a lot of information about size scale and one can learn from customers what size theyll need which can help in our novelty and fancy deliveries from the information we can adjust size scale in different regions
2292555 demonstrate to us that this company both increasingly segments its merchandise offering successfully into an array of consumer groups and successfully taps new markets one by one as it moves along the curve of buying back franchises that gave it an initial cost effective means to grow its business the company increasingly gains power over its ability to control its brand image and merchandise offering through likely continued turbulent economic waters polo ralph lauren is one that over time should continue to create shareholder value
2292556 enables this company to penetrate segments where demand is growing and pull back where demand is leaner

2292569 did not our heart burn within us while he talked with us on the road and while he opened the scriptures to us
2292570 we ought to obey god rather than men the god of our fathers raised up jesus whom you murdered by hanging on a tree him god has exalted to his right hand to be prince and savior to give repentance to israel and forgiveness of sins and we are his witnesses to these things and so also is the holy spirit whom god has given to those who obey him

2292578 if i could have given my two kids 30 grand off their mortgage im sure theyd be absolutely delighted that would be a lot more pleasant than looking at a big hole in my bank account
2292579 we did a conservative estimate based on what victims have reported to us where we believed in excess of 100m had been lost we actually believe that figure could be far higher potentially 400m 500m
2292580 there were people standing up doing the buy buy buy sell sell scenario
2292581 and i thought to myself simon youre looking to build a relationship with a financial broker whos going to help you make good money
2292582 weve had in over 2 500 written complaints regarding the sales practices and the mis selling carried out by pacific continental the losses potentially are running into hundreds of millions of pounds
2292583 their incentive is purely down to extracting as much money as they can from every individual they can and moving on
2292584 if every consumer was willing to hang up the phone and recognise what a boiler room was then the menace of boiler rooms would be dead and gone for ever
2292585 the response includes information on the national cyber security center how privacy will be protected under the cnci how success of the initiative will be measured and how the department views the private sectors role in the initiative
2292586 the department chose to redact information relating to contracting at the national cyber security division the senators have asked dhs explain their reasons for the redactions
2292587 why was the determination made that the contract will be for a 10 month period
2292588 how will the dhs provide appropriate oversight to ensure that the contractors support efforts do not intrude on inherently governmental functions
2292589 prior to this announcement committee staff had been instructed that the existence of the ncsc was itself classified
2292590 their letter to dhs in may asked for a detailed account of the departments role in the comprehensive national cyber security initiative noting a lack of information from the department in spite of the fact that the administration had claimed that cybersecurity was one of chertoffs top four priorities for 08
2292591 rod beckstrom the director of the national cyber security center in dhs continued the pattern of providing few details during his keynote at the black hat security conference thursday in las vegas
2292592 instead of getting into specifics both examples of real threats and what the government is trying to do about it he mainly talked in general terms about how businesses need to understand better the economics of security and the need to improve collaboration between people and governments throughout the world he also talked at length about abraham lincoln and george washington and how those two would have approached tech security
2292593 beckstrom started in march so hes still pretty new plus this administration has gone through cyber chiefs like spinal tap goes through drummers
2292594 so we should cut him a little slack still we couldnt help but feel disappointed by what we consider another missed opportunity
2292595 some people try for an eight because they think it will mean money but sometimes you will end up causing some challenges in the life that will not necessarily be desirable for that child
2292596 i think in this case its going to be a good situation
2292597 it was improvisational questions and answers with host russell brand just like other promo guest stars ll cool j and pete wentz did russell joked about there being sexual tension and britney shot back i dont feel the tension the other joke was about no one knowing who russell was so she called him by the wrong name ll called him russell bland and britney called him russell brown
2292598 the joke of the whole thing is there is an elephant in the room

2292610 we just dont have very many people join up to just want to volunteer anymore
2292611 with the fire department you usually get to help people in their greatest time of need
2292612 well its what i want to do for a living and if im going to go to school and work hard at it then thats just what i want to do
2292613 society has changed the area around greensboro has changed with additional population
2292614 but i think that people that are taxpayers in a fire district theyre entitled to get in touch with their department see if they are having problems
2292615 i made a serious error in judgment and conducted myself in a way that was disloyal to my family and to my core beliefs
2292616 i recognized my mistake and told my wife that i had a liaison with another woman and i asked for her forgiveness
2292617 it is inadequate to say to the people who believed in me that i am sorry as it is inadequate to say to the people who love me that i am sorry
2292618 in the course of several campaigns i started to believe that i was special and became increasingly egocentric and narcissistic
2292619 take any test necessary to establish the fact that i am not the father of any baby
2292620 if you want to beat me up feel free you cannot beat me up more than i have already beaten up myself
2292621 i have been stripped bare and will now work with everything i have to help my family and others who need my help
2292622 seventy one percent approximately to me from 69 8 percent is not a great move for that extra year
2292623 although i think its important to recognize that a small percentage of kids do need that extra year and id rather have that with them completing high school than have them leaving because they cant meet the four year standard
2292624 we looked at their graduation plans their course of study do they have all the required courses first of all and if there were any struggling areas what did they need in terms of getting the help they need
2292625 each one of our staff members will have anywhere from 12 15 kids and theyll meet with them twice a month
2292626 and a lot of what they do is talk about graduation rates graduation project course selection all of those things we dont have time for in a regular math science class when the curriculum is so tight and needs to be taught in a semesters time
2292627 i loved him so much that i would ski naked down mt everest with a carnation up my nose if he asked me to
2292628 because maybe youre gonna be the one who saves me and after all youre my wonder wheel
2292629 i wish theyd give me a polygraph and ask me if ive ever stolen anything from the police department or stolen anything from cops for kids or stolen anything from the evidence room did i ever intend on stealing
2292630 give me a polygraph we give polygraphs to people when were investigating people
2292631 i was given an option i would either have to resign last night or i would be terminated
2292632 i think it takes special people to be teachers dedicated and want to help and want to change the future
2292633 let our college students know as they make career choices that teaching is quite an honorable profession and it is a very very rewarding profession
2292634 you are shaping these kids lives and it can be a scary thing you know and the pay obviously isnt always the best and people are like you know maybe i can make money some other way
2292635 those are areas that are more economically depressed areas where there are not that many quality of life things that would attract young teachers coming out of college
2292636 were finding that getting high quality teachers is going much better than in past years
2292637 we think the economy in other areas may be impacting it people are coming to charlotte where the economys a little better looking for work

2292644 the saliva analysis epithelial cells from the interior of mouth collected from a person undergoing a paternity test gave an incongruous result a dna which could not come from the man who had carried out the test
2292645 after repeating the analysis there was an only one possible conclusion in the mouth of that man there was dna from two different persons
2292646 we arranged to meet the person in question we showed him the result and we explained him that we suspected that he had manipulated the samples which as it was a trial in judicial investigation could bring him serious consequences faced with the evidence he admitted that shortly before the sample taking he put into his mouth some saliva he kept in a little container
2292647 he admitted that when he mixed his saliva with someone elses he attempted to
2292648 we must highlight points out lorente that the alteration of dna tests is almost impossible without forensic experts realizing it but this case aroused the interest of the scientific community after its publication in the journal of the american academy of forensic sciences the reason is obvious it raises the need of adopting special measures to prevent experts error leading to crime or fraud or lack of punishment from this publication many protocols of saliva taking for forensic analysis cases of paternity crime suspects and dna databases include the obligation for saliva donors to wash their mouth out with water before a witness just before he places the swab in his mouth to collect saliva samples
2292649 offers a one in one billion chance of a mismatch
2292650 there was not enough evidence to provide a realistic chance of conviction
2292651 last year we served 637 kids and so the whole goal of this is to make sure that every kid has the ability to start the school year with new school supplies so they dont have to be embarrassed when come into school
2292652 thats something that we always run out of 1 3 inch binders calculators watercolors those are our greatest needs but there is also paper pencils and sometimes teachers have special things on the list and we dont usually get those so thats a need too
2292653 every kid loves to get brand new school supplies they are really grateful

2292660 this last year i used 65 000 in fuel and in this school year coming ive now had to budget 95 000 for fuel
2292661 our transportation department loses about 100 000 a year from our state funding to what it costs us to operate
2292662 because of the high fuel costs weve changed some of our model on how were running stuff weve gone through this year and weve added additives to our diesel fuel to get better fuel mileage we are getting stricter with some of the kids so that we dont drive around a lot of kids will call us and say theyve missed the bus and well go back and pick them up well this year because of the cost we are just not going to do that
2292663 we just went and got a list from all the schools on where every child in our school district lives and we adjust the routes accordingly this year just go where the kids are
2292664 if some of the kids live 10 to 15 miles from school we have a thing with their parents where they will call us if they need a bus that day if they dont need a bus we dont drive all the way out there
2292665 so that will help too and we dont need the capacity that we are losing by smaller buses so i think we are going to do a lot better with these new buses i am expecting maybe nine miles a gallon verses seven that doesnt sound like much but thats a 28 percent increase

2292668 michigans economic future is dependent on our ability to provide every child with a quality education and this budget helps move us toward that goal
2292669 by investing in early childhood education and high schools that use strong relationships and real world rigor to help kids succeed we are investing in michigans future
2292670 as the 21st century economy changes our education system must change with it
2292671 innovations like early college high schools and small high schools can help students succeed by keeping them engaged in learning

2292712 there are 2000 mosques in the uk if each mosque held an open day and attracted at least 1 000 visitors that will be two millions people the mosques can potentially reach out to
2292713 its just simple to do but theyre not doing it
2292714 in a climate where there is a growing fear of muslims mosques which are central to the community need to do something to tackle this
2292715 if someone had a query or if a non muslim wanted to know about what islam had to say on a certain issue they can easily ring the helpline and just ask
2292716 when there is a fire we ring the fire brigade when someone is having personal problems they ring the samaritans so when someone has an issue about islam or just needs to talk why not ring a mosque helpline
2292717 these are practical steps that can make the world a better place
2292718 we also need to reach out to the media and politicians and people who are demonising islam
2292719 if a journalist has upset the muslim community with an article then invite that journalist to your home and build an understanding
2292720 the chances are they will be willing to listen to us so we need to reach out to them
2292721 mosques also need to have a media monitoring unit so that they know whats happening elsewhere in the uk as well as their own town
2292722 if a muslim woman is attacked for wearing the hijab the mosques need to know about it and note it down so we can collate information about incidents throughout the uk

2292784 in de praktijk ben je de eerste en de laatste week best veel voor school bezig
2292785 in de vier weken ertussen ben ik dit jaar een paar ochtenden naar school geweest maar in het algemeen kan ik dan best goed afstand nemen normaliter ben je in je hoofd voortdurend aan het organiseren dat hoeft in die weken niet als me iets te binnen schiet schrijf ik het op en daarna zet ik het van me af in de eerste week dat ik weer aan de slag ga werk ik dat lijstje af
2292786 dan staan alle meubels op een hoop het eerste werk van de leerkrachten was deze week het klaarzetten van de tafels en stoeltjes

2292914 there are so much to celebrate tonight for olympics and also for ourselves
2292915 we spent two years working in birds nest till now i can still remember the sizes of wash basins and faucets i had installed inside the stadium
2292916 all those audio and video technologies in the performance made me feel like in the space age
2292917 the firework performance was so wonderful it reminded people that it is the chinese who invented gunpowder
2292918 it is impossible to miss the historic coincidence of the games happening on the 30th anniversary of reform and opening which has permanently transformed china
2292919 after 30 years of opening up china not only could host the olympics but also host a very good one
2292920 we fear that our presence might cause stress for our son so we decided to just stay home and watch tv with our relatives
2292921 it is the greatest honor for an athlete to participate in the olympic games i am so proud of my son
2292922 im very happy to see so many friends from all over the world come to our country the olympics are a seed that grows friendship and peace
2292923 this is no doubt the best opening ceremony ive ever seen unquestionably
2292924 i think any person watching tv anywhere in the world will have a sense of chinese history and the power that china now has made from its long history its wonderful
2292925 i like the beginning part most its so impressive and touching i can feel power and beauty harmoniously connected
2292926 the whole performance is almost like a brief introduction of chinese history
2292927 the performance is a good start for those who are not familiar with chinese culture

2292984 you have to make a good film that would be a good film under any circumstances
2292985 you have to put the narrative first the reality is no matter how many 3 d screens we get you are still going to have a large number of people possibly the majority of people who see the film in a 2 d environment
2292986 hannah montana and miley cyrus best of both worlds concert
2292987 the systems themselves in my opinion can handle any creative challenge
2292988 the way we developed the performance capture workflow on avatar
2292989 that is going though facial algorithms and going back into the camera as a real time cg face of the character
2292990 you see it talk you see the eyes move it is pretty phenomenal
2292991 once weve laid down a take the take exists in the digital asset management system
2292992 its this amazing ability to quickly conjure scenes and images and great fantasyscapes that is very visual we call it director centric because i can use the camera to block the actors
2292993 when you are doing performance capture creatively its very daunting its very hard to imagine what it will look like but if you can see it if you can have a virtual image of what is it going to be like then you are there as the processing power goes up our models get more sophisticated and our lighting tools get more sophisticated even while we are making this movie im still doing a lot of virtual camera work on the film on stuff that was shot six months ago
2292994 we changed the words and he redid the dialogue we didnt have to recapture his body performance and he didnt have to put the performance capture suit on again we were just creating new words and we were creating a new face
2292995 one movie where the aesthetics of physical production and the aesthetics of virtual production are to the extent that we could do it pretty much it identical
2292996 were taking our virtual production toolset and superimposing it on physical production
2292997 we turned the set on the soundstage into a capture volume and turned the physical camera into a capture virtual camera so we were able to integrate cg characters and environments into our live action
2292998 we have people in flying vehicles and i can see what is outside the window fed in in real time
2292999 are we looking at a situation maybe 10 15 years out where most laptops are sold with 3 d stereoscopic screens most montors are stereo compatible most dvd players can run stereo content i can see this becoming much more pervasive that we are thinking now

2293001 avait identifi certains risques pour la croissance certains se mat rialisent
2293002 the way we developed the performance capture workflow on avatar
2293003 once weve laid down a take the take exists in the digital asset management system it can be accessed at any time long after the actors have gone home im still out there with the virtual camera shooting coverage on the scene i just have to play the take back i can do the close up the wide shot i can even move them around on a limited basis we relight it we do all kinds of things
2293004 you have to make a good film that would be a good film under any circumstances
2293005 you have to put the narrative first the reality is no matter how many 3 d screens we get you are still going to have a large number of people possibly the majority of people who see the film in a 2 d environment
2293006 im writing a new version of the invisible man for universal im in the process of doing invisible man right now and im working with some conceptual artists in tandem with writing the script im actually working with one of the artists from batman begins and the dark knight so it could be magneto or it could be the invisible man next
2293007 well the invisible man the universal film is a great movie a claude rains film
2293008 my take is kind of an extrapolation it actually deals with a nephew of the first character its got some of the characters from the h g wells book but its kind of a continuation
2293009 it involves scotland yard getting their hands on the current invisible man and basically saying wow youd be a really good secret agent to send into imperial russia right now it starts off from there
2293010 its a beautiful place in fall with the colors changing
2293011 but in winter it can be very bleak there are city blocks that are abandoned the woods can be brutal we didnt want to go the cgi world
2293012 its a once in a lifetime project i did this alone no help i have found with other things in the past that if you have help the help often does not get it right and you have to do it over 95 of the time plus i like to work alone all parts are scratch built cept tires rims brakes engine etc meaning all bodyparts brackets just about everything external on the car
2293013 well i think it will be a good thing to keep down some of the loitering and cruising we have which should keep down some of the trouble weve been having with fights and stuff

2293016 rudy is a family pet he doesnt go anywhere but hes part of the family
2293017 i do not support it i would veto it i would do that because i believe the subsidies are unnecessary and i do not believe we should have tariffs against imported products
2293018 i just thought id start out with that non controversial statement
2293019 we are we are now have a farm bill thats winding its way through the senate and the house of representatives which protects sugar why should we do that when when we have see and increasing in cost of food and particularly those including those that have sugar in it why shouldnt we uh why should we raise protectionist barriers to sugar into this country and why should we pay farmers who make as much as nine hundred thousand dollars a year additional tax dollars of yours and mine if i were the president of the united states i would veto that farm bill in a new york minute
2293020 3 8 billion disaster relief fund for farmers and ranchers
2293021 a green payment scheme that pays farmers who practice land water and wildlife conservation on working lands
2293022 provides 300 million in mandatory funding for payments to support production of advanced biofuels including cellulosic ethanol and biodiesel
2293023 250 million in grants and loan guarantees for renewable energy and energy efficiency systems for agriculture and rural small businesses
2293024 over 116 000 u s jobs and nearly 19 billion in u s investment could be lost in just one year if renewable energy tax credits are not renewed by congress the study concluded that over 76 000 jobs are put at risk in the wind industry and approximately 40 000 jobs in the solar industry
2293025 compromises that won passage for a major energy bill in the senate this week left investors for geothermal wind and solar resources out in the cold after a long struggle the senate passed the bill late thursday it increases vehicle fuel mileage standards and encourages energy efficiency in federal buildings and in electricity guzzling appliances the house is expected to take a final vote next week but passage was assured only after negotiators removed provisions that would set a requirement that 15 percent of electricity come from renewable sources by 2020 also gone were extensions for investment and production tax credits set to expire next year for generators of geothermal wind and solar power from the standpoint of renewable energy the compromises were certainly a missed opportunity and they were out of step with much of the support we get from across the country said gregory wetsone director of government affairs at the american wind energy association
2293026 would have revoked 13 5 billion in tax breaks from the five largest oil companies the money would have been redirected into tax incentives for solar wind geothermal biomass wave energy and other renewables consumers would have received a 3 000 tax credit for buying an electric plug in hybrid and a tax credit of up to 4 000 for installing solar panels to power their homes but the measure failed on a 59 40 vote falling one vote shy of the 60 votes needed to end debate and move the bill forward
2293027 the amendment strikes the finance committee amendment that extends for an additional seven years the tax credits for ethanol and methanol producers the congressional budget office has estimated lost revenues total 3 8 billion mccains amendment would have allowed the existing subsidies to continue through the year 2000 but would have eliminated the seven year extension
2293028 if ever there was a prime example of corporate pork the unnecessary inequitable ethanol subsidy program is it
2293029 ethanol is not worth it it does not help the consumer those ethanol subsidies should be phased out
2293030 ethanol is not right the subsidies should be phased out
2293031 become make it a national priority to for energy independence
2293032 but ill tell you what i would eliminate ethanol subsidies i would eliminate the tariff on imported ethanol im for biofuels im for all that stuff but lets let the market play lets not subsidize ethanol or any other alternate form of energy
2293033 while grassroots groups on both sides of the political spectrum oppose the proposal social conservative leaders such as dr james dobson founder of focus on the family who broadcasts a radio program to hundreds of thousands of evangelical christians have been its most vehement critics mccain sponsored legislation last congress that included an even broader requirement for grassroots lobbying coalitions to reveal their financial donors
2293034 want s to allow undocumented workers who participate in a guest worker program to be able to stay in america and apply for permanent residency or citizenship after paying fines and satisfying other requirements
2293035 republican presidential hopeful john mccain on thursday backed a scaled down proposal that imposes strict rules to end illegal immigration but doesnt include a path to citizenship among other things the bill makes being in the country illegally a criminal misdemeanor and toughens penalties for re entering after being deported
2293036 the senate voted 53 47 in favor of extending the presidents investor tax cuts on dividends and capital gains
2293037 the tax cuts were temporary and then had to be made permanent the tax cuts are now there and voting to revoke them would have been to not to extend them would have meant a tax increase ive never voted for a tax increase in my life

2293069 chuck donovan executive vice president of the family research council a washington advocacy group allied with dobson said
2293070 there are certainly a fair number of people including in our own building who think that practically there may not be even one fewer abortion in the country as a result
2293071 the partial birth abortion ban as a fundraising technique has brought in over a quarter of a billion dollars

2293641 sixteen years ago my father left ireland where i was born and set up house in london but my mother always hated the city so after the funeral she returned to county kildare
2293642 my father was ill for nearly six years and i saw him on a regular basis though the loss is great there is the sense that hes guiding me
2293643 they gave me a two year sabbatical from 1996 98 to study classical japanese and japanese art at oxford columbia and princeton
2293644 because traditional japanese culture is now so much part of my sensibility that i wanted to see if i could tap the essence of poetry written to a golden standard in the heian period what was it that resonated with people as strongly today as 700 years ago
2293645 take no 9 ono no komachi which i translate as a life in vain my talents faded like these cherry blossoms paling in the endless rains that i gaze out upon alone
2293646 when i read the poem in japanese each kanji has three or four meanings piled up on one another take the first line hana no iro wa hana means flower also poetic or artistic talent even the time of a womans beauty similarly iro can mean color fading sex and sensuality
2293647 it worked as a poem but i found it nearly impossible to capture its brevity without losing the depth of meaning that took much longer
2293648 i cant help feel that if young japanese had a way to express their innermost emotions we might have fewer incidents such as in akihabara recently when that desperately unhappy and angry young man ran amok maybe it would help if they were taught how to express themselves as honestly as their ancestors did
2293649 i like to support the work of young japanese artists for example i was very keen that yasushi yokoiyamas painting fujitsu ni honen in a little while things will get better was featured on the cover of my book anyone over 60 tends to think it sacrilegious being manga like in style but i wanted to use an image which is attractive to young people
2293650 its very nice because now i can pick and choose im enjoying it
2293651 i can honestly say it provided a whole new perspective on my life
2293652 i like to reinvent things question the way in which we see the world see things in new ways

2293659 i mean i feel sorry for the people who had to witness it but for the guy who actually had his head knocked of not so much
2293660 wow they do grow them tough in canada remind me not to mess with canadians
2293661 oh yeah i heard about that what an idiot why is this such a big deal
2293662 what do you mean obviously you have to be pretty messed up to saw someones head off did you read the part about him eating parts of the body
2293663 i thought some idiot had stuck his head out of the window of a moving bus and had it taken off by a lamp post or something
2293664 its times like this i wish i was a neurophysicist

2293678 that the poverty rate stays about the same year to year no matter whos running the country yet the democrats only notice it when the gop is in office
2293679 it is only as deserved or undeserved that a sentence can be seen as just or unjust
2293680 no person shall be held to answer for a capital or otherwise infamous crime unless
2293681 my answer has always been that this is so rare i do not know of a proved case of mistaken execution in america in the last 50 years that society must be prepared to pay that terrible price why among other reasons because more innocents will be killed by murderers who are not executed in prison or once released or if they escape than will be by the state in erroneous executions
2293682 often have the tragedy of innocents dying because of a social policy
2293683 the woman was killed read murdered because many americans believe that it is better to let a murderer go free than to convict one with evidence
2293684 so those who still wish to argue for keeping all murderers alive will need to argue something other than an innocent may be killed they already support a policy that ensures innocents will be killed
2293685 i knew i had to give it to ovechkin before anyone
2293686 we sold our home here a couple of years ago but depending on how the season goes were thinking of buying here again

2293694 people laugh but when im working out thats what i think about
2293695 if i did that would i be getting the opportunity to do what im doing now
2293696 i never knew if i was going to get the chance but it was the only thing i ever wanted to do
2293697 if i had to ride the buses until i was 68 i dont know how old youre allowed to be and still coach then i would have done that
2293698 when i got that call i was pretty pumped up i felt like a very young 52
2293699 i had to get their respect right off the bat so i gave alex crap
2293700 it was on the first shift of the first practice and he missed a drill
2293701 i pulled him aside in front of the guys and told him he couldnt do that
2293702 i knew i had to give it to him before anyone
2293703 if all i did was give crap to the nine guys i coached in the minors before then it would be i was just giving crap to the ahl boys
2293704 in the end we believed we could win and we were pretty shocked when we lost
2293705 inspired by a biblical passage in the 25th chapter of the gospel of matthew in which jesus says for i was hungry and you gave me food i was thirsty and you gave me drink
2293706 especially younger evangelicals who are very open to somebody with a new vision

2293712 many jews feel a bit uneasy about obama and his anti semitic friends these jews are also disturbed at the summary dismissal or a serious jewish liberal democrat like joe lieberman the democrats vice presidential candidate eight years ago lieberman is a strong mccain supporter and that support will provide a strong push for ambivalent jewish voters to tilt towards mccain placing a religiously serious jew on the republican ticket with mccain will provide an even stronger push in a close election and this looks to be a close election a swing of jewish voters to mccain could translate into victories in florida pennsylvania ohio michigan and other states that mccain could either win or lose those battleground states are the keys to victory for mccain

2293789 let me not have to pay an arm and a leg for the fuel which can only be depleted not renewed so i can go back to going about my business and treating this non evolved creation which was created for me to my whim and fancy
2293790 and whenever you pray dont be like the hypocrites who love to stand in the synagogues and on the street corners so that they will be seen by people i tell you with certainty they have their full reward but whenever you pray go into your room close the door and pray to your father who is hidden and your father who sees from the hidden place will reward you

2293795 fair trade bullshit thats been marketed to the hipsters who think theyre doing the world a favour by patronizing the right kind of places
2293796 we get a bit of flak for just being a duo and not having a bassist but i think less is more
2293797 being in a duo you have that feeling that you have to give 110 every night you cant have a bad gig or rely on anyone else except yourself
2293798 were fans of bands like the white stripes and the dresden dolls
2293799 who are a duo but have enormous energy even nirvana who admittedly had three members made a big noise
2293800 theyre really sweet they basically havent been apart for more than three seconds in the past two months
2293801 liverpool needed a striker so that steven gerrard could go back in his favourite midfield position
2293802 we needed a creative and a hard working forward who can link midfield and attack and robbie keane is perfect for that role
2293803 it was just a bit of fun really we supplied them with crowd footage taken from a home game of every premiership club and they made their decision about liverpool fans both male and female being the most attractive
2293804 its true that beauty is subjective and in the eye of the beholder but i have spent 15 years as a top talent spotter for international model agencies which means ive worked with some of the heavyweights in the tv world on the catwalks and advertising so i think i kind of know what im talking about
2293805 but there is also a criteria that you have to typically take into account
2293806 by the time i saw them they were already on me
2293807 they started kicking and beating me i couldnt protect myself there were about 25 of them
2293808 they consider us nothing more than mosquitoes not human beings as though we didnt exist
2293809 olympiacos is a challenge for me ive had two weeks of pre season training with liverpool and i believe i will be ready to do whatever i have to
2293810 today a lot of newspapers published news that we were negotiating with liverpool and that we had a tactical strategy of bargaining
2293811 these reports are not true our club has no intention on transferring xabi alonso

2293816 hopefully it wont be my last opportunity but of course every year we have high hopes that well be closer to the top this year is the same
2293817 in some ways made things more difficult because the expectations became so high
2293818 then we won the european super cup and fa cup the following season and so suddenly everyone was saying ok the next step will be the premier league title
2293819 in some respects we were maybe our own worst enemies but of course id prefer to have that problem to be talking as a champions league winner people are talking now about us not having won the league for 18 years but it was 21 years since this club had last won the european cup
2293820 its clear that we are going in the right direction and progressing
2293821 we have got good young players coming through who will be important while those with experience are settling down now so it could be a very good season for us
2293822 the key is not to say that we can win the title because its clear that its the most difficult league in the world to win look at the final of the champions league last season it was between chelsea and united who are at the top of the table in england
2293823 everybody can see that the team and squad is improving every year and that now we are much better but will that be enough to win the title thats the big question because it depends on the other teams as well
2293824 i cant control what united chelsea or arsenal do every year im trying to do the right things but so are they is it going to be enough i dont know
2293825 its important for all teams to be focused solely on things on the pitch because that way you get the best from each player because they dont have distractions and arent always reading bad news about their club
2293826 the best way for all clubs to do things is not to create too much bad news
2293827 since i arrived here you can see that the fans are amazing and support you 100 per cent
2293828 it might be similar at other clubs but this one is very special its different

2293839 damn was the words out of her mouth she pulled his jeans and boxers down
2293840 now seriously you need to slow down we havent yet got our shirts off
2293841 the other part i said was you dont like how i talk
2293842 nah but neither do you so shutup and get to work
2293843 its the soldier not the reporter who has given us freedom of the press its the soldier not the poet who has given us freedom of speech its the soldier not the campus organizer who has given us the freedom to demonstrate its the soldier not the lawyer who has given us the right to a fair trial its the soldier who salutes the flag serves under the flag and whose coffin is draped by the flag who gives the protester the right to burn the flag

2293856 are you on the south side or the north side of the river
2293857 its too soon at the moment to decide but i have an idea of the team id like to pick
2293858 because weve had players coming back late in different groups after euro 2008 we have to be careful of injuries we need to wait a bit longer see how the players are in training and then decide what we are going to do
2293859 tonight is a chance for the players to impress not just me but the supporters as well
2293860 the preparations have gone well but its important to improve our sharpness a bit more now and thats why we have agreed to play lazio
2293861 it can sometimes be difficult for young players when they move to a new club but he has done well and it will be good for his confidence that he has already scored two goals
2293862 it is now important that he keeps on working hard and trying to get better because he still needs to improve

2293876 rudy is a family pet he doesnt go anywhere but hes part of the family
2293877 my job is going to be difficult either way theres a lot of pressure to just be a starting quarterback in this league
2293878 im still following bretts legacy regardless of the fact if hes here retired or like he is in new york now
2293879 theres high expectations on myself on our team and i think its still going to be a difficult situation as far as the pressure outside this locker room thats put on me
2293880 it was good to get a resolution to the whole thing its been definitely on all of our minds weve had to talk about it a lot throughout the training camp
2293881 everybody in the locker room were happy for brett that he gets to still play and were going to move forward together as a team
2293882 a sense of relief you could say it in a lot of ways im about press conferenced out number one thats something its a responsibility i understand but it was something that the situation needed to be resolved and it was nice to get to a finality of that
2293883 im relieved that were talking about football our football team and thats what the focus needs to be on
2293884 im just reassured of the fact that things happen for a reason just to trust god in every situation and try and remain patient and even keeled because theres going to be ups and downs in life as in football and the things you cant control are the things often you want to worry about the most
2293885 but its really useless to worry about those because theyre really out of your control this situation was a prime example of that
2293886 the thing that wouldve happened potentially is a quarterback competition that was kind of the worst option i guess you could say which wasnt even a bad option at all
2293887 they told me i was the starter back in march and i worked hard to figure out ways to exert my leadership on this team get to know guys a little more
2293888 when all this stuff kind of went on last week i realized the very worst case scenario was being able having to compete for my job so that wasnt a bad situation

2293893 it may be coincidental but maintenance standards appear to have deteriorated at united as operational decisions are increasingly driven by economic considerations
2293894 there is nothing more important than the safety of our employees and customers and it is unconscionable and intentionally misleading for alpa to suggest otherwise our engine performance and maintenance requirements exceed all federal safety standards
2293895 all of this engine maintenance is performed by our dedicated and highly competent employees in san francisco and is held to our own very high safety standards and those of the faa

2293904 the last thing a college professor told us at the end of the class was to remember for the rest of our life is to not spend time on the things you cant control instead spend your time thinking about what you can
2293905 it was my dad who gave me the best advice of my 45 year career he said get sales up and keep expenses down that sounds simplistic but it is the way my father got 4 margins in his food business when his competitors made 1 or 2 the goal is to get revenues moving and to keep expenses from rising at the same rate so that the margins expand

2293914 evidence for obamas affinity with the asian american experience runs true even as one delves deeper into his history
2293915 a lot of aspects of the senators story will be recognizable to many asian americans
2293916 he talks about feeling like somewhat of an outsider about coming to terms with his self identity about figuring out how to reconcile the values from his unique heritage with those of larger u s society these are tensions and conflicts that play out in the lives of all children of immigrants
2293917 by the time obama talks about his remote fathers outsized academic expectations for him
2293918 barry you do not work as hard as you should
2293919 calling obama the first asian american president doesnt obscure or invalidate his other identities black white multiracial transnational pancultural
2293920 african americans think and rightfully so that this is a guy who understands their experience but its similar if you talk to latinos and asian americans or to our 22 year old field organizers people see in him the qualities they want to see
2293921 its amusing watching people come up with these caricatures suggesting hes not american
2293922 hes not only american his story is the quintessential american story its the story that our nation is all about
2293923 we as an industry need to step up and do what the government cant reasonably do on their own given their resource and people limitations

2293935 the group asian americans for obama was founded by ko to organize the aa community to elect obama as president the groups web site is a resource center for organizers who need tools to campaign in their communities
2293936 mccain supporter phan acknowledges the obama campaigns effectiveness in mobilizing the younger generation and minority groups the group asian americans for mccain is limited in its resources he said
2293937 they said a number of different things to gain entry and to gain their confidence which is typical of people who do fraud
2293938 you know the mower probably just needs a tune up replace the oil and spark plug and i bet shell be as good as new
2293939 we are pleased that our unity colleagues will have the chance to hear from sen obama and be among the first to question him upon his return from his overseas trip
2293940 we hope that in this historic campaign sen mccain whose presence is equally important will also address our audience the kind of audience that reflects the growing diversity in america
2293941 we are honored to have senator obama join us at unity especially considering his international schedule
2293942 it reaffirms the importance and respect of journalists of color in this years election process
2293943 we have had other republican and democratic presidential candidates address our organizations including president george w bush and sen john kerry at unity in 2004 and hope sen mccain will join sen obama and choose to continue that tradition
2293944 by putting sen obama in the white house we can help enact his historic agenda for change on issues of critical importance to the asian american community including health care education immigration and the economy
2293945 to a casual observer it probably seems odd that we lump together these extraordinarily diverse and complex communities into one council
2293946 however what draws you together and what i hope makes you democrats is the shared experiences of coming to this country building your families and passing on a better life for the next generation
2293947 each of these individuals are deeply committed to ensuring that the rapidly growing south asian american communities are engaged and participating in this years historic elections
2293948 welcome to hawaii event where barack will talk about his vision for bringing america together and creating the kind of change we can believe in
2293949 about his vision for bringing america together and creating the kind of change we can believe in
2293950 i think it is safe to assume there will be thousands
2293951 ive never been so excited about a candidate in my life
2293952 i think there was an underestimation of the audience by a lot of people in what is the most pervasive form of entertainment there is we all focus on the ratings and performance of tv and films but what is it we see most of
2293953 we said to the industry and i believe weve upheld this we are not here to do a job on you but we are not here to do a press release either
2293954 picking a real estate company is like playing the lottery getting a winner is a gamble
2293955 its very difficult for producers and im not ashamed to use my own company as an example
2293956 i dont take it personally but i think its shortsighted and that it adds to a process of creative decay in the film business as pga president im very concerned about it
2293957 we are buying projects every day from producers were just not paying their overhead
2293958 we are all under enormous pressure from our corporate parents to make our numbers and if you can trim 5 million from your budget by dropping overall deals it is the easiest place to take out money
2293959 in television networks have assumed all creative control and ownership of the programs they produce and that has taken the creative and entrepreneurial initiative away from producers
2293960 weve seen whats happened in motion pictures as far as im concerned producers are under siege
2293961 hustling for financiers with deep pockets or running off to any number of dot coms
2293962 confirm a fact you dont want to know namely that the major studios dont want to be in business with you at least they dont want to pay for the privilege
2293963 the nice thing is we have a healthy enough deal with warner bros that we have the benefit of having the best of both worlds
2293964 were on the lot but were not tied to one studio
2293965 these days youd better be rich if you want to be a producer just to be able to survive between pictures
2293966 minimajors dont even pay the option fee anymore or theyve cut it to 10 000 or less
2293967 that 25 000 fee has remained static while the value of a house in westwood has gone up tenfold
2293968 say i come up with an idea i work with a writer to develop it and then after six months we sell it to a studio for 600 000
2293969 the studio gives me a take it or leave it offer if im lucky i get 12 500 which is probably just enough to pay my lawyer the writer his agents everybody gets paid but me because my fee doesnt start until preproduction when we go out to dinner to celebrate the deal guess whos expected to pick up the check
2293970 there is no question that it has become harder than ever for producers who are being squeezed right along with the writers who lost tv deals in the horrific aftermath of the strike so i dont feel were being singled out money available to producers is down dramatically and what is frustrating is that in may we saw one of the healthiest upfront ad markets and a booming summer box office
2293971 in the last two years weve made eight movies without it
2293972 there are some real disadvantages to having a studio deal
2293973 do you think agencies want to commission a 700 000 fee or someone elses first dollar gross deal
2293974 these producers who have no net under them have the most interesting entrepreneurial energy and they find nuggets that require time to discover
2293975 ive always tried to provide safe harbor for them because there is no established career track for producers right now
2293976 and by the time it got into production i was so pushed out of the process that i didnt meet the star of my movie ben stiller until the premiere
2293977 the respect and acknowledgement for the role of true producers has diminished radically in the last 20 years
2293978 everybody is hurting right now and agents studios and everybody else are clawing into revenue streams that once went to the producer and the only person not protected in the equation is the producer
2293979 for home buyers the sad thing is that the vast majority of home buyers wont see this incredible opportunity for what it is until the storm passes to be gone forever
2293980 it felt to me like there was some resistance to flashpoint going into the cbs primetime schedule and that seemed to be written between the lines of some of the reviews
2293981 but i feel thats going away because audiences in north america seem to be responding to the show
2293982 it certainly makes financial sense they suddenly realized why not work with canada theres no language issue and its right next door
2293983 when we talked to the folks at cbs about flashpoint they said theyd been talking about finding a new model for making television and they said theyd be talking to us about flashpoint whether or not there was a strike
2293984 no one else was in the house and she knew exactly where the watch was when they left
2293985 they are going to steal something they are going to steal something
2293986 how are they the sellers ever going to be out of here in two months
2293987 no doubt a good part of this drop reflects an increase in the number of smaller homes in the sample
2293988 still mean prices also slumped so we think there probably has been a serious drop in prices per square foot
2293989 there was a feeding frenzy that was helped by bankers willing to finance almost anything at any cost sometimes even making illegal loans that were called no docs where they didnt even check credit ratings look at the property or do the usual necessary work before approving a loan
2293990 real estate brokers lawyers and everyone involved were reaping the profits but the cost wouldnt be determined for a few years it was like a train going down the tracks at 100 mph then applying the brakes but the train ran out of track and crashed we were living in a false economy
2293991 the old saying in real estate location location location really does not hold true a more appropriate saying would be timing timing timing in other words when to buy and when to get out
2293992 only tells you theoretically what size mortgage you can handle it doesnt mean the lender will pre approve you for that amount unless you make a formal application to the bank filling out all of their forms and getting your credit checked along with employment and bank accounts to verify balances what pre approval does is to make you a cash buyer in the eyes of the seller you are a better prospect than pre qualified buyers who only have an estimate of the extent they can buy but who have not gone through the necessary paperwork to be pre approved
2293993 remember the old saying one cannot serve two masters this is true here you should be very careful when a broker says he is representing both parties legally he cant be looking out for both parties interests at the same time on the same sale
2293994 no dishes in the sink no crumbs on the kitchen counter no dirty clothes on the floor no one will eat drink sleep or brush the dog again until this house is sold
2293995 have you ever played the question game well there are rules
2293996 rule 1 you ask a question then me then you and so on back and forth
2293997 rule 2 you have to tell the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth like truth or dare but without the dare because i dont know how weird you really are
2293998 rule 3 you cant ask the same question thats already been asked
2293999 rule 4 you have to ask questions that let skeletons out of the closet take advantage of our anonymity
2294000 geez all we really had to talk about was dog food and petting our dogs we didnt really connect on a conversational level plus i made out with him so i know hes going to want more of that but i dont even know this guy it was fun at the time but i just dont feel comfortable with this right now there are a million guys ill meet another hot guy tonight when im out with my girlfriends
2294001 ok im going to spin you around in a circle let me see your hand
2294002 you seem to be very connected with your emotions you seem to really listen to your womans intuition

2294004 you really care about your friends i bet you will make a really good mother
2294005 i notice youre the leader of your friends why is that
2294006 youre a very classy girl what are you doing in a place like this
2294007 wow you seem so confident with your friends like youre kinda the leader of your peer group
2294008 you have such an expressive personality thats a valuable thing in the entertainment industry there are a million women who are beautiful i just came back from florida but how many do you think have an outgoing personality like yourself im telling you thats a very attractive quality and a valuable asset
2294009 it has been an eventful week with a lot of rumors and a lot of things that people come up with and i have no idea where its coming from
2294010 this defines where we are at and i am really excited about the opportunity that these guys gave me six years ago
2294011 we felt like we had a deal a long time ago with tony with a handshake the test was just trying to get it on paper tony is what we consider a franchise player and one of the foundations of the team hes part of the family
2294012 tony gave us our first pole our first win and our first championship and thats the kind of relationship that weve had
2294013 you know like so many families once in a while we have our squabbles sometimes they get pretty loud but i promise you that guy sitting up here theres nobody more motivated in the sport
2294014 theres still a few things to iron out but hes going to be here next year
2294015 now we can concentrate on finishing out this season strong and getting ready for next year
2294016 we thought we should have at least three of the four as championship contenders
2294017 weve been very competitive at almost every racetrack and thats probably the most frustrating thing weve been in the position to win quite a few races but either an incident on the racetrack has taken us out or driver error or in fairness some bad strategy on our part
2294018 i had a little meeting with them after the last race and i think we all are pretty much on the same page
2294019 there is no no 1 driver what has made this team work i think is that there isnt that its the four working together have we had that all year this year no has there had to be some reminders yes
2294020 i saw bodies lying on the streets around ruined buildings in cars
2294021 its impossible to count them now there is hardly a single building left undamaged
2294022 georgian military forces completely control all the territory of south ossetia
2294023 they have sent in their troops and weapons and they are bombing our towns
2294024 in accordance with the constitution and federal law i as president of russia am obliged to protect lives and dignity of russian citizens wherever they are located
2294025 we wont allow the death of our compatriots go unpunished
2294026 im asking you to give me a chance to come back
2294027 ive got some kids here i can save that i can make a difference in their lives
2294028 were just extremely ecstatic that chief washington is going back to his job as he should be
2294029 we thought the whole thing was ridiculous from the beginning and the truth finally came out
2294030 were glad its over and were hopeful the community can heal and move on
2294031 the board has made its decision and i accept it and look forward to repairing the breach
2294032 the district the board the administration has wasted far too much time and too much money on this hearing and i think we need to move forward and keep in mind our purpose to restore academic excellence to our district and our students
2294033 products that claim to be eco friendly but do not list all their ingredients or which use generic terms like anionic surfactant cannot be adequately evaluated for their effect on human health or the environment
2294034 obviously i think thats great for galvestonians because had those two proposals passed i believe it would have been devastating to the citys operations
2294035 hopefully the public got educated on the effects of the things
2294036 i can only speculate but my opinion is that if he had the signatures he would have gone forward with it
2294037 to sit here and not sign it and postpone this is just poor management this is a project that would take thousands of people off the road
2294038 i dont want to take possession of something that looks like this if we have not done our studies to show theres no contamination in it
2294039 if youre going to put dirt in it who cares about stagnant water right now
2294040 but until we have the proper information im not moving forward
2294041 i think were trying to make people who feel theyre on the outside feel like theyre on the inside
2294042 its having someone who has so much in common with me like valuing reading and education and thinking its cool
2294043 as a parent the message that theyre sending is real strong about young people growing up in america as individuals
2294044 only those who take leisurely what the people of the world are busy about can be busy about what the people of the world take leisurely
2294045 time is useful because it is not being used leisure is like unoccupied floor space in a room it is that unoccupied space which makes a room habitable as it is our leisure hours which make our life endurable
2294046 the goal of the buddhist is that he shall not want anything while the goal of the taoist is that he shall not be wanted at all
2294047 how are we to live how shall we enjoy life and who can best enjoy life
2294048 mere relationship between man and woman is not sufficient the relationship must result in babies or it is incomplete
2294049 woman reaches her noblest status only as a mother and that wife who by choice refuses to become a mother loses a great part of her dignity and stands in danger of becoming a plaything
2294050 a natural man loves his children but a cultured man loves his parents
2294051 the art of attaining happiness consists in keeping your pleasures mild
2294052 it is against the will of god to eat delicate food hastily to pass gorgeous views hurriedly to express deep sentiments superficially to pass a beautiful day steeped on food and drink and to enjoy your wealth steeped in luxuries
2294053 the man who has not the habit of reading is imprisoned in his immediate world the reader is always carried away into a world of thought and reflection
2294054 a writing is always better when it is ones own and a woman is always lovelier when she is somebody elses wife
2294055 he who is afraid to use an i in his writing will never make a good writer
2294056 anyone who reads a book with a sense of obligation does not understand the art of reading to be thoroughly enjoyed reading must be entirely spontaneous you can leave the books that you dont like alone and let other people read them
2294057 those who are wise wont be busy and those who are too busy cant be wise

2294165 we were dismayed that the state supreme court put off the decision on marriage equality to the legislature where the political pressure could result in the passage of a civil unions law instead of real marriage equality
2294166 we needed to find a way to demonstrate to our legislators that full marriage rights for all couples are the only way to go
2294167 weve seen legal constructs like civil unions fail in the past giving the appearance of equality but not the reality

2294188 i must thank luciano spalletti in particular because he believed in me and gave me a chance to show my worth it wasnt easy for me to settle in italy and having a coach like spalletti was fundamental

2294209 i dont think the presidents strategy is going to work we went through two weeks of hearings on the senate foreign relations committee experts from across the spectrum military and civilian conservative and liberal expressed great skepticism about it my suggestion to the president has been that the only way were going to change the dynamic in iraq and start seeing political commendation is actually if we created a system of phased redeployment and frankly the president i think has not been willing to consider that option not because its not militarily sound but because he continues to cling to the belief that somehow military solutions are going to lead to victory in iraq
2294210 it is critical our community be an integral and active part of the debate because african americans are disproportionately impacted by the effects of climate change economically socially and through our health and well being
2294211 though far less responsible for climate change african americans are significantly more vulnerable to its effects than non hispanic whites
2294212 health housing economic well being culture and social stability are harmed from such manifestations of climate change as storms floods and climate variability
2294213 african americans are also more vulnerable to higher energy bills unemployment recessions caused by global energy price shocks and a greater economic burden from military operations designed to protect the flow of oil to the u s
2294214 the flooding of new orleans still highlights the vulnerability of the african american community to types of extreme weather events expected with global climate change

2294230 when arks are built lives are saved when soldiers march jerichos tumble when staffs are raised seas still open when a lunch is shared thousands are fed and when a garmet is touched whether by the hand of an anemic woman in galilee or by the prayers of a beggar in bangladesh jesus stops he stops and responds
2294231 insanity is continuing to do the things youve always done and expecting different results
2294232 cannot be resolved by the same type of thinking that created those problems in the first place
2294233 if you do not allow god to change the way people do church you will miss out on what god wants to do
2294234 i liked you until i found out what you were like

2294241 virtually every time i rent from them they are doing something special for me once i rented a 15 passenger van to drive people and supplies to the gulf coast on a hurricane relief project i think they discounted my rate by at least 50 i didnt ask that they do it they just recognized the importance of the trip and wanted to help out and the woman who handled it didnt have to go check with her manager she just did it that kind of freedom makes them more likely to serve the customers best interest which ultimately results in the companys

2294255 bast rk bleibt zuhause da er leichte probleme in der wade hat
2294256 dass es f r uns keinen grund gibt den fc hansa auf die leichte schulter zu nehmen wir haben nur ein ziel und das hei t weiterkommen und die n chste runde erreichen
2294257 ich konnte dem bundestrainer keine garantie mehr geben dass ich ber das eine jahr hinaus f r das ich beim vfb stuttgart einen vertrag habe noch fu ball spielen werde insofern habe ich ihm und andreas k pke vorgeschlagen dass sie f r die deutsche nationalmannschaft nicht mehr mit mir planen
2294258 wir haben in der beurteilung der situation absolut auf einer wellenl nge gelegen ich habe mich bei jens f r gro artige leistungen in der nationalmannschaft bedankt sicher wird unser erfolg bei der wm 2006 dank des elfmeterschie ens gegen argentinien immer eng mit seinem namen verbunden bleiben aber auch bei der euro 2008 hatte er einen genauso gro en anteil an unserem erfolg
2294259 ich habe bisher nur wenige spieler kennengelernt die so positiv und pr gnant ihre erfahrung eingebracht haben um gemeinsam alles f r den erfolg zu geben
2294260 die nummer eins f r dein land zu sein das ist doch das gr te was ein spieler erreichen kann es w re die best tigung meiner arbeit der letzten zwei jahre
2294261 es ist toll wie er als torwart mitspielt und ein spiel lesen kann er verk rpert den modernen torh ter von heute
2294262 die ganzen umst nde geben mir ein gutes gef hl ich glaube man steht mir beim dfb sehr positiv gegen ber
2294263 der bundestrainer hat mich bei em zur nummer zwei gemacht auch wenn das einige nicht zu interessieren scheint und sie lieber andere ins gepr ch bringen
2294264 fr her hat sich das meist wie von selbst ergeben k pke nach illgner kahn nach k pke lehmann nach kahn diesmal gibt es keine so eindeutige nummer 2 deshalb w rden wir falls die situation eintreten sollte erst einmal die leistungen beobachten es muss nicht sofort eine absolute festlegung auf die nummmer 1 stattfinden
2294265 the attention ive gotten since ive been here has been overwhelming the bottom line as we all know is to win games thats what im here to do
2294266 i cannot tell you where the tree is going to be for obvious reasons because itll be stripped bare in about 30 seconds
2294267 if you had picked a number higher you wouldve gotten more money on your metrocard
2294268 let me warn you that when you get on and off the train during rush hours just be sure to follow your blockers
2294269 you win the super bowl and i promise you will get a key
2294270 the future is now i dont have 17 more years to play i dont think i want to give the new york jets and the people of this city the best year possible believe me
2294271 to a certain degree i dont know what im getting into
2294272 hopefully i can bring as much excitement throughout the year as weve had the last two or three days
2294273 i tried to simplify my approach and shortened my swing
2294274 you have to look for specific pitches and locations and i was sitting on it and got lucky
2294275 it was a good piece of hitting he stuck his bat out there and got a hold of it im pretty upset i helped their bullpen get a win i have to go out there and be better than that
2294276 this result is momentous it is a clear message to gordon brown and the labour party that our residents have had enough mehfuz ahmed will make an excellent councillor he embodies the positive spirit of the conservative party and our campaign in westminster north we work for the right to represent our constituents people are realising that if they want to improve their lives it is the conservative party that will provide the opportunities to do so
2294277 many people who have never voted conservative before have put their faith in me
2294278 it was a great privilege to welcome baroness warsi to westminster north
2294279 this constituency is home to an extremely diverse population with over 100 languages spoken in our schools
2294280 there are a number of organisations in westminster north that offer inclusive community led programmes and that provide positive opportunities for people of all ethnicities
2294281 programmes such as these transcend traditional cultural barriers and encourage genuine social interaction between different communities i look forward to working with baroness warsi in the coming months and years to ensure that they are given the support they deserve
2294282 in areas with high levels of ethnic diversity and high population turnovers such as westminster north cohesion within the community is vital because it helps to reduce crime and anti social behaviour and drives social mobility upwards
2294283 under this government there is a worrying trend that young people appear to be integrating less well than their parents and if this trend continues we could end up with a country more divided and segregated than ever before
2294284 it is encouraging to see social action projects in westminster north helping to develop greater levels of cultural understanding amongst local residents
2294285 in my opinion everybody should be a toff because everyone in the country should have the benefit of a decent education
2294286 ken livingstone has criticised the media for focusing on these events he is wrong
2294287 there have been two stabbings in this constituency and one young boy has lost his life during the last three weeks the more press coverage the better this issue has to be kept at the top of the political agenda
2294288 some children carry a knife as a status symbol to impress their friends others believe it provides them with protection very few intend to use it practically none of these teenagers will be aware that they are much more likely to be stabbed by their own knife than by someone elses
2294289 it is the job of the mayor to lead the fight back against violent crime every londoner has the right to walk our streets to use our public transport and to enjoy our green spaces in confidence and without fear of attack
2294290 electing boris johnson as the mayor of london on may 1st will be a massive step in the right direction
2294291 after 10 years in government and 8 years with ken livingstone as mayor with two weeks to go until londons elections labour have failed to address the serious issue of knife crime
2294292 gun and knife crime has been blighting londons streets and we need fresh ideas to rid our communities of these weapons
2294293 our current labour leaders seem to be in a state of despair and labours lack of action on this issue in london has led to families unnecessarily losing loved ones all londoners have the chance on may 1st to vote for a change to help make their streets safer
2294294 boris understands the gravity of the situation that we are facing in london and his policies reflect that a lot can be achieved by focusing on the smaller issues such as anti social behaviour on buses
2294295 based on what i have seen happening the community could be successful in establishing its identity if there is some regular communication flowing from the top for ex a monthly summary
2294296 when in your life have you felt the most joyful and the most energized by work
2294297 the program has been under wraps for six months but with the attention to mobile device security new mobile devices and considering how companies are trying to save money on energy lately we felt it was time to announce the initiative
2294298 companies need to ask will it be productive does it really add value to our bottom line
2294299 what was happening in my world was not important to her
2294300 a person or organization will excel only by amplifying strengths never by simply fixing weaknesses
2294301 just a few words about time management forget it in the strictest sense you shouldnt be trying to do more in each day trying to fill every second with a work fidget of some type
2294302 since we have 8 hours to fill we fill 8 hours if we had 15 we would fill 15
2294303 parkinsons law dictates that a task will swell in importance and complexity in accordance with the time allotted for its completion
2294304 a sua maria andava ali com um c o vadio
2294305 he may have felt that the best was behind him
2294306 there was little of the idler and nothing of the sponge or the chiseler in fitzgerald who reserved his deepest respect for the self made man
2294307 never knew hardship but rather the shabby gentility that has spurred so many of the great strivers and adventurers in history
2294308 over the din of a night club scott would start talking literature and suddenly one realized that behind his collegiate facade was someone finer and quieter someone very much harassed by a gift sensitive as a young leaf he trembled to all his surroundings he registered every emotion noticed every change of manners and put it in his fiction which he wrote almost like journalism with a dash of poetry added thus he recorded the age he was helping to form and his work and his play became hopelessly intertwined
2294309 was notoriously resistant to any sort of innovation in firearms
2294310 for all of richard jordan gatlings cool headed technical finesse and businessmans brio he actually came up with his gun he claimed for the most tender hearted of reasons as a way of saving lives it occurred to me he wrote to a friend in 1877 that if i could invent a machine a gun which could by rapidity of fire enable one man to do as much battle duty as a hundred that it would to a great extent supersede the necessity of large armies and consequently exposure to battle and disease be greatly diminished as disingenuous and self serving as that sentiment sounds it ended up being quite correct innovations in arms steadily reduced the relative lethality of battles not to mention the cost of waging war throughout the twentieth century
2294311 men women and children were like stalks of wheat beneath a scythe
2294312 the gatling gun is a weapon of death but its story is not altogether grim for it is also the story of a nation on the rise and of a man who by inventing a new kind of machine helped propel it in that upward trajectory it is the story of a country just at the moment when its destiny begins to stir and of an individual whose career was hitched to that amazing creative and economic boom it is the story of one genius who helped push america to the top a man of decency and vision and ambition a man who held dozens of patents for a variety of life enhancing gadgets but who died disillusioned his name attached in the popular mind not to plows or bicycles or flush toilets or dry cleaning machines all of which he improved but to a gun a utilitarian device whose use came down to a chilling simplicity death
2294313 was no crackpot eccentric but a respected and socially connected businessman married to the daughter of a prominent indianapolis physician
2294314 difficult to reconcile the man who created the gatling gun with the loyal husband and gentle father to reconcile the canny competitive arms merchant with the decent peace loving citizen
2294315 a new variety of plow a cotton cultivator a washer to tighten gears more effectively
2294316 nine patents for agricultural implements his inventions include a hemp brake a rotary plow a lath making machine a gearing machine and a steam driven marine ram
2294317 fed by a gravity driven hopper the seeds dropped one by one into the furrow gatling couldnt get that process out of his mind its rotating simplicity its smooth mechanical perfection
2294318 gatling had everything he needed the basic mechanical design embodied in his seed planter the moral imperative supplied by the memory of the dead and ailing soldiers as they arrived at the indianapolis train station and the commercial impulse which arose as a possibly awkward but completely predictable consequence of the realization that this might well be a drawn out expensive affair it might last years not months despite all the breezy hypothesizing at the outset and long wars meant large profits for gunmakers
2294319 for a thousand dollars apiece with his own money after the ordnance department had turned down his request for funds
2294320 the only place in which a gatling gun was destined to make an appreciable difference during the civil war wasnt on a battlefield at all it didnt come in the midst of a struggle between competing armies and it would set the tone for the weapons dark reputation later in the century for its grim identification with the forces of oppression and exploitation
2294321 the story foretells the way gatlings guns would be deployed after the war as menacing symbols as icons of sheer destructive ferocity even if they just sat there
2294322 gatling guns were purchased by police departments state militias and factory owners
2294323 tools of domination and intimidation both at home and abroad
2294324 gatling guns became the weapon of choice for british forces determined to enforce colonial rule in africa
2294325 no no no his head was too full of all the things he wanted to build things he thought he could sell thereby building a great fortune he was a restless young man he was brimming with energy and purpose and hope he had caught his countrys peculiar fever there was no cure
2294326 richard gatling and his brothers had followed different rivers as they moved beyond their youth into the world at large but everything eventually would come back to one river the river of the past and it ran as it always does from darkness into light and then into darkness again
2294327 they are the baptists they think they are the only ones here
2294328 when youve had everything taken away and you cannot change things by your own means you are left with little else except to wait upon god
2294329 natural selection is a cumulative process which breaks the problem of improbability up into small pieces each of the small pieces is slightly improbable but not prohibitively so when large numbers of these slightly improbably events are stacked up in a series the end product of the accumulation is very very improbable indeed improbable enough to be far from the reach of chance
2294330 i think human beings are biologically inclined to gravity towards beliefs that sound true permanent and absolute
2294331 do you know the latin proverb mundus vult decipi ergo decepiatur herr hitlers favorite saying the world wants to be deceived therefore let it be deceived and he isnt wrong newspapers on the continent explain every day why there wont be war and i assure you there will be unless the right people determine to stop it
2294332 maybe changed their minds maybe it wasnt where they wanted it maybe theres another one a few hundred yards north who can say but thats the likely explanation or if you wanted to think another way an army thats going to attack with a tank force will get rid of the static defenses between them and the enemy border because then theyre in the way merciers technical description barely suggested what he feared this was nothing less than preparation for war a classic telltale sign of planned aggression the journalists could wring their hands from morning edition to night war is coming war is coming but what hed found in the darkness wasnt opinion it was an abandoned tank trap defense put aside and what came next was offense attack houses burning in the night
2294333 an ordinary looking man who led a rather ordinary life a more than decent life in the small city of breslau a wife and three children a good job as a senior engineer at an ironworks and foundry a subcontractor to the giant rheinmetall firm in d sseldorf
2294334 a half czech half german woman of uncertain age who two years earlier had fled the fulminous nazi politics of the sudetenland and settled in warsaw
2294335 had turned a desk job into something very much like a fight so to walk away now would be to walk away from a fight he had never done that and he never would
2294336 was famously the intellectual of the conseil sup rieur de la guerre the high committee of military strategy and was said to be one of the most powerful men in france though precisely what he did and how he did it remained almost entirely in shadow
2294337 the germans are building tanks i was watching them until i lost an agent and theyre planning maneuvers in schramberg in the black forest they are i believe thinking hard about the ardennes forest in belgium where the maginot line ends
2294338 too bad about the poles but theyve got to be made to understand we arent coming to help them no matter what the treaties say we might be able to if de gaulle and his allies had their way but they wont get it french military doctrine is in the hands of marshall p tain de gaulles enemy and he wont let go
2294339 animals existed to provide humans with food clothing implements labor and in the case of science knowledge
2294340 the belief most influentially articulated by aristotle that animals possess very low forms of intelligence at best and are incapable of higher reason
2294341 she was dissenting not only from the philosophical and theological traditions known to the educated elite but also from the beliefs of most ordinary people who were utterly unaware of the intellectual arguments and even the scriptural authority that underlay or justified their attitudes and behavior most people simply used and abused animals as labor food and sport because that was what people had always done one did not have to be a conscious cartesian to believe that sympathy for an animals suffering when we injure it was nearly as preposterous as concern for a trees pain when we prune its limbs
2294342 passion for animal baiting bullrunning cockfighting and dogfighting cockthrowing and human prizefighting earned the british a reputation for cruelty among europeans
2294343 by means of the anthropocentric argument that animals existed to serve the greater good of humans
2294344 like other animal performers to be found at fairs inns and street corners displayed such a remarkable ability to dance bow calculate sums and read that they seemed to call into question on a popular level the position challenged by margaret cavendish on a philosophical level the assertion that animals are incapable of knowledge sense reason or intelligence
2294345 these animal performances contributed to an emerging sense of kinship and identification with beasts
2294346 what had changed in the eighteenth century was the scale on which pets firmly established themselves in the homes of the middle and working classes throughout town and country and the intensity of the bonds people were forging with these animals in their homes probably no other development in the history of humans relationship with beasts had such a profoundly positive impact upon the status of animals as did the spread of pet keeping as more and more people of all social classes shared their lives with pets those lucky creatures whose most important role was to provide companionship rather than labor or food it became increasingly difficult to think of animals as soulless machines or irrational bundles of appetites
2294347 the worlds first animal protection law passed by a national legislature
2294348 genuinely believed in extending christian charity to beasts for their own sake
2294349 was imbued not only with loyalty to his people and with the physical courage to duel over an affront but also with the passion to fight in the public and political arena for a just cause
2294350 capacity for compromise and moderation and an ability to work with others
2294351 martin clearly enjoyed playing into english stereotypes about hot tempered irish squires who settled problems with fisticuffs if not with duels actually his speeches in parliament often displayed a well informed mind political independence from both the government and the opposition and a principled adherence to the measures he considered best for the irish people particularly its catholics he was quite capable of thinking and acting strategically on behalf of his causes but many of his colleagues tended to view martin as a jokester even a buffoon an impression he seemed to encourage he often acted the wag cultivating his reputation for eccentricity making speeches so witty that his colleagues were convulsed in laughter though it also inclined them to underestimate him
2294352 the horrific plight of the countrys work animals and of animals in slaughterhouses was relentlessly on display in urban centers
2294353 one of the greatest pieces of oratory ever delivered on behalf of animals
2294354 to bulls dogs and any other cattle or domestic animal
2294355 animals possessed of no voice to speak for themselves have always depended on the kindness of humans and too often that kindness has been woefully lacking but as shevelow shows in
2294356 i consider him a fundamentally decent person and i do not believe he or his white house deliberately or consciously sought to deceive the american people
2294357 defining moment in my time working for the president and one of the most painful experiences of my life
2294358 and five of the highest ranking officials in the administration were involved in my doing so rove libby vice president cheney the presidents chief of staff andrew card and the president himself
2294359 constrained by my duties and loyalty to the president and unable to comment but i promised reporters and the public that i would someday tell the whole story of what i knew
2294360 ive written it not to settle scores or enhance my own role
2294361 but simply to record what i know and what i learned
2294362 but the behavior of the president and his key advisers was even more disappointing
2294363 a man of personal charm wit and enormous political skill
2294364 how can that be how can someone simply not remember whether or not they used an illegal substance like cocaine
2294365 the first time when i felt i was witnessing bush convincing himself to believe something that probably was not true and that deep down he knew was not true in the years to come as i worked closely with president bush i would come to believe that sometimes he convinces himself to believe what suits his needs at the moment
2294366 in light of not finding the weapons of mass destruction do you believe the war in iraq is a war of choice or a war of necessity
2294367 her breath coming in shallow gasps her skin turning blue
2294368 so arduous had been the delivery so close had the mother and baby come to dying that the doctor cautioned sara to have no more children
2294369 conditioned him to assume that a female presence in his life was there to serve and adore him
2294370 to whom he was the sun and they were his planets
2294371 that a young man of such gifts an adonis who could have easily won the hand of any number of more beautiful women decided to choose eleanor is either evidence of a then unsuspected depth in him or of the inexplicable choices of the human heart or both
2294372 had been starved for affection warmth above all intimacy with a soul mate were not to be found in franklin
2294373 between trips to hyde park and campobello eleanor was often absent while lucy continued to report to the roosevelt house on n street
2294374 what do a thirty five year old man who has sired six children and a twenty six year old woman who is madly in love with him do when by chance or design they find themselves alone
2294375 him to consider the effects of divorce on their children
2294376 she would cut him off without a cent and forfeit his right to inherit the estate
2294377 freedom at a high price or living on in the comfortable prison of convention
2294378 there was never a complete break between franklin and lucy
2294379 anna proved smart and competent as she willingly took on missy like tasks helping fdr serve at the cocktail hour arranging the seating for dinners dealing with callers for whom the president had no time
2294380 letting his hair grow long growing a beard dressing onstage in blue jeans tennis shoes and t shirts with a bandanna around his neck or head
2294381 was not to be trifled with when he was drinking demonstrating a proclivity to punch holes in walls in doors and windows
2294382 his eye couldnt help wandering especially when he was rambling on the road
2294383 he always said he was going to be a songwriter and a country music singer
2294384 you knew he was special you just didnt know what kind of special
2294385 possessed an innate understanding of a great country song keep it short keep it simple enough to work within the box that producers provide and make it tug at the heart
2294386 initial euphoria was soon dampened by indications admittedly in rather obscure places that the new world of peace and democracy would face some teething problems
2294387 the collapse of the communist superpower the soviet union is the single most important event prompting the exponential growth of organized crime around the world in the last two decades almost overnight it provoked a chaotic scramble for riches and survival that saw virtually every citizen sucked into a vortex of violence from the bitter wars of the caucasus to the shoot outs in towns and cities this was a deadly environment as a new class of capitalists exploited the vacuum of power by seizing whole industries and raiding the state coffers accompanied by an orgy of consumption and decadent behavior last witnessed a century ago under czar nicholas even such mighty organizations as the kgb and the red army became quickly embroiled in this spectacular nightmare the transformation traveled well beyond the soviet unions borders into all continents of the world as money poured out of the country looking for safe havens some legal but most decidedly dodgy throbbing at the heart of these extraordinary events was moscow
2294388 now accounts for between 15 and 20 percent of global turnover
2294389 criminal corporations aspire to penetrate markets the world over mirroring the global goals of legal entities such as mcdonalds
2294390 every month thousands of cars are stolen from the streets of northern europe in preparation for their illegal export to eastern europe and the balkans
2294391 he took his soviet military experience and used that to build a very lucrative business operation
2294392 counterfeit dvds for less than a dollar apiece all for the purposes of research of course
2294393 the political criminal nexus pcn a profoundly corrupt relationship between the local criminal tycoons and party leaders
2294394 those who positioned themselves well in the first three years after the end of communism were often in a position to make up the rules of their brave new world as they went along
2294395 in the late 1980s the west began to liberalize its financial markets
2294396 it was here in the huge reservoirs of the international banking system that the liquid assets of the corporate and criminal worlds mixed and mingled very quickly it became impossible to separate the two while crime groups big and small took full advantage of the globalization of finance they were not required to explain their actions before an antitrust commission nor did they have to abide by the rules of the world trade organization and its predecessor
2294397 money was being shifted about with an unimagined ease and nobody was keeping track of it
2294398 if we fail to construct an adequate regulatory mechanism that is some form of global governance then organized crime and corruption will combine with protectionism and chauvinism to engender a very unstable and very dangerous world
2294399 as such stodgy figures that it becomes impossible to think of them as young men who had fun playing the game
2294400 burdening a childs game with an adults seriousness of purpose
2294401 at heart the knickerbockers were just young men who gained the same pleasure from ball playing as any other generation this was equally true of the generation of young men who succeeded them and turned baseball into americas national pastime it was genuinely an innocent age for baseball and only by understanding this forgotten element can we appreciate how baseball has come to mean so much to americans
2294402 so great was the prejudice of the public against the game at that time that the players were frequently reproved and censured by their friends for degrading themselves by indulging in such a childish amusement and this prejudice prevailed to a great extent for many years
2294403 has been a game all over the land from immemorial time but it was until recently considered undignified for men to play it except on rare holidays and then they were wont to play on some out lying common where they would be unseen of their more staid associates
2294404 the one that abolished soaking and the one that designated a foul as a do over
2294405 made baseball ready for a nation transformed during the 1850s and 1860s by a series of breakthroughs in communication transportation and technology that changed how and where americans lived
2294406 would cause so many americans to willingly abandon a familiar way of playing ball in favor of a method preferred by faraway new yorkers
2294407 having one standard version of playing baseball made it far easier to arrange competitions between clubs
2294408 could not be hit very far making the game revolve around running and chasing
2294409 we used the lively ball and when it left the bat after being hit square it came at one as though shot from a cannon a good batsman could drive the ball almost to kingdom come
2294410 almost every town had its legendary stories of long ball hitters
2294411 struck a ball considerable over the vane of park street church 225 feet up
2294412 sent the ball to the face of the clock on the congregational church the following sunday the choir remained later than usual at rehearsal and at 1 oclock the clock struck thirty seven times the boy had to quit using those bats for fear of pitchers becoming cross eyed dodging between the ball and the broken end of the bat
2294413 the grave sedate dignified president of the college was an habitu of the ball ground and it is reported that he would become so enthused at times that he would rise in his carriage and wave his silk hat in a very dignified manner of course to cheer the boys
2294414 were accorded the utmost courtesy by the players they were given easy chairs placed near the home plate provided with fans on hot days and their absolute comfort was uppermost in the minds of the players after each of our games in the early 60s sandwiches beer cakes and other refreshments were served by the home team the umpire always received the choicest bits of food and the largest glass of beer in case he cared for such beverage if he didnt he needed but to express his desires in the thirst quenching line before the game started and he got it
2294415 soldiers learned the knickerbockers version and brought it back home with them spurring the great boom of 1866 and 1867
2294416 historic tour was a great boon to the spread of enthusiasm for the game

2294426 why we drive the way we do and what it says about us
2294427 myself included seem to take driving a car fairly lightly perhaps holding on to some simple myths of independence and power but it is actually an incredibly complex and demanding task
2294428 why youre not as good a driver as you think you are
2294429 for those of us who are not brain surgeons driving is probably the most complex everyday thing we do it is a skill that consists of at least fifteen hundred subskills at any moment we are navigating through terrain scanning our environment for hazards and information maintaining our position on the road judging speed making decisions about twenty per mile one study found evaluating risk adjusting instruments anticipating the future actions of others even as we may be sipping a latte thinking about last nights episode of american idol quieting a toddler or checking voice mail a survey of one stretch of road in maryland found that a piece of information was presented every two feet which at 30 miles per hour the study reasoned meant the driver was exposed to 1 320 items of information or roughly 440 words per minute this is akin to reading three paragraphs like this one while also looking at lots of pretty pictures not to mention doing all the other things mentioned above and then repeating the cycle every minute you drive
2294430 a simple mantra you can carry about with you in traffic
2294431 when a situation feels dangerous to you its probably more safe than you know when a situation feels safe that is precisely when you should feel on guard most crashes after all happen on dry roads on clear sunny days to sober drivers
2294432 a climbing twisting broken asphalt nightmare of blind hairpin turns
2294433 there was little to keep me from tumbling off the edge of the road
2294434 a smooth flat road with gentle curves and plenty of visibility
2294435 i just about fell asleep and ran off the road
2294436 the things that work best in the traffic world of the highway consistency uniformity wide lanes knowing what to expect ahead of time the reduction of conflicts the restriction of access and the removal of obstacles have little or no place in the social world
2294437 anonymity in traffic acts as a powerful drug with several curious side effects on the one hand because we feel that no one is watching or that no one we know will see us the inside of the car itself becomes a useful place for self expression the flip side of anonymity is that it encourages aggression
2294438 as the inner life of the driver begins to come into focus it is becoming clear not only that distraction is the single biggest problem on the road but that we have little concept of just how distracted we are
2294439 drive as if the world is a television show viewed on tivo that can be paused in real time one can duck out for a moment grab a beer from the fridge and come back to right where they left off without missing a beat
2294440 as a profession traffic engineering has historically tended to treat pedestrians like little bits of irritating sand gumming up the works of their smoothly humming traffic machines with a touch of condescending pity pedestrians are referred to as vulnerable road users as a testament to the inherent bias of the profession no engineer has ever written a paper about how vehicular interference disrupts the saturation flow rates of people trying to cross the street
2294441 how traffic explains the world on driving with a local accent
2294442 traffic is a sort of secret window onto the inner heart of a place a form of cultural expression as vital as language dress or music its the reason a horn in rome does not mean the same thing as a horn in stockholm why flashing your headlights at another driver is understood one way on the german autobahn and quite another way on the 405 in los angeles why people jaywalk constantly in new york and hardly at all in copenhagen these are the impressions that stick with us greek drivers are crazy the visitor to athens will observe safely back in kabul
2294443 more people were killed in the united states on saturday and sunday from midnight to three a m than all those who were killed from midnight to three a m the rest of the week
2294444 statistically the most dangerous day to be on the road
2294445 nearly twenty times more beer is drunk in total on super bowl sunday than on an average day
2294446 car drivers have less to fear from big trucks than from what they themselves do around big trucks
2294447 are high heavy and have very stiff front ends meaning other vehicles have to absorb more energy in a crash

2294497 as economic modernizers as supporters of strong national government and as humanitarians more receptive than their democratic rivals to talent regardless of race or gender the whigs deserve to be remembered they facilitated the transformation of the united states from a collection of parochial agricultural communities into a cosmopolitan nation integrated by commerce industry information and voluntary associations as well as by political ties from the vantage point of the twenty first century we can see that the whigs though not the dominant party of their own time were the party of americas future

2294502 the most bloody conflicts derived from the domination and exploitation of the north american continent by the white people of the united states and their government if a primary driving force can be identified in american history for this period this was it as its most ardent exponents the jacksonian democrats conceived it this imperialist program included the preservation and extension of african american slavery as well as the expropriation of native americans and mexicans the remarkable changes in transportation and communications facilitated it determination to seize more land provoked harsh expulsions of populations wars both large and small and argument between pro and anti imperialists above all westward expansion rendered inescapable the issue that would tear the country asunder a dozen years later whether to expand slavery

2294512 the army was using a byzantine quota system that capped its share of black manpower at between 9 and 10 percent but the army couldnt even hit that modest target due to a shortage of segregated training facilities
2294513 the war department prized the principle of segregation over the efficient use of talent
2294514 african american college graduates were often lumped into battalions alongside illiterates
2294515 though outwardly committed to quelling racism the army allowed many of its training camps to be run like antebellum plantations rather than learning how best to kill or outwit nazis black draftees instead found themselves peeling potatoes and scrubbing toilets they were housed in the shabbiest barracks and fed cold or putrid food scraps deemed unfit for white consumption anyone who dared complain or protested their lot with a wisecrack was quickly punished either tossed in jail or slapped around

2294529 the captain gave the order to fire and fourteen machine guns answered at once but it all seemed like a farce it was as if the machine guns had been loaded with caps because their panting rattle could be heard and their incandescent spitting could be seen but not the slightest reaction was perceived not a cry not even a sigh among the compact crowd that seemed petrified by an instantaneous invulnerability suddenly on one side of the station a cry of death tore open the enchantment aaaagh mother they were penned in swirling about in a gigantic whirlwind that little by little was being reduced to its epicenter as the edges were systematically being cut off all around like an onion being peeled by the insatiable and methodical shears of the machine guns
2294530 with precise and convincing details how the army had machine gunned more than three thousand workers penned up by the station and how they loaded the bodies into a two hundred car train and threw them into the sea
2294531 set the template for capitalism the first of the modern multi nationals
2294532 started with a few bananas grown at the side of a railway line and became a global power
2294533 was greedy and controlled millions of acres of land only a relatively small part of which it used in countries of many landless small farmers it kept the rest to keep out competitors and for a rainy day in and around its plantations it had fifteen hundred miles of railways a good number of which its host countries built and paid for

2294538 the greater danger lies in devaluing the actual football games if they become simply part of a larger spectacle or a multipronged marketing campaign
2294539 live and let live philosophy in defiance of tradition and the establishment
2294540 i always understood that players drew the fans who made the owners rich that the players not the owners risked crippling injury on every play only to become crippled in middle age anyway even if they managed to avoid major injuries readers may occasionally find a former players bias in the chapters that follow
2294541 footballs power from its beginnings derived from the players appearing larger than life and meeting physical demands that seemed heroic in contrast to ordinary human experiences
2294542 those who respond to its fundamental nature will remain fans no matter what the packaging while those who respond to the packaging may be briefly attracted but will not become real fans
2294543 football makes little sense according to the rules we learn to live by in our modern world that is why it appeals so powerfully not just to working stiffs wearing dog masks and barking in the end zone seats in cleveland but also to tv executives and ceos in luxury suites football ultimately is what it is and what its fans make of it no matter what efforts go into the packaging it is deeply ironic that the nfl has become a financial colossus but can no longer afford to trust footballs power the league needs those 80 or 90 million casual fans on top of its passionate 40 million to feed the money machine it has created yet without that inherent power all the marketing in the world would be pointless
2294544 we no longer live in a heroic age our values have changed yet football itself is an expression of a longing to recover the heroic
2294545 the spain was a famous rarity a lavishly illuminated hebrew manuscript made at a time when jewish belief was firmly against illustrations of any kind it was thought that the commandment in exodus thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image or likeness of any thing had suppressed figurative art by medieval jews when the book came to light in sarajevo in 1894 its pages of painted miniatures had turned this idea on its head and caused art history texts to be rewritten

2294548 i just love to move the ball forward even if its only a millimeter in the great human quest to figure it all out
2294549 my work has to do with objects not people i like matter fiber the nature of the varied stuffs that go to make a book i know the flesh and fabrics of pages the bright earths and lethal toxins of ancient pigments wheat paste i can bore the pants off anyone about wheat paste of course a book is more than the sum of its materials it is an artifact of the human mind and hand the gold beaters the stone grinders the scribes the binders those are the people i feel most comfortable with sometimes in the quiet these people speak to me they let me see what their intentions were and it helps me do my work
2294550 this book had probably been rebound many times in its long life
2294551 in simple cardboard covers with an inappropriate turkish printed floral decoration now faded and discolored
2294552 there probably werent ten people in the world who could have told for sure that id taken this book apart and put it back together
2294553 ive written too many papers knocking that approach to restore a book to the way it was when it was made is to lack respect for its history i think you have to accept a book as you receive it from past generations and to a certain extent damage and wear reflect that history the way i see it my job is to make it stable enough to allow safe handling and study repairing only where absolutely necessary
2294554 clearly a spectacular human being brave and intelligent and all the rest of it
2294555 well from what youve told me the book has survived the same human disaster over and over again think about it youve got a society where people tolerate difference like spain in the convivencia and everythings humming along creative prosperous then somehow this fear this hate this need to demonize the other it just sort of rears up and smashes the whole society inquisition nazis extremist serb nationalists same old same old it seems to me the book at this point bears witness to all that
2294556 how is your latest tatty little book anyway fixed all the dog eared pages
2294557 american emancipation was always a complex interplay between at least four factors the geographical course of the war the size of the slave population in any given region the policies enforced at any given time by the union and confederate governments through their military forces and the volition of slaves themselves in seizing their moments to embrace a reasonable chance for freedom turnages and washingtons narratives throw into bold relief and confirm the significance of each of these factors to the perennial question who freed the slaves lincoln or blacks themselves the turnage and washington stories answer conclusively that it was both without the union armies and navies neither man would have achieved freedom when he did but they never would have gained their freedom without their own courageous initiative either
2294558 two extraordinary unpublished and probably unmediated narratives about one of the most revolutionary transitions in american history
2294559 both turnage and washington considered themselves quite ordinary they sought no fame for their courageous escapes washington became a house painter and turnage a night watchman among other occupations each would live well into the twentieth century and forge a working class family that struggled against the barriers of class and racial discrimination in teeming american cities yet they possessed the will to write to make their stories of liberation known to find readers and garner recognition even if only within their families as men who had conquered their condition as slaves remade themselves as free people and left a mark on time as best they could they wanted someone to know they were veterans of the great struggle between north and south quiet heroes of a war within the war to destroy slavery that americans were beginning to forget
2294560 wallace turnages apology for his book my book is a sketch of my life or adventures and persecutions which i went through from 1860 to 1865 i do not mean to speak disparagingly of those who sold me nor of those who bought me though i seen a hard time it had an attendency to make a man of me i will also beg my reader to excuse my ungrammatical and desultory biography because my kind reader can see that i have been deprived of an education and what knowledge i have to present this biography to you i learnt during that time and since i escapted the clutches of those who held me in slavery
2294561 counted the height of impertinence of a slave in the south
2294562 before morning i had began to fee like i had truly escaped from the hands of the slaves master and with the help of god i never would be a slave no more i felt for the first time in my life that i could now claim every cent that i should work for as my own i began now to feel that life had a new joy awaiting me i might now come and go when i pleased
2294563 the next morning i was up early and took a look at the rebels country with a thankful heart to think that i had made my escape with safety after such a long struggle and had obtained that freedom which i desired so long i now dreaded the gun and handcuffs and pistols no more nor the blewing of horns and the running of hounds nor the threats of death from the rebels authority i could now speak my opinion to men of all grades and colors and no one to question my right to speak
2294564 a recent study of runaway slaves in the antebellum south found that slaveholders advertisements often described a slave as proud artful cunning
2294565 an unrelenting polarization that has divided washington and the country into hostile even irreconcilable camps
2294566 partisan rivalry most often has been a source of energy innovation and inspiration
2294567 is that the political system is more polarized than the country rather than reducing the level of conflict washington increases it that tendency not the breadth of the underlying divisions itself is the defining characteristic of our era and the principal cause of our impasse on so many problems
2294568 the longest sustained period of bipartisan negotiation in american history
2294569 our own period of hyperpartisanship an era that may be said to have fully arrived when the republican controlled bill clinton in december 1998
2294570 harkened back to the intensely partisan strategies of mckinley and his successors
2294571 yet many conservatives recognized in bush a kindred soul not only in ideology but more importantly in temperament because their goals were transformative rather than incremental conservative activists could not be entirely satisfied with the give and take the half a loaf deal making of politics in ordinary times in bush they found a leader who shared that conviction and who demonstrated over and again that in service of his goals he was willing to sharply divide the congress and the country
2294572 he is not the centrist as president that he was as governor
2294573 still a persuadable center in american politics and that no matter how effectively a party mobilized its base it could not prevail if those swing voters moved sharply and cohesively against it
2294574 the party that seeks to encompass and harmonize the widest range of interests and perspectives is the one most likely to thrive the overriding lesson for both parties from the bush attempt to profit from polarization is that there remains no way to achieve lasting political power in a nation as diverse as america without assembling a broad coalition that locks arms to produce meaningful progress against the countrys problems
2294575 our modern system of hyperpartisanship has unnecessarily inflamed our differences and impeded progress against our most pressing challenges in washington the political debate too often careens between dysfunctional poles either polarization when one party imposes its will over the bitter resistance of the other or immobilization when the parties fight to stalemate our political system has virtually lost its capacity to formulate the principled compromises indispensable for progress in any diverse society by any measure the costs of hyperpartisanship vastly exceed the benefits

2294577 hell theyd say in the country club locker room you know how milts getting his everybody knew bearing testimony to the fact that suburban vice like a peeling nose is almost impossible to conceal it went all over town this talk like a swarm of bees settling down lazily on polite afternoon sun porches to rise once more and settle down again with a busy murmur among cautious ladylike foursomes on the golf course buzzing pleasurably there amid ladylike whacks of the golf ball and cautious pullings down of panties which bound too tightly everybody knew about their affair and everybody talked about it and because of some haunting inborn squeamishness it would not have relieved loftis to know that nobody particularly cared
2294578 surge of anger and futility that rose up in his chest and sudden shame too shame at the fact that their life together which had begun as most marriages do with such jaunty good humor and confidence had come to this footlessness this confusion
2294579 feared helen for what seemed ages he had lived with her not so much in a state of matrimony as in a state of gentle irritation together like the negative poles of a magnet gradually but firmly repelling each other
2294580 and he thought briefly about madness and this family which had succeeded almost effortlessly it seemed in destroying itself and he became so overwhelmed by melancholy that his stomach rumbled and his hands and wrists became limp and trembled on the steering wheel he thought of the wild evening after maudies funeral when with peyton absent and loftis he supposed hiding upstairs helen had told him that everything was finished there was no god no anything behold with a nod upstairs toward loftis and which included he gathered peyton too this breed of monsters god what words she had used who was to blame mad or not helen had been beastly she had granted to loftis in her peculiarly unremitting way no forgiveness or understanding and above all she had been beastly to peyton yet loftis himself had been no choice soul and who finally lest it be god himself could know where the circle composed as it was of such tragic suspicions and misunderstandings began and where it ended
2294581 everywhere i turn i seem to walk deeper and deeper into some terrible despair
2294582 yes yes you are so so right thank you very much
2294583 fui sempre eu toda e inteira sofrendo com a mesma intensidade com que vivi a alegria
2294584 has to offer extends beyond the limits of our imagination that someday men will learn that in its bounty the sea is inexhaustible
2294585 there is probably only one bluefin left for every fifty present in 1940
2294586 the last of these regal fish are today pursued more relentlessly than ever the fish are now so valuable that it pays to employ planes and helicopters to scan the ocean guiding boats in for the kill when fish are spotted this isnt fishing any more it is the extermination of a species
2294587 to get as much as he can before it is lost
2294588 the whole bay yields only 80 000 bushels a year down from a peak of 15 million in the nineteenth century
2294589 there is a common theme in european expansion and exploitation of the sea first the explorers columbus cabot drake bering cook and others set sail for god country fame and wealth they returned with tales of strange seas teeming with wildlife through books the possibilities for exploitation became known in europe stimulating a second wave of travel financed by merchant adventurers in pursuit of profit those voyages although commercially motivated were instrumental in extending the boundaries of the known world as well as the animals slaughtered for commercial ends sailors and travelers had major impacts on the fauna of islands and the sea butchering millions of animals for provisions
2294590 a quarter to a third of all animals caught are simply tossed back into the sea most of them dead or dying
2294591 a nice steady job that would let me spend in the most ordinary way the rest of my days in paris
2294592 in the early years of the 1950s there were still no tall buildings in miraflores a neighborhood of one story houses two at the most and gardens with their inevitable geraniums poincianas laurels bougainvilleas and lawns and verandas along which honeysuckle or ivy climbed with rocking chairs where neighbors waited for nightfall gossiping or inhaling the scent of the jasmine in some parks there were ceibo trees thorny with red and pink flowers and the straight clean sidewalks were lined with frangipani jacaranda and mulberry trees a note of color along with the flowers in the gardens and the little donofrio ice cream trucks that drove up and down the streets day and night announcing their presence with a klaxon whose slow ululation had the effect on me of a primitive horn a prehistoric reminiscence you could still hear birds singing in that miraflores where families cut a pine branch when their girls reached marriageable age because if they didnt the poor things would become old maids like my aunt alberta
2294593 the beginning of real life for me the life that separates castles in the air illusions and fables from harsh reality
2294594 i tried to picture her childhood being poor in the hell that peru is for the poor and her adolescence perhaps even worse the countless difficulties defeats sacrifices concessions she must have suffered in peru in cuba in order to move ahead and reach the place she was now
2294595 a grown woman convinced that life was a jungle where only the worst triumphed and ready to do anything not to be conquered and to keep moving higher
2294596 everything i told her was true i was still crazy about her it was enough for me to see her to realize that despite my knowing that any relationship with the bad girl was doomed to failure the only thing i really wanted in life with the passion others bring to the pursuit of fortune glory success power was having her with all her lies entanglements egotism and disappearances a cheap sentimental thing no doubt but also true that i wouldnt do anything but curse how slowly the hours went by until i could see her again
2294597 an experience that had left a wound in my memory
2294598 i was a hopeless imbecile to still be in love with a madwoman an adventurer an unscrupulous female with whom no man i least of all could maintain a stable relationship without eventually being stepped on
2294599 could this farce more than thirty years old be called a love story ricardito
2294600 which would last throughout the eighties and provoke an unprecedented bloodbath in peruvian history more than sixty thousand dead and disappeared
2294601 who when they reached old age saw their lifelong dream of peru making progress fade instead of materialize
2294602 our profession is a disguised form of procuring pimping or being a go between
2294603 as i always suspected literary translations were very poorly paid the fees much lower than for commercial ones
2294604 of what i thought of as real writing no more of this literary fiction with which i had been making myself miserable for the entirety of my middle twenties
2294605 film and television were the only types of authorship that mattered books can matter in the big cultural way if theyre on television or are made into movies which is pretty much the same thing you reader know who don delillo is but that dude across from you on the bus would probably guess that he was that fat sidekick guy in burt reynolds movies hey i dont like it either but qed
2294606 with his utilitarian attitude toward fun endlessly plotting how the most could be had by the largest number of people
2294607 at full bore he was good for only about five days of nonstop no sleep networking weed smoking beer drinking coke snorting and psychedelic eating
2294608 one thing i am afraid i am glossing over here is the overwhelming sense of belief we had in ourselves and in what we were doing we didnt just believe what we were doing was right or fun but that it would work the raconteurs false modesty i have adopted in order to tell this story belies a very real confidence i had in myself confidence that i would be not just a player but a singular distinctive force in american media i had spent my twenties toiling in the wrong medium an irrelevant one in which harder work paid smaller dividends now we would make the world ours
2294609 something far grander far mightier the new breed of enfant terrible the brash young chief executive officer of a new media empire
2294610 we were friends who wanted to do something together in other times or other circumstances we might have started a magazine a social club a religion or a gang it was the late 1990s so we started an internet company
2294611 what we really wanted to do was make new movie and television properties of our own
2294612 tap into and provide a platform for the media underclass that had thronged uninvited
2294613 alienated from most of what could be seen on tv or in theaters what was available on television and in theaters simply did not say what we felt what was more distressing was that it was also true of purportedly alternative and independent media where we might hope to find our values echoed and amplified
2294614 the perfect example of how something small and weird provided it had a genuinely unique voice could break big overnight
2294615 had been completely co opted by mainstream entertainment companies that were using independence as a marketing angle
2294616 a mining museum called the park city silver mine adventure
2294617 called lapdance the lowest of the low in an interview afterward which delighted us despite our having no gripe with robert redford himself
2294618 could there truly be a living to be made in telling other people what to call their products it seemed so goofy a scam that i could hardly believe it was working but clearly it was
2294619 coming up with good names turned out not to be what our work was really about
2294620 coming up with the names was just one tiny point on the curve between starting an engagement and finishing it the work was first about getting the work then about making the clients feel good about the process and finally about ratifying whatever decisions the clients reached those were decisions over which we ultimately had no control at the end of the day they were going to call their company whatever they wanted if we couldnt talk sense into them it was much better to make them feel good about a poor decision than to argue against it they didnt want the right answer or even necessarily a good answer they wanted to feel good about an answer
2294621 had produced only work so bankrupt that no one could ever say i had tried my best and failed corporate branding porn and snuff bad comedy
2294622 fame wealth success in whatever form it was hard now even to remember what i had imagined but whatever it had been an image of myself as prodigy wunderkind lenfant terrible it simply was no longer possible i was at least by any reasonable measure of age all grown up this release from the tyranny of my own expectations was a sweeter relief than i can describe
2294623 social justice work in the cracks of the edifice erected in the wake of the civil rights movement
2294624 running reprieve a charity that brings lawyers and volunteers to the deep south from abroad to work on death penalty issues
2294625 the story of new orleans following hurricane katrina is even though it may be hard to accept the story of america at the beginning of a new millennium though we see ourselves as leaders in the world and attempt to spread abroad our ethics of democracy and equality though we celebrate the supposed victory of the civil rights struggle with various holidays each year we face many of the same grave obstacles to human and civil rights that we condemn in other countries and regret in our own past these shortcomings were made plain by hurricane katrinas landfall and its consequences in new orleans
2294626 for those of us who live here even the wealthy and the privileged it is impossible to ignore race and poverty regardless of ones politics or beliefs about the causes of poverty and its link to race these factors are central in our civic discourse and define daily life in the city
2294627 i took issue with the medias characterization of post katrina new orleans as resembling the third world as its poor citizens clamored for a way out i suggested that my experience in new orleans working with the citys poorest people in the years before the storm had reflected the reality of third world conditions in new orleans and that katrina had not turned new orleans into a third world city but had only revealed it to the world as such
2294628 even long before the storm new orleans failed to provide much of anything to its citizens
2294629 for many people in new orleans and in poor communities around the country the government is merely an antagonist a terrible landlord a jailor and a prosecutor
2294630 a smaller footprint would prevent poor people and minorities from returning to their homes
2294631 allowing people to return to homes in flood prone areas is neither particularly humane nor in accord with civil rights when you know that they could drown there
2294632 we ate an amazing lunch of catfish hush puppies chocolate cake and sweet tea
2294633 it was very late by the time i finally left tennessee and entered the more familiar state of virginia
2294634 massive unemployment mile long bread lines and the westward migration that began when oklahoma kansas texas and arkansas turned into a giant dust bowl
2294635 they were the unique product of a particular time and place mostly men who had known extreme poverty and hardship in the south and west with a few hard nosed kids from eastern states thrown in for variety among their number were a couple of ex sharecroppers a pool shark a handsome dandy who worked as a hollywood double in the off season a grease stained third baseman who liked to drive his midget auto racer around a track before a game a surly outfielder who punched any of his own teammates if they looked at him in the wrong way and even a couple of college kids collectively as the gashouse gang they were the creation of a pious nonimbibing methodist who would not even watch them play on a sunday because his religious principles forbade it
2294636 though dizzy was a braggart and a practical joker and sometimes just plain obnoxious the consensus among many of his teammates was that at heart he was a good fellow
2294637 criticized any teammate who in his opinion made a foolish error
2294638 yet none of the players confronted medwick to his face he was clearly a man no one wanted to get into a fistfight with
2294639 liked to read pulp adventure novels about cowboys preferred nightclubs to museums and was forever harassing pestering and negotiating with the front office which he loudly and publicly accused of being cheap and exploitative
2294640 in the final stretch the dean brothers became virtually invincible
2294641 in the full english tradition solid works built about a story in which on the face of it character humour description of scenery criticism of life philosophy all have their place but to which they are accessory
2294642 this impression of simplicity and of something which is almost the opposite of simplicity was the strongest impression which i got from hardy personally
2294643 full of curious and arresting perceptions sublime moments wilful and tragic men and women who impose themselves by their originality and their vivid human presence
2294644 began at once to revisit their early love in his mind with an intensity that expressed itself in a series of poems
2294645 in these poems about emma he is rediscovering repressed sorrow and forgotten love he is like an archaeologist uncovering objects that have not been seen for many decades bringing them out into the light examining them some small pieces some curious bones and broken bits and some shining treasures there is a rising excitement in the writing as of someone making discoveries he has found the most perfect subject he has ever had and he has the skills to work on it
2294646 the road became a theatre for action in his imagination and walking a central activity in his writing used dramatically and to establish or underline character
2294647 he was wrong because hardy had found a true voice sometimes awkward but tuned into experiences and feelings outside the range of henry james it is a voice that speaks to readers in many countries and to which successive generations have responded with this voice hardy established the territory in which he worked best in fiction in which rural landscape is drawn with a naturalists eye and country people are shown playing out their lives between custom and education between work and ideas between love of place and experience of change from now on all his best novels were built on this foundation
2294648 from very early he began to make life into art by seeing the special quality of natural occurrences and by dramatizing and embellishing them
2294649 understood the business side of writing the importance of serialization and how to deal with the american market and the australian as well as british publishers and magazine editors
2294650 if you are lucky enough to have lived in paris as a young man then wherever you go for the rest of your life it stays with you for paris is a moveable feast
2294651 it was wonderful to walk down the long flights of stairs knowing that id had good luck working i always worked until i had something done and i always stopped when i knew what was going to happen next that way i could be sure of going on the next day but sometimes when i was starting a new story and i could not get it going i would sit in front of the fire and squeeze the peel of the little oranges into the edge of the flame and watch the sputter of blue that they made i would stand and look out over the roofs of paris and think do not worry you have always written before and you will write now all you have to do is write one true sentence write the truest sentence that you know so finally i would write one true sentence and then go on from there if i started to write elaborately i found that i could cut that scrollwork or ornament out and throw it away and start with the first true simple declarative sentence i had written up in that room i decided that i would write one story about each thing that i knew about i was trying to do this all the time i was writing and it was good and severe discipline
2294652 i knew the stories were good and someone would publish them finally at home
2294653 when i stopped doing newspaper work i was sure the stories were going to be published but every one i sent out came back
2294654 when you are twenty five and are a natural heavyweight missing a meal makes you very hungry but it also sharpens all of your perceptions
2294655 she got to look like a roman emperor and that was fine if you liked your women to look like roman emperors
2294656 a man then who looked like a boy with a face between handsome and pretty and a delicate long lipped irish mouth that on a girl would have been the mouth of a beauty
2294657 the mouth worried you until you knew him and then it worried you more
2294658 he was cynical and funny and very jolly and charming and endearing even if you were careful about anyone becoming endearing
2294659 to found at washington under the name of the smithsonian institution an establishment for the increase amp diffusion of knowledge among men
2294660 his personal belongings the trappings of his life as an aspiring aristocrat
2294661 with these losses smithson along with the story of his life seemed to have utterly vanished
2294662 the libraries and archives of europe britain and the united states
2294663 an intoxicatingly fiery woman twice married twice widowed twice a single mother and mistress to a duke
2294664 one of the most powerful and charismatic figures of georgian england
2294665 in the tradition of the whig aristocracy with a great love for all things french a penchant for travel and a belief in progress to the polish of a gentleman smithson married the rigor and questioning of a scientist
2294666 remained hungrily acquisitive of knowledge all his life gathering information and observations into myriad notebooks and journals
2294667 equating freedom of movement with liberty and light and the privations of war and oppression with darkness and ignorance
2294668 an understanding of matter based on the ancient aristotelian elements of earth air fire and water
2294669 the means of overthrowing the system as it existed of replacing a corrupt order based on superstition and inherited privilege with one that rewarded talent and merit
2294670 in americas unprecedented system of government founded upon the rights of man where each person was to be valued for his contribution rather than his pedigree the future the most promising foundation for the pursuit of knowledge and the advancement of society
2294671 he was not interested in pursuing knowledge solely in the tradition of the gentleman amateur
2294672 was already seriously committed to a life in science and he was above all ambitious
2294673 was a worldly woman a cosmopolitan woman and by extension a woman of loose morals
2294674 those who are not officers do not interest me an officer is another being a sort of artist living outdoors with sparkles on his arms in a seductive uniform yes i have had many lovers but it is the beautiful soldiers brave always ready for battle and while waiting always sweet and gallant for me the officer forms a race apart i have never loved any but officers
2294675 she was in an odd way innocent she still expected a magical love to transform her world still she knew instinctively how to flirt and please a man at seventeen mgreet was deeply romantic frivolous and terribly vain she longed for experience to burst out of the strict world of propriety and regulation so she could have fun and she craved admiration from an older man
2294676 deteriorated into sharp quarrels too much drinking heavy spending and suspicions of infidelity
2294677 a cerebral hemorrhage or aneurysm which can be a consequence of congenital syphilis
2294678 a darker more puritanical mood was sweeping across europe and the days of exuberant living were drawing to a close
2294679 she always had taken money from men because she needed money and they had it
2294680 she always felt she deserved it the matter was over and done with as soon as she got the money at least as far as she was concerned
2294681 spy fever had broken out all over europe and people were encouraged to look for and report any potentially suspicious actions
2294682 was convinced that she was a predatory woman deliberately tricking men
2294683 it is difficult to imagine a woman less likely to be able to engage in clandestine activities than mata hari
2294684 while she was certainly seductive which might be viewed as useful for a spy she was never on any occasion invisible
2294685 a ridiculous candidate for a job that required clandestine behavior
2294686 believed firmly that mata hari was guilty because she slept with many men and traveled widely in wartime such a woman must be a spy
2294687 with a supreme indifference between you and me there wasnt enough evidence to flog a cat
2294688 she was convicted not for espionage but for her lack of shame
2294689 im so used to being anonymous in python that its nice to know someone noticed
2294690 i have kept a diary more or less continuously since april 1969
2294691 had been writing comedy with terry jones since leaving university in 1965
2294692 to keep a record of how i fill the days
2294693 it seals the present moment and preserves it from the tidying process of context perspective analysis and balance it becomes history but quite unselfconsciously what proves to be important over a long period is not always what a diarist will identify at the time for the historians sake i should probably have noted every detail of the birth of monty python but it seemed far more important to me to record the emergence of my new family than the faltering steps of a comedy series that would probably last no more than two years and that i feel is as it should be legends are not created by diaries though they can be destroyed by them
2294694 somehow since monty python it has become difficult to write material for more conventional shows monty python spoilt us in so far as mad flights of fancy ludicrous changes of direction absurd premises and the complete illogicality of writing were the rule rather than the exception now we jealously guard this freedom and writing for anyone else becomes quite oppressive
2294695 john is a good traveling companion in so far as he is nearly always recognized by stewards and stewardesses who pamper him blatantly and eric and i were able to catch a little of this reflected blandishment
2294696 he can be incredibly self centered and if he wasnt so charming with it i would have told him so
2294697 john is still tense and unrelaxed with people which compounds his problems he has more defenses than fort knox
2294698 seems to feel that having stated his position he now deserves the good life
2294699 is faced with the extraordinary complexity of his private life it seems to sap his energies totally
2294700 hes now become a model of co operation and efficiency and his avuncular presence is calm and reassuring in fact john today suggested that graham was reminding him more and more of a vicar
2294701 the news from america daily lends an extra air of unreality to the situation for by all accounts python is catching on in the states as the prestige programme to watch
2294702 read more german novels for here if anywhere is a chance to try and prove solzhenitsyns point that art and literature are the only spiritual ambassadors between countries
2294703 vivid impressions of south east asia in paul therouxs the great railway bazaar
2294704 cameron and paul have been spending every night together he doesnt have a house in los angeles and cameron doesnt mind him staying with her
2294705 when he dated jennifer aniston he used to stay at hotels but cameron likes him a lot and always wants to be around him
2294706 she wasnt hiding the ring and quite proudly showed it off
2294707 cameron and paul were sitting on the patio leaning in toward each other her body language looked like she was really comfortable with him she looked genuinely like a girl falling in love
2294708 take a stand today right now right here this is where it counts either way
2294709 it works great for me so why not share with the world
2294710 it was an effort to set myself free in that western past by taking all the ingredients of the standard western which were real enough after all and seeing if with a theme that concerned me and that had more than dated and local implications and a realistic treatment i could bring both the people and the situations alive again
2294711 that ever present element in any society which can always be led to act the same way to use authoritarian methods to oppose authoritarian methods
2294712 it can happen here it has happened here in minor but sufficiently indicative ways a great many times
2294713 losing its stage stop look and beginning to settle into a half empty village of the kind that hangs on sometimes where all the real work is spread out on the land around it and most of the places take care of themselves
2294714 arthur davies general store the land and mining claims office canbys saloon the long sagging bridger inn with its double decker porch and the union church square and bare as a new england meeting house
2294715 always talks as if he had a little edge which is his kind of humor
2294716 with folds of fat over the collar bulging brown eyes and a mouth with a shape like a womans mouth but with a big pendulous lower lip like men get who talk a lot without thinking much first
2294717 had been a confederate cavalry officer and the son of a slave owner and he had that kind of a code and a sharp quiet head for management
2294718 that if the mainstream press told the southern racial story the rest of the nation would be shocked and shaken and demand sweeping changes
2294719 was a detailed narrative reenactment showing how the killers had beaten tortured killed and submerged till
2294720 the civil rights story needed a reporter who knew the region well had the right accent abided by all the rules wouldnt get emotionally involved wouldnt argue with anyone wouldnt become the news who would just write what he saw wouldnt get beat wouldnt get snookered and was willing to give up his family perhaps his life for the story
2294721 set into motion a level of reporting that would establish the national standard for two decades
2294722 as forceful a spokesman for segregation as there was in the south
2294723 the news and courier feels that whats wrong with this country is democracy
2294724 the result of all this postmodern history with its talk of deconstruction decentering textuality and essentialism has been to make academic history writing almost as esoteric and inward directed as the writing of literary scholars this is too bad since history is an endeavor that needs a wide readership to justify itself
2294725 popular historians who have no academic appointment such as walter isaacson ron chernow thomas fleming and stacy schiff have successfully moved in to fill the void left by the academic historians preoccupied by issues of race gender and multiculturalism
2294726 i had great respect for barbara tuchman and have even greater respect for her successor as the premier popular historian of the country david mccullough
2294727 the special language that literary critics now use to separate themselves from the power structure as well as the common herd of us ordinary readers interpellation exfoliation ambiguation valorized intellection narrativized and meta this and meta that
2294728 what has gone on in american history writing over the past twenty five years at least as it is represented by some of the books that i reviewed
2294729 reveal my own varied responses to what has happened to historiography during this tumultuous period
2294730 the problems and issues of the present should be the stimulus for our forays into the past
2294731 it is natural for us to want to discover the sources the origins of our present circumstances
2294732 should not be the criterion for what we find in the past our perceptions and explanations of the past should not be directly shaped by the issues and problems of our own time the best and most serious historians have come to know that even when their original impulse to write history came from a pressing present problem to be able to see the participants of the past in a comprehensive way to see them in the context of their own time to describe their blindness and folly with sympathy to recognize the extent to which they were caught up in changing circumstances over which they had little control and to realize the degree to which they created results they never intended to know all this about the past and to be able to relate it without anachronistic distortion to our present is what is meant by having a historical sense
2294733 extraordinary present minded and hence depressing picture of antebellum society that burns has drawn
2294734 is a political activist for whom writing history is really politics by other means
2294735 was a cruel and brutal age and human life was a great deal cheaper than it is for us today
2294736 is ultimately marred by the present mindedness of its author
2294737 i suppose the most flagrant examples of present mindedness in history writing come from trying to inject politics into history books i am reminded of rebecca wests wise observation that when politics comes in the door truth flies out the window historians who want to influence politics with their history writing have missed the point of the craft they ought to run for office
2294738 seek to study past events not to make transhistorical generalizations about human behavior but to understand those events as they actually were in all their peculiar contexts and circumstances
2294739 history does not teach lots of little lessons insofar as it teaches any lessons it teaches only one big one that nothing ever works out quite the way its managers intended or expected history is like experience and old age wisdom is what one learns from it
2294740 unlike sociology or political science history is a conservative discipline conservative of course not in any contemporary political sense but in the larger sense of inculcating skepticism about peoples ability to manipulate and control purposefully their own destinies by showing that the best laid plans of people usually go awry the study of history tends to dampen youthful enthusiasm and to restrain the can do the conquer the future spirit that many people have historical knowledge takes people off a roller coaster of illusions and disillusions it levels off emotions and gives people a perspective on what is possible and more often what is not possible by this definition americans have had almost no historical sense whatsoever indeed such a sense seems almost un american
2294741 to inculcate patriotism build a national identity and turn immigrants into citizens
2294742 not just as different but as specially or providentially blessed as somehow free from the larger tendencies of history and the common fate of nations
2294743 eventually the name of this tribe would be transmogrified and would come to refer to peru home to the largest native empire the new world would ever know
2294744 stigmatized by the fact that his father had never married his mother
2294745 had received little if any schooling and thus remained illiterate for his entire life
2294746 tale of pizarro and a handful of spanish heroes defying the odds against hordes of barbaric native savages not coincidentally mirrored the ideas and conceits of the victorian age and of american manifest destiny no doubt this volume also reflects the prevailing attitudes of our time
2294747 hernando pizarro his horse snorting presumably looked down his lines then directly at org ez across the plain from him not taking his eyes from him he then raised his sword on high held it aloft for a moment then quickly brought it down
2294748 the royal hub of the empire a city that was purposely meant to display the ostentation of state power
2294749 the equivalent of the king the pope and jesus christ all rolled into one
2294750 the marauding spaniards made no distinction between men women and children
2294751 a force of between 100 000 and 200 000 warriors a stupendous feat of logistical organization
2294752 animals that could carry a fully armored spaniard and still outrun the fastest native
2294753 they could communicate much more efficiently through writing thus being able to send and receive complex information between their often divided forces
2294754 were designed for hand to hand combat with other similarly armed foot soldiers and consisted of an assortment of clubs
2294755 taxi ghosts bus ghosts police ghosts fire ghosts meter reader ghosts tree trimming ghosts five and dime ghosts once upon a time the world was so thick with ghosts i could hardly breathe i could hardly walk limping my way around the white ghosts and their cars there were black ghosts too but they were open eyed and full of laughter more distinct than white ghosts
2294756 i couldnt tell where the stories left off and the dreams began
2294757 whenever she had to warn us about life my mother told stories that ran like this one a story to grow up on she tested our strength to establish realities those in the emigrant generations who could not reassert brute survival died young and far from home those of us in the first american generations have had to figure out how the invisible world the emigrants built around our childhoods fits in solid america chinese americans when you try to understand what things in you are chinese how do you separate what is peculiar to childhood to poverty insanities one family your mother who marked your growing with stories from what is chinese what is chinese tradition and what is the movies
2294758 it is the way chinese sounds chingchong ugly to american ears not beautiful like japanese sayonara words with the consonants and vowels as regular as italian we make guttural peasant noise and have ton duc thang names you cant remember and the chinese cant hear americans at all the language is too soft and western music unhearable ive watched a chinese audience laugh visit talk story and holler during a piano recital as if the musician could not hear them
2294759 would have liked to bring myself back as a boy for my parents to welcome with chickens and pigs
2294760 chinese smeared bad daughters in law with honey and tied them naked on top of ant nests a husband may kill a wife who disobeys him confucius said that
2294761 brilliant a natural scholar who could glance at a book and know it
2294762 adding no american name nor holding one in reserve for american emergencies
2294763 the last and greatest of all human dreams for a transitory enchanted moment man must have held his breath in the presence of this continent compelled into an aesthetic contemplation he neither understood nor desired face to face for the last time in history with something commensurate to his capacity for wonder
2294764 had been one of the most powerful ends that ever played football at new haven a national figure in a way one of those men who reach such an acute limited excellence at twenty one that everything afterward savours of anticlimax now he was a sturdy straw haired man of thirty with a rather hard mouth and a supercilious manner
2294765 her face was sad and lovely with bright things in it bright eyes and a bright passionate mouth but there was an excitement in her voice that men who had cared for her found difficult to forget
2294766 they were careless people tom and daisy they smashed up things and creatures and then retreated back into their money or their vast carelessness or whatever it was that kept them together and let other people clean up the mess they had made
2294767 the man who fixed the worlds series back in 1919
2294768 with the faith of fifty million people with the single mindedness of a burglar blowing a safe
2294769 who represented everything for which i have an unaffected scorn
2294770 something gorgeous about him some heightened sensitivity to the promises of life as if he were related to one of those intricate machines that register earthquakes ten thousand miles away
2294771 something was making him nibble at the edge of stale ideas as if his sturdy physical egotism no longer nourished his peremptory heart
2294772 americans while occasionally willing to be serfs have always been obstinate about being peasantry
2294773 one of my most vivid memories is of coming back west from prep school and later from college at christmas time when we pulled out into the winter night and the real snow our snow began to stretch out beside us and twinkle against the windows and the dim lights of small wisconsin stations moved by a sharp wild brace came suddenly into the air we drew in deep breaths of it as we walked back from dinner through the cold vestibules unutterably aware of our identity with this country for one strange hour before we melted indistinguishably into it again
2294774 nineteen nineteen was a time in america when the pent up hopes of a nation at war collided with the chaos of wars aftermath it was a time when bombs exploded on porch steps and grown men threw sharp edged rocks at little boys whose skin was a different color and it was a time when working people having experienced the highly organized collective character of waging war came to believe that through organized labor they could claim the power to achieve the happiness they felt they deserved after surviving such a war it was a year when race riots erupted in twenty six cities labor strikes occurred at an average of ten a day and always there was the looming terror of the new enemy bolshevism it was indeed a year of struggle an apocalyptic time some would say others would say it was only a dark moment preceding a new day
2294775 the nation seemed to be sinking deeper and deeper into a quicksand of conflict and hatred
2294776 a year that laid the groundwork for so many aspects of modern america from the struggles for free speech and black equality to the establishment of a system of domestic intelligence
2294777 to many it meant that bolshevists had struck the pacific northwest like lightning bolts soon to cause the nation to burst into the flames of revolution
2294778 it was there that the rolling wave of hope from the western front met the rising tide of fear and intolerance back home
2294779 but that message had no lasting significance and fell like the leaves of autumn into a rushing river
2294780 has taught writing at northwestern universitys medill school of journalism and at columbia universitys graduate school of journalism
2294781 had gone well the service was decorous the reception jolly the send off from school and college friends raucous and uplifting
2294782 in a tiny sitting room on the first floor of a georgian inn
2294783 they were young educated and both virgins on this their wedding night and they lived in a time when conversation about sexual difficulties was plainly impossible
2294784 that their wedding night was not simple when their love was so obvious
2294785 and what stood in their way their personalities and pasts their ignorance and fear timidity squeamishness lack of entitlement or experience or easy manners then the tail end of a religious prohibition their englishness and class and history itself nothing much at all
2294786 specific worry based on one unfortunate experience was of overexcitement of what he had heard someone describe as arriving too soon
2294787 where he merely suffered conventional first night nerves she experienced a visceral dread a helpless disgust as palpable as seasickness for much of the time through all the months of merry wedding preparation she managed to ignore this stain on her happiness but whenever her thoughts turned toward a close embrace she preferred no other term her stomach tightened dryly she was nauseous at the back of her throat florence suspected that there was something profoundly wrong with her that she had always been different and that at last she was about to be exposed her problem she thought was greater deeper than straightforward physical disgust her whole being was in revolt against a prospect of entanglement and flesh her composure and essential happiness were about to be violated she simply did not want to be entered or penetrated sex with edward could not be the summation of her joy but was the price she must pay for it
2294788 this was not a good moment in the history of english cuisine but no one much minded at the time except visitors from abroad
2294789 for the first time her love for edward was associated with a definable physical sensation as irrefutable as vertigo before she had known only a comforting broth of warm emotions a thick winter blanket of kindness and trust that had always seemed enough an achievement in itself now here at last were the beginnings of desire precise and alien but clearly her own and beyond as though suspended above and behind her just out of sight was relief that she was just like everyone else it was undeniable she was not a separate subspecies of the human race in triumph she belonged among the generality for all the novelty she was not in a state of wild abandonment nor did she want to be hurried toward one she wanted to linger in this spacious moment in these fully clothed conditions with the soft brown eyed gaze and the tender caress and the spreading thrill but she knew that this was impossible and that as everyone said one thing would have to lead to another
2294790 less about a specific place in the country than a place where the whole country used to be
2294791 i remember seeing commissioner bell standing in the back of our locker room after the game he was crying i think he knew what we didnt yet that this was a watershed for the nfl
2294792 thats the game that changed professional football the popularity of it started right there
2294793 twelve players from that game went on to the pro football hall of fame said new york linebacker sam huff who was one of them
2294794 he had character he wasnt the all american looking quarterback like out of a movie he had it inside
2294795 work ethic that says what you get out of something depends on what you put into it
2294796 left them with some sort of glandular disorder which was not malignant but which kept them half poisoned most of the time and caused them frequently to have such bad nosebleeds that they had to be sent home from school
2294797 the result of a scratch from a nail in the railing of a paddock when he was watching her take her first jump
2294798 feeling that she had been the cause of his far too early death
2294799 not allowed to climb trees because splinters had been known to get into the bloodstream and travel to the heart
2294800 did not have bicycles and they were not allowed to build things
2294801 bad uneven teeth and nearsighted eyes so that they had to wear braces and spectacles
2294802 his table manners his rough and ungrammatical speech his clothes and his profession
2294803 rich old man who was different from anyone else in the world
2294804 had been everywhere in the world and hunted every animal indigenous to the north american continent
2294805 associated as he had been with the renewal of crowded days after the tranquil ennui of the summer he had seemed to the children after he had gone half legendary like a figure known only in his identification with a particular place or a particular day of the year he was a sort of god of september surrounded by the gold autumnal light
2294806 the moment they met the sad mild mannered housekeeper they had known that she could easily be shaken from her resolution and this in itself was enough to cloud their passion yet though they no longer felt daring but on the contrary were afraid there was no waning of their determination they knew both of them that they would try to escape would invent headaches would have nosebleeds would hide behind books but they would not in the end successfully evade uncle claude they were bound to learn
2294807 becoming i have been one ever since i was nothing going on one
2294808 cruel smug face his pince nez on a black ribbon the effeminate white piping of his vest
2294809 read into his face vacuity and self pride he saw the plump hands as indolent and useless and believed that in a handclasp they would be flaccid
2294810 good to look at for a second and nice to photograph
2294811 we have been engaged in the development of rss and image technologies for 5 years already and we known what our customers need
2294812 we are constantly working on increasing the efficiency of our solutions and we are glad that our products are getting more and more popular we are ready to do everything possible to make our solutions meet all functional requirements of our customers
2294813 we want to find out whether theres a role for messaging in the browser
2294814 the initial prototype is a primitive implementation with many bugs and subsequent versions will include changes that break functionality and delete all your messages making you start over from scratch
2294815 extensions are a great way to prototype functionality in firefox
2294816 but i want to stress that this is a labs experiment and doesnt mean were adding this in firefox
2294817 the reason why were conducting this experiment with snowl is because we dont know if messaging should be in the browser but we want to find out that and a lot of other things
2294818 we want to gather as much feedback as possible then make the decision to continue if it seems promising and adds significant value to the browser
2294819 those are the questions we need to address but its still a successful experiment even if something doesnt make it into the browser
2294820 we could add some core messaging functionality to firefox or take just a piece of snowl to put in the browser or maybe do it some other way as a more mature extension separate from firefox
2294821 i think this is a project that will run more than just months
2294822 its hard to believe that within three to six months we would add messaging to firefox this is a rough estimate but i think its a one to two year thing
2294823 you love me but you dont know who i am
2294824 whats next dont you ask yourself not only next month years to come
2294825 nothing is next there is no next this was next eight years ago they planted a bomb in one of the towers nobody said whats next this was next the time to be afraid is when theres no reason to be afraid too late now
2294826 they had begun a search for land and an old house in the country in a manner that was not only halfhearted but shamefaced they were doing something because it seemed to be expected of them not because they felt any true inner urge then suddenly the land fever had seized them they knew in a flash what had been wrong with them all those years the peace and security that only the fair land itself could provide they had left out of their lives altogether
2294827 anticipated a budget of 11 000 for his dream house but the completed project ultimately escalated to a total of 56 000 a sum so inflated by his misconceptions that it nearly drove him into bankruptcy he was forced to sell the house two years later
2294828 had been lucky enough to hit upon a three word slogan for a laxative account that had broken four successive agency vice presidents
2294829 a two story house in quiet modern good taste frame and brick veneer construction something to blend with the older architectural examples that dotted the countryside around them but no slavish imitation of times past it would be in effect a bringing up to date of the old house with obvious modifications dictated by the difference between the eighteenth and twentieth centuries and by the difference between the profession of farming for which the old house had been constructed and advertising which should somehow be exemplified in the new
2294830 becoming an utter vacuous fool with a simian knack of writing advertising copy for a tonnage laxative and no other use or capacities whatever
2294831 he was being cheated he was being bilked he was being made a fool of but he could not find the villain because everyone was a villain all all had made him the butt and victim of a huge conspiracy clever and cruel
2294832 whether everybody elses life was such a succession of roller coaster plunges from elation to despair and swoops back to elation or whether as his closest friends and office mates insisted he was a sufferer from severe emotional instability
2294833 one of those skilled workmen who restored a mans faith in his kind
2294834 one circumstance remained always the same in his methodical progress through the earths crust he was encountering everything in an omnipotent gods creation except water
2294835 in the midst of the bucolic loveliness where he had wanted to live in peace and harmony with nature and his fellows he was disliked it was just that he was an outlander he could wear overhalls or dress in mail order clothes or part his hair down the middle until kingdom come and it would make no difference he could live in a cow barn until all the perfumes of araby were powerless to lighten the smell of wet leaves and manure but the natives of lansdale county would still know him for an alien forever
2294836 ask one of your workmen to get a pound of the a amp ps best butter and match it exactly
2294837 in the master bath the color should suggest apple blossoms just before they fall
2294838 a divine sanction for the retaking of the authority the whites had lost in the civil war and a heavenly quality to the reestablishment of white supremacy
2294839 had in mind instead a social compact under which negroes would not formally be slaves anymore but under which they would be unable to vote hold office or have legal rights in which they would be completely powerless subject to the will of whites without any protection or recourse even when that will was expressed in individual violence and sexual violation
2294840 replaced the informal and violent nullification of negro rights with a formal highly detailed legal system mandating separate education employment and public accommodations for the two races
2294841 had been a relief which blessedly closed a chapter in american history and made a great new national life possible
2294842 to use extralegal violence to remove the republican party from power and then to disenfranchise black people
2294843 white liners at the very least a tightly controlled statewide organization
2294844 there was no more gallant and efficient officer in the armies of the union
2294845 fully in tune with the radical ascendancy of his party in washington
2294846 the whites of warren county now held the almost impregnable high ground in vicksburg and they were literally as they had been psychologically since the war ended surrounded by negroes whom they assumed to have nearly infinite numbers horrifying intentions and terrible powers though oddly at the same time they were also viewed as incapable of exercising free will and therefore helpless to resist the malign influence of men like adelbert ames
2294847 it was a crucial moment in which the whole fate of reconstruction and negro citizenship hung in the balance
2294848 time was short and the level of civil disorder was as high as it had ever been in american history
2294849 by now quite obviously equipped with both a conventional political organization and a terrorist one
2294850 part of what makes a great editor is what you take out not just what you leave in
2294851 are generally those that have the stamp of one mans personality
2294852 recognized the concept of the auteur long before it was officially promulgated
2294853 altered race relations overturned ingrained practices subverted traditions ushered in political change transformed institutions undermined a way of life and even turned cities upside down
2294854 the impact of the civil rights movement differed from person to person family to family town to town in the end few escaped its long reach some white southerners attested to liberating experiences that forever altered their racial attitudes and behavior others found new ways to resist racial equality many more clung to any sense of normalcy they could salvage at times willfully ignorant of the tumult around them still change seeped into life in ways whites had barely conceived and scarcely contemplated
2294855 peeled any layers of respectability from the pro segregation position
2294856 threw many whites who thought they inhabited a middle ground into the flames of a revolution
2294857 detested members of the mobs for their crass tactics and for their assumption that they could impose their will upon an entire community
2294858 eventually helped to break the white boycott of new orleans public schools
2294859 they could learn to live with if not embrace integration
2294860 maybe it will be like cold water in a swimming pool once youve been in awhile you get used to it and it just isnt so freezing after all
2294861 i dont like all this i never did and i wont ever the nigra doesnt even want what those civil rights types keep saying theres nothing to do but go on weve got to take it and most of the time we just forget about the whole thing and just go about our business the nigra likes his people and we like ours and if theres mixing in libraries or restaurants thats o k it wont bust us we know that now
2294862 the majority of blacks are happy and content over the way things used to be the majority of the negroes do not want to go to school with us
2294863 a world of safety valves one that included all white private schools country clubs and expensive suburbs
2294864 drew in some white southerners who earlier in the decade had stood horrified at the sight of segregationist mobs
2294865 deplored riots feared a civil rights struggle shorn of its nonviolent heart and chafed under court ordered school integration busing and the tax burden imposed by an active federal government
2294866 we the black and the white deeply need each other here if we are really to become a nation the price of the liberation of the white people is the liberation of the blacks
2294867 white southerners made a concerted effort to forget the very past that continued to define them
2294868 im not a fan of books that examine humor in a scientific fashion
2294869 if i ever see another book called the serious side of comedy im going to throw up the closer you get to understanding humor the more you begin to lose your sense of humor
2294870 comedy is a way to bring logic to an illogical situation of which there are many in everyday life ive always likened what i do to the man who is convinced that he is the last sane man on earth this guy is like the paul revere of psychotics running through the town and yelling this is crazy a long time ago i read a news item that illustrated this point nicely an engineer at a palm springs tv station had a private porno tape that he was playing for his buddies in the late shift somehow he accidentally transmitted the tape over the air the strange thing was that the station didnt receive a single telephone call while the tape was playing but the minute it was over the phone lines lit up with outraged callers
2294871 the gag about a guy who is having an affair with his boss wife
2294872 viagra may be the word that causes people to become a little uptight because they arent sure whats coming next
2294873 im one of those passengers who arrives at the airport five or six hours early so i can throw back a few drinks and muster up the courage to board the plane
2294874 apparently im not alone because ive never been in an empty airport bar i dont care what time you get there even at 8 00 a m you have to fight your way to the bar at that hour everyone drinks blood marys so no one can tell its booze at least until they fall off their chair
2294875 good evening id like to welcome you aboard the mrs grace l ferguson airline and storm door company i dont know how much you know about our airline weve only been in business about a week our airline was founded on the premise that what the american public wanted was low cost overseas transportation weve attempted to eliminate what we call in the airline business frills and extras like maintenance and a whole bunch of technical instruments have you ever had one that hangs on for about four or five days i dont mind the headache so much but its that damn double vision
2294876 theory of accounting if you got within a couple bucks it was okay
2294877 swapping absurd stories on the telephone with my friend ed gallagher who worked in advertising
2294878 wanted to see if i could somehow make a living at being funny i had to find out if what people had been telling me up to that point in my life was true that i was funny i had to leave the world of accounting and see if i could earn a living at being funny
2294879 i didnt want to give the impression to a company that i had any intention of staying on
2294880 shot to no 1 on the billboard record charts and soon became a true phenomenon
2294881 the culmination of my surreal year came at the 1961 grammy awards saluting the best of 1960 i won best new artist of the year best comedy performance for the button down mind strikes back and album of the year for the button down mind in the album of the year category i beat out frank sinatra it just got back to me recently that frank was mad that he didnt win amazing but then again it didnt take much to upset frank
2294882 was part of that change that shook up the dull eisenhower years along with shelley berman mike nichols and elaine may jonathan winters and of course lenny bruce
2294883 we did situational comedy we told stories and comedic vignettes time magazine dubbed us the sick comics because our stories poked at supposedly sacred topics i was dealing with a revered ex president abraham lincoln shelley did a bit on the taboo topic of suicide mike and elaine did a funeral routine our audience was equally nontraditional college kids made up our fan base nightclubs were expensive so the college kids ordered pizza and beer and sat around listening to comedy records our comedy albums became their nightclubs
2294884 i recorded several comedy albums i starred in several television series all of which have my name in the title i acted in several movies that didnt have my name in the title all the while ive been married to the same woman for forty three years had four children played countless rounds of golf and met some interesting people
2294885 bedded down alongside the georgetown pike strung out along a five mile stretch from gaithersburg to rockville
2294886 nearly all of whom were physically incapacitated in some way or had never fired a weapon
2294887 if early broke through the ring of forts surrounding the city confederate veterans would be running loose on the streets of washington d c the
2294888 his ranks were thinned by the hundreds of men killed or severely wounded at monocacy
2294889 of those remaining large numbers were unfit for battle because they suffered from exhaustion after marching two days after the fight at monocacy in what union prisoner of war w g duckett called the almost suffocating heat
2294890 would be forced to send a significant number of his troops from outside richmond and petersburg to defend the union capital
2294891 the july 9 1864 fight at monocacy has come to be known as the battle that saved washington it was it also very possibly was the battle that played a pivotal role in the series of events that started with lees june 12 1864 order to send early to the shenandoah valley that series of events prolonged the civil war for as many as nine long months
2294892 commander of the eighth army corps and of the middle department based in baltimore
2294893 all of delaware and maryland from baltimore west to the monocacy river
2294894 was in effect the military governor of the city of baltimore with nearly 250 000 people the nations third largest and the state
2294895 the monocacy river in front of him a river with few easily crossed fords
2294896 the last thing he wanted was an all out field battle against a significant enemy force bolstered by hardened veteran sixth corps troops holding high ground on the other side of a river
2294897 believing he said to his dying day that by holding up early for nearly an entire day he had reached his goal of giving grant time to get experienced troops up from petersburg to defend washington and letting union army chief of staff henry halleck know with no degree of uncertainty that early and his men would be moving on a beeline toward washington
2294898 pamela has been in my sights for quite some months and im delighted to announce her involvement in my show
2294899 we make sure we have mommy and daddy nights out our child comes first obviously but there are certain things you can do
2294900 once we know hes in good hands we go out late at night and have a few drinks then well come home dim the lights and do our thing and im not going into any more detail than that
2294901 when it comes to things like our cozy naked sundays i think its important for jordan and i not to lose ourselves of course having a child requires a lot of time and attention but we think its really important to still have mommy and daddy time
2294902 lately my mother has said i wish you were gay considering your choice of men

2294905 after everyones tucked in their bed ill be making the rounds for room service
2294906 the land allocated for the pilgrims needs to restored this is not a view held by hindus only but by people of all religions across the country
2294907 we stand for the fact that muslims in india love their motherland anyone who stands in our way is not a true muslim or a hindu
2294908 one of the few welcome lessons age teaches is that only desire trumps time
2294909 writers can tell any lie that leaps into their heads
2294910 we are not made strong enough to stand up against endless grief
2294911 a trade post out at the edge of the cherokee nation
2294912 was hardly bigger than the parlor room of my aunts house
2294913 possessor of the deepest and sharpest mind to which i have ever been exposed
2294914 it is tempting to look back at bears people from the perspective of this modern world and see them as changeless and pure authentic people in ways impossible for anybody to be anymore we need noble savages for our own purposes our happy imaginings about them and the pure world they occupied do us good when incoherent change overwhelms us but even in those early days when i was first getting to know bear and his people i could see that change and brutal loss had been all they had experienced for two centuries it was not any kind of original people left no wild indians at all and little raw wilderness they were damaged people and they lived in a broken world like everybody else
2294915 if you were born or adopted into a clan you were cherokee everybody else was an outsider so when bear made his offer it was not only between him and me it was also a deal with his whole people and thus a matter of identity for them and for me and for him
2294916 to put the whole history of the human heart on the head of a pin
2294917 the great american story the who overcame the unfortunate circumstances of its birth to be accepted in the more rarified world of the gentry
2294918 rum has always had a distinctly american swagger it is untutored and proud of it raffish often unkempt and a little bit out of control the history of rum tends toward the ignoble many times pleasingly so rum in short has been one of those rare objects in which america has invested its own image like moonglow the life of america is reflected back in each incarnation of rum
2294919 became the de facto national drink of many of the troops
2294920 fractious islanders cracking one another over the head in rumbustious entanglements at island tippling houses
2294921 rum was the gin of the new world but it was more than a quick ticket to a fast drunk rums rise marked a rite of passage for the struggling colonists merely by drinking it they effectively announced a change in their role on the global stage they were no longer a people who made do with crude and rustic beverages concocted in their own kitchens they could now pay for valued goods with the sweat of their labor
2294922 one of the first mass market products manufactured in america
2294923 its no coincidence that distillers and rum merchants were in the forefront of the political and armed resistance
2294924 had become de facto community centers virtual petri dishes for the breeding of a discontent that taverners learned to channel
2294925 the value of the rum for slaves trade was minimal
2294926 no spirit benefited from the long national drought as much as rum
2294927 with ample supplies in the islands and a newly developed taste for the stuff among everyday americans this three hundred year old spirit emerged from its century long slumber into a bright new day
2294928 from the distinctive toward the unexceptional from full flavored to light
2294929 a simple drink its basically a rum collins with the addition of mint
2294930 a moral issue as old as the scriptures and as clear as the american constitution
2294931 at times he was capable of genuine acts of compassion and thoughtfulness on other occasions he was cold disparaging and notoriously unresponsive and never more so than when blacks criticized the inadequacy of his policies even at moments of great crisis he could display a numbing indifference to violence and bloodshed
2294932 tended to be cold and calculating when organized civil rights protesters tried to pressure him into taking a political stand he was much more sympathetic to individuals who had suffered directly from the violent outrages of segregation
2294933 still did not fully comprehend what blacks were up against in pockets of fierce segregationist resistance like birmingham
2294934 job each morning was to lay out the presidents clothes
2294935 where the only blacks allowed into the dining room were stewards with napkins folded over their arms
2294936 the very gestures that black leaders and liberals derided as token were in fact highly effective in terms of sustaining widespread black support
2294937 battled hard for new civil rights legislation and fought tenaciously on behalf of black residents in the district of columbia
2294938 as for the son of the slave woman i will make a nation of him also because he is your offspring
2294939 just hear aunt hagars chilun harmonizin to that old mournful tune its like choir from on high broke loose if the devil brought it the good lord sent it right down to me let the congregation join while i sing those lovin aunt hagars blues

2294941 her father took a second job in the evenings and the family which included a younger brother stayed near the bottom of the middle class a few paychecks from the lower class in which the parents had been raised and which they had thought they would not have to see again
2294942 they shared food they shared stories about home about southern places that would be the foundation of their lives in the north none of them could know that the cohesion born and nurtured in the south would be but memory in less than two generations
2294943 where south carolina old folks said people threw away their dishes after every meal because it was cheaper to buy new ones
2294944 they treat colored people like kings and queens in washington cause thas where the president lives would they treat colored people anything but good in a city where the president hangs his hat and pets his dog and snores beside mrs president every night now would they no course not they wouldnt do such a thing to us

2294946 it might have been all the grandparents he saw before him all the people who had struggled into old age only to find themselves parents once again all of them the kind of people the preacher had built his rock on the world was turned upside down when the mature ones were forced to do what the younger ones should be doing
2294947 we want we rage we desire we fail we succeed we stand in that long long line
2294948 the heart can be cruel the heart can be wicked the heart can give joy but it is always an instrument we can never understand
2294949 her heart was breaking but that was in the nature of hearts she told herself it was also in their nature to heal for however long it took six months a year two years
2294950 no man should be put to death where so much doubt exists
2294951 if it had not been for these thing i might have live out my life talking at street corners to scorning men i might have die unmarked unknown a failure now we are not a failure this is our career and our triumph never in our full life can we hope to do such work for tolerance for justice for mans understanding of man as we now do by dying our words our lives our pains nothing the taking of our lives lives of a good shoemaker and a poor fish peddler all that last moment belongs to us that agony is our triumph
2294952 the reporter admitted he had taken hasty notes and possibly enhanced them
2294953 it had all been over in a minute one crime had been committed one car had picked up the bandits one bandit had fired from its passenger seat but as the crowd began to babble a kaleidoscope of impressions swirled around the scene
2294954 smoking and speaking a foreign language that identified them as dagos
2294955 between the civil war and world war i the commonwealth never elected a single democratic senator nor gave a majority of votes to a democratic presidential candidate
2294956 reached a verdict in three hours but decided it would look hasty if announced so soon
2294957 this long and dolorous calvary this terrible and iniquitous bastile
2294958 they were making out in a corner for pretty much the whole evening before they moved over to another sofa where they joked and posed for photographers
2294959 we decided from a brand profile point of view this was a good thing
2294960 the races will take place all over europe and hopefully the middle east and far east as well

2294962 if she wants to send email lets help her go digital and send some email
2294963 the fact that the rss bjp has given a call for a three day all india bandh on this issue is indicative of its desire to utilise it to whip up communal passions further in order to try and consolidate its hindu vote bank
2294964 well what about other types of emergencies what about diseases and other illnesses
2294965 unless the country is protected dharma cannot be protected and unless dharma is protected the country cannot be protected
2294966 foods weve been eating for a long time in the case of meat fish and eggs for millions of years
2294967 to me traditional means the way we used to eat them that means different things for different ingredients fruits and vegetables are best when theyre local and seasonal grains should be whole fats and oils unrefined from the farm to the factory to the kitchen real food is produced and prepared the old fashioned way but not out of mere nostalgia in each of these examples of real food the traditional method of farming processing preparing and cooking enhances nutrition and flavor while the industrial method diminishes both
2294968 an industrial tomato for example is bred to be solid and thick skinned the better to tolerate mechanical harvesting washing packaging and long distance shipping uniform shape and size are also important flavor and texture take a back seat
2294969 are produced on large industrial farms with methods that degrade the environment and diminish nutrition
2294970 raise animals with humane and ecological methods for local and national markets
2294971 a two hundred year old white box with black shutters
2294972 the first is that the knowledge one gains in undertaking a major home improvement project is inevitably the knowledge one ought to have had before attempting it in the first place the second is that a house is far less complicated than the average ignorant homeowner usually assumes the seldom seen spaces inside walls floors and ceilings arent filled with circuit boards laser beams and liquid helium for the most part they contain nothing but insulation mouse nests and stale smelling air the difficult parts of a house are relatively few and compact and they fit together in a logical way and when they malfunction they do so for reasons that can almost always be discovered understood and dealt with every time i learned something new about my house my anxiety about it lessened
2294973 home improvement is a powerful creative act maybe the most ambitious creative act that all but the true artists among us will ever undertake remodeling a room building an addition planting a garden even installing a bathroom sink are all forms of three dimensional self expression over time houses evolve into structural extensions of the people who live inside them our shelters become projections of our selves
2294974 construction is a sequence of logical steps you cut this board then you cut that board then you join the two boards together some of the steps are more complicated than others but all of them can be described and understood and they can be performed by human beings
2294975 it is a sign of the essential depravity of the american psyche that kitchens have become more important in peoples minds as cooking has become less
2294976 many new houses dont have traditional living rooms and if you live in an old house you probably understand why most living rooms defy occupancy a living room is like the ancient tuxedo that hangs in the back of your closet its designed for a part of your life that exists mainly in your imagination
2294977 not in my most creative moment could i conjure up a story as rich and as layered
2294978 a fascinating book a wonderful reminder of how good true crime writing can be
2294979 a 21 year old local girl a pretty girl dark haired slender athletic popular with the boys and very independent
2294980 in the ladies restroom she said she would feel safer if one of her girlfriends would spend the night at her place but she did not say what worried her
2294981 a friendly place filled with people who speak to strangers and always to each other and are anxious to help anyone in need
2294982 brutal rape and murder of a young woman was terrifying and the town seethed with gossip speculation and fear
2294983 either slipped away or was conveniently ignored or was simply neglected
2294984 was not fingerprinted nor did he give saliva and hair samples
2294985 as an unemployed guitar picker who lived with his mother drank too much and acted strange
2294986 there was not a single fingerprint lifted from the carter apartment that matched either ron or dennis fritz a gaping hole in the theory that the two were there during the prolonged and violent attack there were no eyewitnesses no one heard a sound that night
2294987 case against ron consisted of two inconclusive polygraph exams a bad reputation a residence not far from that of the victims and the delayed half baked eyewitness identification of glen gore
2294988 was a suspect only because of his friendship with ron
2294989 the u s supreme court approved the resumption of executions in 1976
2294990 since 1990 oklahoma has executed more convicts on a per capita basis than any other state no place not even texas comes close

2294992 the semen from the crime scene excluded ron williamson and dennis fritz
2294993 until the system is fixed it could happen to anyone
2294994 that bathroom seemed like a witches house the stained walls had traces of hook shaped hands of screams of despair everywhere the scaling walls opened their toothless mouths oozing dampness over the mirror because it didnt fit anywhere else theyd hung a macabre still life of pale bream and onions against a black background madness smiled from the bent faucets
2294995 brought back in a rush all my hopes regarding barcelona until the moment id entered this atmosphere of perverse people and furniture i was afraid to get into the bed that resembled a coffin i think i was trembling with indefinable terrors when i put out the candle
2294996 i thought that any joy in my life had to be paid for with something unpleasant
2294997 not only saw herself as strong and capable of leading multitudes but also as sweet unfortunate and persecuted
2294998 mix those two worlds that were beginning to stand out so clearly in my life my student friendships with their easy cordiality and my dirty unwelcoming house
2294999 in the heat of summer it has a beauty thats oppressive and a little sad
2295000 i remember the first autumn nights and how they intensified my first moments of disquiet in the house and the winter nights with their damp melancholy the creak of a chair interrupting my sleep and the shudder of my nerves when i discovered two small shining eyes the cats eyes fixed on mine in those icy hours there were certain moments when life broke with all sense of modesty before my eyes and appeared naked shouting sad intimacies which for me were only horrifying intimacies that the morning took care to erase as if theyd never even existed later came the summer nights sweet dense mediterranean nights over barcelona with golden juice flowing from the moon with the damp odor of sea nymphs combing their watery hair over white shoulders over the scales of golden tails on one of those hot nights hunger sadness and the power of my youth brought me to a swoon of feeling a physical need for tenderness as avid and dusty as scorched earth with a presentiment of the storm
2295001 brutalized by lack of freedom censorship prejudices hypocrisy and isolation
2295002 the unsurpassable title says everything about the novel and the city where it takes place
2295003 property is emotion its who we are its how we feel its our identity not just the land and the people the very house you move into a big house you become a louder person maybe you move into a new place you attract new people and gradually over time you change you become new so what are we saying is effecting this change the person or the space around them its not a lounge its us thats why i got into this line of work mark property is our modern religion
2295004 the following night i broke into his apartment and stole everything that wasnt nailed down
2295005 my hands were hot but everything else felt cool i was on a roll now this was sunday shopping i was hitting my stride
2295006 in the back row right next to me i was smiling too i dusted both our faces clear there was a lot of dust it was a long time ago
2295007 their owners would recall that moment of sensation for years afterward the dislocation the disbelief the realization that they had been burgled they would remember the words as they broke the news to friends or their families their voices trembling but beyond the moment of discovery the fear doesnt last people rationalise what has gone missing after time they become almost grateful in your imagination theres always something worse to lose
2295008 letting me know how sharp she was the young girl the rich girl burning a little brighter than everyone else
2295009 by the next night everyone in the country knew what she looked like but nobody could say where she was
2295010 a girl had disappeared without trace she had walked out one night and never come back and that was it
2295011 listening to harry made me realise what had been really going on it wasnt about me and it wasnt even about him all this time i thought id been breaking into places and stealing stuff in fact id been doing the opposite i had stepped into other peoples lives and walked through their homes but i hadnt been looking for their secrets i had been checking on mine i had been looking for caroline since she left us all
2295012 an ethical wonderland in which up is down and right is wrong
2295013 it is a place where a powerful wall street broker is willing to manipulate the stock market on behalf of people still using sippy cups so i think it is safe to say that it is a world where things have gone awry an elaborate system designed to ensure that children end up in the right nursery school so that they can attend the right elementary school so that they can gain entrance to the high school ivy league so that they can gain admission to the actual ivy league what happens after that seems to be superfluous and the pressure only grows as the children get older until you find yourself face to face with a student or worse a parent who believes that changing the b you have just given to an a will somehow be the difference between harvard and south dakota community college
2295014 to present myself as a writer while not actually having to write which was just about the best of all possible worlds

2295016 emma to my knightley not as some dirty old man lusting after one of his students as some of you are probably thinking as a kind of mentor someone who would teach her to be a little less haughty and a little more humane
2295017 at least on the days that she decided to wear any underwear at all
2295018 some students allowance consisted of twenty thousand dollars or more deposited in their own checking account at the start of the school year
2295019 had questioned my intelligence my competence as a teacher and my masculinity all in the service of moving his daughter from a b to an a

2295026 while the saga of fanny hill will undoubtedly never replace little red riding hood as a popular bedtime story it is quite possible that were fanny to be transposed from her mid 18th century georgian surroundings to our present day society she might conceivably encounter many things which would cause her to blush
2295027 if i have painted vice in all its gayest colours if i have decked it with flowers it has been solely in order to make the worthier the solemner sacrifice of it to virtue
2295028 he was the universe to me and all that was not him was nothing to me
2295029 had anyone but a few instants before told me that i should have ever known any man but charles i would have spat in his face or had i been offered infinitely a greater sum of money than that i saw paid for me i had spurned the proposal in cold blood but our virtues and our vices depend too much on our circumstances i considered myself as so much in his power that i endured his kisses and embraces without affecting struggles or anger not that they as yet gave me any pleasure or prevailed over the aversion of my soul to give myself up to any sensation of that sort what i suffered i suffered out of a kind of gratitude and as a matter of course after what had passed
2295030 a kept mistress in form well lodged with a very sufficient allowance and lighted up with all the lustre of dress
2295031 a very handsome young lad scarce turned of nineteen fresh as a rose well shaped and clever limbed in short a very good excuse for any womans liking
2295032 a middle aged discreet sort of woman came to offer her cordial advice and service to me
2295033 because keeping a house of conveniency there were no lengths in lewdness she would not advise me to go
2295034 i f i may judge from my own experience none are better paid or better treated during their reign than the mistresses of those who enervated by nature debaucheries or age have the least employment for the sex sensible that a woman must be satisfied some way they ply her with a thousand little tender attentions presents caresses confidences and exhaust their invention in means and devices to make up for the capital deficiency but here is their misfortune that when by a course of teasing worrying handling wanton postures lascivious motions they have at length accomplished a flashy enervated enjoyment they have at the same time lighted up a flame in the object of their passion that not having the means themselves to quench drives her for relief into the next persons arms who can finish their work

2295037 must be a very nasty sort of person indeed a sci fi villain like ming the merciless
2295038 it is not a coincidence that this book has largely concentrated on how unspeak is used simultaneously to advance and disguise the claims of war and corporate interests the masterpieces of the art are indeed ethnic cleansing war on terror repetitive administration rhetorically unspeak is a kind of invasive procedure it wants to bypass critical thinking and implant a foreign body of opinion directly in the soft tissue of the brain perhaps for this reason it seems to have a particular affinity with projects of violence
2295039 seeks to annihilate distinctions between anti social and criminal resources and human beings cleansing and killing combatant and civilian abuse and torture
2295040 names became weapons weapons were given persuasive names distinctions were deliberately blurred realities were denied punishments as confucius predicted did not fit the crimes language created a permanent culture of war
2295041 the word is a weapon rather than a badge its function is to essentialise and delegitimise the target if his victims are innocent the terrorist is evil so george w bush characterizes al qaeda as these vicious and evil men these evil ones evil people and even evil folks a phrase that packs a weird combination of homeliness and biblical disapprobation now there is little question that if the word evil means anything it can justly be applied to acts of deliberate murder yet there is a difference between calling an act evil and a person evil just as there is a difference between terrorism and terrorist to call a person evil is to shut down argument to deny forever the possibility of negotiation to go on the theological offensive
2295042 its much easier to take the language thats given to you and the government knows that full well so if you keep saying coalition forces coalition forces people will use it i think people do need to be more careful they do take phrases willy nilly from the government without thinking without seriously analysing what they say
2295043 taken as a whole 1973 was a cultural watershed a moment of major realignments and shifts in american politics culture and society this year marked not just the end of the sixties but the onset of a debate one that continues to this day about the legacy of that turbulent decade at the same time this year was alive with a sense of new possibilities and openings to the future harbingers of an emerging new postmodern cultural configuration

2295069 were between the ages of fourteen and seventeen native born and male
2295070 the precise dimensions of the pickpockets world remain impossible to measure purloined goods were rarely recovered and even smaller proportions of pickpockets were ever prosecuted in the seventeen known years in which george appo worked as a pickpocket for example he was arrested for and convicted of larceny four times to the average law abiding citizen four convictions were considerable but appo picked hundreds quite possibly thousands of pockets without being apprehended once while working a county fair outside toronto appo pickpocketed approximately twenty five different individuals his four arrests for pickpocketing quite likely account for less maybe much less than 1 percent of all his thefts

2295077 began to think what a fool i was to go back to the opium pipe after being away from it for so long
2295078 if i could break away so easily and so often as i had from the opium habit why not muster up nerve enough to break away from a crooked life i made up my mind to try again to get honest employment and to reform without fear or favor
2295079 concluded that a formal education and better environmental influences could have enabled appo to become an intelligent and estimable person

2295083 science cant do justice to the taste for cold the appeal of ice cream that does not pass the sybaritic moment of consumption when cold turns to sweetness and warmed by the body slides down the throat to the most cordial of receptions the cycle of the seasons turns from winter to summer with every bite over and over again ice cream is the release of flavour captured ingeniously vivaciously in ice thats what the taste for cold is all about

2295104 history will say that the peace loving kashmiri hindus did not escalate the problem like the pandavas they only wanted the 5 villages so that they could peacefully exist but were denied even a pilgrimage to their homeland by insensitive politicians and communalists it is then that they demanded their full fair share the issue of denial of services to amarnathji pilgrims must open our eyes to the reality of kashmir today and shake us from lethargy in the least we should make our cause to be as espoused as the tibetan cause

2295126 we were the lucky ones we first citizens of film
2295127 for all his destructiveness and ferocity and self doubt he turned out to be an exceptional father with heroic energies
2295128 plunged right ahead with fatherhood striding up its trail at full charge
2295129 its funny as an editor she was maternal but as a mother she was editorial
2295130 nobody in our family was much of a hugger to tell the truth mother least of all
2295131 he was a grownup but there was a readiness for play in him that lasted all his life luckily i didnt need another father and that freed us up
2295132 though subject to nerves he possessed something like that invisible extra beat of time that great athletes show on the field dogs and children were easy for him because he approached them as a participant instead of a winner when andy without his trying and almost without my noticing it taught me how to sail or how to row or how to lure a flounder with a bit of periwinkle as bait and in some part how to write ease seemed to be the whole trick he let things emerge like the time he unexpectedly put his nearly empty bottle of pabst or schlitz down on the carpet in front of his big dachshund fred who sniffed about and soon found that by laying one paw on the neck he could tip the last of the beer toward the top of the bottle and lap it out then he ate the label

2295136 are in house affairs the books and articles written in language that the uninitiated find inaccessible and often incomprehensible
2295137 mostly biographies that became a publishing sensation because of their unforeseen popularity
2295138 the source of this founders surge need not concern us here though clearly there is an audience for serious history about our origins that the academy has largely ignored the major point is that the founders and the founding are back in a big way as serious topics of public conversation the long latent interest in our origins the old how did it happen question has become relevant again and most importantly one of the hallmarks of the recent founders surge is the emphasis on flawed greatness the coexistence of intellectual depth and personal shallowness the role of contingency and sheer accident instead of divine providence the founding has at last begun to become the topic in an adult conversation rather than a juvenile melodrama populated only by heroes or villains
2295139 we are beginning to forget that the patriots of former days were men like ourselves and we are almost irresistibly led to ascribe to them in our imaginations certain gigantic proportions and superhuman qualities without reflecting that this at once robs their character of consistency and their virtues of all merit

2295142 if historiographers should be hardy enough to fill the page of history with the advantages that have been gained with unequal numbers on the part of america in the course of this contest and attempt to relate the distressing circumstances under which they have been obtained it is more than probable that posterity will bestow on their labors the epithet and marks of fiction for it will not be believed that such a force as great britain has employed for eight years in country could be baffled in their plan of subjugating it by numbers infinitely less composed of men oftentimes half starved always in rags without pay and experiencing at times every species of distress which human nature is capable of undergoing

2295145 a triumph on a par with the winning of independence and the adoption of the constitution
2295146 the inability to think about any racially mixed presence on the continent as anything other than a blot the failure to recognize the opportunity presented by the purchase to revisit the native american question so as to avoid removal but rather to exploit it in order to hasten it the unwillingness to use this extraordinary occasion to promote the possibility of prohibiting the expansion of slavery into the louisiana territory to be sure it would have required an act of incredible leadership to have raised the forbidden question of slavery leadership on a par with that demonstrated by jefferson and the other founders in 1776 and 1787 though it is somewhat difficult to believe the evidence that has survived suggests that jefferson never gave the matter any thought if true this was his greatest failure of all and the tragedy that would come back to haunt his triumph with a vengeance

2295154 consider the improbability of it that the multiple complaints of a people could somehow coalesce and find expression in an act in any act of violence what does a car bomb say about poverty or the execution of a rural mayor explain about disenfranchisement the war had become if it wasnt from the very beginning an indecipherable text the country had slipped fallen into a nightmare now horrifying now comic and in the city there was only a sense of dismay at the inexplicability of it had it begun with a voided election or the murder of a popular senator who could remember now even nine years ago anyone paying attention should have known what was coming but they had stepped together into this chaos the insurgency and the government arm in arm and for nine violent years theyd danced

2295157 the transformation was total and shocking i had expected to see myself disguised but this was something else i was imprisoned in the flesh of an utter stranger an unsympathetic one with whom i felt no kinship i looked into the mirror and saw reflected nothing of the white john griffins past no the reflections led back to africa back to the shanty and the ghetto back to the fruitless struggles against the mark of blackness i had tampered with the mystery of existence and i had lost the sense of my own being this is what devastated me the griffin that was had become invisible

2295159 an important part of my daily life was spent searching for the basic things that all whites take for granted a place to eat or somewhere to find a drink of water a rest room somewhere to wash my hands more than once i walked into drugstores where a negro can buy cigarettes or anything else except soda fountain service

2295168 the criterion is nothing but the color of skin my experience proved that whites judged me by no other quality my skin was dark that was sufficient reason for them to deny me those rights and freedoms without which life loses its significance and becomes a matter of little more than animal survival

2295180 it was nt easy tolerating him talking this way to her to bear his scorn his ridicule his insults his walking past her like she was nothing but a house cat but after four years of marriage mariam saw clearly how much a woman could tolerate when she was afraid and mariam was afraid she lived in fear of his shifting moods his volatile temperament his insistence on steering even mundane exchanges down a confrontational path that on occasion he would resolve with punches slaps kicks and sometimes try to make amends for with polluted apologies and sometimes not

2295200 this familialness this cupboard love is intrinsic to a larger mediterranean culture in which sons go into the family business and bring their wives to live in their parents house in which loyalty duty respect for elders and the collective good take precedence over modern notions of self fulfillment behind these customs lies the understanding that the world is a vicious place in which loners get devoured by wolves that its only by sticking together and looking after ones own that theres any hope of getting by
2295201 because they dont have the ambition or the patience or the know how that can solidify your gains translate wealth into less transient goods such as education or health care or political influence
2295202 among the people i meet in roussillon there is an inherited mediterranean culture a conception of the good life which is in many ways antithetical to the reigning free market ethic instead of ingenuity and enterprise what people value is neighborliness respect stability leisure here its considered proper for men as well as women to put family life before career a man who leaves for the office at dawn and comes home just in time to give his children a good night kiss isnt thought to be making a sacrifice but a selfish mistake
2295203 women may not leave the house without their husbands permission they are not supposed to drive cars smoke cigarettes or drink alcohol they may not wear trousers or skirts above the ankle all they are allowed to do in fact is stay at home covered in head to toe black scrubbing floors cooking waiting on the men and making sure their daughters are never seen talking to a boy

2295205 ill start when theres been a death in the family
2295206 just three weeks after you have started reading this book you will be smoking and maybe even enjoying your first cigarette
2295207 it was after my exams that i first felt like giving up its the times when youre least stressed that its so tempting to throw in the towel so i try to make sure that im in stressful situations or find something worrying to think about and that usually gets me reaching for another smoke
2295208 the hardest times are when i go to places like gyms or health spas being surrounded by temptation is really hard sometimes especially when you see how much other people are enjoying themselves and how healthy they look but i stuck with it and tried to steer clear of those environments while i was forming the addiction now im so hooked that i dont really spend much time in places like that before nipping out for a smoke
2295209 its 2 a m and i have run out of matches and cant find a lighter

2295211 i am going to catch more colds than my non smoking friends and acquaintances they are going to last longer and involve mucus
2295212 you must also prepare yourself for the sad reality that many people will delight in telling you that the reason you have so many colds is because you smoke for the most part and especially if the person telling you is a doctor nurse or pharmacist it is best to remember that they are right nod your humble agreement and make a mental note to spend more time with musicians or comedians in the future
2295213 all we will say here is that it is now widely believed that mobile phones microwaves asbestos loft insulation x ray machines farmed salmon and department store elevators can give you cancer that cigarettes sit comfortably in that list is hardly breaking news
2295214 i know only that i will smoke today that i will smoke tomorrow and do humbly place my destiny into the hands of addiction
2295215 i promise not to bring smoking into disrepute by being seen in public smoking and crying at the same time
2295216 i will not attempt to teach my dog to smoke

2295220 full of fun with a quick wit an abounding sense of humor an easy ability to make friends from all walks of life and an intense intellectual curiosity
2295221 the door to the corridor was open leaving the room i headed nimbly along it and down the stairs into the lobby and out on to the street i knew this excursion came under the monkeying about heading yet i could not resist it the street called to me as a gold nugget must beckon to a prospector until then my life had been bounded by my parents small suburban garden a nearby playing field an ancient tractor and more recently a ships rail now it was colorfully lit boundless unknown exciting and throbbing with adventurous potential
2295222 at the time i was not to know it but these streets were to be my patch my playground and i was to become as well known in them as any of the shopkeepers
2295223 was not unduly averse to my wandering the streets and i began ranging more widely
2295224 was famously street safe muggings were unheard of child molesters non existent and street violence usually restricted to a territorial fight amongst hawkers and stallholders the nearest a european was likely to come to crime was when he had his pocket picked
2295225 my blond hair considered by the chinese to be the color of gold and therefore likely to impart wealth or good fortune was my passport to many a nook and cranny of chinese life it was also the reason why whilst walking down the street a passer by would often briefly stroke my head i was a walking talking talisman

2295230 i thought about it i had been happy in hong kong it had been an exciting place in which to live and i was sure it had much to offer that i had yet to uncover however there was more to it than that i felt i had grown up in hong kong i could recall little of my life prior to the corfu it was as if my memory my actual existence had begun the moment my foot had touched the dock in algiers england was as strange a place to me now as hong kong had been on that june morning in 1952 in short i felt i belonged there
2295231 but there isnt much doubt about the origins of the form itself vaudeville evolved from saloons from variety shows from dime theaters from minstrel shows from burlesque from opera and legitimate theater from the circus and the freak show trav s d argues convincingly that it ultimately emerged as a reaction against the earthy smutty character of some of its predecessors that it was presented as a clean family friendly alternative to the saloon and the honky tonk business a paying operation that provides a living for the wide variety of professionals involved that requires managers
2295232 when people make reference to vaudeville it is really the business infrastructure they are talking about the great network of famous circuits that stretched from canada to americas southernmost precincts and brought the same high quality professional entertainment to lobstermen in maine meatpackers in chicago miners in scranton ranchers in texas and garment workers in new york
2295233 look what the story offers a great fire a cultural calamity the spectacle of public officials blaming each other an unseemly rush for the money to rebuild the theater the satisfaction of a trial with guilty verdicts and jail sentences the pride of the fenices rebirth and an unsolved mystery money secretly changing hands unnamed culprits hiding in the shadows it stimulates the imagination gives people the freedom to make up any scenario they want what more could anyone ask

2295242 happy christmases are all alike every unhappy christmas is unhappy in its own way
2295243 the lions share of the blame for this must rest on the shoulders of my stepfather a good man who probably could not help but ruin the holidays for the rest of us because he himself had endured christmases so biblically dreadful that he knew no other way the linchpin of this entire story lies in the fact that my stepfather shared a birthday with the baby jesus and so spent his entire childhood without a birthday present or a birthday party or even a nice birthday wish from his mother every christmas wreath and stocking and package wrapped in reindeer covered paper dredged up the whole horrible memory for him again so that by christmas morning he was nothing but a blur of grief there was always a good bit of weeping beneath the tree in tennessee
2295244 as a jewish adult living in a christian world i find that most people generally assume everyone celebrates christmas and thats okay we get to wade in some of the joy and jingle without having to do any of the heavy lifting
2295245 some things to know yes i am jewish and therefore it is fair to say that i have no business celebrating christmas in the first place but my mothers counter to that comment was always we celebrate thanksgiving and were not pilgrims and as is often the way with converts and infidels we celebrated christmas with all the hoopla as if we were to the manger born true there was no mention or display of this being a religious holiday it was about santa claus and elves and stockings hung by the fireplace and good cheer and a big dinner and sugar cookies and gifts gifts and more gifts

2295247 i decided not to recoil from jamess snoring but to welcome it accept it treat it like part of the environment i mentally catalogued his fascinating assortment of snores a series of harsh booming exhales sort of like surfacing whales clearing their blowholes punctuated by raspy bleats like a buglers call to charge then a long excruciating tearing wail that sounded like a torso being fed through a mill saw
2295248 the basketball rivalry between duke and north carolina has become the greatest rivalry in college athletics and one of the greatest in all of sports it is ali versus frazier the giants versus the dodgers the red sox versus the yankees hell its bigger than that this is the democrats versus the republicans the yankees versus the confederates capitalism versus communism all right okay the life force versus the death instinct eros versus thanatos is that big enough this is a rivalry of such intensity of such hatred that otherwise reasonable adults attach to it all manner of political philosophical baggage some of which might even be true i know because im one of them
2295249 presented two faces to the world one that of a quiet fellow who liked to read and walk and ponder things and the other that of an absolute beast a guy who screamed and ranted and jumped up and down on the floor as he watched north carolina play basketball
2295250 the mythology many of us swallowed as we grew up
2295251 duke is the university as launchpad propelling its mostly out of state students into a stratosphere of success north carolina by contrast is the university as old home place equally devoted to the values of community and local service
2295252 neither duke nor carolina had a choke hold on virtue that both schools had at varying times been forces for enlightenment both locally and nationally
2295253 at moments both institutions had succumbed rather too easily to the ugliness of the age
2295254 without something to hate we should lose the very spring of thought and action
2295255 that hatred had its uses that the suppression of good honest hatred bollixed people up turned them inside out and made their niceness somehow mean
2295256 the outright expression of antagonism was good or at least the outright part was good a good honest hatred beat a dishonest love
2295257 the town liked to indulge a view of itself as a zoo of tolerance in which the keepers mingled with the animals until you couldnt remember who was an animal and who was a keeper and everybody was very proud of this confusion

2295268 to go to lengths that sukhanov himself would consider amoral
2295269 a burning contempt for his own world a world of the past a world of acquiescence and accommodation for the sake of survival
2295270 i woke up with a smile of absolute happiness upon my lips knowing that a new different life lay before me
2295271 was not a private embarrassment or a wicked foreign enchantment
2295272 sukhanov is not based on anyone i know but of course in many ways he is born of my early experiences i grew up surrounded by my parents friends people of sukhanovs generation many of them artists philosophers writers who had to make difficult choices in order to survive some of them like my father and the artist ernest neizvestny a close family friend did things they believed in and faced harsh consequences others bargained with the authorities and enjoyed certain rewards but always at a price the questions of courage and weakness perseverance and betrayal daily comfort and artistic immortality were very real concerns from my earliest years i suppose sukhanov is the fruit of my living with these questions for a long time

2295274 the lawyers have twisted it into such a state of bedevilment that the original merits of the case have long disappeared from the face of the earth its about a will and the trusts under a will or it was once its about nothing but costs now we are always appearing and disappearing and swearing and interrogating and filing and cross filing and arguing and sealing and motioning and referring and reporting and revolving about the lord chancellor and all his satellites and equitably waltzing ourselves off to dusty death about costs thats the great question all the rest by some extraordinary means has melted away

2295284 i am not at all comfortable about being the instrument of revelations
2295285 but i set out to write this book with my eyes open knowing that willie morris was an imperfect man in an imperfect world and i truly think that despite some moments of personal discomfort at bottom the best editor i ever had would not have wanted me to pull my punches
2295286 perhaps one thing set willie morris apart from all other editors in the eyes of writers far more than others he was prone to permit whatever space a writer needed for a given work that does not mean that he encouraged or accepted careless spewings so long as a writer used the space he needed wisely and well however the sky was the limit willie did not believe as virtually all magazine editors do today that readers attention spans were no wider than butterfly wings

2295288 he was wounded he was bereft he was angry and felt somehow betrayed he felt he had given much to harpers and got little back he was sore ashamed of what he saw as his failure and failure had been such a stranger to him that he didnt know how to react it was almost as if a bomb had exploded in his head and it took him more than months it literally took years for willie to recover from the resulting wounds if he ever completely healed i think it was not until the last decade of his life so originally he hid from almost everyone like a hermit in a cave among his whiskey bottles

2295298 after so much struggle it was strange that one big break an order from an importer who happened to pass through town would make milton hershey a success the classic script would call for at the very least some minor setbacks and skirmishes with tough competitors but none of those things happened instead hersheys sales abroad increased steadily giving him a secure base for his business he also exploited his recipe and the advantages of his location to build his business at home

2295310 i woke up with a smile of absolute happiness upon my lips knowing that a new different life lay before me
2295311 was not a private embarrassment or a wicked foreign enchantment
2295312 sukhanov is not based on anyone i know but of course in many ways he is born of my early experiences i grew up surrounded by my parents friends people of sukhanovs generation many of them artists philosophers writers who had to make difficult choices in order to survive some of them like my father and the artist ernest neizvestny a close family friend did things they believed in and faced harsh consequences others bargained with the authorities and enjoyed certain rewards but always at a price the questions of courage and weakness perseverance and betrayal daily comfort and artistic immortality were very real concerns from my earliest years i suppose sukhanov is the fruit of my living with these questions for a long time

2295338 had the ioc known seven years ago that there would be severe restrictions then i seriously doubt whether beijing would have been awarded the olympics
2295339 i have no interest in associating myself with the olympics or the stadium
2295340 an olympics held without freedom and against the will of a people will be nonsense because no totalitarian regime can play at being a democracy it is a pretend harmony and happiness

2295353 the generation of jewish boxers disappeared so precipitously after barney rosss reign that by the time my mother and father were seniors in high schools in 1947 and 1948 there were scarcely any jewish professional fighters of note in the united states
2295354 jews have always viewed sports participation as a means for achieving something else gaining social status or scholarships to universities or going into business not an end in itself
2295355 the bitterness and hatred inside me made me a much tougher fighter
2295356 every opponent in a street fight seemed to remind me of pas murderers and so i seemed to find extra strength in fighting them or kicking them in the groin and making them scream in agony

2295367 when world war 1 broke out in 1914 the in turkish or young turks ittihadist movement saw an opportunity to rid the country of its armenian population
2295368 xenophobic nationalism nurtured by atavistic impulses of turkism aiming at the elimination of the armenians as a non turkic and discordant minority
2295369 need to preserve and sustain the territorial integrity of the ottoman empire on the one hand and to prevent foreign involvements on the other have preoccupied the organs of the state
2295370 the massacres first targeted able bodied men for annihilation thousands of armenian men conscripted into the ottoman army were eliminated first the rest of the adult population was then placed under arrest taken out of town and killed in remote locations
2295371 nearly four million muslims of arabic kurdish turkish and balkan
2295372 and 600 000 armenians 300 000 greek and 100 000 ottoman jews perished in eastern anatolia alone
2295373 armenian revolt is one of many by christian nationalist groups seeking to create their own nations from the lands of the ottoman empire
2295374 the spring of 1915 arf seized the city of van and had
2295375 what took place in van following the rebellion by the armenians in march 1915 was typical of many towns and villages in eastern anatolia
2295376 the stories told by muslim villagers were all much the same when the armenians attacked the muslims turks kurds arabs kurds circassians lazes bosnians and others own villages or nearby villages muslims fled with whatever moveable property they could carry on the road armenian bandits first robbed them then raped many of the women and killed many of the men usually but not always a number of women and young children were killed as well the surviving villagers were then left to travel to safety if they could without food or adequate clothing the villagers were unable to defend themselves either in their homes or on the road because most young muslim males had been conscripted only very old and very young males and women were left armenian bands however were made up of young males who had never been drafted were deserters from the ottoman army or had come from the caucasus
2295377 of the legacies of these pasts recall the important lesson once taught us by barrington moore that even liberal democratic societies were born in fire and blood

2295381 the first european on record to lay eyes on the river niger
2295382 a new and glorious calling the lone brave african explorer
2295383 sometimes displayed a mocking contempt for rank and social hierarchies
2295384 his command of the facts the acuity of his intellect his courage and his poise
2295385 a proponent of finding timbuktu and tracing the definitive course of the niger
2295386 a fanatical patriot convinced of english superiority blustering and insufferable to all who crossed him
2295387 well set up man of fine physique highly gifted in many ways
2295388 laing so far as we know was not allowed to consummate the marriage
2295389 to reach timbuktu the golden city of the sudan he would have to cross two thousand miles of the harshest desert in africa territories where tripolis jurisdiction did not extend conditions could be unimaginably harsh in these lands where human life was held more cheaply than a good pair of boots lawless bedouin bands made their living off the plunder of caravans
2295390 had estimated would take at most a few weeks had in fact taken 399 days he had counted every one fifty seven weeks of loneliness suffering privation and bloodshed fourteen months of solitude without the companionship of a native of his own land without the woman he loved
2295391 he feared he would be disfigured for life and dreaded emmas reaction when she saw him again if he survived
2295392 laing was surely disappointed to discover in timbuktu not even the palest shadow of the city abounding in wealth and architectural wonders that he and all europe had imagined the metropolis was quite obviously caught in a spiral of decay and war a thousand years old it had a look of irreversible decrepitude unprepossessing even from a distance up close timbuktu was dirty and falling apart stinking horribly of unwashed people and sick animals inertia gripped everyone and everything
2295393 stayed in timbuktu for thirty five days gathering research studying arab manuscripts copying city records and talking to scholars
2295394 there was no running water then other than in streams or rivers no electricity no tv very few radios and when newspapers were bought they were shared between houses each locality lived within its own small world
2295395 have hardly changed at all since i ran and played and worked in them as a boy
2295396 young as we were we were soon forming our own defences and adapting to the harsher laws of the world we were very close together in years and drew closer natural rivalries were suppressed they couldnt be afforded all our energies were concentrated on surviving under our father when there was a bad beating and the storm had died wed gather round whoever was beaten to comfort and affirm its unfairness and it lessened our misery and gave strength to our anger this gathering into a single band formed gradually over a number of years
2295397 her practicality and quiet cheerfulness and the unusual gift of making people feel better about themselves
2295398 he was a man who acted out his life in parts and who lived out his life as far as it was possible in roles nearly all of which he had abused while remaining protected within the role he had set out as a gifted difficult only child both over protected and spoiled while remaining exposed to his mothers violent corrections
2295399 where his propensity for violence was tempered by cold calculation and a keen sense of self preservation
2295400 what work did they do occasionally they summonsed people for not having lights on their bicycles at night for after hours drinking for assault or trespass owning unlicensed dogs possessing fields of thistle ragwort or dock
2295401 there was no other way to have it the result was usually the arrival of a large number of children in rapid succession there were families in which the children were cherished but many more where they were resented as unwanted mouths that had to be fed
2295402 we were made to feel a burden and to feel ashamed
2295403 knew him better than i knew any living person and yet i felt i had never understood him so changeable was he so violent so self absorbed so many faced if it is impossible to know oneself since we cannot see ourselves as we are seen then it may be almost as difficult to understand those close to us whether that closeness be of enmity or love or their fluctuating tides
2295404 the intensity of the conflicting emotions grief loss relief took me unawares
2295405 i cannot say i have fully understood him and leave him now with god or whatever truth or illusion or longing for meaning or comfort that word may represent
2295406 it was as if my lost world was restored and made whole and given back
2295407 a strange and complete happiness when all sense of time is lost
2295408 why take on any single life a priest a soldier teacher doctor airman if a writer could create all these people far more vividly in that one life of the mind the writer could live many lives and all of life instead of being a priest of god i would be the god of a small vivid world i must have had some sense of how outrageous and laughable this would appear to the world because i told no one but it did serve its first purpose it set me free
2295409 i had set myself the goal of uncovering the truth about august 7 1930 who planned it who covered it up how did it unfold and how could this deed ever be undone might as well be ambitious i thought then i wanted to look at the racial conundrum embodied in my own family my grandfather in the klan my grandmothers apparent connections to some indian tribe with grant county as the american microcosm i would look for all the hidden histories connected to race i wanted to see the big picture the context that had allowed the lynching to happen certainly that was the mystery behind the mystery
2295410 mass complicity and the pride white marion took in this public execution
2295411 these were failed damaged people and joining the klan was how they made themselves feel better and it was deeply sad
2295412 this is the unbearable part facing the fact that my grandparents went along with it
2295413 what it would mean for me to truly witness to truly own the history of my family and my marion and to take in the impact racism had had
2295414 if i encountered something uncomfortable i would have to stay with the discomfort no guilt tripping no distancing

2295416 all culture is a cover for secretively monstrous behavior particularly the nuclear family
2295417 the whole world is a mess and i just want to rule it
2295418 people who sort of even know me in real life sometimes express disbelief until the people who really do know me confirm to them that its all true people who dont know me at all usually think i make all this crap up the funniest part of this to me is that there is so much that i actually dont write about that is about a hundred times crazier than the stuff i actually do write about if you all only knew thats all i have to say if yall only knew
2295419 decisions decisions just roll the dice fate is going to do with you what she will anyway
2295420 unfettered whining is a banana split for the motherfucking soul
2295421 theres no rule that says you have to be fulfilled doing a particular socially acceptable thing
2295422 its a strange thing to discover when youre an adult that youve been somewhat misadjusted to the world your entire life and didnt know it
2295423 if you can get past the occasional imbecile induced bike folly and the fact that davis seems to perpetually be in the path of some giant bipolar tornado you may come to realize that this city is a great place to live
2295424 i see a bookshelf filled with different books from different authors all acting as portals to different worlds and different times the author may give them birth but its the readers who keep them alive
2295425 some books contain the machinery required to create and sustain universes
2295426 i like writing about characters who are drawn to each other but arent necessarily good for each other nyx walks back into your life and you see everything you love destroyed but some vital piece of you something you cant name something you didnt even know was missing is somehow there again whole full like a missing piece of your heart that chokes you
2295427 i believe that love will find you when youre not looking for it so ive been actively not looking for it for about three years now ill let you know how that works out for me
2295428 i found that writing for me was a thing of the hands hands need to produce art and whether its written or made it feeds the need to produce art
2295429 when somebody loves you they love you for everything you are good bad butch brutal bad bowler and im all of those things and a lot more pretending im not hiding it covering it up pretending that all i want is the garden and the house and not the midnight fucking in marrakech is a lie its gutting half of myself its sacrificing one to get the other i shouldnt have to sacrifice it those parts of myself should make each other stronger gutting one guts the other i cant live a life thats half a person i cant live half a life now how do i get the house and the garden and the fucking in marrakech this is the real question
2295430 love is a choice i fully believe that also i think its controlled by the same part of the brain that makes you actively choose to pretend you dont know how the stove works choose wisely
2295431 a lot of people ask me for advice on writing
2295432 i hope that within these roughly 2 000 pages is a tale about women searching for their place in the world coming to terms with themselves fighting for change accepting their power dealing with issues of friendship family responsibility sexuality and identity struggling with fears and doubts hope and longing oppression and desire i hope and yet it seems as if the prevailing sentiment is the only thing that matters is the man is having a man am i mistaken am i reading this incorrectly im asking
2295433 why does my job exist it exists because i willed it into existence when the day goes badly i can remind myself that i have asked for this job by name and thought to create this for myself and i can only blame myself for the whole thing
2295434 dude i was a nerd from the day i was born i was reading in kindergarten i got humungous glasses that covered half of my face in second grade ive been living the nerd life ever since

2295436 i sometimes think god is a shit and he wouldnt be worth it otherwise hes much more interesting when hes a shit
2295437 sometimes though you dont get to choose what kinda fame youre gonna get or how much itll cost ya
2295438 so heres what i think we need to do if we want to write a sci fi or a fantasy show and give it appeal way beyond the normal boundaries of sci fi fantasy fandom
2295439 personally i believe neither that youre attracting nutty people because you dont want nice ones nor that the universe will deliver someone really neato as soon as you deserve him or her it would be nice if things worked out that equitably for everyone but in my experience the universe is kind of shiftless and lazy and just doesnt bother
2295440 when you are young passion and hope are so strong thats its almost impossible to stop loving someone after youve been kicked around by life however you start to have a dual response to handsome con men wow and arrrrrrgh it takes not will power but painful experience to make us wise
2295441 be of service go where you can help if youre an artist be of service to your art dont have it the other way around you have to put aside your dreams of being a hotshot and learn to be useful you step up everyday get a nice clean hit and youre done

2295443 whenever youre called on to make up your mind and youre hampered by not having any the simplest way to solve the dilemma youll find is simply by flipping a penny no not so that chance shall decide the affair as youre passively standing there moping but as soon as the penny is up in the air youll suddenly know what youre hoping
2295444 im not normal by conventional social standards and ill never be so maybe i should stop worrying and just embrace the insanity a bit
2295445 you are always dreaming every dream you could dream all the time even when youre awake a part of your brain is stirring that brew which one you choose to remember in the morning is based on wishes anxieties its a vast and fascinating place everywhere you turn a part of you
2295446 her weirdnesses have the quality of life in a trailer park during tornado season someones shih tzu just blew in through the window pfft theres a buick parked on the ceiling bah old man parsnip just got blown right into the anal cavity of a standing cow cest la vie her life is managed in clusters of riot interrupted by the occasional errant moment of calm
2295447 most women accept the fact that they can be occasionally somewhat crazy i dont know any women who believe they are always handle situations with rational thought they all know they slip off the deep end from time to time it happens but men they really dont get it they really think they are never wrong what they want is whats best why wouldnt it be its what they want why shouldnt they have things their way and its there that lies the problem men are inherently crazy because they dont think theyre crazy at all its the definition of insanity really
2295448 oddly enough she can handle having a lesbian daughter much better than one who is still single at 30
2295449 i am way more afraid of forgetting how to be happy alone than i am actually ending up alone
2295450 various medical authorities swarm in and out of here predicting i have between two days and two months to live
2295451 you know marcel proust french writer total loser never had a real job unrequited love affairs gay spent 20 years writing a book almost no one reads but hes also probably the greatest writer since shakespeare anyway he uh he gets down to the end of his life and he looks back and decides that all those years he suffered those were the best years of his life cause they made him who he was all those years he was happy you know total waste didnt learn a thing so if you sleep until youre 18 ah think of the suffering youre gonna miss i mean high school high school those are your prime suffering years you dont get better suffering than that
2295452 it makes me f ing pissed off when people are surprised that this happens
2295453 weve been decades to get to this point and if anybodys na ve and foolish enough to think that were never going to have a positive control again then you may as well go home and not cover this race
2295454 the media has a responsibility to understand that this is no way going to be the last positive test were going to have its going to go on for years

2295664 adready is the only way weve been able to make it work with rapid iterations on different ad concepts a comprehensive analytical framework for measuring results and the savvy to negotiate the best deals with publishers adready has doubled our roi in display ads
2295665 most companies in the online display space have focused on who sees an ad and on where they see it
2295666 adready is not focused on who and where but on what the ads themselves this area is ripe for innovation and we believe adready has the potential to build a substantial business by bringing online display success to a broad range of advertisers

2295756 we have in any case to go back to our lord
2295757 the only reason you have to hate us is that we believed in the signs of our lord as they came to us o our lord give us sufficient endurance that we may die submitting to you

2295811 mary kate and ashley were supposed to be here tonight but they heard there was food
2295812 on monday i paid 7 for a pint now all of a sudden its 7 80 i was shocked i complained to staff they have got two prices regulars prices and non regulars prices
2295813 there is no price list on the wall i dont mind paying more but it is completely arbitrary it is not the money it is the price hike it is outrageous
2295814 in light of these allegations we will be seeking to make contact with the landlord this may well constitute unfair trading procedures and this is something the council would look into
2295815 that should not be the case and it wont be the case as far as im aware there is no change in price there is no difference everyone should be paying the same
2295816 were nowhere near the 1991 recession the numbers are so extreme that it leads you to believe that maybe theres some statistical anomalies going on here
2295817 i would suggest there is some statistical noise going on here we had a big boost in manufacturing in may that seemed more fiction than reality and i think this is that boomlet working its way out of the economy
2295818 however canadas economic fundamentals remain solid canadas labor market has outperformed that of the u s since the start of the year while over 70 000 jobs have been created in canada the u s has lost over 463 000
2295819 up to now recent comments have been sort of highlighting the risk to inflation but with this kind of employment report its going to make clear that there is risk on the growth side as well
2295820 the trouble for the bank of canada is that inflation remains too high and will reescalate if as we expect energy prices rebound
2295821 the bank of canada must focus on jobs and families before apparent signs of future inflation
2295822 employment decreases in july occurred in manufacturing business building and other support services and educational services the only significant gains were in accommodation and food services
2295823 though most of the job losses in july were part time this latest jobs report depicts a worrisome trend in the canadian labor markets
2295824 if the string of job losses endures for a couple of more months at a time when economic growth in the us deteriorates the boc could be forced to provide extra stimulus
2295825 markets were looking for 5 000 jobs growth and ended up with 55 000 losses
2295826 we are planning to spend a great deal of time looking at that over the next couple of months
2295827 but we obviously have done a lot of homework determining what is available and what the market conditions are and we will take opportunity when it presents itself
2295828 the second quarter results demonstrated the difficulty increasing revenues at the same rapid pace as the increase in the price of jet fuel

2295832 it very quickly moved away from a burglary into a definite sexual case which led us to seize exhibits that gave us further offences which were filmed on video
2295833 a rape allegation was made which was also connected to the video incidents of children and adults being filmed on a toilet using the toilet
2295834 when i saw the evidence i thought i cant believe it it really just took me ages to believe it
2295835 the public have every right to be concerned about the growth of this sort of violence
2295836 it is a tragedy that this sort of triviality caused such a young man to lose his life and it has caused enduring heartache to his friends and family
2295837 the pain that martins death has caused for our family is indescribable
2295838 we as a family will never make sense of the unnecessary suffering that was inflicted upon martin
2295839 life will never be the same a piece of our heart has been taken
2295840 this was a vengeful attack out of all proportion to what may have gone before and no mercy was shown
2295841 this is such a case which leads from dirty looks to death in one hour
2295842 we are just hoping that the people who have been involved with martins murder will learn from what has happened to martin
2295843 i cant see past that my heart has broken and will never mend
2295844 you took the life of a woman in circumstances of great violence
2295845 you took her life in her own home where she was entitled to feel safe

2295863 it is impossible to determine exactly what has happened to this item of mail
2295864 it is very unlikely however that it has been in the royal mail system for that length of time

2295996 we are asking our friends and the united states among them to somehow to try to mediate and try to persuade russia to stop this military aggression and invasion of georgia
2295997 what we heard is that the state department and the entire administration is deeply concerned and that they are heavily engaged with russia trying to de escalate the situation
2295998 what is most critical now is to avoid further confrontation between russian and georgian military forces the consequences for euro atlantic stability and security are grave

2296200 the fomc statement and the end to the feds recent rate cut cycle have played a major role in ending the dollars decline
2296201 for example the yield spread between germanys 10 year note and the u s 10 year is today friday at 33 basis points a 36 basis point drop from early july

2296221 i cant assure you that this train wreck isnt going to happen but i will do everything in my power to see that we avert it
2296222 my straight talk would be please dont let this foreign company ruin our part of the world
2296223 im personally calling on john mccain to send rick davis to germany to use his considerable clout with dhl to help save these 8 200 jobs in southwest ohio
2296224 come here to wilmington and come here to ohio and explain the reasons and rationale for their decision
2296225 we thought it was an issue that there were people giving to the campaign who had no intention of supporting or voting for john mccain
2296226 so we thought it was an appropriate measure at this point

2296233 if the party is speaking about unity they the clinton delegates believe the only way to unify the party is actually allowing them to vote
2296234 moving beyond the convention if they were not allowed to vote there would be a lot of resentment
2296235 we are not going to base our campaign on the concerns of so called campaign strategists on cable tv

2296379 ukraine is anxious having received the information that the conflict in the south ossetia georgia has developed into a new phase with involving the military potential of the third party
2296380 unfortunately the information from the site indicates that the russian federation which had played a role of intermediary since a long time is gradually becoming a side of the conflict the foreign ministry of ukraine believes that it may aggravate the situation even more with broadening the conflict s geography and turning it into a regional one with unpredictable consequences
2296381 ukraine calls on the russian federation as permanent member of the un security council to pull out its troops from georgia to be reserved in its actions and to exert the necessary influence upon the separatist regime of tskhinvali in order to return to the bargaining table

2296383 they are saying to me as a cancer patient that i dont deserve the right to live whether its for one month two months six months or even years
2296384 if we can find billions of pounds or millions of pounds to help out people like northern rock and find millions and millions of pounds to go and fight in wars then surely to god we should be able to find some money to keep the people in our country alive or to prolong their life

2296418 the whole experience was inspiring and i look forward to sharing it with flashforward attendees what was clear from the conversations i had with this group is that their work is not only driven by passion but the quality of the work is also shaped by it
2296419 passion isnt something you can teach others but it certainly is infectious
2296420 to create work without passion is a season in hell

2296439 an entrepreneur is defined as a person who is willing to live like no one else will so that one day they can live like no one else can
2296440 the only place where success comes before work is in the dictionary
2296441 successful people are not lucky they make their own luck
2296442 the life of an entrepreneur is occasionally exhilarating and almost always exhausting only unbridled passion for the concept is likely to see you through the 17 hour days month after month and the painful mistakes that are part and parcel of the start up process
2296443 achievement of your happiness is the only moral purpose of your life and that happiness not pain or mindless self indulgence is the proof of your moral integrity since it is the proof and the result of your loyalty to the achievement of your values
2296444 what lies behind us and what lies before us are small matters to what lies within us
2296445 i couldnt wait for success so i went ahead without it
2296446 continuous effort not strength or intelligence is the key to unlocking our potential

2296461 but it seems one sided pretty liberal though maybe thats the reality
2296462 whats the scientific consensus on whether the world is warming due to greenhouse gases that humans are putting into the atmosphere
2296463 yes theres some human caused warming but its on top of a natural cycle
2296464 its a hoax the scientists and clean energy industry are in it for the money its cooling now and if theres a big volcano itll get really cold cows and termites put out more greenhouse gases than we do
2296465 not sure about right now but if we keep adding people and they keep putting out co2 its eventually going to be unsustainable
2296466 theres no such thing as a degree in climatology so those guys really dont know very much
2296467 has it been warmer in the last 10 years than in the previous 50
2296468 are you aware that the tobacco industry made a concerted effort first to convince people that there was no proof smoking caused cancer then to portray smoking as a matter of personal freedom that it was a personal choice that people could make or not make
2296469 are you aware that theres a similar effort being made by the exxon and friends to spread doubt about global warming and that its being run by the same pr companies that were set up by the tobacco industry to spread doubt about tobacco
2296470 i have not really decided yet i agree with kucinich on the issues i always vote my heart but we are facing some real serious challenges and so voting pragmatically may be what i do
2296471 obama he is the only person who can bring the country together and who can demonstrate to the world that america cares about globalization hillary carries too much baggage and is too angry obama provides the only real hope that our country can more forward
2296472 john mccain he is calmer and collected a lot more he has experience in foreign affairs he shows more respect to the other candidates i think he could get along with congress and create a new environment all the democrats are talking about change but they dont say what they are going to change
2296473 obama i just find him inspirational i feel like he represents whats best in the county and he can bring together a consensus of different races i guess i just have clinton fatigue i think we need someone inspirational right now
2296474 edwards would be my first choice if he was nominated but if not i am leaning towards hillary politically she has the most experience and backing her husband did not do too bad a job at least he seemed to keep us out of wars
2296475 i figure oscar al must have several highly paid linguistic experts on his staff to stay a step ahead of the real scientists who are debunking his cry of we are all doomed
2296476 al gores movie an inconvenient truth has moved global warming from scientific theory to dogma by means of the media which now treats global warming deniers nearly the same as holocaust deniers
2296477 we are making the character look photorealistic the fibres of their clothing the pores of their skin and each individual hair
2296478 we are making the character look photorealistic the fibres of their clothing the pores of their skin and each individual hair it is possible that the work certainly the first one will start next year
2296479 if we continue the direction were going were likely to end up where were headed
2296480 i think were at a stage where we can depoliticize the movement
2296481 we need to elect the right people wholl take action on climate change
2296482 our goal is to promote the book to the community
2296483 get nevada city county to adopt this book and the actions therein
2296484 get us to consider what actions we can take to reduce emissions
2296485 heres what this other group should do and i dont have time or interest its their job
2296486 people did not always realize that they were talking past each other
2296487 it is for us the living rather to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced
2296488 i say to you today my friends that in spite of the difficulties and frustrations of the moment i still have a dream it is a dream deeply rooted in the american dream

2296500 paris is wearing them shes going to wear them shes just not going to be the face of them
2296501 shes always wanted to do a shoe range as well
2296502 we were talking about her coming on board with mine having a little bit of creative control
2296503 for me she wanted a little too much creative control so we just decided that she can do hers and ill do mine and she can wear mine until hers are done
2296504 on his quintet recording osiris moore unabashedly embraces melody and mood as well with a set of ten of his own compositions that are almost surprising in their straight ahead delivery and deceptively ornamented scoring lovely playing is to be found especially from pianist marc van roon and bassist paul berner
2296505 annual sampler ranges from tableaus to a pas de deux by john rockwell for the new york times thursday nights bill was particularly weighted toward big names and elaborate productions yet it could be argued that the shortest and simplest number an eight minute pas de deux in plain costumes on a bare stage was the most moving the most mysterious the most heartily cheered
2296506 the most arresting thing about ochoas duet to a score by mark van roon is the quiet dramatically charged suppleness of julie gardette and fran ois rousseau im not referring just to their limber bodies but to their responsiveness to changes in the emotional weather
2296507 its a marvelous film worthy of the best italian cinema tradition
2296508 a war film a war taking place just 150km south of rome
2296509 its a film of great civic value because it uncovers a real part of italy a place you can barely believe is part of this country

2296511 around 30 of campanias 85 buffalo mozzarella producers would be shut down immediately to reassure the public
2296512 there are always traces of dioxins in the food chain on the basis of what we have found you would need to eat seven kilograms of contaminated mozzarella every day to have any effects on your health
2296513 the negative repercussions of the rubbish crisis on tourism in campania will be felt for years to come because it will take a long time for the region to recover its appeal

2296517 edwards told abc news correspondent bob woodruff he did have an affair with 44 year old rielle hunter but said that he did not love her
2296518 there will be apprehension in the house until this is solved
2296519 once they picked him up it was a foregone conclusion a necessity that the police obtain this alleged statement
2296520 a confession was essential for the prosecution and i think we can argue successfully that this statement was obtained under coercion and unconstitutional means
2296521 im sincerely sorry for what ive done and i wish i could take it back
2296522 she slapped me in the face and kneed me in the groin and i dont know something snapped in my brain
2296523 if you feel that i aint been in prison long enough and hit me so be it
2296524 we were looking for how to find a new way to get people to go regularly as if they were subscribers but not have the problems subscriptions have because subscriptions are not the future
2296525 they want to go when they want to go and you risk people not going because they either dont feel like they belong or cant get the kind of access to concerts they want this program gives them a guarantee in a way
2296526 a game of dominos bottle of light ale and home for match of the day
2296527 yes you started 5 minutes late and took a break

2296531 georgian forces are controlling the entire territory of south ossetia except java
2296532 this information will be checked but this is the approximate number based on information from relatives
2296533 we are a freedom loving nation right now under attack
2296534 we urge all the parties including georgians south ossetians and russians to de escalate and avoid conflict
2296535 we are working on mediation efforts to secure a ceasefire
2296536 ambulances cannot move hospitals are reported to be overflowing surgery is taking place in corridors
2296537 if this is not war then i wonder what is
2296538 there is a threat of even more large scale russian aggression against georgia georgia faces an existential threat amid russian aggression
2296539 they have in effect begun hostilities using tanks and artillery
2296540 there should be only one ossetia we want to live with our brothers
2296541 now we see georgia has found a use for these weapons and for the special forces that were trained with the help of international instructors
2296542 als het gouden leeuw project straks eenmaal is afgerond krijgen we feitelijk een prachtig stuk nieuwe openbare ruimte in het centrum van venray dat leent zich prima voor een vergroting van de kermis
2296543 hier zouden overigens geen twintig attracties moeten komen te staan ik denk eerder aan vijf grote
2296544 mocht je het te eng of te gevaarlijk vinden dan zijn er genoeg vluchtwegen
2296545 de toezichthouder had die twijfel de jongen om wie het ging bleek 15 jaar oud
2296546 het is onrechtvaardig het is niet altijd mogelijk iemands leeftijd te controleren wat als een 18 jarige een biertje koopt en het doorgeeft aan een minderjarige een kastelein is toch geen politieagent het is als met het rookverbod een ander begaat de overtreding en de kastelein moet betalen het lijkt erop dat de kassa moet rinkelen de overheid schiet door beter kunnen ze naar scholen en ouders gaan die moeten meer verantwoordelijkheid nemen
2296547 wat doorschiet is het alcohol en drugsgebruik onder jongeren in deze regio dat blijkt uit onderzoek
2296548 de helft betaal ik zelf de andere helft mijn ouders
2296549 vaak vechten we voor de gein maar soms is het menens
2296550 ik vind het wel leuker om in hoge attracties te gaan
2296551 in park hilaria ga ik het liefst in attracties die over de kop gaan
2296552 s avonds is het hier drukker daar moeten we het vooral van hebben
2296553 je merkt dat al die berichten over een recessie en een inzakkende economie ook hun invloed hebben op de kermis
2296554 ja hoor laten we niet al te somber doen als het even kan ben ik er graag weer bij
2296555 ik ben al de derde generatie van onze familie die telkens naar rosmalen komt die traditie blijf ik graag voortzetten
2296556 het is duidelijk bouwvak ok vanuit campings in de buurt komen best wel mensen naar de kermis maar dat weegt niet op tegen het verlies aan klanten die het land uit zijn we zullen het geld deze maand vooral in den bosch moeten verdienen want ja eind augustus staan we daar ook
2296557 in difficult periods like this it is vital that we continue to evolve our products to exceed customers needs and jeep patriot does just that
2296558 by providing great fuel economy performance handling and flexibility all at an affordable price the jeep patriot is a tremendous value
2296559 he has been complaining of giddiness and thus he went for a thorough check up at the hospital it was then that he was told of his condition his vision isnt good to begin with but it has deteriorated so much and he didnt realise it either
2296560 he is now undergoing a checkup to find out the reason for his condition and to administer the appropriate treatment
2296561 come on shoot me again on this points to spot side now please
2296562 9531 it was surprising that it was getting any attention
2296563 the legislation is there for a reason to stop the spread of the disease
2296564 during an avian influenza outbreak when there are significant concerns about the about the disease and the implications for other farmers breaking the rules is a very serious offence
2296565 during an outbreak even greater care should have been taken and clearly it wasnt by mr buchanan
2296566 we very much regret our involvement in this offence and accept the sentence imposed by the court
2296567 we wish to make it abundantly clear that these offences are not linked with the avian influenza outbreak in 2007
2296568 karikatur itu jelas melecehkan umat islam pihak stain sendiri mengaku tidak tahu pemuatan karikatur tersebut namun pak abdul hadi baik secara institusi maupun pribadi meminta maaf kepada umat islam
2296569 kami sangat menyayangkan pemuatan karikatur itu tetapi karena pihak pengelola buletin kampus sudah meminta maaf maka kami sebagai orang tua tentunya memberi maaf tetapi kami sudah memberikan warning keras agar hal itu tidak diulangi
2296570 tanpa niat kita membenarkan aksi kekerasan namun apa yang dilakukan ratusan santri dan berujung pada bentrok di lhokseumawe itu merupakan akibat sikap diam pemerintah menegakkan amal makruf di daerah tersebut
2296571 kami melihat pemerintah sangat musiman dalam penegakan syariat islam sehingga muncul ketidaksabaran para santri yang sudah muak melihat tingkah laku pelanggar syariah di aceh
2296572 why do i tend to like people i just met more than the people i know really well

2296602 right to go first in citing them here would label me as
2296603 police lieutenant a woman wants to show that victims are more than numbers
2296604 brought it on themselves by the way they acted dressed spoke
2296605 common myths about sexual assault the article blazons a rough count of the number of times that same slogan phrase has been foisted upon the public since the rise of feminism would probably reach the tens of thousands and the common myths argument has itself become a myth
2296606 in discussing rape or any feminist issues of course one must immediately realize that feminist mythology is expressed in femspeak that true because i say it is argot of the feverishly ideological and militant all terms and expressions in other words have special esoteric meaning
2296607 as a young woman whose rape charge sent four young men one physically incapable of sex to prison for forty years once told me several years after the conviction maybe they didnt know it was rape thats up to the woman isnt it she didnt say no it would appear
2296608 that incidentally was the same case in which a female juror later confided that in her mind any time a woman had sex with more than one man it had to be rape
2296609 the lady juror didnt have to hear that no either i guess
2296610 i happen you see to have been a private detective who during the early seventies did a thoroughly detailed investigation of literally dozens of rape cases investigation that included interview with the supposed victims several years after their trauma
2296611 myth 1 purported truth that how a woman acts dresses or speaks has nothing to do with rape thats not what men say
2296612 that i was going ninety miles an hour with no brakes has nothing to do with my wreck
2296613 myth 2 purported truth that men are also victims of rape ahem
2296614 myth 3 purported truth that anyone can be a rape victim this is called the straw man fallacy in logic look it up
2296615 myth 4 purported truth that 15 to 20 percent of rape victims dont know their assailant ditto myth 3
2296616 myth 5 that rapists succeed by means other than physical force yeah like the young lady i mentioned above said maybe the guy didnt know it was rape thats up to women isnt it
2296617 people lie when they have a reason or hadnt you noticed
2296618 myth 6 purported truth that wives and prostitutes odious comparison that can be raped special femspeak interpretation again what just for all practical purposes leaves the question of whether rape occurred up to the victim
2296619 myth 7 that false accusations of rape are few good grief in what world does the author live
2296620 it happens too that i also happen to have first hand insight into this one
2296621 the fact is that nearly half of rape charges brought since the year 1975 have been false police blotters across the country record the evidence in incontrovertible detail for anyone interested and sincere enough to do the leg work necessary as i said false charges of rape have become an epidemic one spawned almost entirely by feminism and the hysteria it engenders
2296622 i told you that so i could tell you this

2296630 carrollton texas after spending nearly 27 years buried in the vast texas prison system for a crime he did not commit charles chatmans first weeks of freedom have been overwhelming
2296631 chatman was exonerated last month by dna testing while serving a 99 year sentence for sexual assault
2296632 as dna technology and investigations identify a mounting number of wrongful convictions the urgency to find others like chatman is increasing
2296633 last week two men were cleared of separate murder convictions in mississippi after new dna testing led authorities to another man now charged in both slayings
2296634 since 1989 there have been 213 post conviction dna exonerations in the usa of those 149 came in the past seven years according to the innocence project the parent organization of a far flung network that helps prisoners obtain dna testing or other evidence that could prove their innocence
2296635 they rape us with their eyes their laws and their codes
2296636 all sex even consensual sex between a married couple is an act of violence perpetrated against a woman
2296637 you grow up with your father holding you down and covering your mouth so another man can make a horrible searing pain between your legs
2296638 i want to see a man beaten to a bloody pulp with a high heel shoved in his mouth like an apple in the mouth of a pig
2296639 the traditional flowers of courtship are the traditional flowers of the grave delivered to the victim before the kill the cadaver is dressed up and made up and laid down and ritually violated and consecrated to an eternity of being used
2296640 heterosexual intercourse is the pure formalized expression of contempt for womens bodies
2296641 to call a man an animal is to flatter him hes a machine a walking dildo
2296642 since marriage constitutes slavery for women it is clear that the womens movement must concentrate on attacking this institution freedom for women cannot be won without the abolition of marriage
2296643 we cant destroy the inequities between men and women until we destroy marriage
2296644 being a housewife is an illegitimate profession the choice to serve and be protected and plan towards being a family maker is a choice that shouldnt be the heart of radical feminism is to change that
2296645 in order to raise children with equality we must take them away from families and communally raise them
2296646 i believe that women have a capacity for understanding and compassion which man structurally does not have does not have it because he cannot have it hes just incapable of it
2296647 probably the only place where a man can feel really secure is in a maximum security prison except for the imminent threat of release
2296648 men who are unjustly accused of rape can sometimes gain from the experience
2296649 the incest taboo can be destroyed only by destroying the nuclear family as the primary institution of the culture the nuclear family is the school of values in a sexist sexually repressed society the alternative to the nuclear family at the moment is the extended family or the tribe the growth of tribe is part of the process of destroying particularized roles and fixed erotic identity as people develop fluid androgynous identity they will also develop the forms of community appropriate to it we cannot really imagine what those forms will be
2296650 the end of the institution of marriage is a necessary condition for the liberation of women therefore it is important for us to encourage women to leave their husbands and not to live individually with men all of history must be re written in terms of oppression of women we must go back to ancient female religions like witchcraft
2296651 by the year 2000 we will i hope raise our children to believe in human potential not god
2296652 the most merciful thing a large family can do to one of its infant members is to kill it
2296653 i feel that man hating is an honorable and viable political act that the oppressed have a right to class hatred against the class that is oppressing them
2296654 the simple fact is that every woman must be willing to be identified as a lesbian to be fully feminist

2296657 intense pain or suffering of body or mind the infliction of such pain or suffering
2296658 the inflicting of severe pain to force information and confession get revenge etc

2296688 yeah right in your dreams potter you havent completely tamed this dragon you and your damn pheromones have been cramping my style
2296689 i think most people would consider that an invitation potter youre supposed to accept it or decline your choice of course but if you do were fucking in my bed im not sleeping in any flea riddled rats nest you might call a bed

2296697 ill try to explain just give me a moment put the wand down please
2296698 oh please from sirius black is it now im convinced stand back harry
2296699 you sent me something at the end of my third year at hogwarts what was it
2296700 god sirius i thought you were gone everyone said you were dead i watched you fall
2296701 when i fell i felt a sharp tug like a port key i remember thinking at that moment that the veil was how the death eaters had gained access to the ministry i tried to apparate a safe distance away within the room but i was already moving
2296702 seems ive missed out again tell me what happened tonig the night i vanished
2296703 i was screaming your name convinced that you were just out of sight hiding maybe but you never came out when i tried to get to you remus grabbed me everyone was still fighting so much noise but i didnt care i kept watching the veil for you waiting
2296704 we should call an order meeting right now nobody will care if we wake them up not for this
2296705 id like to clean up rest before i see everyone
2296706 nearly everyone from his side the rest are either in azkaban or hiding from our side tonks arthur flitwick moody slughorn wood dumbledore
2296707 this wasnt a last minute decision whatever i owned when my time was up was to be given to you its been that way since the day james named me your godfather ill take whatevers left in the vault but the house is yours and anything in it
2296708 thank you harry i know its not much but im happy youve made a life here with draco most of my memories of this place are nothing i want to hold onto except for that last christmas when we were all here together do you remember
2296709 if you want me to stay fine but i want you to move back in
2296710 i cant harry im sure you can figure out the reasons for yourself now im a free man i think id like to see more of the world and really see it not just through snuffles eyes hiding from the authorities
2296711 if you really dont want to keep the house ill give it to draco or sell it remus left me his cottage so i think ill explore country life before i take off on a world adventure i really just wanted to give you a place to help you make your own way build the family youve always wanted
2296712 i dont know about draco but im sure the potter line ends with me last time i checked two wizards cant make a baby
2296713 there are wizarding adoption agencies all over the didnt you tell me last night you wanted to be a father
2296714 i had a lot of wine by that point sirius
2296715 ill have to be honest harry i knew it would be hard to see everyone again after so much time but to be reunited with you meet your lover spend all this time its been harder than i expected every morning im still shocked when you come down for breakfast instead of the boy i remember
2296716 i lost your parents missed out on my own young adult years couldnt be there for you when you needed me most and now ive missed seeing you grow into this man whos the best of both worlds
2296717 fine but i think we should all talk when you get back
2296718 i know what you saw what it must have looked like
2296719 five years draco how many other people get more than one chance at first i thought i was finally getting a reward for all the hell ive been through that i had james back again
2296720 make sure you yell out his fathers name when you finally get him into bed im sure hell appreciate that
2296721 malfoy listen damn it i dont want him that way i never have
2296722 save your lies cousin i saw how you couldnt stop touching him kissing him
2296723 because its something he needs to hear hes convinced himself that you dont but we both know better dont we
2296724 i talked to sirius and i know what you think you saw but its not like that between us i promise
2296725 its not the same kind of hes my godfather draco hes allowed to touch me
2296726 it went beyond godfatherly actions and into the realm of inappropriate
2296727 when my parents died i was too young to know what was happening and sirius was dragged off to azkaban neither one of us had a chance to mourn them properly or were ready to until just now thats all we were doing you know how much it means to me to have him back in my life i thought i had lost everyone id ever loved
2296728 yes well now where do i rate in this list
2296729 ive had plenty of time alone to draw up my own conclusions without your help
2296730 i know ive been distant since he came back but i never dreamed something like this would happen draco hes
2296731 so to you this has been a three year one night stand
2296732 fine you want to talk about this now heres your answer i dont know what we are how long were you planning on staying draco how long would you have lived in that ugly house with me
2296733 did it seem before your dogfather arrived that i was going anywhere
2296734 i didnt know how to respond ive always assumed it was only what women wanted to hear
2296735 i felt like an idiot lying there waiting for you to say it back
2296736 thats why i never said anything again i didnt want you to feel uncomfortable i thought that if i brought it up again youd feel like i was rushing you forcing you to say it when you werent ready but i wont lie to you i kept hoping youd tell me some day but when two more years went by and still nothing no mention of plans for the future i started to put away my dreams for us i tried to just be happy with whatever you were willing to give me
2296737 when sirius was holding me telling me that my parents would be proud of the man ive become i couldnt stop thinking that maybe he was wrong maybe they would have been disappointed with how ive done almost nothing since the war hidden away in an old house holding on to memories committed to a man who isnt in love with me
2296738 its unlikely ill ever advertise our arrangement on a screen at the quidditch world cup however i do love you idiot
2296739 im sorry i just got caught up in everything and i didnt think it was fair for us to in the house when sirius doesnt have anyone
2296740 ill have you know i had quite the reputation before you came along
2296741 well theyre not here now so i guess that means i win
2296742 strangers cant disapparate in the gardens ill be bounced back idiot
2296743 youre not very good at that are you if you want i could give you a few pointers potter you know help you improve your technique
2296744 on top of completely embarrassing yourself youll have to pay the tavern owner a fortune in damage repair at this rate
2296745 oh really ill bet you ten galleons you cant hit the bulls eye
2296746 a bet the great and wonderful potter he of the careful and cautious nature is actually willing to make a wager on something
2296747 well well well i didnt know you had it in you to actually gamble potter how very daring even so you do a poor job of it moneys so pedestrian
2296748 true but its not as though losing it would matter to you very much for all that youre being un potter like and actually doing something that involves personal risk like gambling
2296749 youre being very potter like which is to say not very brave about it
2296750 not brave what do you call chasing down dark wizards practically every day
2296751 risking your life isnt necessarily brave and its hardly personal potter in fact its one of the least personal risks going and its not even remotely brave when you dont have fuck all to say about whether or not you take the risk to begin with after all if you lose all you lose is your life wheres the worry over that if you die its not as though youll be around to mind it much
2296752 real risk taking involves sticking around for the consequences if youre going to make a bet you might as well make it interesting
2296753 well risking my life isnt what were talking about right now its hitting that bulls eye with a dart ill bet you anything you like malfoy theres no fucking way you can hit something that small from this distance
2296754 what just because you cant and you think im arrogant what makes you so sure im not just plain better than you are
2296755 anything i like you say okay potter youre on ill bet you i can hit the center of that target from right where youve been standing three darts three tries well bet a blow job on it
2296756 the word exploded out of harry his surprised voice squeaking in disbelief but even as he forced his tone to be outraged warmth of a very sensual nature flooded him and pooled in his groin
2296757 oh im very serious you said anything i liked and thats what i like
2296758 whats the matter potter afraid to put your mouth where your mouth is
2296759 you seem to go out of your way to insist on that point on a regular basis potter but
2296760 to be fair ill give you a chance to back out since despite most emphatically not being afraid you seem to be more than a bit uncomfortable with the terms ive suggested
2296761 we can always just make a gentlemanly sort of bet where i promise to give you tips on how to throw a dart as part of the deal
2296762 im not uncomfortable malfoy i can handle any stakes you care to set
2296763 and you have no idea how delighted i am by that fact
2296764 open your shirt yes like that no dont take it off just open it and leave the tie there around your neck now sit here
2296765 and now reach up and grab the headboard of the bed
2296766 why did you change the terms of the bet like that
2296767 the bet was just for a blow job we never specified whether the winner would give or receive if i recall correctly
2296768 then whyd you let me think you wanted me to give
2296769 what makes you think i dont ive had some pretty fabulous fantasies about you giving me head harry
2296770 well if thats true why not get it winning the bet gave you the perfect opportunity
2296771 maybe i only want my fantasy to come true if i can have it on my own terms
2296772 its never involved me winning sexual favors from you in a bet
2296773 draco believe me bet or no bet if i didnt want you i wouldnt be here
2296774 is that so well thats handy because if memory serves on another point i did hit the target all three times
2296775 do you have any interest in making good on the other two
2296776 the system isnt allowing me to connect with the server
2296777 im having the same problem its like it doesnt even recognize us anymore
2296778 just relax people stay calm if we cant get in the front door then well have to try the back
2296779 how dare you walk out of your position someone needs to have their back against that wall
2296780 i swear nina every time i look at you you just keep getting sexier
2296781 listen up gentleman i want all of you to look at commanding officer nina no longer as a woman she is to be looked at like one of the guys a very attractive and sexy man one that you wouldnt kick out of bed
2296782 hes got abe annie and yuri in there too im not sure what happened but whatever it is its big
2296783 how do you know this we havent received a call from them for all we know they could be dead
2296784 you must have faith in me comrade i would never put your lives in danger
2296785 now i hate to repeat myself again get your men ready walking through these snowy conditions will prove to be a task for all of us
2296786 if i dont like it i dont read it vote for it
2296787 if i dont like it i dont read it vote for it

2296794 dont you have house elves for this kind of thing
2296795 please potter you think i would leave them in charge of my finest liqueurs and wine vats no this kind of thing definitely requires a humans touch
2296796 well potter this is my study and im in need of a short dalliance while i wait for this wine to breathe care for a seat
2296797 well its home not like the others certainly not like that monstrosity we just left merlin almighty my mother was daft as a bugbear to purchase that place but it was her favourite for some godawful reason and i wouldnt feel i was doing her justice if i let scrimgeour get his dirty little hands on it now would i pride potter must be maintained at all times
2296798 will master please to give flinky instructions on the gentlemens owls that are currently beating down the french doors in the ballroom and carrying very large packages with the name gluckworthy and sons on the return address before the stained glass breaks and flinky must explain to master why he must replace the doors that the most kind and magnanimous former former former mistress had commissioned all the way back when flinky was just a wee elfling
2296799 open the windows and let three of the owls in but tell the fourth to go back home immediately i dont do business with that third gluckworthy son and he had damn well better cease with his insipid brown nosing before i choose to reallocate all of his familys assets the snotty arse
2296800 oh flinky thanks master and will see to it presently

2296802 i really hadnt noticed its become such a madhouse recently what with the holidays i suppose im used to it
2296803 only when i have better prospects for the evening harry
2296804 you wouldnt believe how long ive waited to see you in this manor harry
2296805 my right to rescind any comforts i might have offered in favour of my own
2296806 will master please forgive the intrusion because flinky is indeed more sorry than words can express but that sardovich goblin is in the fireplace asking for particulars again and flinky has told him to bugger off as master specified but he is holding the nasty yellow potion again and flinky is not liking getting splashed with it this time
2296807 tell him the funds have been transferred to his client and will be finalized by next wednesday should he need confirmation he may bother my solicitor after ten tomorrow morning and mind your manners flinky
2296808 if sir pleases mightnt he see to the gentlemen sticking their heads through the floo in the fifth grand fireplace where the bats roost for solstice
2296809 bulper did we not discuss what would happen to lesser house elves who barge in upon the master when he is entertaining guests
2296810 but sir asked to be informed about all matters concerning the swiss account and bulper recognizes mr halifax yes he does
2296811 bulper tell them first that its much too late to be flooing me about their accounts second to straighten out their limited grasp on time zones and third that i will personally curse my fireplaces shut on their ridiculously unaesthetic noses if they insist upon pursuing their inquiries tonight
2296812 yes master certainly master bulper will most positively see to it master
2296813 shall we get out of here to somewhere more comfortable
2296814 salazar harry oh gods you i knew i wasnt expecting the impossible
2296815 never really thought youd take me up on my invitation
2296816 you honestly dont know how long ive been wanting this do you
2296817 does master wish to be informed if mr halifaxs partners have arrived at the gate or would he rather pretend they do not exist again as he did last week and the week before
2296818 send them on their way and for merlins sake make sure the wards are set properly this time last week they got as far as the foyer
2296819 oh but master does not understand the ferociousness of mr halifaxs agents
2296820 flinky does not believe so but master may wish to
2296821 flinky has it on good authority that that is not the case but
2296822 is the wizarding world imploding due to my not speaking to mr halifax tonight
2296823 will flinky please inform mr halifaxs agents that they are to leave the immediate vicinity of the manor before the master sets the thestrals on them
2296824 of all the cheek coming to my home tonight its unbelievable
2296825 you know i really can go if you know if its not such a good night and all
2296826 oh dont be ridiculous potter its a perfectly good night for it
2296827 and its been centuries since that particular centaur wove anything remotely resembling a tapestry so obviously this one is quite rare ive no idea if it really does depict the future but apparently i had several superstitious cousins on my grandfathers side who bet their life savings on it and seeing how much loot my family was swimming in before the war they couldnt have been too far off could they ah here it is
2296828 ive a bigger one in venice would you like another drink
2296829 i should never have waited so long to bring you here
2296830 oh everyone wants you harry i on the other hand demand it
2296831 wasnt sure what id do if you werent the kissing type
2296832 flinky must inform the master that those who must not enter the manor have entered the manor
2296833 flinky tried to douse the fire in the drawing room so the room would be most uncomfortable but masters guests insist upon sitting in the dark and waiting and flinky fears that she will have to be hospitable if they do not leave
2296834 well cant you entertain them for an hour or so flinky its a big mansion give them a tour and then lose them somewhere
2296835 oh all right flinky do go away ill be down in a moment what in grindelwalds name do they want anyway
2296836 flinky must inform master of his rapidly expanding estate in switzerland and that master may wish to bid it farewell before it goes away with the guests and that flinky secretly fears great piles of galleons like the one sitting in the masters foyer
2296837 not enough galleons in the world to bail them out of azkaban when i get through with them
2296838 oh harry this will only take a moment make yourself comfortable
2296839 is mr harry potter going to be wanting tea while he waits or would he prefer firewhisky from the lower vaults
2296840 do you think you could drop the anti apparition wards i ill just be heading home
2296841 right away harry potter sir flinky will just go and inform the master of harry potters imminent departure
2296842 not necessary flinky theres no need to bother the master ill just go really
2296843 oh but that is just not fitting harry potter sir the master would be most angered if flinky neglected to inform him harry potter sir
2296844 the master might make flinky clean the old boots and he knows how much flinky fears the old boots
2296845 no no its okay really he must be very busy hed hate to be interrupted dont you think
2296846 oh flinky understands how important business is flinky will inform the master that something has come up and mr harry potter will be back
2296847 i swear that the weasleys are trying to single handedly rebuild the wizarding population
2296848 even if theyre not concerned with finding pureblood partners for the purpose there was a birth announcement in the prophet today one of them just had twins
2296849 i cant remember one of the boys but that hardly helps narrow it down does it
2296850 the only one still childless is ginny shes nearly thirty shed better get a move on or perhaps its harry who doesnt want children or maybe thinks kids would interfere with their relationship
2296851 theyve certainly been married long enough adrian and i had roderick before our second anniversary
2296852 what on earth are you doing here on a saturday
2296853 thought id mingle with the old crowd for a change you know
2296854 good to see you malfoy this is chloe i dont think youve met
2296855 i thought the potter weasleys were going to come tonight
2296856 didnt you hear the owl she sent apologies perhaps next time
2296857 you know what charon is like on fridays everyone does so its obvious why im here i come to meet men what i want to know is why are you here
2296858 if youre here to pick up someone or be picked up youre doing a piss poor job of it
2296859 at least three men each night would have been happy to do anything you liked i could tell but you wouldnt even go out on the dance floor
2296860 and youre married even pansy queen of gossip doesnt suggest that youve any problems there the opposite if anything so what are you really doing
2296861 no one will pay attention if we look like everyone else
2296862 youre married and yet youre here to pick up men the great harry potter a common adulterer and a shirt lifter to boot no wonder your wife wouldnt appear in public with you last week
2296863 ive been wondering for a long time i love her but lately i only get well i think about men when she and i are together so she finally agreed that maybe i could pursue this to see if i really wanted it but i dont dont know what to do how to act
2296864 well the golden boy has feet of clay after all oh i believe you its too improbable to be a lie so youve come to charon three times and those clay feet have been too cold for you to actually try anything that might let you learn what you want to know like maybe dance
2296865 then im going to drag you out onto the dance floor i trust that youve improved somewhat since that yule ball in fourth year
2296866 hed love to get his arms around you no question
2296867 not so hard as you thought dancing with a bloke is it
2296868 surely you didnt expect anonymity half the wizarding world knows your face
2296869 i didnt oh fuck you dont think theres anyone from the prophet here do you
2296870 theyve had me in the gossip column plenty of times its not that bad
2296871 we didnt think about that possibility i guess this wasnt a good idea
2296872 look you came here to find a bloke to shag right
2296873 i guess ive had a lot of wrong ideas about you
2296874 i guess youve had a lot of practice um i dont i mean im sure i wont be that good
2296875 i thought i supposed that youd expect me to reciprocate
2296876 there are other ways i dont insist that you give me a blow job
2296877 why beat around the bush thats what i want thats what im going to ask for but i dont absolutely insist mind you if youd rather fuck me im happy to wait a bit until youre up for it
2296878 you can talk to me in parseltongue in the meanwhile
2296879 like you were just doing a few minutes ago yes i dont actually understand the language mind you but hearing you speak it is rather delicious call it one of my little quirks
2296880 would it be all right if i just touched you to start with im not quite used to this yet
2296881 im not exactly going to scream like a banshee if you touch me there
2296882 if i fuck you you have something to use i expect
2296883 of course ive several sorts of muggle style lube charms are all right in a pinch but lube is better ive always found
2296884 damn if youre going to do that fuck me while youre at it
2296885 yeah and for for taking me seriously and being kind
2296886 i half expected you to make fun you know since i really didnt know what i was doing
2296887 i didnt think it would be so exciting sex with you i mean oh hell im not saying this right it was not in any way a problem for me that it was you i was glad actually not to be with a complete stranger
2296888 but i dont presume youll want it to happen again
2296889 but you never know potter if you ask me nicely i might be willing to get together again sometime if you havent gotten the itch out of your system
2296890 i dont know ill have to think about it talk to ginny she deserves to know whats happened as soon as i figure it out myself
2296891 i really do appreciate this draco i um i guess ill see myself out
2296892 dobby i need you to tell me when harry has gone to bed okay
2296893 ive got a surprise for him and i need to get it ready without him knowing its something special and i really dont want to spoil it can you let me know when he goes to bed and promise me that you wont tell him
2296894 you can count on me draco malfoy dobby is happy to make sure harry potter has his surprise dobby will be telling draco when harry potter goes to bed
2296895 no dobby this is a private matter i really cant have help with it but thank you
2296896 of course i told him to let me know if you started asking anything about me where i am what im doing what i say when i come
2296897 of course and i know that you were in here the other night
2296898 and in case you were wondering your name in parseltongue is
2296899 i dont know if it will work but ill teach you a few phrases in parseltongue youve already heard your name twice tonight
2296900 youve been waiting to do this for some time now havent you
2296901 yes i have and youve been waiting for the same thing
2296902 because i wanted to see how far youd take it
2296903 and to make sure that i wasnt imagining that you were interested at least as much as i was
2296904 well yes why else would i have trusted you with my invisibility cloak
2296905 perhaps but now its getting late and im getting a bit cold youre still wearing clothes you know
2296906 bed but i cant do that what if someone finds me here
2296907 you can leave in the morning youve still got the invisibility cloak you know
2296908 or if you dont feel like sleeping i can give you a language lesssssssson
2296909 not long ago the lord reminded me that you belonged to him and not me but he said that i will always be your daddy it his my honor to give your hand to dustin
2296910 weasley back there just told you she said you cant even kiss properly kiss potter how pathetic
2296911 so i dont sleep around susan likes that about me
2296912 but if you cant even kiss properly potter no one will give you the time of day
2296913 i i wont touch anyone thats not in a skirt
2296914 youre inexperienced i can help you and if you ever intend on scoring with girls youre going to need to know what youre doing
2296915 i find it hilariously funny i want to see you blunder and who knows maybe im just feeling nice today
2296916 obviously or do i need to explain anatomy to you too
2296917 unless youre some kind of prudish freak you can get yourself off so go ahead
2296918 im going to gather crucial information in which to base your remaining four lessons on from the corridor
2296919 it was valuable information and if you dont like the means in which i have to go to achieve it which i didnt like anyway i dont have to waste my time making you into a non loser i hear girls dig the inexperienced bumbling idiots
2296920 um okay friday in two days at nine again same place
2296921 there are no quidditch practices today therefore no one will walk in and see
2296922 you will be learning the fine art of nipple sucking
2296923 dont use your teeth or only a little scrape every now and then havent you ever touched your nipples when wanking
2296924 its the only way to know if you actually can
2296925 i said nothing without a skirt a girl you know
2296926 i told you i wasnt doing anything to anyone who wasnt in a skirt
2296927 kissings nothing potter so dont act like its a big deal if you had parents you would kiss them
2296928 but you dont so i guess i can see why you think its a big deal but anyway bones even said kissing was a big problem so you need to work on that
2296929 well i never kissed anyone before besides cho and that was wet
2296930 make sure you swallow your spit before i kiss you and theres no need to use so much saliva its not a required substance for kissing in fact dont do anything just get a feel of what im doing
2296931 what were you thinking earlier i had to answer all sorts of ques w what are you wearing
2296932 you are much better at kissing how much have you practiced with her
2296933 quick potter do you have a watch what time is it flitwick can walk in any second were there spells on the door
2296934 do you want flitwick to walk in and find you in the nude with dried come on your chest
2296935 and whats with you and potter we havent heard you ramble about him for a few days
2296936 yes im sure theyre helping each other get girls they are probably fighting
2296937 i dont want you yelling something like that ruin my reputation
2296938 youre kidding right how would that help me with shagging girls
2296939 its common knowledge that you cant properly fuck someone unless youve been fucked
2296940 well if youre going to be to me and you said you cant properly unless youve already been
2296941 im going to show you how to prep a bloke for penetration of course a girl preps herself but i dont know
2296942 you need to relax it wont hurt if you relax
2296943 you pretty much just gave them your best glare ever and ive seen quite a few good ones
2296944 dont lie to me i can see two people are in there unless youre holding a pair of robes whoa susan must have been in a hurry
2296945 i mean ive already been penetrated so wouldnt this show if i can do it since its our last lesson and all
2296946 i dont know what you did with the wands i used shampoo to ease entry
2296947 dont you fucking move unless its to get out no wait dont do that ill move
2296948 no okay i never have the most ive ever done was snog pansy
2296949 itll get better if i can hit that spot youll see stars i swear
2296950 no see it was just lessons i mean were not dating or anything
2296951 a few days ago i had a date with susan
2296952 first five lessons are free after that itll cost you
2296953 first off i dont want to contract any diseases so while the lessons are in session you will be having no sexual contact whatsoever with anyone but me
2296954 what about the fact that im a slytherin and a death eaters son and youre a gryffindor the boy who lived
2296955 and im going to change how you feel for me
2296956 and finally mister filch has asked that i remind you that dungbombs are not an appropriate educational tool if they are to be used for instructional purposes which he strongly discourages please be sure to clean up the resulting filthy residue thoroughly
2296957 as you are no doubt aware there will be no meeting next week to give you all ample time to prepare your examinations the following weeks meeting will be used for planning the end of term feast and other activities the year is almost over congratulations on making it through in one piece
2296958 harry i would like to speak with you the rest of you thank you for your attention and have a pleasant evening
2296959 headmistress i swear i havent been using dungbombs in my class
2296960 thats not what i wish to speak with you about harry i have a somewhat more serious matter to discuss with you
2296961 my goodness you look i apologize if i alarmed you i do not have bad news
2296962 it is a school related matter i wish to discuss with you the tri wizard tournament
2296963 the department of magical games and sports thinks it would be a fitting way to mark the ten year anniversary of the defeat of voldemort i am inclined to agree with them it would be held at hogwarts next school year
2296964 the governing board is insisting that you serve as the head of task safety for the tournament they are concerned that some of the parents would fear for their childrens well being given given the history of the tournament
2296965 harry potter i get it i just i dont think its safe i dont know
2296966 we are really and truly out from under the shadow of the madman harry its time to enjoy the sunshine
2296967 if anything happens to one of our students i promise to personally kill you
2296968 as long as your students play by the rules theyll be fine
2296969 malfoy your student was trying to sneak a look at the first task you know thats against the rules but more than that its dangerous
2296970 thank you professor potter i will handle this nika please go inside
2296971 everyone knows you had help when you were in the tournament if you know whats good for you youll look the other way next time you see a durmstrang student wandering about where theyre not supposed to be
2296972 and dont you dare threaten me not if you know whats good for you
2296973 it is not fair zhat some of zhe creatures in todays task were native to zis country it as given zhe ogwarts student an unfair advantage she must have known not to fear zhe what do you call zhem limpies our sebastien was only zhe slowest one because e did not know zhat such fishes were armless
2296974 hogwarts finest youre teaching defence arent you pansy told me
2296975 thats nice that you keep in touch with your friends mine are all dead
2296976 dunno so what is she youre not married to her or anything are you
2296977 merlin no were seeing each other in an exclusive fashion seven years of bliss i think when you add it all up and really seeing isnt quite the right word she lives in america at the moment which presents a bit of a logistical challenge
2296978 wow youre professor of defence against the dark arts too
2296979 oh but why there its so far from home dont you miss yknow stuff id miss stuff
2296980 as im sure youd remember if you werent totally pissed i have no home your people took it from me despite what i did why would i want to be here being here does nothing but remind me of what ive lost you have no idea what thats like
2296981 wait this could be fun sure tell me my fortune
2296982 you will travel a great deal in your life ah and you have already met your soul mate
2296983 is that all ive gotten more thorough predictions from packets of breakfast cereal
2296984 we were told that the tasks were designed by an impartial committee
2296985 tossers do you know their proposal involved four separate magical beasts rated five xs or higher as if i was going to approve a plan that required teenagers to face a chimaera not to mention a manticore i mean why not just throw them into a cage with a nundu while youre at it
2296986 so they just let you redesign the of course they did youre harry bloody potter
2296987 let me they made me they didnt much like it when i called them a bunch of incompetent sadistic child abusers apparently they took that as an insult
2296988 so they said they werent going to change a thing on their design and if i wanted changes i had to do them myself so i did itll be on your head when the spectators all die of boredom they said but i think the first task went really well it was exciting and no one got hurt
2296989 yes it was good wholesome fun for the whole family
2296990 yes i know but im leaving at the crack of dawn travelling pansy is coming home for christmas so im spending the holidays with her family
2296991 look potter being emotionally stunted i dont expect youll understand but seven years is a long time
2296992 its impossible to know someone for that long and still find them exciting i dont know i suppose if shes my bloody soul mate i ought to just marry her marriage is the next step isnt it its what one does although to be honest i had been thinking of breaking things off with her its got to be one or the other something needs to change
2296993 but you cant go off and marry her just because that old witch said youd already met your soul mate thats ridiculous you dont even know if its her it could be it could be anyone
2296994 ha ha very funny i just mean you shouldnt marry her if you dont want to be with her you shouldnt its not fair to her thats not how things are supposed to be
2296995 someone broke into my office and stole some of my notes on the second task
2296996 it is especially since theres only a week until the task and i havent time to redo it which means that someone will have an unfair advantage in the competition
2296997 no i want you to admit to being the culprit i know it was you
2296998 i didnt touch your fucking notes and i dont appreciate the accusation
2296999 it has nothing to do with i am not god shut up malfoy youre the only one who knows that i designed the tasks myself
2297000 potter if i had broken into your office and rifled through your papers you can be sure that i would have left no trace and we would not be having this conversation
2297001 you are the head of task safety everyone knows that you were consulted on the design and implementation of each task you had to inspect the task setup and presumably document your safety assessment
2297002 just because it could have been anyone doesnt mean it wasnt you
2297003 if i prove that it wasnt me or any other member of the durmstrang delegation would you be willing to take steps to rectify the current information imbalance
2297004 that can be discussed later do you or do you not want the competition to be fair
2297005 why do you keep staring at me its rude to stare you know
2297006 sorry i just want to keep track of the time
2297007 im getting a rust spot arent i is it my minute hand it feels itchy
2297008 youre lying ive been hanging in this room since 1883 i can tell when im being lied to im getting a spot admit it
2297009 of course i didnt i couldnt very well have looked through every room in an hour could i
2297010 what does it matter potter dont you want your precious papers back then go get them shes still in the great hall finishing her lunch
2297011 eight minutes ill have to go get them during dinner if they really are there
2297012 i did i cant even say that im surprised she had them after the first task she was very upset that sebastien had done so poorly i suppose she wanted him to do better this time around
2297013 i had valid reasons for suspecting you so you can drop the persecuted act
2297014 act what act i just want to hear you say it
2297015 i want to know how you knew the truth though
2297016 lets just say i know how to uncover information its better if you dont ask too many questions about my methods i wouldnt want you to have to report me to the ministry
2297017 i see lucky the culprit wasnt a hogwarts student or else you would have been out of luck
2297018 yes id noticed clearly they have at least one competent teacher
2297019 lets discuss what you can do to even out the playing field so to speak
2297020 the papers were gone when i came into my office this morning i got them back at half six this evening even assuming that she stole them yesterday just after i left my office for the evening at the most she had access to the information for twenty two hours
2297021 fine hand them over and ill return them tomorrow at what the bloody hell is wrong with your clock turn and face me like a proper timepiece thats better ill return them at five oclock tomorrow sorry at three minutes past five
2297022 you think im an idiot dont you dont answer that it was a rhetorical question
2297023 did you write this while holding the quill with your toes ive seen trolls with better penmanship
2297024 and here we are at this line again what the fuck does this say is it even english or any language that uses the roman alphabet i think ill just blackmail you into telling me what it says or i could torture you nothing is stopping me from casting something nasty on you right now i know this is the key this line right here put the something on something cast something or cat something but its probably cast since cat isnt a verb last i checked sod it cant i just stay quiet unless ive miraculously learned to read your baboon writing surely by now youve grown tired of hearing my every thought fascinating though i may be
2297025 no keep talking or else ill take the notes away and youll never see them again
2297026 fine take them theyre useless madame roux was probably glad when she discovered theyd been taken away from her nothing but a bunch of cryptic squiggles and symbols masquerading as descriptions of obstacles
2297027 once this is over potter you are going to pay for this i cant even begin to tell you wait
2297028 yes i did stop talking thats because im too shocked to speak what kind of a task is this you do realize the competitors are children dont you
2297029 of course i know theyre children one of them is my own student
2297030 this says cast erogenus please dont tell me they have to turn themselves on in order to get through the task
2297031 that is without question the worst poker face i have ever seen and ive played poker with house elves
2297032 you dont even know what the erogenus spell does do you
2297033 its a fantastic little charm it allows you to turn any part of your body into an erogenous zone just imagine instead of having only ten having hundreds of them
2297034 i was but ten i thought there was just the one
2297035 oh potter no wonder youre still single you are single arent you
2297036 the human body has seven specific erogenous zones and three non specific i advise you to look them up before your next encounter with anything other than your right hand
2297037 what is it your left hand then how was i to know
2297038 yes you are youre alive but you havent lived youre hiding from life
2297039 all i know is that you could have everything ive ever wanted fame glory power fortune but instead of living that life the life you could have youre holed up in this old castle
2297040 you should get back to the notes youre wasting time
2297041 i am and you are reading simple enchantments to spice up your love life
2297042 where was i oh right i was lamenting the quality of your penmanship
2297043 thats three hours unless you want to use your discretionary hour
2297044 so did you figure anything else out you got kind of quiet near the end there
2297045 you were so engrossed in your reading that i didnt think youd noticed but no i didnt figure anything out i was merely in a stupor of frustration
2297046 thank you so what did you learn tonight do you know all ten now at least
2297047 oh well i couldnt find all ten in that book i mean it said there were ten but didnt list them all but lets see lips neck um nipples and um the one i already knew about they called it the male member thats funny like its in some sort of club
2297048 yes a club where the members wear odd little hats
2297049 right with oh i always thought it looked like more of a helmet but a hat yeah okay this conversation is officially weird
2297050 at least you know four of them thats a start
2297051 i suppose i dont really understand the neck one though
2297052 someone else has to do it for you to really feel it
2297053 its one in the morning the entire castle is asleep
2297054 no i heard something it it might be a student
2297055 wait no i didnt mean we could go to my room
2297056 yeah i dont mind its just its probably best that youre not seen leaving my room in the morning
2297057 for once potter you and i are in perfect agreement that would be disastrous fuck i cant believe i fell asleep
2297058 id ask what youre smiling about but im sure i already know
2297059 i was referring to the exceptional performance that your fiona is giving if i didnt know better id think she knew something that the other two didnt
2297060 what are you never mind look i wanted to talk to you
2297061 i just wanted to say that im sorry for bolting like that this morning it wasnt anything personal i why are you smiling like that
2297062 well dont worry i didnt mean it it was purely strategic theres a better chance of last night happening again if you arent annoyed with me
2297063 but why would i be annoyed i asked you to leave i would be annoyed if you hadnt left
2297064 you keep saying that durmstrang students get a more thorough education
2297065 mmm theres a reason for that you wont like it youd stop speaking to me id lose my fuck buddy and then what would i do the sexual frustration alone would kill me
2297066 besides technically i dont think that fuck buddies need to be on speaking terms with one another
2297067 we could have angry hate filled sex and never say a word
2297068 look potter the dark arts have a long tradition in in the country where durmstrang is located
2297069 theres no such thing dark spells are dark precisely because their very nature violates basic human rights their sole purpose is for evil
2297070 you dont need to know dark magic to do evil
2297071 you dont have to do evil just because you know dark magic
2297072 oh so what its not as if you can do good with a dark curse either
2297073 on the first day of class i present the following scenario to my first years one wizard casts the imperius curse on a man who is about to murder someone and commands him to stop saving the other mans life another wizard casts a full body bind on a man as he is walking down the stairs causing him to fall and break his neck only one of those spells is considered dark magic only one of those spells is cast with the intent to harm note that they are not the same spell
2297074 just because you can find a positive use for one dark spell
2297075 its not just one i could do that with any of them
2297076 meet me by the lake this afternoon i want to talk to you about something
2297077 but think of all the extra hours youll have to sleep
2297078 i suppose id rather have you preferably on your stomach and naked
2297079 im going to see pansy shell be home for easter
2297080 that would be much more believable if you didnt look like you were about to get up and dance a jig
2297081 a jig who does that is that what you pure bloods do for fun
2297082 we dance the jig and then when were tired we sit around planning new and inventive ways to torture muggles
2297083 so once we once i am a free man i im not quite sure how it will work but we could try being more public i suppose maybe not yet but eventually
2297084 sorry i am excited but it is a little frightening im not worried about the students or other teachers but word will get out ive kind of gotten used to being out of the public eye
2297085 im not saying we should take out a full page advertisement in the prophet we just wouldnt have to hide anymore
2297086 if we stop hiding our relationship we might as well have taken out that advert
2297087 youre overestimating the level of interest the wizarding world has in your private life fame doesnt last forever
2297088 yes we have youve been avoiding me why are you upset you didnt even seem that enthusiastic about the idea in the first place
2297089 im not upset you said you couldnt do this and having thought about it i agree neither can i im not avoiding you you simply no longer have relevance to my life
2297090 you thought no wonder you were angry i didnt mean i couldnt do this i meant i couldnt end things with pansy
2297091 we were carrying on perfectly well before when i was with pansy i see no reason why that should change
2297092 you have two seconds to get out of my way and thirty seconds after that to get naked and in my bed
2297093 fuck buddies dont need to be on speaking terms with one another that was mind blowing
2297094 fuck you potter you pretend to be fine with our arrangement but the moment you see me with justin you bloody smile at me like a simpering fool i suppose your plan is to have pansy find out about us and then once shes left me we can fly off into the sunset together is that what you think will happen because i promise you if she finds out about this it is over between us
2297095 what the hell are you talking about what does justin have to do with pansy i didnt smile like a simpering fool i only smiled because you were with one of my students and i thought that glaring at you might have looked odd believe me id rather have glared
2297096 what does justin have to do with you mean you dont know hes her fucking cousin why do you think i never spend the entire night here im living in the slytherin guest quarters if im not there in the morning hell tell her shes not terribly clever but shell realize that im up to something
2297097 the committee was right why dont i have them solve a crossword puzzle instead that would be more challenging than this ooh maybe i can make them work it using ink instead of a pencil that would make it even more dangerous
2297098 if you must be sarcastic this early in the morning can you please be quietly sarcastic
2297099 its been years too many it feels like a lifetime
2297100 they say she might even be released soon maybe in a few years shes almost herself again
2297101 not that shell ever be completely the same she asked about you last time i visited she always does shell be so pleased when i tell her that ive seen you you know next time youre in london you should visit her shed really like that
2297102 shes great shes got such a wicked sense of humour
2297103 some of the pranks she plays if i didnt know better id swear she was somehow fred or georges but youll see soon enough if all goes well shell be here at hogwarts next year
2297104 yeah i know its last minute but i could really use your help
2297105 with less than a month until the task itll be tough these things take time and ive been out of the field for years now but i think i can pull it off i still have my connections
2297106 i told her it was over she wanted to kill me
2297107 so what does that even mean you wanted me before too and then you didnt im supposed to believe you this time
2297108 come and visit me this summer and ill try to explain youll enjoy yourself i have a cottage in the mountains and goats
2297109 you will always be welcome back here harry any time
2297110 the wizengamots already tried him taken away his wand you know thats the worse punishment for a pureblood
2297111 why he did it i reckon whether it was worth it
2297112 you know i thought sixth year that you fancied him a bit you were always trailing after him
2297113 a few more years seeing what people are mad enough to do to one another and youll change your tune pick your battles believe me lad youll be glad of it
2297114 holland walk council housing ollivers said to send you down
2297115 bigger lot of tits ive never seen almost puts timmons to shame
2297116 pity could use your voudoun down there third one of these in the past month
2297117 geoff anders caucasian male late twenties probably using an alias given that he was found in this section of islington throat slashed left to right vivisected and genitalia removed
2297118 send me the full reports maybe another pair of eyes
2297119 expect them this evening but i think you ought to see this its why i called you down
2297120 poor sod looks rather a bit like you doesnt he
2297121 what are you doing here potter i sincerely doubt its for sex
2297122 filth are you now i suppose i shouldnt be surprised once an auror always one muggle or not i suppose
2297123 by shagging any bloke who wants a slap and tickle
2297124 surely not you you wanted me in azkaban as i recall
2297125 the last time i saw him was after my hearing you know
2297126 but i prefer it to the alternative particularly given the life span of former death eaters in the wizarding world
2297127 you didnt have to take the mark you didnt have to do what he asked
2297128 i never had a choice potter just as you never had a choice about killing him
2297129 is that everything i did was to keep my parents alive and for what it was always going to be either his lordship or the ministry
2297130 christ the way muggles treat their deads inhuman cant they at least mend the skin
2297131 they dont match any of the missing wizard reports i have
2297132 then again the descriptions not really much to go on unless you turned up missing
2297133 dont go doing that all right bad enough when you lit off with that french bird last christmas and didnt tell anyone mum nearly had a heart attack
2297134 horrible shite next time i bring the beer all right
2297135 ill leave those files with you just dont lose them or kingsleyll have my arse
2297136 you know you could come back any time tonks tells me that every time we have a meeting
2297137 you know as well as i do it never will i wont ever be anything but the boy who lived and im tired of it all besides i rather like straddling both worlds like this
2297138 tell hermione hello if you see her before sunday shes coming over to take luna shopping but i think thats just an excuse for luna not to have to go to dinner at the burrow and have mum ask her again why were not married yet
2297139 i truly hope youve a decent excuse for bringing me into this hellhole at such an ungodly hour
2297140 no and this ungodly hour is two in the afternoon
2297141 anders griffin whitman odd but they all seem to have familiar faces
2297142 youre mad potter now either charge me with something or let me go
2297143 leave me be potter please for merlins sake just leave me and all of this be
2297144 better make this quick kingsleys in rare form today were all putting galleons on whether or not tonks made him sleep in the library again
2297145 so i reckon youre wanting to know what i found
2297146 cross referenced every ministry file i could wiggle my way into and let me tell you i probably broke a few codes in the process better be bloody glad ive high level access mate
2297147 in those combinations no according to the ministry they dont exist
2297148 thought you might like them might be some others tucked in there too i couldnt be too thorough with kingsley breathing down my neck interesting stuff in there dont know how useful itll be makes for good gossip though did you know old ollivander had three brothers weird only showed up because his mums mum was an anders one of them had a squib in the family too very hush hush that padma patil married one four years back an anders that is not a squib i think i remember hermione trying to make me go to the wedding when we were together
2297149 i got you out of it last minute by pretending to be ill
2297150 oh right she caught us out didnt she oh and crabbe remember that piece of shite he had a whitman for an aunt
2297151 you realise its well past time you had a new partner yes
2297152 stop breaking into personnels records you cant tell me youve forgotten how tetchy they were about it last time they caught you
2297153 stop being a prick potter or get off your lazy arse and come over to scd
2297154 its just i find it odd that i unexpectedly run into an old schoolmate who happens to have connections to your case
2297155 no such thing really as a coincidence especially when it comes to rentboys blokell do a lot if he needs a few pounds
2297156 let me in or i take you and whomever youve got in there down to the station
2297157 are you trying to get me to take you in
2297158 he says you might as well come upstairs before youre too pissed to walk
2297159 its midnight potter and youre in my sitting room do forgive me if i wonder what the hell you might want from me
2297160 seven years almost since i last saw you at the hearing and now suddenly you show up right at the time when theres a murder case that
2297161 i followed you the other night i didnt intend for you to see me i didnt know if youd be needed i just wanted to know how i could find you if you were
2297162 something anything you are the boy who lived after all seemed like a good idea to find you in case
2297163 you want to explain how four of you lot ended up bending over for a few pounds
2297164 ill ring you on your mobile when i find out i want to check something first
2297165 i can give you five minutes but you owe me potter
2297166 tickets to arsenal against man united i promise patrick up the arse and all what
2297167 better come through this time or ill put a bug in timmons ear
2297168 shrinkage its freezing in here and he doesnt have any flowing blood
2297169 its not just polyjuice obviously there are traces of an additional potion of some sort possibly transfiguratory which makes sense
2297170 itd keep the form after death very difficult to break too its just usually those sorts of potions are considered very experimental because they tend to border on poisons you have to be very adept at brewing either of them its far too easy to mix them and end up with a potion thats a poison or a poison thats a potion or both
2297171 weve done a bit of work with them at the ministry mostly based on death eater research
2297172 i dont know id have to examine the molecular structure and magical signature of the potion remnants and that takes time
2297173 but we do know they were forced to drink something before death
2297174 not necessarily some potions can be delivered intravenously st mungos does it all the time with unconscious patients and there are dark potions that work best through a cut in the skin
2297175 maybe although im not getting the proper readings from the wounds to say definitively check the reports again
2297176 something could have been overlooked or maybe there was a puncture wound a needle of some sort could have been used far easier to transport potions to be used offensively in that manner the death eaters did it from time to time during the war
2297177 small circular wound probably surrounded by a slight bit of bruising id say
2297178 but i know whos at the top of my list now
2297179 you cant jump to conclusions just because you dont like this rentboy of yours
2297180 whats wrong with you potter youre acting like a twat for christs sake think youve a bloke whos connected to these murders same profession same background knew at least one of them well enough to leave a message on his mobile wont tell you anything except a vague indication that hes scared shitless now is he your suspect or your next victim
2297181 and how many times have you run up against that in this line of work
2297182 youll have something shortly a name at least for this poor fellow i think ive enough for the aurors to trace a magical signature at least
2297183 you know theyll want to take this on though its not muggle any longer
2297184 if malfoys involved harry the wizengamot will have to be notified
2297185 is there any way to keep it hush for now
2297186 hes high enough to get me auror laboratory access without having to file an actual report and ive a contact in the labs who could probably assist as long as ron signs off on it
2297187 ask him tell him he owes me that favour from last year still hell know what you mean
2297188 shes right you know the aurors will take this over at some point they have to
2297189 i have an odd feeling wouldnt hurt to check it out
2297190 its the middle of the day trust me hes probably sleeping last night off
2297191 we have to do something youre better at the spell than i am
2297192 i can patch him up a bit enough to move him maybe but hes going to need a healer harry and soon
2297193 try to hold him closed its going to hurt and hes going to move ive never seen a wizard in the field stay still through this
2297194 itd take too long to convince them to treat him
2297195 i mean she mostly works with babies and such but shes a healer and malfoys not that far off from a baby really
2297196 look well take him back to my flat hell be safer there and then you can talk to cho shes more likely to do it if you ask her
2297197 hes just my best witness for a case all right
2297198 just give him the potions and keep him in bed for at least a day or two id prefer longer but given that you wont let me take him to st mungos id say thats the longest the two of you will be able to manage not killing each other
2297199 you dont need to report this to the mle cho
2297200 tell luna ill see her and the sprog to be tuesday morning
2297201 i should check on malfoy anyway when he wakes ive a few questions for him
2297202 just be careful harry and im not just talking about whatever it is youve managed to get yourself caught up in here
2297203 you know really you could use a cushioning charm on this bloody mattress
2297204 judging from this utter pigsty i highly doubt itd make any difference if i did
2297205 i suppose theres no way to dissuade you you always did have a one track mind
2297206 and you know a great deal more than youre letting on
2297207 and id prefer gregory goyle not to be going about looking like me either
2297208 dont even start unless youre going to tell me who the other two are and why the bloody hell they decided to polyjuice themselves
2297209 the three of them polyjuiced when we were working whenever we were pretending to be muggle really you dont understand what its like potter its not safe to be yourself on the streets and anything you can do to protect yourself you do it only took greg being followed home and having the bloody fuck beaten out of him once before i realised that we had to do something and polyjuice seemed the easiest solution
2297210 maybe i didnt care maybe it didnt matter if i was beaten or whatever happened
2297211 and its not like i had anyone who gave a damn
2297212 its how we coped with what the wizengamot forced us to be
2297213 i suppose you think we should be lucky to have escaped azkaban
2297214 howd you get the potion if you couldnt make it
2297215 snape may be half mad but he could still brew until lately at least he owled it to us i couldnt meet with him the aurors monitored our conversations but they thought vincent was too thick to bother with he asked him for it and snape agreed
2297216 he always did look after us even when we didnt deserve it
2297217 so he turned the other three into himself me and remus
2297218 really potter youre the thick one he had lupins hair still from brewing wolfsbane for part of the potion
2297219 yours was easy enough to get from the weasley girls room you go and see her often enough
2297220 and dont say shes not youre not the only one who gives a damn about someone whos off their nut anyway
2297221 not for long his lordship made certain of that didnt he
2297222 and he didnt force me so dont even suggest that or ill pound your bloody face in
2297223 you cant lose yourself in madness as much as you might like you cant throw your own life away
2297224 about all of this thats why you came to me
2297225 theres a lot of things im not telling you potter
2297226 youve fucked me you might as well call me harry when youre not in me as well
2297227 have you ever done something that you regretted i mean truly honestly regretted
2297228 slytherins arent exactly good at helping its far more of a gryffindor thing to do
2297229 hed only taken the mark a few months earlier and it was his first time out with greyback
2297230 that sometimes the only way we could manage to get through what we were asked to do was to be entirely pissed out of our minds if you numbed yourself enough then you didnt think about what you had to do or about the blood or the shit or any of it
2297231 we were all drunk and we tried to fix him but it didnt work none of it did we only made things worse and then the only thing i could do he was begging me he knew he was going to die
2297232 at least i thought i didnt now there are a hundred ways id do it differently i think about them every night
2297233 he was one of my best friends and i killed him
2297234 father of course and snape he helped us hide zabinis body among the dead that day he did it for me his lordship would have killed me
2297235 there were strict rules on that sort of thing the dark lord didnt want us going about thinning his ranks
2297236 it has to be snape he was so angry with us that day it was the last time he came to me that night he couldnt look me in the face he told me id sickened him that id gone too far down fathers path
2297237 and i figured youd nothing in your pantry but beer and crisps
2297238 its not exactly a surprise love i broke up with you because i was tired of your giving boys arses a better once over than you gave mine
2297239 now where is the patient i should probably go let him get the appalled shouting over with so he can be fed i think
2297240 you dont think this professor of yours could be responsible
2297241 anyway if he thinks it might be i dont discount that
2297242 its not like him mad or not and ive no idea how he might get out of mungos
2297243 you find out what you need to about the professor ill pop my head in make sure theyre all right
2297244 its entirely impossible for anyone to leave hospital without our knowing
2297245 and the ministry requires that we keep extra wards and charms on professor snape in particular
2297246 i need to talk to you about zabini and crabbe and goyle and nott
2297247 someones after him theyve already tried and i dont know who it could be
2297248 i told him you were off at the yard sent him on a five minute tirade
2297249 and i picked up your mobile a few minutes ago
2297250 he cuts them first while theyre still alive and then she poisons them with a potion
2297251 theres something i need to tell you at some point but nows not the time just whatever you do dont panic all right
2297252 we go from the middle of the station to outside your flat and you say not now
2297253 im a wizard this is magic and youre going to bloody well help me because if hes hurt draco im not going to be responsible for what i do and id rather not spend the rest of my life in prison or in azkaban
2297254 you better have some better explanations when this is done
2297255 and you promised potter you promised wed find the bastards some day and we did and now i want whats mine
2297256 a madman talks all one needs to do is listen
2297257 so what you used me you lied to me about what you knew let me think youd no idea about magic and the ministry
2297258 as if youd want to associate with a squib and a bastard son at that
2297259 i thought you were a muggle and i didnt care why would i damn it olliver you killed three men
2297260 is the last bloody favour im doing for you for quite a while
2297261 i dont suppose anyones bothered to think about the person over here sodding bleeding to death now have they
2297262 i had to pull a few strings and so did ron but the wizengamots dropped the restrictions on your magic
2297263 weve been trying for six months now and today its official
2297264 so if anyones dead id suggest just sending the poor buggers on to the morgue because theres a rather good possibility that ive no intention of letting him up at all today right then ta and all that muggle shite
2297265 i am so going to be sacked some day because of you
2297266 youre the one who keeps asking me to fuck you in your office now
2297267 about to take my trousers off and shag the hell out of me with your wand
2297268 excellent work that must have been a record under ten minutes
2297269 the final stage is the most difficult for people malfoy for everyone skill and training wont get you anywhere in character testing this is about you personally and whether or not we think youve got what it will take to survive as an auror youll be forced to look hard at yourself and few people enjoy that or know how to do it honestly youll be made to do it honestly
2297270 everyone knows the character testing is the worst part youve got until tomorrow afternoon malfoy take the morning off
2297271 meet us in the conference room in the auror department
2297272 well spend the morning reviewing your personal information and so forth it will work like an interview at least at first lets say two oclock
2297273 what what do you mean what why havent you returned my calls if youre home
2297274 pansy i just got home and i just stepped out of the shower
2297275 what are you doing now i assume you have no plans like always
2297276 and since you havent eaten yet why dont we meet somewhere and you can tell me about it
2297277 giannettas at ten dont be late for once in your life im tired and i want to get to bed within the next ten hours
2297278 there are a few things we need to talk about
2297279 as you know i am the auror responsible for overseeing this section of your qualification but i do it with information and observations that my colleagues in the department gather throughout the training process for the past three years as you know a record of personal information has been kept on each one of the trainees specific detailed information the way you move your head when being given information the direction your eyes shift at certain points of a conversation exactly which muscles in your face tense when youre attacking an opponent for a training exercise all of these little things are fair game we analyse them we discuss them and finally at the end we share our findings with you and discuss them together the reason we save the character testing for the end is that in many ways it is the hardest level of the training to become an auror takes more personal integrity as well as your many consider skills and it takes in turn a great deal of willingness to be fully honest with yourself about yourself
2297280 im sure youre aware that many trainees reach this point and fail to qualify because of this level of the testing we dont take pleasure in their failure but it has proven over time to be the most effective method of weeding out the people who will break on the job who will let personal agenda take priority over safety or a successful mission are you prepared to enter this level
2297281 all right then let us begin all in all malfoy youre a very strong candidate i think you know that
2297282 comes from a quality that we actually look and hope for in aurors ironically in your case we wonder if it doesnt go a little far
2297283 but sometimes an outward calm can hide turmoil beneath the surface in fact quite often when people are that good at keeping up the impassive look its a cover weve spent a good deal of time in the past three years trying to uncover your turmoil your turmoil is your weakness the factor that will undo you we have to drag it out into the look and examine it find out why its there and what its doing to you your life your work
2297284 what if theres no turmoil what if im just quiet
2297285 in fact you can be quite vocal especially when provoked no theres turmoil unresolved issues we have no doubt of this in fact weve even made a list of your trigger points listen
2297286 nearly everyone reacts badly to their families being insulted or wronged
2297287 your ancestry same thing your performance you have a lot of pride malfoy possibly too much arrogance is only arrogance when it outweighs the amount of talent supporting it luckily youre very talented but talent alone and we cannot stress this highly enough will not get you where youre going
2297288 youre not arrogant but it comes close to the line sometimes granted its justified youre one of the best wizards your age around
2297289 the biggest issue though at least as we see it is potter
2297290 its always been a trigger point had been since before either of us met you the jealousy the resentment the outright hatred if i may you may have fought on the same side of the war but that doesnt make you friends
2297291 since when has it become law to be potters friend
2297292 this is exactly the point malfoy its not a law but it is a personal weakness and one that could be exploited to your disadvantage were not saying that you have to be friends with everyone in order to be a good auror but this particular vendetta goes so far back and runs so deeply that we think it would cloud your judgement thats the concern
2297293 could you work with potter if you had to malfoy be honest could you be civil and professional and not allow any personal history to get in the way
2297294 if its just a hypothetical question why does it matter
2297295 its not public information potter has been living undercover among the muggles for nearly two years now i trust youll keep this confidential the fact of the matter is that you may very well be one of the few wizards skilled enough to partner him we havent thought it through or anything that detailed its a possibility thats all but before we get as far as even thinking about assignments you can see why your personal relationship with potter matters to us
2297296 if you can prove to us that you can deal with your issues sufficient to the task as we see it of becoming a fully qualified auror then youre on your way it is difficult for most people though as we said earlier it requires a level of self honesty that most people dont want to get into its not comfortable looking at ourselves on the deeper levels i think this is a deep seated issue for you that probably extends all the way back throughout your childhood its perfectly understandable your father was a death eater you were born in the same year as potter went through hogwarts with him as his rival and by pure circumstance his natural enemy until you left your family of course but by then the two of you had developed a bad history and its never been resolved if you pass your character testing i wont lie to you malfoy youll be one of the ministrys top aurors and wed be privileged to have you potter is one of our very best and if we cant trust you to comport yourselves professionally together then we simply cant have you on staff
2297297 we have confidence that you can complete this final assignment successfully i think youll be a happier person for it if you can learn to leave this childish rivalry behind youre twenty seven years old its time to move on
2297298 genuinely not just friendly terms but a true friendship get to know him find out what hes like one on one what he likes to do in his spare time how he likes his current assignment whatever you dont need to like all of his friends and acquaintances though it would obviously make it easier ill let you in on something when potter went through this training we made him enrol in anger management classes he learned a lot about emotional control and processing things slowly and its done him well before that we didnt think he necessarily had the emotional fortitude it would take he could learn more of that from you we think it would be a beneficial friendship as far as the ministry and particularly the auror department is concerned
2297299 sometimes often weve had candidates get up and walk out of the room before the explanation of the assignment was even finished people dont like this part i personally think youve got one of the easiest assignments weve ever given
2297300 we do know that it will be harder that it sounds
2297301 im glad you heard it out what do you say
2297302 we thought you would we were hoping you would i should say now some of the finer points you have six months wed like to check in with you then and see how things are going
2297303 thats longer than most people get for the final assignment
2297304 we know that friendship doesnt happen overnight so we figured the extra time might be helpful well check in once a month or so and see its the twenty fifth of november today see what you can do in the meantime we trust youll recall that the final assignment as the others is completely confidential not a word not to a soul obviously if potter finds out the whole bet is off and no one wants that youll remember
2297305 good man malfoy this is an invite to the annual ministers ball i dont know whether youve already been invited or not but its become more exclusive in recent years potter will be there it might be a good place to start
2297306 we have every confidence in your social abilities as well as your abilities on the field malfoy best wishes
2297307 i completely fail to understand how your assignment requires you to go to a ball
2297308 look do you want to come or not if not im fine going by myself
2297309 as if youd be caught dead going to the social happening of the year without a date even if its only a fake date
2297310 who would you even take if i didnt want to go
2297311 you dont need to rub in it any more than you did then
2297312 its not my fault your gaydar doesnt work for shite fine ill take that as a no now if youll excuse me i have some things to do
2297313 ill go if you need a date id love to go to that ball you know that
2297314 its friday night cocktails at six ill be there for my assignment so i might need to talk to some people whatever happens just dont make a big deal out of it all right
2297315 wouldnt dream of it im very discreet you do your thing and ill work the room
2297316 i have to go shopping you look exhausted get some rest
2297317 i was thinking of having a nap ill call you or something
2297318 i didnt know you knew that im teaching herbology now that pomonas retired
2297319 its all right if you like that sort of thing
2297320 oh this and that trying to get my life sorted that sort of thing you
2297321 must make it easier to make the transition from living without magic
2297322 actually im still using magic just carefully but i did grow up with electricity yes
2297323 yes i would use it when i wasnt even thinking about i dont think i could do it for too long a time besides i would hate feeling like a muggle
2297324 what are you doing here malfoy who did you come with
2297325 shes probably off finding someone to take her home later
2297326 please i havent drunk enough for that to be funny yet
2297327 harry i just saw witherbee across there im going to say hello
2297328 tell him to answer your owls while youre at it
2297329 i dont think weve ever had that long a conversation before
2297330 so i heard you werent a fan of events like these
2297331 i just came to keep neville company he wanted to come
2297332 i brought pansy because she would have clawed my eyes out if shed found out i had an invitation to this and didnt invite her
2297333 what are you drinking can i get you something i need a refill
2297334 i wasnt planning to drink tonight but i suppose one cant hurt
2297335 five questions and i make no guarantee to answer anything no quick quotes quills
2297336 sharon alexander the owl and scroll and your friend is
2297337 this is draco malfoy i went to school with him at hogwarts
2297338 now that the war is over what are you planning to do with your life
2297339 may i ask why not or will that cost me another question
2297340 all right will you take my head off if i ask about your personal life
2297341 it isnt im single and not looking to be otherwise
2297342 i follow them out of loyalty to my best friend
2297343 have to you have no idea how snubbed people get when i dont show up for whatever charity ball theyre throwing especially if i come without a date
2297344 its not very likely that i would the only people who would want to come with me are fame seekers i dont want that even if its just a sham i dont want that either
2297345 thats a good one malfoy i want to be left alone
2297346 no i didnt mean now malfoy i just meant in general
2297347 come on sit down its kind of nice having the company
2297348 if its so nice why did you take off before
2297349 oh then i was just pissed off about the reporter i hate it when they come up to me at these things i get it every single time i can almost ask their questions for them what are you doing now who are you seeing weve been hearing strange rumours could you address them all that do you have post war trauma if theyre trying to be creative
2297350 im just trying to figure out how to live a normal life like a normal person do normal people things and all that
2297351 i could forget it or at least let it be the past and stay there but its like the public wont let me move on and fade into obscurity i never wanted people to know who i am i was shocked when i found out that i was a wizard let alone a famous one that people like you had been reading about their entire childhoods i never did know how to deal with it and now that its all over i still dont and im tired of trying i just want to be
2297352 maybe youll never be forgotten but you could still live normally and do normal things
2297353 what sort of thing do you want to do anyway
2297354 why not theyre the first team i got familiar with thanks to ron
2297355 i have tickets to the cannons vs tornados game on tuesday i dont suppose you would want to come i have a spare ticket
2297356 i dont have plans to go with anyone else so far
2297357 dont be a twit potter normal people go to quidditch matches correct im offering dont take it if you dont want it but if you do then come its not complicated
2297358 i dont need to know what you do potter relax
2297359 sorry im not supposed to talk about it thats all
2297360 thats about empty id say finish it off and lets get out of this alley
2297361 why dont i meet you outside the ministry say and we can take a portkey ill be in the neighbourhood and i can pick one up six thirty
2297362 i have an idea why dont we disillusion ourselves for the match that way perhaps no one would recognise you and bother you
2297363 sorry malfoy i forgot myself there thought i was with ron or something
2297364 git i think i can say that much at least
2297365 it doesnt have to be anything formal just coffee even
2297366 yeah it felt good to get out and do something like this i had fun hanging out with you too its nice talking to someone who knows so much about quidditch and flying
2297367 hates his wife but would never leave her hes too dependant on her inheritance plus hes never learned how to do his own laundry
2297368 probably the same thing he does now only more often
2297369 he goes to the sauna after work and pretends hes not checking out the younger generation
2297370 its okay its not going to throw you out or anything no magical qualities whatsoever
2297371 i suppose your petrol tank isnt permanently full by any chance
2297372 how did you know thats your seat belt there put it on and if you want to know about anything just say the word so where are we going
2297373 so i saw an old man in a store today
2297374 i know anyway he was trying to buy fruit at a stand outside this store and some teenagers came up and tried to mug him
2297375 well he tried to stun them but i obliviated him before he could they forget sometimes when they get older how youre not allowed to do stuff like that i was keeping him out of trouble
2297376 one of the perks of being the boy who lived
2297377 calm down im not going to kill you not today anyway
2297378 fine keep your little secrets youre probably laughing at me and i dont know why but you know what
2297379 you can go ahead and think whatever you want but youre not fooling me
2297380 just that you seem to want to be friends with me all of a sudden and i havent asked why have i but here we are together again and you dont seem to hate it enough to stop wanting to do it again every time so i figure you couldnt hate it or you wouldnt you never did stuff you didnt want to do
2297381 i didnt particularly want to get involved in a war on either side
2297382 but it happens and you either have to rise to the occasion or find someplace to hide
2297383 i always pegged slytherins as the hiding sort i hope that isnt offensive after everything you yeah sorry maybe i shouldnt have said that
2297384 i cant fault you for thinking that thats what half my housemates did
2297385 how can you be friends with people who ditched you during the war left you to do the dirty parts and then came back once everything was okay again thanks to thousands of peoples sacrifices and deaths
2297386 sorry i dont usually do that much any more i just think its a raw deal for you
2297387 what do you mean do i mind that all sorts of people who didnt bother about the war get to enjoy the peace now no not really
2297388 i did what i had to do because i had no choice about it there was a prophecy it was me or no one what was i supposed to do just sit back and let voldemort destroy everything that makes life worth living you chose to fight i did it by default it was the only decent thing to do
2297389 i did it because it was the only decent thing to do too
2297390 i didnt mean for things to get so intense there
2297391 i suppose we had to talk about the war sometime
2297392 its something that needs to be acknowledged at least if were going to be friends obviously it was a huge part of our lives i dont know what you do and you dont know what i do but i think its probably safe to say that the war has effected what we do with the rest of our lives
2297393 it couldnt really help but do that for most of our generation i think
2297394 and youd be the first to point out that were not most people
2297395 thanks for being willing to actually talk about it properly so many people dont want it scares them i think especially talk to me about it they seem to think its such a sensitive subject that ill be angry at them for bringing it up or get mental or something i mean its not like i really want to talk about it most of the time but sometimes you do
2297396 well here we are i promise more cheerful topics next time if theres a next time that is
2297397 i sorry i have to get up early thats all and i youll owl me
2297398 uh i got them to go i was wondering if we could actually maybe go somewhere i sort of think we should talk and i dont really want to do it here
2297399 er i think ive made a mistake i think ive been sending messages i shouldnt have been sending and uh god im really bad at this im sorry i didnt mean to
2297400 and i go and fuck it up like that i probably made you completely uncomfortable and im really sorry i just realised it had gone too far last time and should either explain myself and be up front with you or else stop trying to pretend this is something it isnt
2297401 it would have gone a little further every time until you were finally so freaked out i dont know what would have happened
2297402 i should have told you how i felt from the start
2297403 i suppose i should have too but it wasnt like that at the beginning
2297404 i mean it was i could do to keep from well the other night was weird for me
2297405 for some reason i will never understand i seem to want this to be something its not going to be and since that cant happen we have a problem
2297406 ive been trying to tell you that im that im interested in having more than a friendship with you
2297407 i thought you were trying to tell me you werent interested and that you were uncomfortable with the fact that i am
2297408 ive been interested in you for years i thought never mind never mind what i thought it doesnt matter i want you i like you i thought this was going to end our friendship completely
2297409 im the idiot if i hadnt brought this up how long would you have let it go wanting it and never saying anything
2297410 never mind i dont care it doesnt matter any more
2297411 i thought everyone knew i was gay i thought you were straight
2297412 dont you read the gossip headlines sometimes the rumours get it right you know
2297413 no i dont read anything of the sort you couldnt have just said something just to let me know
2297414 you have no idea how close i was to making a serious pass at you on tuesday after dinner
2297415 dare i ask if you have somewhere to be tomorrow morning
2297416 i never would have if id never found out you werent straight or interested in me i never would have said a word
2297417 i just cant really believe it it seems too good to be true or something
2297418 its not that complicated we both wanted in each others pants and here we are
2297419 not for me at least i dont really know about you but there it is i like you ive wanted this for such a long time
2297420 not right away but i do have a meeting at noon
2297421 i dont have a date and dont plan to find one
2297422 what do you mean youll see me there how as a couple as people who always hated each other now trying to be civil in public as people who fuck around and whatever else but dont talk about what it is what
2297423 i didnt realise there was a need i thought it was obvious
2297424 and even then its not exactly spelled out in stone is it thats okay i just want to know how you plan to be in public
2297425 dont get like that thats precisely why i brought it up i dont really like talking about things like this but i figured you might be there boy who lived and all and i thought it might be awkward if we hadnt talked about it first calm down
2297426 you can talk to whoever you want but lets not avoid each other
2297427 all right i guess thats what i get for not having a big splashy public coming out
2297428 not getting to be what we really are in public
2297429 yeah thats how it works besides do you even want that
2297430 i dont want you coming with some girl just to keep up appearances though
2297431 thats not what i meant i have nothing against pansy i just meant in general
2297432 unfortunately yes nothing exciting just a meeting with my solicitor
2297433 youve got a lot of nerve even coming to talk to me malfoy
2297434 i thought you were completely genuine i thought you were actually as happy as i was about what was happening i cant believe you deceived me that convincingly and for so long how long would you have let it go malfoy were you planning to out me publicly did someone pay you what i dont understand even you how you could do this
2297435 i can understand friends malfoy but why would you do this to me
2297436 i havent deceived you and i would never out you like that
2297437 i cant believe a word you say i i have never been this hurt ever i cant believe you would do this
2297438 potter if you dont start backing up your random accusations with something real im going to get really angry soon
2297439 at the very least ill have the satisfaction of having outed your tiny ugly little personality no person with any sort of moral integrity would get involved with someone like this all for the sake of passing a test and im glad the aurors know before you duped them too
2297440 potter i havent duped anyone yes i had an assignment to get to be friends with you genuinely friends
2297441 i wasnt allowed to tell you obviously hard to establish a friendship that way when one person knows its just an assignment for the other person i didnt fake any of it though not after the first day
2297442 i cant believe i was stupid enough to think you were for real
2297443 it wasnt part of my assignment to fuck you you know
2297444 do you know how i feel felt about you i dont ever want to see you again dont contact me
2297445 just hear me out ten minutes no more then if youre not convinced you can go wherever youre going
2297446 get out of the way i told you im in a hurry
2297447 i gave you time to cool down and you wont read my owls so i thought maybe i should come in person
2297448 we cant have this conversation in a lift lets go inside
2297449 and then im going to go to the burrow and try to forget this
2297450 harry i it was my assignment to get to be friends with you
2297451 i didnt want to ill admit that i didnt know what to make of you at the ministers ball but after when i found you outside with that bottle of champagne something changed
2297452 oh and not telling me you were in training finished your training whatever wasnt a lie of omission
2297453 i told you i wasnt allowed to talk about the assignment or that im that i was a candidate
2297454 did you have a character testing assignment i bet you didnt ill bet they figured the entire war was your character testing right there and maybe they were right but it was for me too why cant you give me any credit for having changed
2297455 i actually wanted to get to know you better and we did i started fighting whatever this is from then on until i found out that you had been too it had nothing to do with my assignment harry
2297456 i was surprised by all this but i liked it a lot
2297457 just what i said that it wasnt about the assignment that it was more that i had almost forgotten that it began because of my training that i wanted to see you and talk to you
2297458 i have the owl at home somewhere if you need proof
2297459 you dont know that weve hardly been together three weeks if you count the part right before we actually got together youve probably never even been in love before
2297460 sometimes things are just too complicated for that to work and theres nothing you can do about it
2297461 come on harry i know you feel the same way im sorry i fucked up and thats the last thing i wanted to do but i never lied to you about wanting to be with you i do i want to
2297462 i heard kingsley talking about it i wasnt supposed to have heard
2297463 i guess i made a big deal out of something that wasnt fair for me to know about in the first place
2297464 its understandable you did hear whether or not you should have and i would have been upset too
2297465 how many times are you going to make me say it
2297466 hear o israel yahweh our god yahweh is one love yahweh your god with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength these commandments that i give you today are to be upon your hearts impress them on your children talk about them when you sit at home and when you walk along the road when you lie down and when you get up tie them as symbols on your hands and bind them on your foreheads write them on the doorframes of your houses and on your gates
2297467 for from him and through him and to him are all things
2297468 hus wife zeng jinyan and their baby who have been under house arrest in beijing since january were allowed to attend the sentencing yesterday morning with hus mother leaving the court ms zeng 24 burst into tears as she said the verdict was the culmination of four years of harassment
2297469 on average we get 40 new clients a month through adwords along with almost as many applicants we cant accept right away overall adwords generates 90 percent of our business
2297470 the integration of adwords and analytics is great it reduces guesswork
2297471 adwords worked immediately and we knew the good old days of the brochure were over effective marketing strategies were shifting from print to the web we were in the dark ages but after we joined adwords we went right to the renaissance
2297472 adwords is responsible for the majority of our revenue and weve consistently earned 3 for every dollar we spend
2297473 and think your rankings will get you on the first page of google and thousands of people will come flocking to your site because they can finally find you
2297474 a web site will do you no good if your customers cannot find you if you want a
2297475 yes you will have seo and can be found on google
2297476 how do i know these clicks are from actual potential customers
2297477 how can you tell if my competitors are clicking on my ads
2297478 its been 3 000 miles or 7 000 miles if you are using all synthetic oil we are here to change your oil
2297479 what you mean i spent all of this time and money paying for links writing in forums posting articles and asking hundreds of webmasters for links and it doesnt matter now are you joking
2297480 pay per click and seo services by adrienne devita was the best marketing investment our company has ever contributed to our previous adword campaign was costing us thousands of dollars per year and average click costs were over five dollars after talking with adrienne about our previous adwords situation she took the time to educate me of several ways we could save money with her services and how we could turn our campaign into a profitable one while spending less money i have worked with many adword and pay per click services from marketing agencies in the past and never acquired results as astonishing as the current success of our new adwords campaign some companies charged up to ten thousand dollars for adword campaigns and didnt come close to offering the same level of support knowledge and success that adrienne possessed for less than two thousand dollars we received outstanding customer service and higher results than we would have yielded from any marketing agency i highly recommend adrienne devitas services in all of your pay per click services as she will not only save you thousands in services but increase your return on investment for years to come our new campaign has produced an average of five dollars per click to less then a dollar per click
2297481 i have been in the telecommunications industry installing maintaining and servicing telephone systems for over 20 years but i was never really interested in advertising on the internet i figured if i never needed it before why bother now right but over the last 5 years business had been suffering and i was trying everything to get more customers i spent thousands on direct mail campaigns and the return on my investment was pretty bad i was referred to adrienne devita and i told her i didnt have a lot of money so i just needed a simple web presence and her to get me traffic immediately i am actually kicking myself for waiting so long to advertise on the internet because in the first 7 days of going online and using pay per click i received a service call and a bid for a new telephone system and installation for a small business in my local area thanks for the great work and affordable prices it is really great to meet an honest business person who actually gets you results and cares about my success
2297482 i recently hired adrienne to set up a google adwords campaign for me
2297483 adrienne devita has been a wonderful help with getting my google adwords account set up correctly she has also helped me so much in understanding how to get traffic to my websites i am very glad that i found her i found out that i have been paying way too much for my google adwords pay per click dont try to set it up yourself trust me this service is worth it as soon as we started running the adwords campaign adrienne set up i started making sales immediately the service paid for itself right away thanks again adrienne for all the help i will be using you for my 4 other sites as well
2297484 after setting up my own google adwords campaign and paying hundreds of dollars without even one phone call i was very discouraged when you set up a new campaign with extremely targeted key words after only 5 clicks i received 2 phone calls i couldnt believe it those 5 clicks cost me less than 3 00 i was ecstatic if i would have continued to run the adwords campaign i set up i would be broke my financial investment into your marketing consulting services significantly increased my bottom line tenfold now thats what i call results i cant wait to implement some of your other ideas in the near future youre a valuable investment and i look forward to working with you again on my future marketing campaigns
2297485 i have been shown so much by adrienne when it comes to being found on the internet with google adwords and getting your site set up for free traffic after shopping around for seo and adwords services other companies wanted to charge me thousands of dollars for the same services i couldnt believe what a bargain adrienne provides to business owners i am very fortunate to have found her before getting taken to the cleaners by other companies you dont have to hire a large corporation to get the same results from a small business owner she cuts straight to the point and tells it like it is without the sales pitch she knows what she is talking about when it comes to websites and seo adrienne is the first person i hire when it comes to site info feedback and straight to the point support
2297486 ive been a massage therapist for over 10 years but when i relocated to riverside county it was very difficult obtaining new clientele i met adrienne through our local bni networking group and her help was invaluable watching her build my web page was astounding it was effortless for her to set it up in no time it would have taken me weeks to try and figure out how to do what she did her online skills and techniques she showed me to get traffic for my business was unbelievable i didnt even know you could do any of the things she showed me adrienne also believes in direct mail and uses this amazing system to contact your clients and get more referrals whenever you want them for less than 1 per customer the coupons she designed really helped my business take off once you get a client she showed me how to start a referral and loyal client program with rewards i would never have that would be as lucrative as it is now anytime i need marketing services there is no doubt in my mind the only person i will use is adrienne
2297487 ive had my business in operation for a little over a year and adrienne has been the key person in helping me form professional successful marketing strategies
2297488 dont listen to them they have distorted hindsight they think their relationships are so perfect and they dont remember the struggles they had while they were dating their husbands marriage has wiped their memory clean
2297489 i am so sick of my married friends doing the same thing to me
2297490 by working in partnership with the private sector we are delivering facilities at a lower cost to the victorian taxpayer mr lenders said
2297491 this development will boost local business during construction and on completion will provide more than 150 new jobs mr cameron said
2297492 not only will this prison have high tech security they will also have energy and water saving features which are great for the environment
2297493 however we are more disappointed with the process that has led to this decision committee chairperson tim cronin said
2297494 the consultation process considered the views of a diverse range of user groups and the alexandra oval reserve committee of management has been one of these in fact it was the main reference group
2297495 throughout the consultation process we provided information to the consultants at a number of meetings however we feel that our views and recommendations have been largely ignored in the final report
2297496 we are also looking forward and a subcommittee has been formed to look at the redevelopment of the fiscalini pavilion mr cronin said
2297497 we have a group together now to drive that through our master plan mr cronin said
2297498 we will be working on that in conjunction with council
2297499 it really is a privilege to belong to an international organisation and be recognised for your service to the public mr wilson said
2297500 you meet a lot of people around your age and you help them by giving them a smile and saying gday mr wilson said
2297501 ararat colleges 2008 student attitude to school survey results dont only show a dramatic improvement they also compare very favourably to the state mean results principal geoff sawyer said
2297502 with continued improvement the college is confident that its results can become among the best in the state
2297503 the college has been working hard to establish a positive school culture and what is expected from its students has been clearly defined mr sawyer said
2297504 students are clear on what they and their school are willing to accept and that these expectations will not be lowered with this in mind a positive school culture which allows every student to achieve their full academic physical and social potentials is assured
2297505 i cant remember how old i was when i went to my first show but i know i havent missed many since and now im happy that i can give something back for everything ive enjoyed all these years by being a member of the committee mr watkins said
2297506 we work hard on the committee i wont deny that mostly in the immediate preparation but what a result we get
2297507 tell me there isnt something for everyone with floral art handicrafts and cooking then the art and the photography and the garden section for the artistic and also the animals the horses sheep poultry and goats all the traditional agricultural show exhibits it makes such a great day for this town he said
2297508 i read a quote the other day from the show program from november 1936
2297509 you never know you might end up with a prize let us know what you might like to be part of he said
2297510 i think there is an appetite out there its just a matter of finding the right way to bring it to them
2297511 it seems like on the wii theres some education necessary for a large part of that demographic in terms of heres why you should want to play this game instead of
2297512 every time i pick up a new game im like oh my god theyve changed the controller mappings again and now ive got to you know reconfigure my head just so i can start to enjoy this game
2297513 with something like the wii you just pick it up and its natural
2297514 i dont think theres anything preventing the game complexity of
2297515 they removed some of the requirements for xbla games but there are still a lot of requirements and i believe that at least for a single player game like my game the vast majority of these requirements are unnecessary
2297516 i put in a tremendous amount of work meeting all these requirements when i could have put that work into the actual game and made it even a little more polished little bit better
2297517 but i feel like it actually decreases the quality of games because people spend so much of their energy on these things that users dont even really care about
2297518 i definitely had a couple of unpleasant business interactions with microsoft
2297519 nothing horrible well nothing quite bad enough to cause me to cancel releasing the game on arcade
2297520 but what would keep me from putting another game on arcade again is just that theyve changed the business deal at least as ive heard
2297521 if its as ive heard that it is i couldnt even necessarily break even
2297522 money is not really my goal so even if braid does very well thats not my concern im not going to do a sequel to braid i dont care how many copies it sells
2297523 i mean maybe in five years when im motivated if i have a really fresh idea for it but im not waiting in the wings with a level pack or dlc or anything
2297524 i didnt want to do them on the old dashboard because its covered with ads everywhere
2297525 braid is about setting a mood and a feeling and you cant do it while theres like a burger king ad there flashing i just felt that juxtaposition would have been bad for the game
2297526 they didnt try to dictate the game design as many publishers might they were very hands off there and what is in the final game is exactly what i wanted to put there
2297527 they also bent a lot of xbla rules in order to help me make the game the way i wanted which was pretty cool of them
2297528 technically illegal if you go by the book but they saw what i was trying to do and went with it
2297529 for the most part working with microsoft has been great
2297530 there have been occasional problems including one that i was very upset about but there are people at microsoft who really got the game and worked very hard to help bring it to completion and it would just be wrong to slight their contribution with some kind of blanket microsoft bad attitude
2297531 theres certainly an awful lot of out there but there are lots of people happy to read about video games in the same way theyre happy to watch on tv or read ty newspapers
2297532 if if its fulfilling their needs such as they are then its serving a purpose right its just different to what we try to do
2297533 writing about video games is nothing to be ashamed of and i dont feel the need to try and justify it as anything more than it is are we investigative journalists or war correspondents no but we dont want to be either
2297534 we strive to be just as accurate in depth and compelling as any publication in existence but were also very aware of our audience and we write with them in mind
2297535 our voice is as if we are a friend sitting on the couch next to you talking about this game that you probably havent seen yet so we want you to know when we are excited
2297536 as much as id like more readers tomorrow im more interested in having even more readers on the same day next year
2297537 they wont come back unless you treat them with respect
2297538 olis review also drew attention because he didnt give the game 100 marks on a 100 point scale as some of our competitors did
2297539 anything with a negative spin tends to get attention it seems that youll always attract a bigger audience by giving something a kicking
2297540 there are people out there who seem to make half decent livings out of it actually
2297541 where readers feel like they are a part of the site
2297542 writing about the biggest games every day and being honest about them
2297543 plus very well written story impressive graphics explosive action deep character development
2297544 het doel is om nog meer bekendheid te geven aan dit evenement
2297545 ingevolge het europees recht mag een product dat in een van de europese landen is vervaardigd en goedgekeurd in alle andere europese landen worden verkocht en verhandeld
2297546 het desbetreffende besluit niet meer in overeenstemming is met hetgeen in europa rechtens is
2297547 dit toont nu precies het belang van de europese unie nederland mag niet zomaar onnodige eisen stellen aan italiaanse parkeerschijven of andere elders toegelaten producten van al die onnodige beperkingen moeten we af ik heb heel veel waardering voor de rechter die de moeite heeft genomen om het europese recht te bestuderen
2297548 achter de schermen zijn we al meer dan twee jaar bezig met de voorbereiding daarin verwerken we alle kennis en ervaring uit vorige evenementen de helderse sails in 93 en 97 maar ook die van sail amsterdam en natuurlijk de marinedagen want de koninklijke marine is nauw bij het evenement betrokken en deels ook zelf gastheer
2297549 voor het liaisonwerk hebben we 100 man vrouw nodig elk schip n de grote schepen twee of meer zeker de oost europese tall sships vragen veel aandacht hun liaisons moeten sowieso goed engels spreken maar liefst ook russisch of pools voor de ontvangst en begeleiding van de vips zetten we 25 hostesses en 10 publieksvoorlichters in ook het weg en watertransport de technische ondersteuning en de algemene dienst vragen veel handen denk aan de inrichting van de sectieposten het zorgen voor voeding kleding en slaapgelegenheid
2297550 ik heb mijn hart verpand aan deze stad heb er dus wel wat voor over de tall ships races is een groot evenement logisch dat je eraan meewerkt in mijn geval als hostess ik neem extra vakantiedagen op mijn hyves site
2297551 we zijn in totaal met 35 man 7 brigaden en groot materieel aanwezig
2297552 while retail store growth is in the middle low single digits e commerce is still growing at least in the mid to high teens
2297553 je moet geen zout in mijn wonden strooien het presidium heeft een en ander besproken maar besloten de raad op de gewone tijd te laten aanvangen je begrijpt dat ik als voetballiefhebber hier heel veel moeite mee heb maar ik heb me bij dat besluit neergelegd ik zal snelheid in de vergadering aanmoedigen maar ik vrees het ergste als volksvertegenwoordiger zal ik wel aan de vergadering deelnemen omdat ik het boven mijn hobby s en liefhebberij stel maar met pijn in t hart
2297554 ik hoop in ieder geval van harte dat de raad op tijd af is want ik ben zeker van plan de wedstrijd te gaan zien ik ben voornemens aan het begin van de raad een orde voorstel in te dienen met betrekking tot de volgorde van de agendapunten zodat ik de voor mij belangrijke punten nog kan meemaken in het presidium is besloten de raad op de normale tijd te laten beginnen van mij had het eerder gemogen
2297555 naar mijn inzicht is de raadsvergadering een hoofdzaak en voetbal een bijzaak ik ga er dan ook van uit dat de raadsvergadering alle aandacht krijgt het is ook goed dat de tijden van de raadsvergadering niet zijn aangepast
2297556 ik heb helemaal geen zicht op de agenda maar met wat amendementen en schorsingen kan het zo uitlopen zelf ben ik geen voetbalfanaat maar er zijn velen die het wel zijn en dat plezier wil ik een ander niet onthouden bovendien zullen veel burgers de raad nu ook niet volgen ik ben een tegenstander van het afraffelen van de besluitvorming dus lijkt het me eigenlijk het beste om de raad een dag later te houden
2297557 of de voetballiefhebbers onder de raadsleden wel of niet aanwezig zullen zijn weet ik niet zelf ben ik van mening dat als je kiest voor het raadslidmaatschap dit ook inhoudt dat het kan gebeuren dat nederland moet voetballen en je tegelijkertijd moet vergaderen zelf ben ik van mening dat de raadsvergadering dan voorgaat je zit er namelijk namens je kiezers
2297558 raadswerk is gewoon werk dus dat gaat voor het voetballen en er zijn mogelijkheden genoeg om de beelden nogmaals te bekijken bovendien het is de finale niet
2297559 hoewel ik graag wedstrijden van het nederlands elftal zie gaat de raadsvergadering voor de collegepartij zal in elk geval op volle sterkte het speelveld betreden er staat twee punten jaarrekening en nota recreatie en toerisme op de agenda die in potentie tot uitgebreide behandeling nopen
2297560 het zou kunnen dat het vergadertempo wel iets hoger ligt en een verlenging zie ik gezien het voetbal ook niet voor de hand liggen naar verwachting zullen we deze wedstrijd wel voor vrijwel lege tribunes spelen maar zal de veldbezetting normaal zijn ik verwacht los van ziekte of vakantie in elk geval dat de coalitie in de voor haar vertrouwde 8 4 6 opstelling speelt
2297561 ook de vleugelspitsen van de oppositie zullen hun beste beentje voor willen zetten in hun jacht naar scoringskansen
2297562 naast elkaar met elkaar en met respect voor elkaar want als het regent in den helder druppelt het op texel
2297563 je bent nog jong en hebt nog een heel leven voor je geniet er nou maar van
2297564 with a seemingly infinite array of options customers now know that demand theirs is in short supply they dictate how they will consume where when and how much using a variety of community based online tools they are creating social networks composed of the people they trust that are rapidly becoming the significant channels of media distribution and capable of distributing marketing messages that surpass madison avenue in reach and impact
2297565 warner music chief edgar bronfman misses the point that there is significant value added by activision and his comments reflect his lack of understanding about the business
2297566 in games the actual royalty derived from the use of a song or the royalty derived from the download of a song remain in my estimation far below what their true value is
2297567 i think that mr bronfmans characterization as paltry is his reaction to the
2297568 however his flip comment disregards that the songs downloaded on guitar hero are
2297569 the value of the music is near zero without the game file and nobody downloads guitar hero content to play on their ipod
2297570 as far as warner music is concerned we will not license to those games
2297571 the other thing i find interesting is mr bronfmans distorted view of his leverage in this matter activision isnt operating a music download service where consumers get to choose whatever they want instead
2297572 thus activision can select songs not published by warner music so mr bronfman should rethink his negotiating leverage
2297573 what we need to be very careful of is that the recorded music industry and the music publishing industry do not allow an ecosystem to occur where we are not properly compensated
2297574 that i think is the state that were currently in with activision and harmonix
2297575 it takes a pretty special game to carry such a lengthy title and be able to hold its head high amongst games with much shorter names
2297576 thankfully we dont have to worry about fitting this title on a package
2297577 i love school girls because the more i get older they seem to stay the same age
2297578 using the dons view players will be able to build defend and expand their crime rings while keeping an eye on the movements and plans of the rival families players will also learn to master the business of organized crime by building a family of made men hiring crew handing out orders and promoting their best men up the ranks
2297579 running an organized crime family in a world defined by family loyalty is something that we felt could introduce a new strategic element to the genre
2297580 that is what the dons view is all about laying out a strategy to pick off the competition one by one
2297581 the dons view is so unique it could fundamentally change the rules of open world games by blending action and strategy to create something entirely new
2297582 listen guys weve got a message from hanneke kaamer van hoegee of the het was brian ook wel the mailman genoemd omdat hij degene was die alle inkomende error reports ontving

2297622 many a boy grows up wanting to play baseball the national pastime many a girl does too few however are aware that women have played baseball nearly as long as men women have been playing ball since the mid 1800s reflective of american society baseball originally did exclude women as it did african americans and other minority groups from participation in this white mens game but as they transformed their place in the wider society women made a place for themselves in the sport during the late 19th century women played on college campuses and formed red and blue blonde and brunette and bloomer teams while some clubs found mens teams to play most competed against women

2297718 we were harmed by the very people who took an oath to protect us
2297719 but i think its also the kind of thing that happens and i dont think we would have realized that until it happened to us
2297720 is they didnt have a proper warrant to do what they did they actually didnt give us a warrant at all until 71 hours after it happened and thats really whats disturbing despite all the mistakes that were made theyre holding to their guns saying they did nothing wrong
2297721 this happened to us we cant get our dogs back and we know that but the reason we asked for federal authorities to investigate this is because this is a systemic problem and we want to make sure that while it happened to us and thats a tragedy we dont want it to happen to anyone else
2297722 they were the reason we bought this house because it had a big yard for them to run in
2297723 cheye and trinity we support you friends and citizens of berwyn heights
2297724 i was completely stunned because those dogs didnt hurt anybody they barely bark
2297725 she gave me a big hug and she said if the police shot your dogs dead and did this to you how can i trust them
2297726 i dont want people to feel like that i just want them to be proud of our police and proud to live in prince georges county
2297727 if we accept going to beijing for the games it will be
2297728 we are committed to a vigorous import and export compliance program
2297729 i think the trend in stocks is up i do feel that july 15 represented the bottom for stocks and we are going to move higher
2297730 i really feel that what investors are looking for right here is signs that the economy is starting to pick up right now
2297731 it looks like we are finally getting the break weve been waiting for in terms of slowing down the inflation spiral that has been taking place
2297732 you have a tremendous rise in the dollar and thats putting pressure on crude oil which is helping to buoy u s equity markets
2297733 clearly the economy is still weak some of the stimulus from the tax rebates is
2297734 i think the key to watch for is the unemployment number once you go above 6 percent the concerns about recession will go up
2297735 look at the prices of food around the world its unfair to look at just the price of oil as the leading indicator of where inflation trends may be
2297736 theres strong likelihood that the fed is going to have to start to raise interest rates to control inflation
2297737 for a long term investor id advocate slowly going back into commodities right now gold will be my favorite recommendation
2297738 we want to show the world the real china because a lot of people dont understand our country and try to demonize it

2297741 these are chinas olympics so of course we want to hold the chinese flag
2297742 the olympics is about showing the world our new economic power and our pride in our country
2297743 it feels great to be here theres a very thick air of patriotism in the square tonight and i think thats the way it should be
2297744 its a tradition in china thats been handed down from ancient times
2297745 its very exciting it makes for a really great atmosphere
2297746 for a long time china has dreamed of opening its doors and inviting the worlds athletes to beijing for the olympic games
2297747 dear athletes remember that you are the role models for the youth of the world

2297757 begin vorige eeuw kocht mijn grootvader petrus willem marie hoegen de heerlijkheid hoogelande inclusief de ru ne van de kapel en de daarbij behorende rechten het jacht vis en begraafrecht eerlijk gezegd was het hem alleen maar om het jagen te doen want hij was een echt pedant heertje

2297824 the notion of talking to ones enemies no matter how intransigent or unreasonable they may seem has been fetishised by many from across the political spectrum
2297825 unfortunately there is a growing sense among certain political groups in britain that draw analogies between the resolution of the ira problems and israels difficulties with hamas
2297826 israeli diplomats who have visited london recently have been lectured in certain quarters that they should learn the skills of british diplomats from their northern ireland problems and the issue is not confined to political circles in london we have heard it in washington as well
2297827 the ira posed no existential threat to the british the objectives of hamas require the destruction of the state of israel
2297828 we have civil legislation in ireland which prohibits incitement to hatred and it is possible that this material is in breach of that my view is that it would be
2297829 i will be investigating it and take the necessary steps
2297830 it is a worrying sign that the new generation of youngsters will see these goods detached from the context of how they were used in the holocaust
2297831 the embassy of israel in dublin strongly condemns all forms of antisemitism including the sale of materials which insult and stereotype the jewish people or belittle the memory of the holocaust and the crimes of the nazi regime
2297832 antisemitism just like racism and xenophobia is not only a jewish problem or an israeli problem but is a sickness which eats at the core of humanity
2297833 if as a society we tolerate hate material we will find ourselves gradually tolerating verbal violence and that eventually could lead to antisemitic acts of violence therefore we need not only to take all these acts into consideration but to take action together against them
2297834 dismayed to read of the open sale of nazi memorabilia including antisemitic material which we strongly condemn
2297835 it really is the end of an era for us but my family and i feel the time is right to make the next step

2297841 we want to be conciliatory but this is too much

2297844 nif can justly be proud of an impressive record of achievement their work to promote civil rights womens rights and minority rights has secured their reputation as an anchor of israels voluntary sector
2297845 im really proud of what my father has achieved at npls but i also need to make my own mark
2297846 in past years my mother has set up and run the synagogues social care network my sister leads the choir and runs a playgroup while my brother in law has managed the security rota as the congregation grows we can no longer treat npls as the family business and nor is it right that we should
2297847 i am immensely proud of what we have achieved and to see aaron take over as our senior rabbi is a dream fulfilled

2297868 present day science has made so much advancement that public morality is not the same as what it was in ancient times much decadence has taken the upper hand luckily in taiwan there are so many temples which help to propagate moral culture thus helping countless people to walk on the right path tea of immortality was served and he further said we are very pleased that both of you have come to our tribunal today present day human beings struggle mainly for fame and money they dont care for conscience reason or righteousness which are all lost on them everywhere one can see deceit being the order of the day restaurants barber shops night clubs all make use of girls to induce men to patronize them officers of hades constantly visit earth to record instances of breach of morality and there is no end of such record also there are places where people visit to satisfy their carnal desires such as dance halls houses of pleasure etc where eventually joy will be followed by sorrow when such people die their souls will be sent to this fifth tribunal they are the souls you now see here such breaches of morality are very sinful i want to impress on human beings not to resort to earn money through prostitution otherwise the sins are so great that they cannot be repaid even in three generations i am in charge of the fifth tribunal i am iron faced i do not ask for gratitude every soul that comes to this tribunal begins to get frightened because my sentence is very strict and severe if human beings do not forsake evil ways and turn to the right path they will find out what will be in store for them when they die and their souls come here this tribunal can also be named loud crying prison because nothing can be heard here except loud crying there are 16 heart gouging smaller prisons here specially to punish those who have 1 lawless heart 2 evil thought heart 3 stubborn heart 4 hate filled heart 5 malicious heart 6 lewd heart 7 jealous heart 8 biased heart 9 selfish heart 10 cruel heart 11 treacherous heart 12 animal heart etc i will order the general to gouge out the heart of each type of sinful soul it is not because i have a cold heart or a hard heart but it is because these souls themselves had committed such evil sins mentioned above it can be said that they earned the punishment by virtue of their own wrong doing on earth

2297882 what is the source of quarrels and conflicts among you is not the source your hedonism that wage s war in your members you lust and do not have so you commit murder you are envious and cannot obtain so you fight and quarrel you do not have because you do not ask you ask and do not receive because you ask with wrong motives so that you may spend it on your hedonism
2297883 but these passages do not explicitly forbid living by the philosophy of hedonism they merely counsel against it
2297884 fortunately god only calls hedonism and the lifestyle of pursuing pleasure to be unwise and foolish but he does not outlaw it so we can still pursue it with all our strength
2297885 if youve been watching my car which one is it
2297886 and where in the bible did that concept come from

2297893 you have evil motives in questioning the biblical nature of hedonism

2297949 women are like apples on trees the best ones are on the top of the tree the men dont want to reach for the good ones because they are afraid of falling and dont want to get hurt instead they just get the rotten apples from the ground that arent so good but easy so the apples at the top think something is wrong with them when in reality they are amazing they just have to wait for the right man to come along the one whos brave enough to climb all the way to the top becuase they value quality

2297959 w hrend im funk rundfunk nur eine begrenzte anzahl an sendern existieren kann k nnen im internet beliebig viele sender betrieben werden vor dem gesetz sind also im moment alle gleich es gilt die meinungsfreiheit aber funkfrequenzen m ssen zugewiesen werden und eben deswegen kann und muss es eine lizenzpflicht f r rundfunk im eigentlichen sinn geben und es d rfen keine lizenzen f r internet rundfunk verlangt werden im internet ist brigens sichergestellt dass alle meinungen zu wort kommen da notfalls eben jemand anderes dar ber berichtet

2298029 for a country to have a great writer is like having a second government that is why no regime has ever loved great writers only second rate ones
2298030 a great and important writer who through his work played a decisive role in bringing down the communist totalitarian system
2298031 our most precious possession our spiritual life in the east it is destroyed by the dealings and machinations of the ruling party in the west commercial interests tend to suffocate it this is the real crisis the split in the world is less terrible than the similarity of the disease plaguing its main sections
2298032 fashionable trends of thoughts and ideas are carefully separated from those which are not fashionable nothing is forbidden but what is not fashionable will hardly ever find its way into periodicals or books or be heard in colleges
2298033 gradually it was disclosed to me that the line separating good and evil passes not through states nor between classes nor between political parties either but right through every human heart and through all human hearts
2298034 for me faith is the foundation and support of ones life
2298035 as an independent statutory authority the accc sets its own enforcement priorities and can direct those resources to indigenous art if appropriate
2298036 recognises that a vibrant and sustainable indigenous art sector is critical for artists and their communities
2298037 arts minister peter garrett seems driven by cost cutting imperatives not the needs of some of australias most talented but vulnerable artists
2298038 like most people i just presumed that chocolate came from france i hadnt really given cocoa much thought
2298039 i never did any stories there because it was really one of the success stories of africa
2298040 these people have seen everything and so when they say things are bad you know theyre really bad for them to be surprised tweaked my interest
2298041 there are farms where people eat one meal a day so the kids go im going to make a living on the ivory coast and they become so vulnerable and so exposed to abuse
2298042 these kids were strangely happy for western children that they could have things that make them happy
2298043 ive been in some pretty dicey situations but i have to say i found working there the scariest probably after haiti its so sinister when all levels of government are engaged in something evil
2298044 its so extraordinary cynical the congressmen were going to pass a law and they said no no well do it ourselves give us a deadline
2298045 ive been back to ivory coast and seen the projects that they say are making a difference theyre pathetic theyre just so silly and minor just showcasing
2298046 in the last paragraph of the book i said that nothing was going to change people who contacted me after reading it really resented that
2298047 because i am such a hard bitten journalist i didnt think of people actually wanting to mobilise like that
2298048 i dont like it much so it is especially tiring for me because i am so nervous
2298049 music is incredibly meaningful and important because it helps you to live
2298050 the music is made of colours lots of them the more colours there are the more interesting the music
2298051 and there is strong proximity with art art is a way of communicating the incommunicable a way of communicating something that cant be expressed with words so there is an absolute analogy between the various art forms
2298052 i have studied piano for many years so to me its a friend that provides great companionship even though i have an undying love for all musical instruments
2298053 unfortunately i havent been able to study them all but based on what i learned with the piano i can just about mistreat other instruments there are times when i walk past the cupboard where i keep all my wind instruments and i grab the first one that takes my fancy
2298054 bocelli is plain and simple a san remo smoocher who was snapped up by desperate classical labels as a marketing gimmick it is the blind leading the deaf he is rarely in tune and never in tempo listen to his recording of the verdi requiem and blush
2298055 if you work well together you breathe together and you experience the music all together and things cant go wrong we are all part of something everybody is involved in the same way it amazes me every time i think about it how 80 90 elements can do that
2298056 i mean we are humped into the same industry as bocelli it is ridiculous
2298057 i think the audience has always loved opera as long as you give them a chance to know it
2298058 this is one of the main purposes of people who make music being able to communicate strong feelings its an indication of the fact that the message has been communicated properly when this happens it means mission accomplished
2298059 you have to be able to give a reasonable answer to such a weird choice of job then the answer you must give is that it is important to bring to theatres this old tradition that i believe can lead to spiritual development especially in young people
2298060 since my childhood i had to sing everywhere birthday parties church school everybody asked me to sing
2298061 i got an opera record as a present and i started learning it and then sang along for hours on end there was a step by the fireplace in my fathers kitchen that was my first stage
2298062 i studied with passion many of my relatives were lawyers so i went to university and studied diligently its an interesting job but when you have a vocation for something you end up following that
2298063 in my case fame arrived late and it all happened very quickly
2298064 many things have changed i now have to travel around the world and i am forced to see my friends and family much less frequently
2298065 on the other hand i have peoples affection which is absolutely crucial for somebody in my line of work
2298066 nobody can imagine fame because fame has no rules it comes and goes of its own accord and this is partly the beauty of it inside things are the same though my values are the same as ever my mentality and beliefs i have grown up with remain unchanged
2298067 he gave me precious advice i think maestro pavarotti taught me to love our job as he loved the profession in a unique way
2298068 the day of the performance you must keep quiet all day in the past singers used to keep quiet for 48 hours
2298069 silence is crucial to keep your voice intact you then prepare by practising every day by studying the repertoire and by adopting a lifestyle that resembles that of an athlete refrain from smoking drinking alcohol and eat moderately and healthily
2298070 and you have to study the music the first stage of the study consists of learning the score in the most rigorous way and this means not only learning the notes but also the style and the composers mind frame at the time when it was written after such rigorous study you have to forget everything and make it your own
2298071 it can be boring at times but i think that if the music is beautiful and it becomes boring the blame lies with the artist
2298072 my father and granddad made wine but they produced it with simple means just like the farmers of the area
2298073 since me and my brother have taken over we have been trying to improve the quality of our wine
2298074 we have hired a famous oenologist to produce a good wine and our sangiovese purezza gets better and better every year
2298075 its quite appropriate to be concentrating on australian art indigenous art and the interesting art in the region but in a way weve lost a bit of the focus on american art
2298076 american art is still incredibly important and interesting we share so much as new world countries immigrant countries our philosophies and attitudes have a lot in common yet you tend to see a lot less american contemporary art than i would have thought ideal
2298077 its really such a major centre of activity and one really needs to be very much tuned in
2298078 you had a great art museum with great staff doing great work this was one isolated issue that was fixable and absolutely had to be fixed
2298079 i was totally from the outside and coming from australia also helped i was totally neutral
2298080 promote the moral physical and intellectual improvement of the inhabitants
2298081 it is safe to say that the wenlock people alone have preserved and followed the true olympian traditions
2298082 the olympics these days are all about money theyre over the top
2298083 this is what its all about getting together with local athletes twenty three clubs are represented just on the track let alone the 150 in the road race
2298084 this is the way i relax when im not hunched over a computer ive won all my fights so far
2298085 we take every opportunity we can to spread the message because they have been held within this little community for so long and in recent years its really beginning to have a much bigger impact i think 2012 will help that
2298086 i am basically an artist who sees things in terms of paint
2298087 i always enjoy getting out and observing things its interesting to me that when i finish painting no matter how good or bad my reflexes are so strong that i could paint anything at all and i mean it observation is the catalyst for me
2298088 i only use the subject matter as an excuse to hang the picture on
2298089 at long last i can relate to figure work as well as landscape and as i have long suspected figure work will always be part of my work although it has taken a back seat row for nearly 13 years
2298090 williams worked by choice largely anonymously in the british capital
2298091 there has to be some reason why i did stick to the landscapes as long as i did and this was simply because i just wanted something where i could move with great freedom and i felt one with it
2298092 williams is one of the most interestingly original and distinguished painters of the latter 20th century yet beyond australia he is something of a secret still
2298093 its all about the ooze here a quite decadent physical oozing down the wall behind you
2298094 its quite abstract really theres not much of a story
2298095 the thrilling outpouring of unquenchable joy but mahlers grasp of coup de theatre character dramatic confrontation and aural mise en scene
2298096 his music is populated by shadows armies skeletons marching bands funeral processions figures pulled from a brueghel marketplace a bosch garden a bacon bathroom
2298097 i think they need to experience the show with no distractions totally centred on the way the text comes into their voices and bodies
2298098 as a director im not there to move traffic around
2298099 its really about creating a world that initially stems from my brain through the performers brain and then through into the audiences brain
2298100 every new show for me is a variation or a riff on my central themes
2298101 im not going to tell you what they are its all there in the work over the last 20 years
2298102 i was intoxicated with the colours of the sets and outlandish costumes intoxicated with the funky groovy toe tapping music intoxicated with all those singing and dancing houses trees animals and clocks
2298103 i sat there a cross legged bespectacled seven year old in a melbourne grammar uniform holding my breath singing into the shagpile with a feeling of palpitating delicious nausea
2298104 at the magnificent climax of the last movement he resembled nothing less than a mad penguin doing an impression of a sprinkler system
2298105 and who or what was providing the impetus for all of this unbridled ecstasy
2298106 i lived completely in my head and i just loved it
2298107 there is a very big difference between feeling lonely and being alone
2298108 i have never ever had a problem with being alone never a problem with my own company
2298109 im living in the present but also the past and the future
2298110 it was rather bold because i had only ever written program notes before but the writing simply had to represent what went on in my head
2298111 a great torrent of ideas really that formed themselves into sentences and paragraphs very quickly
2298112 and i was writing in a crabby longhand with arrows markings and crossings out on each page
2298113 i think one of the hardest things for a young director to develop is the skill to be able to create with your own voice
2298114 to be able to take the idea and create mise en scene that is truthful for you and is in your voice
2298115 you either can or you cant but you can only find this voice through risk through experience and through intellectual rigour and brutal self criticism
2298116 moving people mindlessly across the stage in provincial parades of gobsmacking mediocrity
2298117 the problem is director drought ask any of the good actors or designers in the country
2298118 most directors have no idea about space no idea about the actors body no idea of rhythm no idea of the contrapuntal movement of body sound light and image and no idea about why the f k they want people to buy a ticket and sit through an evening of their work
2298119 they think them too clever by half too smart for their own good its ultimately about the aussie fear of appearing stupid i dont get it so therefore i dont like it whereas i dont want to get it i want to get in it and seek to understand it
2298120 you just dont see contradiction on the stages its as if we have a pathological fear of complexity
2298121 its just not possible to have a willing excited dialogue between the stage and the audience everything is so passive
2298122 we have so few cultural traditions here though and almost no context for what we do and it is really deathly if the audience members are not excited participants in the dialogue between the stage and that space where the audience is
2298123 it is a terrible tragedy all that has disappeared all that anarchic energy the ferociousness the sense of tradition
2298124 i hate the lights in my eyes and i could never perform if i was in the centre of a stage blinded by them
2298125 more evidence and analysis while conceding that the references for this fighting are limited and scattered through diaries and letters it should be possible to build up a more detailed picture
2298126 its not surprising that there is a lot of commentary on social changes seen in the previous 12 or 24 months

2298131 critically acclaimed films generally do better than critically panned films at the box office
2298132 if i were a publisher though id hire the best critic i could find and have him or her write two reviews a short one to be printed the day or week the movie opens and that gives away little of the plot but tells readers whether its good or bad the service aspect and a longer more in depth review that discusses the entire film to be posted online the critical aspect then id put a message board beneath the in depth review and sit back most people dont want to hear about a movie before theyve seen it but would love to discuss it afterward
2298133 i was eager to travel in the world while looking for something new as a result i was increasing lots of stuff in my mind
2298134 its quite essential to hang around on the way sometimes so that we could disover something important which have not been found from the daily busy life
2298135 some people tend to recognize the people who try the best to realize their dreams are a bit silly however i want to pursue my own way and make the people happy without compromising anything in the end the compromise cant lead to the big achievement so i am honest to myself and try my best to achieve my ambition

2298149 they were extremely well organised they are very physically strong right up the middle and that is well complemented by their speed on the flanks
2298150 their target men of ciaran lyng and mattie forde tortured down throughout and the work of pj banville out the field was very impressive as well
2298151 you have lyng with his left foot coming in from the right side and mattie forde with his right foot coming in from the right
2298152 both are free takers and redmond barry at number 10 was also hugely impressive against down
2298153 i would also single out their midfield for attention because they controlled proceedings by and large for most of the game
2298154 bar the 25 minutes against dublin they basically havent been beaten this year
2298155 they played a sweeper and got a lot of people back behind the ball
2298156 they will be extremely difficult to break down and were not altogether too fond of leaving ourselves short of men at the back either

2298164 neither the ministers office nor ambassador masekela nor the french embassy nor indeed any available diary notes has any information about the nature of such a meeting ambassador masekela did not attend such a meeting
2298165 one can only conclude that if it did take place it was a courtesy meeting of the kind that occurs frequently and routinely during the course of foreign visits by members of the government without significant substance
2298166 it is axiomatically obvious that the president would have vivid knowledge of a meeting if it were of such great importance as alleged by the opposition whether this will satisfy the leader of the opposition or not is up to her but we cannot embellish the truth with speculation and conjecture simply to satisfy the opposition
2298167 whilst many claims have been made challenging its findings none has been such as to undermine the integrity of the investigation or the substance of its findings concerning the governments role in this matter
2298168 allegations of misconduct by individuals have been followed up within the framework of the criminal justice system and that will continue to be the course to follow should any further investigation provide new evidence
2298169 given that there has already been a thorough investigation of the matter in south africa and given that the full resources of our criminal justice system are available to deal with any evidence that any individual has broken the law government is of the view that there is no need for a judicial inquiry

2298185 wij hebben mirthe altijd verteld dat sinterklaas uit spanje komt samen met zijn pieten
2298186 ik haal mirthe uit school en merk dat ze gehuild heeft weet je wat ze zei juf carla heeft ons verteld dat sinterklaas niet echt bestaat en ook dat hij helemaal niet uit spanje komt dat de pieten geen cadeautjes geven maar dat mama en papa dat doen
2298187 ik werd witheet toen ik dat hoorde haar vader en ik proberen het geloof in sinterklaas in stand te houden wij wringen ons in allerlei bochten om de cadeautjes te verbergen om ze s nachts in haar schoen te stoppen komt zon trut van een juf en vernietigd in n klap ons zo zorgvuldig opgebouwd verhaal ja ik weet het het is een leugen maar waarom zou je een kind van vier die leugen ontnemen als ze er zo intens van kan genieten grr ik kan er nu nog boos om worden wij moesten mirthe weer ompraten
2298188 wel op dit moment is hij erg boos op ons hij zegt niet te begrijpen dat wij hem al die jaren voorgelogen hebben hij zegt dat hij ons dit nooit kan vergeven ik kan alleen maar hopen dat zijn boosheid gauw overgaat

2298239 it appears that the metasploit framework was the framework used to facilitate these attacks
2298240 we have reason to believe these are zero day vulnerabilities
2298241 what we dont want to do is irresponsibly lead people to those exploit pages
2298242 a person even with up to date antivirus software is going to be susceptible to this in the normal course of using this service youd arrive at this page and youd be silently infected

2298294 meskipun cinta itu awalnya datang dari hana kamu harus menjaga perasaannya seorang perempuan sebenarnya malu bila mendahului laki laki untuk mengatakan cinta maka dalam suratmu nanti jangan katakan bahwa kamu menerima cintanya cukup kamu katakan saja bahwa kamu mencintainya dan kamu mengharapkan balasannya buat seakan akan cinta itu bermula dari dirimu bukan dia
2298295 terus apapun isi suratmu apakah kau menerima cintanya atau tidak aku siap menjadi tukang pos mu

2298333 obama has done shockingly little to educate himself firsthand about the war in iraq
2298334 obamas failure to visit iraq listen and learn firsthand and witness the surges progress demonstrates weak leadership that disqualifies him from being commander in chief

2298349 hipsterdom is the first counterculture to be born under the advertising industrys microscope leaving it open to constant manipulation but also forcing its participants to continually shift their interests and affiliations less a subculture the hipster is a consumer group using their capital to purchase authenticity and rebellion but the moment a band sound trend style or feeling gains too much exposure it is suddenly looked upon with disdain hipsters cannot afford to maintain any cultural loyalties or affiliations for fear that they will lose relevance

2298362 identificata pi di 70 anni fa come carattere fondante della vera scienza dal filosofo karl popper la falsificabilit stata sempre vista da molti scienziati come unarma affidabile per tenere lontana la minaccia della pseudoscienza il vecchio pensatore viennese stato acclamato come il pi grande filosofo della scienza da personaggi del calibro di steven weinberg vincitore del premio nobel per la fisica e il celebre libro di popper logica della scoperta scientifica stato definito dal cosmologo frank tipler il libro pi importante del secolo per i tempi cambiano la definizione di scienza data da popper stata messa a dura prova dallemergere di idee scientifiche che sembrano sconfessarla dai tentativi di comprendere la natura fondamentale dello spaziotempo alle teorie che tentano di descrivere gli eventi precedenti al big bang le frontiere della scienza stanno generando una quantit di idee apparentemente impossibili da falsificare
2298363 perci non ho problemi ad ammettere che per pervenire alle mie proposte sono stato guidato in ultima analisi da giudizi di valore e predilezioni personali ma spero che le mie proposte possano apparire accettabili a coloro che attribuiscono valore non solo al rigore logico ma anche alla libert dal dogmatismo che ricercano lapplicabilit pratica ma sono attratti anche di pi dallavventura della scienza e da scoperte che incessantemente ci costringono a confrontarci con nuove e inattese domande sfidandoci a sperimentare risposte finora mai sognate
2298364 gran parte dellattrattiva di popper risiede nella logica tagliente che sta alla base del concetto di falsificabilit popper la illustra attraverso lormai celebre esempio del cigno nero supponiamo che una teoria ipotizzi che tutti i cigni sono bianchi il modo pi ovvio di provare questa teoria di andare a verificare se ciascun cigno sia realmente bianco ma c un problema non importa quanti cigni bianchi si possano trovare non si potr mai essere certi che non esista un cigno nero nascosto da qualche parte dunque non sar mai possibile dimostrare che la teoria vera viceversa il ritrovamento anche di un solo cigno nero sar la prova che la teoria falsa questo il potere fondamentale della falsificazione la capacit di rendere falsa unaffermazione universale con un singolo esempio una capacit sottolineava popper che discende direttamente dai teoremi della logica deduttiva
2298365 convinto che sia tempo di abbandonare lidea di popper che sia possibile definire il procedimento scientifico utilizzando la logica deduttiva al contrario occorrerebbe concentrarsi su ci che gli scienziati fanno nella realt mettere insieme gli elementi di prova delle diverse teorie valutando la loro plausibilit relativa howson tra i principali sostenitori di una visione alternativa della scienza fondata non sulla semplicistica logica vero falso ma sul concetto assai pi sottile di gradi di credenza alla base di questo concetto vi la fondamentale connessione tra il concetto soggettivo di credere e il freddo sterile computo delle probabilit
2298366 a prima vista potrebbe sembrare sorprendente che un banale risultato matematico ottenuto da un oscuro ministro presbiteriano vissuto pi di 200 anni fa possa esercitare ancora tanto interesse riguardo a cos tante discipline dalleconometria alla biostatistica dallanalisi del rischio finanziario alla cosmologia
2298367 un saggio sulla risoluzione dei problemi nella dottrina delle probabilit
2298368 gli scienziati iniziano con lesame di una serie di spiegazioni contrastanti riguardo un determinato fenomeno poi vengono le osservazioni e infine la matematica bayesiana viene utilizzata per calcolare il livello di attendibilit guadagnata o perduta da ciascuna delle teorie rivali in parole povere essa mette a confronto le probabilit di ottenere i risultati osservati da parte di ciascuna delle contrastanti teorie la teoria che ottiene le probabilit pi alte verr considerata quella che ha ricavato il maggior livello di attendibilit a partire dai dati
2298369 le probabilit di ottenere i risultati osservati da parte di ciascuna delle contrastanti teorie

2298522 but then the 1950s it was not as easy to see as it is today that when you make a powerful technology available to human beings with normal form of egocentric consciousness planetary disaster is inevitable moreover the point had to be made that the egocentric predicament was not a moral fault to be corrected by willpower but a conceptual hallucination requiring some basic alterations of common sense a task comparable to persuading people that the earth is round rather than flat
2298523 ok so were leaving next week could you clear you face up
2298524 thats the problem with drinking i thought as i poured myself a drink if something bad happens you drink in an attempt to forget if something good happens you drink in order to celebrate and if nothing happens you drink to make something happen
2298525 i am therefore ill at ease with people who earnestly abstain from such things as smoking drinking and sex to the point of making their squeamishness militant
2298526 the extreme optimism that individuals display appears to be illusory

2298528 sacar mejores resultados en la provincia y ganar la diputaci n
2298529 elaboraci n de una lista para llegar al congreso con una candidatura clara
2298530 una semana despu s de convocar este congreso cuando se diga qui n puede canalizarla y ser el candidato
2298531 desde hace alg n tiempo se ven a barajando que el giro del pp de huelva era necesario
2298532 un mensaje de ilusi n integrador de todas las voces de la provincia
2298533 una victoria que no va contra nadie sino contra el psoe de la provincia de huelva
2298534 es un ejercicio de normalidad democr tica de cara a los comicios del partido provincial
2298535 brecha entre psoe y pp en la provincia ya que la tendencia es que se est abriendo cada vez m s y contribuir con los resultados en la provincia que se gane el gobierno regional
2298536 los militantes de la provincia para que trabajen por la victoria sobre el psoe
2298537 no importan tanto las personas como los objetivos ganar a los adversarios sabiendo cu les son las necesidades de este partido y c mo hacerlo a trav s de una candidatura que siembra ilusi n y es integradora
2298538 ahora cabe que se presente esta candidatura o cualquier otra porque es un ejercicio democr tico
2298539 en cuatro a os han cambiado muchas personas ha habido elecciones locales cambio de concejales y se ve la necesidad de dar un giro al partido para gozar una victoria sobre el psoe
2298540 algo no se est haciendo bien cuando la brecha se est produciendo la mejor receta es el trabajo constante
2298541 no es una candidatura paralela puesto que es la primera que se presenta
2298542 es un alcalde estupendo en huelva pero la provincia es un mbito diferente de trabajo ha trabajado de manera denodada en la alcald a e igual en el partido no ha podido hacer todo lo que ha querido
2298543 se ha demostrado que los que fuimos parte de esa candidatura seguimos en el partido lo respetamos y seguimos trabajando
2298544 no hemos dado ni una sola muestra de habernos revelado ante cualquier decisi n del pp
2298545 este grupo tambi n forma parte de la direcci n del partido por lo que esta podr a ser la candidatura de la direcci n
2298546 pueden venir todos y si esta candidatura es la nica que lo sea
2298547 the surety company is in the position to determine who they will use and they are standing behind their work

2298549 what happens in 8 years if someone new comes to office and doesnt want to work together
2298550 a liberal is a man too broadminded to take his own side in a quarrel
2298551 so i think obama definitely has convinced people that he stands for change and for hope and i cant wait to see what he stands for
2298552 i believe that the second amendment is an individual right and that was the essential decision that the supreme court came down on

2298568 last time i checked we arent the only ones who need to carry around a pocket constitution
2298569 avoid including limes in your diet if youre interested in weight gain
2298570 oh my how ever shall i manage to gain some weight today
2298571 that does suggest those folks are important for the spending outlook and the overall economic outlook
2298572 from each according to their ability to each according to their need
2298573 i care that if obama wins my taxes will go up
2298574 no i think that the air gauge thing emphasizes how actually frivolous the obama you know proposals are with regard to energy
2298575 sure everybody says inflate your tires more turn your thermostat up a little bit more but is that going to solve the problem sure we want conservation we should give people tax incentives to insulate their homes better and do other things to conserve energy thats not enough you cant solve this problem just by shrinking your usage youve got to produce more
2298576 the other thing is they are making fun of a step that every expert says would absolutely reduce our oil consumption by three to four percent
2298577 there are things you can do individually though to save energy
2298578 making sure your tires are properly inflated simple thing but we could save all the oil that theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires and getting regular tune ups youd actually save just as much
2298579 lets begin with the one that started this negative tide john mccains ad last week comparing barack obama to celebrities paris hilton and britney spears
2298580 so even though he was being criticized do you think this was an effective ad because it got people talking about mccain again
2298581 barack obama says that he john mccain is taking the low road hes supposed to be a straight talker who doesnt resort to this sort of thing but he has
2298582 mccain launches another attack on obama is it having an effect on the latest polls
2298583 up next mccain versus obama yet another new negative ad is out you will see it
2298584 is the biggest celebrity in the world ready to help your family the real obama promises higher taxes more government spending so fewer jobs
2298585 so still a jab about the celebrity but much more on message and also when they say things like hes going to raise your taxes which they focused on much more in this ad than the first one
2298586 a new cbs news poll on the presidential race is out this morning and it shows barack obama leads john mccain 45 to 39 the same lead that he had a month ago
2298587 with such a tight race the gloves are off as more and more campaign ads take negative turns
2298588 its good to see johnny finally show that he has a pair of snickers
2298589 lets begin with the one that started this negative tide john mccains ad last week comparing barack obama to celebrities paris hilton and britney spears
2298590 im john mccain and im voting for barack obama for president i wish you would too
2298591 my opponent is a wonderful guy who would be a great president but vote for me because im even better
2298592 andy warhol said we all get our 15 minutes of fame
2298593 ive already had an hour and a half i mean
2298594 lets begin with the one that started this negative tide
2298595 doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
2298596 the choice is clear most of all we can choose between hope and fear it is going to be very difficult for republicans to run on their stewardship of the economy or their outstanding foreign policy we know what kind of campaign theyre going to run theyre going to try to make you afraid theyre going to try to make you afraid of me hes young and inexperienced and hes got a funny name and did i mention hes black

2298640 how to tell you spend too much time thinking about politics
2298641 we had discussions with the afl when they originally came to us with proposals for a stand alone international rules fixture in sydney which we were very interested in but when that proposal changed to include a second game in melbourne we were no longer interested
2298642 it just wasnt as attractive a prospect to us with a second game
2298643 the strategy and the philosophy of events nsw are to bring events that are of economic benefit to nsw and we just didnt feel this quite fit the bill with a second test as part of it
2298644 the decision was made within the company and didn treach board level so john had nothing to do with it we have a rigorous process for making decisions on events such as this
2298645 it was assessed within the company and the decision was made it just didnt stack up for us our board is very balanced we have the chairman of the sydney swans richard colless on there too so the afl would have been well represented
2298646 were obviously very disappointed it isnt going ahead we were very keen to see the event at anz stadium
2298647 we have had a great relationship with the sydney swans for many years now and we host finals games here with great success we get great crowds at swans games and we believed this event could have been of a similar ilk

2298651 the conventions of a number of the states having at the time of their adopting the constitution expressed a desire in order to prevent misconstruction or abuse of its powers that further declaratory and restrictive clauses should be added and as extending the ground of public confidence in the government will best ensure the beneficent ends of its institution

2298655 is it fair to say that the relationship that you had with sean fitzpatrick was a two way street was a mutual relationship
2298656 i told him that i wasnt going to leave my husband the only way he and i would ever have the opportunity to be together in our future was if something had happened to michael
2298657 the only way we can be together theroy she also said or if he leaves me

2298661 it is considered that the results indicate that the cautionary warning given on monday can now be lifted and that people should again be able to enjoy swimming and water sports at the main beaches including havelet and the bathing pools
2298662 samples taken on the east coast at bordeaux the victoria marina and fermain have shown somewhat poorer results but these were all within the criteria to pass the eu legal minimum standard
2298663 however whilst emergency discharge of sewage continues at the southside overflow the red lion outfall and the white rock outfall it would of course be sensible for people to exercise caution and avoid swimming or diving in these areas
2298664 its really sad and it does bring a greater urgency to the problem of sewage and we need to tackle it
2298665 we need to act fast cleaning up our waters will clean up our island
2298666 obviously some people believe that decision should be challenged but in all honesty i believe the director took the appropriate steps and people just had to be patient for a few days
2298667 we have some negotiating opportunities and rather than focus almost entirely on sanctions we should focus on what those opportunities should be
2298668 we would have preferred a more straightforward and positive answer from our iranian colleagues
2298669 the letter that we received yesterday appears to be a stalling tactic
2298670 john mccain is still in striking distance thanks to his own character biography and memories of the mccain of previous election cycles but he cannot afford another week like this one
2298671 i think voters see this difference between the two men
2298672 john mccain is complete barack obama is completing himself the question is will he finish that job by november
2298673 im not sure theres any short term political gain and i know that seems strange since obviously we put a lot of work into it
2298674 i dont think that well see a bump in the polls i think we might even lose some points people back home are worried about gas prices theyre worried about jobs
2298675 the value to me of this trip is hopefully it gives voters a sense that i can in fact and do operate effectively on the international stage
2298676 that may not be decisive for the average voter right now given our economic troubles but its knowledge they can store in the back of their minds for when they go into the polling place later
2298677 i dont think there are any compensation issues here at all as far as the states of guernsey is concerned
2298678 i say that as my personal view primarily because the situation we had here was a force majeure situation
2298679 it was something which came out of the blue and we have a full investigation going on as far as my department is concerned
2298680 the issue i see is utilising the 40 people in a more effective way to contribute to the state
2298681 there are times when the pressures on members of parliament and for that matter other people in public life do become very intense
2298682 it shows largely the continuation of important recent trends which is that texas is a state that is leading the nation in its ethnic and racial changes
2298683 there are a large number of counties in the state that are majority minority and the proportion of minorities in the state continues to increase
2298684 how to tell you spend too much time thinking about politics
2298685 we will be pleased to work with the harris county sports and convention corp astrodome redevelopment co and the rodeo in an effort to finalize agreements that protect the rights of all parties and allow for the successful redevelopment of the reliant astrodome
2298686 last time we were looking at a business proposal that violated our rights all over the place now a lease is being developed to protect our rights
2298687 the commercial lending market is much tougher now quite frankly we have been waiting on getting an approved lease before we go back out into the marketplace
2298688 to refuse to come here would be to give in to hate and prejudice

2298694 the agenda of the gay caucus runs contrary to the pro family pro life agenda
2298695 i will find it difficult to endorse any candidate who seeks the gay caucus endorsement
2298696 for the 25 000 voters who get the caucus slate card they are not going to be on it
2298697 and there will probably be some conservative slate cards that will leave them off
2298698 technically dry is something that can be worked around as needed
2298699 from the initiation of our development efforts with the kenedy foundation babcock amp brown has been committed to the responsible development of a world class wind farm for south texas
2298700 our intention has always been to deliver the benefits of renewable energy while minimizing any impact to the environment we were meticulous in the way we approached the development of this wind farm which we believe will be used as a model for future wind farms around the country
2298701 the winds of south texas are one of the largest and most attractive renewable energy resources in the country representing a tremendous clean and never ending power supply
2298702 our gulf wind farm will provide critical power when it is needed most because the coastal winds in south texas blow the hardest at the same time our states demand for electricity peaks

2298716 its not sustainable for me to have education economic development tourism and workplace relations and planning so therefore i would have to look to other ministers acting in some of those portfolios
2298717 these pay rises were due to be delivered on the first of september and now are already a month late

2298721 for this to work properly a lot of people are living in remote areas and access to food and to warmth and things like that arent always out there so they have to actually travel a lot longer distances on a weekly basis to get the necessities now i dont agree with that
2298722 i think its very very important that we have a look at a minister whos actually based in central australia who has an electorate in central australia provide that real focus from outside alice and tennant creek but logically i think itd be very sensible to have one of the existing members from down there either say karl hampton or alison anderson
2298723 i think that labor has ignored alice springs during its whole term of eight years or so

2298728 there was no question on his stuff no question on anything weve got to get him built up a little bit it will be exciting to see what weve got
2298729 mommy i so happy to see you i like your nice scarf
2298730 weve had a very aggressive program creating awareness to make the environment suitable for everyone
2298731 there are those who wreck the game experience for someone else we still have work to do but the vast majority has a good experience
2298732 people should be able to sit anywhere and have a good experience were serious about it
2298733 if youre looking for a purely religious experience this is not the place to do it but there are people who come who overindulge and are boorish and wreck it for other folks its just not right

2298935 we installed slackware on this old computer i had in my office that was my introduction to open source a student id work with knew about linux and he helped set it up i learned how to admin the box then he graduated and went off so i was the person holding the bag it was a great experience to find out theres this easier and cheaper way an organization could get online
2298936 i had been doing c programming for some research folks when i graduated i was either going to become a programmer or go to graduate school
2298937 i work with my clients to help them figure out the best way to implement technology i help them write bid requests hire web design vendors do project management
2298938 i work with clients who are using various types of open source software
2298939 it was quite serendipitous some colleagues of mine had mentioned me as a possible person to help them out
2298940 i got into open source primarily because i saw it as a way to level the playing field
2298941 i had been working with nonprofit organizations for a very long time and one of the things thats been a real issue for me is that many of these organizations dont have a lot of resources and they want to spend their resources on helping people as opposed to spending them on it its been troubling that in order to get good software theyre forced to spend a lot of money that should be spent on helping people so for me its a lot about putting software in the hands of everybody
2298942 for me thats the primary benefit of open source i dont have anything against proprietary software its fine if you want to pay for it but for me its a crime that organizations that really need good software and do amazing work in the world are often constrained in their ability to get it i value very much the other ideals of open source that you can get at the code and modify and change it if you want to but the way in for me was the level the playing field thing
2298943 this is true over the long term and for all types of different software
2298944 it ebbs and flows i was using drupal and it was atrocious and now its great wordpress was really hard to use and now its like amazing all of this stuff goes through those phases the linux desktop i end up always giving up theres a lot of reasons why that happens but its gotten much better compared to what it was even three years ago
2298945 i would like to see more people of various types and varied levels of expertise involved id like it to be less totally geek driven and more reflective of the wide range of people in the world im not sure how that would happen its not necessarily the open source communitys fault but i think that there would be a lot of interesting benefits if there were more people like designers involved and users who could actually find ways to contribute that are not programming
2298946 i really value the open source community i value the linux community and the incredible amount of work that has gone into making it it takes a lot to make an operating system and to make all the tools in the end when things all shake out down the road i think that linux and other open source operating systems in general will actually triumph i remember that huge pile of floppies in 1995 and how much work it took to get slackware up and now it takes five minutes to get a server up its sort of trivial having watched that its been really amazing even though ive had my own struggles with it i still understand how amazing it has been in the end its going to be linux and thats really cool to me

2299210 om heel duidelijk te zijn ik ben geen roker en ik weet dat roken zeer schadelijk is voor de gezondheid maar dat wil niet zeggen dat ik als politicus mijn gedacht en mijn gedrag wil opleggen aan de rest van vlaanderen ldd wil daarom dat de caf houders zelf beslissen of er in hun caf wordt gerookt of niet alleen de uitbaters hebben het recht om dat te bepalen en de klanten zullen wel hun conclusies trekken als ze niet tegen de rook kunnen zullen ze een rookvrij caf opzoeken en wie rookt of verdraagt dat er gerookt wordt zal naar een rokerscaf gaan laat de mensen dat nu eens zelf uitmaken
2299211 de horeca en zeker de caf s zijn een onmisbare sociale schakel in onze samenleving maar niets is minder wispelturig dan het uitgaansgedrag van de mensen daarom moet de sector zeer soepel kunnen omgaan met personeel en met reglementeringen en voor veel caf bazen is die papierwinkel de nagel van hun doodskist
2299212 yea though i walk through the valley of the shadow of death i will fear no evil for thou art with me
2299213 i have met people who say theyd rather die a quick death than undergo the drawn out suffering of a slow one still in three decades of counseling ive never met a dying person who wasnt grateful for the chance to prepare for death
2299214 there is something deadening about going through life cautiously testing the water toeing the line but there is nothing as exhilarating as living it to the ful it requires rising to challenges that come your way rather than evading them sticking out your neck instead of hiding in the crowd it means daring to take false steps and leaps of faith and the reward is calmness in the face of death
2299215 the solution to suffering is this that the meaning of earthly existence lies not as we have grown used to thinking in prospering but in the development of the soul
2299216 g iven the number of people i know who have not only coped with enormous suffering in their lives but come through it stronger than before i have come to feel that maybe we ought to stop approaching pain as something purely negative if we allow it pain can be an occasion for redemption a crucible of sorts that may refine and renew us

2299232 my friend over there just broke up with his girlfriend because she kept lying to him about little things and we thought it was funny because guys are the ones who have the reputation for lying but now he thinks women are worse so were trying to save him from being bitter about women for the rest of his life only you can help save him from ending up a lonely miserable old man eating dog food in a studio apartment downtown
2299233 camping in england no longer equals flimsy tents and sleeping on lumps and bumps visitbritain now even runs a grading scheme for campsites
2299234 there are five star campsites now and more people will go there because you can plug in hair straighteners or watch tv
2299235 its a mix between being right in the countryside but you are also quite comfortable
2299236 there is a woodburner in each tent and running water
2299237 youve got these places that either have pre erected tents with everything in them that you need and perhaps they even provide a food hamper as well
2299238 i think its perhaps people visiting luxury sites that may have turned their noses up at camping a few years ago because they perceived it to be a bit basic or damp and miserable
2299239 but what these camping experiences have done is open up the option of camping to people who dont like to get too dirty or putting their own tent up
2299240 i think a lot of farmers are moving into tourism and they are finding it quite a successful way of diversifying

2299312 while obviously a classic of baseball and even america yankee stadium does not have the homey feel of wrigley or fenway its more of a maselueum however walking around knowing that this is where ruth gehrig and mantle played make it the venerable place that it is
2299313 dude the bleachers are alcohol free you gotta pre party
2299314 tourist trap would be written all over this place they did a great job with the decorations and vivid colors we felt compelled to buy candy even though we could have purchased the exact same items for a fraction of the price at a nearby drug store
2299315 ive been resting it since hurting it at wimbledon for the purpose of being here and being able to do my best
2299316 for me its a thrill to be back no matter what happens its the olympics
2299317 i could not give the coach any guarantee that i would continue to play football when my one year contract with stuttgart ends
2299318 thats why i told them that they should not plan with me any longer for the national team
2299319 ive had a great time in the national team over the past few years the world cup in 2006 especially was fascinating and a unique experience for me
2299320 it was a good talk we were absolutely on the same wavelength in evaluating the situation
2299321 i thanked him for great performances our success at the 2006 world cup is linked closely to his name because of the penalty shootout against argentina he also played a big role in our success at euro 2008
2299322 he plays a little wild with the drops and slices
2299323 i wasnt expecting a lot of rhythm and i dont think i got much its a good strategy for him but its tough to actually win a match like that to be able to get through rather straightforward was a good thing
2299324 i lose six points in a row that never happens
2299325 i got a little bit nervous and he played well on those points he went for big shots and they worked for him i got a little bit tired
2299326 it took awhile for me to get into the match my legs were heavy he served very well and i wasnt moving well
2299327 he played well but i dont think i played the way i wanted to play
2299328 i had my best win and i couldnt play at the same level
2299329 its always hard playing an american when youre in the usa so i just tried to focus on the whole match i like the atmosphere here and the people
2299330 it makes it a lot harder to hit fairways when the wind is blowing like this youve got to hit it right down the middle and you cant really attack these greens from the rough
2299331 the conditions were much tougher than i expected this morning so i was happy that i was still able to go out and put together a decent score
2299332 the putter was the key to the round i putted pretty well yesterday but the greens were spiked up so i was excited about what i would be able to do in fresher conditions today
2299333 you never know you might shoot an eight over and it comes down to sunday and you can still have a chance to win
2299334 the course is playing a lot harder today than yesterday
2299335 the winds a lot harder i know the guys playing in the afternoon its going to be very challenging for them
2299336 by the great courage and solidarity of the chinese people
2299337 its inevitable that people from different countries may not see eye to eye
2299338 so we should try to expand our common ground on the basis of mutual respect
2299339 they want those leaders to confirm the fact that china has returned to great power prominence in the world
2299340 they really want to say to the people of china that we the communist party of china have done a great job
2299341 the atps tennis anti corruption program is clear that gambling on any form of tennis match is prohibited

2299343 i wasnt happy with myself for getting out then but the team situation im very happy with

2299349 i hope that the court is happy that i have cooperated
2299350 there was hardly anything for the bowlers on the pitch just that we didnt bat well if we take one or two early wickets tomorrow we are very much in the game
2299351 i went to the match confident after taking three wickets in a warmup match so i did not feel nervous
2299352 it was a big moment for me to get sachin tendulkar
2299353 today is the day you have made i will rejoice and be glad in it i wont worry about tomorrow im giving you my fears and sorrows where you lead me i will follow im trusting in what you say today is the day
2299354 in addition to utilizing a secret motion and secret hearing to obtain an order that facially violates the letter of the public records law your staff also failed to adhere to the spirit of the law and to federal and state case law both of which require the consideration of alternatives less draconian than sealing
2299355 according to the law the judge shielded these records temporarily so that an important criminal investigation would not be compromised
2299356 i have come that they might have life and have it to the fullest
2299357 hannah i didnt see any of the things you found
2299358 i feel the paper is unbalanced and prejudiced against the rights of creators and copyright holders in the consideration of digital copyright matters

2299366 men and women are subconsciously attracted to red moist lips because they signal youth sex and fertility men can put on some lip gloss or try licking their lips make it subtle as to avoid being misinterpreted or biting the lower lip
2299367 well the guy already needs to get the guts to ask me out he needs to make me laugh he needs to show he will be successful have he needs to be in shape he needs to have a good personality etc but i think that isnt hard enough for him why dont i play even harder to get by letting him call me and to ask me out 3 or 4 times before i finally agree to a first date
2299368 im spending that evening with my pet fluffy or roommates

2299371 just 57 of healthcare workers in the region would report for work during a radiological event
2299372 and so far the government doesnt seem to have educated citizens about what they can do to protect themselves if a bomb goes off in the city
2299373 there wasnt anything like sparks flying for me i dont know what shes talking about
2299374 i just dont feel like i think i should feel when i meet who im supposed to marry
2299375 by then the most eligible men want nothing to do with her because shes 5 years older than them
2299376 when we speak of difference we are therefore speaking of resistance difference cannot be recognized within the homologation sic this is not a careful translation that biopower imposes on society
2299377 lapsing into the representations of a beautiful soul there are only reconcilable and federative differences far removed from bloody struggle the beautiful soul says we are different but not opposed
2299378 the anti war movement doesnt matter because public opinion doesnt matter
2299379 a variety of claims made about the present which are not actually attributes of the present as distinct from earlier eras
2299380 implied claims about the past due to claims marking the present off from the past such as the notion that now because of immaterialization of labor adequate representation of the proletariat is impossible the proletariat is now a multiplicity as if it could previously be adequately represented
2299381 the irreducible possibility that the subject be more than adequate super adequate to itself

2299386 and the blast wave shattered glass in suburbs twelve miles away
2299387 for a 10 kiloton airburst everyone will be killed by lethal doses of flash radiation to a distance of 0 7 miles
2299388 further downwind from the detonation point a plume of radioactive debris would spread its shape and size would depend on wind and rain conditions but the area over which people who did not shelter themselves or flee within hours would receive lethal radiation doses within a day would range from five to ten square miles the area of brooklyn for new york northwest washington for washington dc or the upper peninsula for san francisco but the direction from ground zero depending on the wind
2299389 over 50 of the population within the dark red oval approximately 5 miles long would incur fatal radiation in the course of the first day if they stayed unsheltered in that area absent elaborate shelters people should leave as soon as possible
2299390 over 10 of the population in the lighter oval about 8 miles long would incur severe radiation injury sometimes fatal in the first day if they stayed unsheltered in that area light shelters could offer significant protection there and nearby sheltering offers the better option

2299393 to give an idea of the devastating blast effects of ground level shallow subsurface and low altitude nuclear weapon detonations
2299394 most glass surfaces such as windows will shatter within this ring some with enough force to cause injury
2299395 contacted by the wall street journal however buffett says he was worrying about any nuclear explosion not just one set off by terrorists and that he was talking about something that might come about over the next century not within a ten year period
2299396 and you know thousands of years ago we had psychotics and we had religious fanatics and we had megalomaniacs but about the most they could do was throw a stone at somebody if they wished evil on them
2299397 today since 1945 the ability to inflict evil or harm on other people in huge numbers has grown exponentially and right now theres the knowledge around to use nuclear material and weve got to hope that the wrong people dont get their hands on it
2299398 there are lots of loose nukes around the world weve got multiple governments that have the capability we have lots of chemical and biological agents that are ill guarded around the world and it should be at the top of the list for our government
2299399 there are people out there that would like to do a lot more than the world trade center or the spanish trains or that sort of thing
2299400 the nuclear chemical and biological threat is real and its one we should attack

2299402 we expect gross margin to be about 31 5 reflecting approximately 23 million related to stock based compensation expense down from 34 8 in the june quarter this sequential decline is expected due to three primary factors first the full quarter impact of the back to school promotion second a future product transition which i cant discuss today and third the one time true up of our contract manufacturer deferred margin that we realized in the june quarter
2299403 the fun part is figuring how this all fits into apples strategy as not just a maker of computers but also as a seller and distributor of entertainment content
2299404 the ntt chip is not just an h 264 decoder it encodes too which is what makes it so special the last i heard nhk was claiming the chip could compress a 1080p video and audio stream into four megabits per second down from the 20 megabits normally required if we assume apple will apply the same kind of wink wink nudge nudge transcoding to 1080p that theyve already applied to 720p in the apple tv then it is within reason to expect theyll claim to distribute 1080p over itunes in two megabits per second
2299405 what really excites me as a content creator is the amazing potential of real time hd video and games are by far the greatest consumers of cycles on modern pcs by embracing a dedicated h 264 chip that it may well have exclusively for a year or more apple is taking an out of the box approach that will frustrate its competitors in both software and hardware while the h 264 chips are expensive theyll enable apple to save money elsewhere by having slower computers that run faster video though it is doubtful that many will use it you can be sure apple will trumpet the ability to support 720p video in ichat
2299406 is the economical and logical choice to fulfill our interim capacity needs

2299511 believe on the lord jesus christ and you will be saved you and your household
2299512 now this does not mean that once you believe on jesus your family members are automatically saved what it means is that you have opened a big door for god to move into your familys life and to touch every member of your family

2299519 my main job is to provide the team with go forward ball and to be efficient at scrum time those little runs are a bonus
2299520 but peters theory is this when you have the ball it is your turn to play do whatever you want as long as you protect the ball and take the team forward weve fortunately got a lot of ball players in our team
2299521 im a prop it would have been awkward to kick that ball i decided to have a go and just like that i was around on the outside its just the way it unfolded
2299522 i learned a lot on tour from guys like forwards coach gary gold and my team mates gurthro bismarck du plessis and so on i just waited for my turn and it came against australia i wanted to do something against them and obviously peter was happy with what he saw
2299523 if god loves you so much how come all these things are happening to you
2299524 he only has to walk straight up to the person he wants to devour and devour him but since the bible says that he goes about seeking whom he may devour the truth then is that there are people whom the devil cannot devour
2299525 who redeems your life from destruction who crowns you with lovingkindness and tender mercies
2299526 parents who take their kids along to this film are underrating the kind of impact it will have
2299527 the dilemma for parents is that every other child at school is going to see it but really they have to be firm and simply say no
2299528 the danger with a film like this is its history in the batman comic book series and cartoons people thinks of this hero as fun and entertaining so parents may even take very young children to see what they believe is a family film
2299529 dont take your 9 year old son unless you think hes enjoy seeing a kid just like him tremble in fear while a gun is held to his head by a previously sympathetic character
2299530 kids would also have trouble following the movie let alone understanding it
2299531 the whole movie from start to finish is inappropriate for kids children below 12 year old in my opinion are not equipped to deal with the moral complexities and ambiguities of the film
2299532 the jokers nihilistic philosophy can sound dangerously seductive to a child two face is the stuff of nightmares and children shouldnt have picture of this broken man in their heads
2299533 there are also some excellent batman cartoons another thing is to perhaps buy the kids of with the dark knight toys
2299534 no way should it be nc 16 uptight worried and conservative parents and nervous children should just remain at home the dark knight doesnt need them
2299535 its faithful to the dark knight comics and it needs to be that way and i find nothing objectionable at all
2299536 i sure didnt hear any freaking out from other children during the screening
2299537 the dark themes and atmosphere are related and pertinent to the story of the dark knight and to proceed with the movie with the greater aim of bring child friendly will be doing the story and characters injustice
2299538 horror films use such shock tactics all the time even the pg rated ones
2299539 otherwise it just had all the usual elements of big action movies
2299540 talk to their kids and make sure they know its not reality
2299541 we stick to the ratings and then exercise common sense if you ask me theres plenty more to worry about on the internet than in the movies itself
2299542 we gaan vandaag en morgen onze leden informeren over dit resultaat ik vind dit een verdedigbaar resultaat met perspectief richting enkele belangrijke kwesties in deze sector ik hoop dat onze leden het hiermee eens zijn
2299543 zij moet nu eerst met geld over de brug komen als zij groen licht geeft dan is het akkoord rond en houden met instemming van onze leden de acties op
2299544 the new rules suit south africa better and the springbok tactics suit the new rules
2299545 in the world cup we saw them kick a lot they had a very solid defence and a lethal counter attack
2299546 we are expecting a very physical confrontation but the springboks are not just emphasising the physical side they are also becoming more intelligent and exposing their rivals deficiencies more
2299547 they love to maul and enjoy the hit and go so its going to be a typically physical argentina test
2299548 but theyre also going to be the perfect test for us to get things 100 percent right before the tri nations matches

2299587 third i am experiencing some culture shock here in a good way of course its just so different than what i had imagined
2299588 well i think i had just imagined things to be slightly different i just wish the media would show this side of iran too
2299589 no the hospitable fun life loving people that they you are you know certain images remain in your mind until an experience convinces you otherwise and in the case of iran and iranians not every american gets to travel here to experience this side of things so they just continue to believe what they are fed by the press
2299590 im just kidding kiss me i know what youre saying lover i get it baba man you have a strong point now if everyone else would get on the same page wed have progress
2299591 seriously i love the way your people party i feel like the spaniard italian blood in me can relate to it the german bits not so much
2299592 oh great now youre going to follow in royas footsteps
2299593 no no no its just that in the middle of this beautiful country with its rich history and complex modern sociopolitical state people still find the time to party hard and to do it so nonchalantly as if that world out there doesnt exist is just fascinating to me i feel like we could be in any major party city in the world right now look around not all of these people are doing drugs look some are just drinking juice but all of them are having a good time
2299594 yeah that guy wearing dark shades and dancing with the wall in the corner is definitely not on drugs and the orange colored drink thats fighting his grip is plain orange juice

2299599 well you know everything good comes from iran i mean look at all these gorgeous people is it even possible to have so many good looking people in one place maybe thats why there are so many restrictions out there because iranian women are just too damn tempting

2299617 oh lover i think he was on something he was harmless but thanks for saving me
2299618 anytime babydoll but why arent you wearing your wedding ring heres your gm shot
2299619 no but wearing a stone that big at a family affair like my cousins engagement party is only going to create conversations that i would rather skip also showing my ring at such a fete would ensure that by the time we come back next year for a visit the girls will have my custom designed ring and claim it as their own maybe so clearly its not worth the risk of wearing it
2299620 wow this russian vodka in a can tastes really good
2299621 yes it is tasty but be careful its also very robust i know you can handle your liquor but just keep in mind that this vodka is extremely strong in its effect
2299622 lover do you mind if i go and search the place for roya quick
2299623 but its not even time to leave yet why dont you wait another few minutes and if she doesnt show up then lets go and look for her together i would really rather not have you walking the place alone theres no longer a single sober person in sight i feel more comfortable escorting you on your search
2299624 lover im going to go and find a bathroom ive got to go really bad
2299625 ok just be careful and go to the one behind the bar ill watch well go look for roya when you come back
2299626 hey babydoll i was getting worried about you did you get to use the bathroom where is it i thought it was here by the bar i think i need to use the bathroom now too
2299627 ok whatever works how did you know i was standing behind you do you have eyes behind your head
2299628 no i found roya though and we need to get out of here i had an idea that this was a drug party but i had no clue it was going to be this crazy its far more intense than what any visionary dollar sign eyed hollywood producer could conjure to depict a drug party scene she was in the room with a group of people sprawled on a bed with their own personal tray of narcotic goodies lets go to the door together and ill go in and get her
2299629 lover i cant find the driver anywhere but weve only been gone for twenty minutes and i bet if we head back towards jordan street well be able to find him i doubt the traffic has made any progress
2299630 the moral police theyre here we have to go now
2299631 were headed to a funeral at the main mosque sir my cousin here has lost her father she is having a very hard time dealing with the grief i asked my husband to carry her to the car we are actually running a bit late
2299632 may allah bless his mercy on you and may it be your last last sorrow have a good night
2299633 lover i think we made it out of there just in time i just saw a bunch of boys being dragged out from the party they all looked like they were handcuffed i think theyre headed for a rough journey at the local prison
2299634 yes but at least were fine thats the risk you take when you throw or go to such soirees hopefully they have an inside connection to help diminish the number of lashings theyre going to receive tonight its out of our hands though and we need to find the driver and go to my cousins engagement before that party gets raided by the moral police too although im sure amoo nader uncle nader has paid the proper people to elude a raid but maybe we should drop roya off first
2299635 no im not going to miss my cousins engagement put me down
2299636 hes waiting at the traffic light on the right hand of the street
2299637 i sent him a text message smarty pants its the year 2006 hello have you heard of a mobile
2299638 i swear we were in a movie tonight maybe a guy ritchie flick minus the madonna infused soundtrack
2299639 yes but were going to be very late arent we
2299640 lover were on pst persian standard time here that means we can arrive as late as we want and they will have expected it
2299641 oh yeah i learned a little about that when you purposely ordered extra wedding invitations and inserted an early arrival time on the invites going out to your family so that they would show up on time and it worked alright then lets grab some redbull from your grandmothers refrigerator when we drop roya off
2299642 i went and checked it out when you were in the shower i was searching for your grandmothers famous lavaashak home made fruit roll ups that ive heard so much about and came across the farsi labeled redbull
2299643 no we need to take roya back to the house shes not feeling well
2299644 we cant take miss roya back to the house in this state your grandmother will not be pleased to see her like this may i suggest for me to go ahead and take you to the party while i wait in the car with miss roya until she feels well enough to join you inside that is

2299654 midrash and various mystical texts present angels as heavenly beings created by god who are not endowed with quote they occasionally appear on earth in furtherance of gods will often as messengers
2299655 while i was thus in the act of calling upon god i discovered a light appearing in my room which continued to increase until the room was lighter than at noonday when immediately a personage appeared at my bedside standing in the air for his feet did not touch the floor
2299656 he had on a loose robe of most exquisite whiteness
2299657 not only was his robe exceedingly white but his whole person was glorious beyond description and his countenance truly like lightning the room was exceedingly light but not so very bright as immediately around his person when i first looked upon him i was afraid but the fear soon left me
2299658 there are no angels who minister to this earth but those that do belong or have belonged to it
2299659 those holy souls who have severed attachment to the earthly world who are free from the fetters of self and passion and who have attached their hearts to the divine realm and the merciful kingdom

2299773 with my family i took responsibility for my actions in 2006 and today i take full responsibility publicly

2299824 being religious today often entails actively and purposefully building or rebuilding a community not simply joining the one you were born into
2299825 the loss of integral jewish community has meant that jewish commitment is a matter of choice that is nowhere more true than in contemporary america where the freedom to participate fully in the life of the larger society is in every respect greater than has ever been before indeed is nearly absolute we are living moreover in what is very likely the most mobile society that has ever existed on the face of the earth it is no wonder that the jewish community in this situation has to argue for every single jewish soul compete for every pledge of allegiance against an ever increasing wealth of beckoning possibilities and must do so not once in a persons life but repeatedly year in and year out because each of us not only decides where to live but with who and how
2299826 i was among the first seven chosen in the team i wouldnt pretend that i was one of the seven best basketball players in america

2299861 i have seen as much as a 300 increase in the number of children coming to our centre for treatment
2299862 its in the interest of the drug dealers to get these kids hooked on drugs early
2299863 the drug pushers use kids to sell drugs on the streets because they dont draw as much attention from the police
2299864 i was selling drugs not for profit but simply so that i could afford the drugs i needed
2299865 i was exposed to shoot outs because there would be conflicts with other dealers over turf i was also asked to hide weapons for the man i worked for
2299866 what kind of kids can we expect to raise with this kind of violence
2299867 but the real solution is going to require a change in the way we live here in mexico a greater understanding of our reality a change in the way we think

2299871 a former ut football player is arrested on lake travis police say cedric benson 25 was boating with about a dozen people saturday night when police pulled his boat over for a random safety inspection
2299872 officers say benson who is now a running back for the chicago bears was behind the wheel and had been drinking
2299873 lake travis is a sanguine body of water in the tony section of austin texas each weekend the lake is filled with boaters of all ages as night drops over texas capital city the manses on the hills above the lake shimmer the likes of actress sandra bullock and tennis star andy roddick reside in the hills and often party on the lake inevitably on those friday and saturday nights young mostly white revelers can be heard out the high pitched laughs and screams of women and the primal frat boy drunken yells to no one in particular abound as their crafts glide by older partiers they wave but the hip hop and rap music remains clearly audible even from 60 feet above the shore the young yell their hellos a little too inebriated while the slightly more sober older folk cordially wave and smile i have seen this scene perhaps 50 times on lake travis i have seen people on party boats diving into spotlighted water late late into the evening i have heard the boom of the bass of rock or rap music as if a speaker was next to my ear but i have never ever seen a lower colorado river authority officer do anything other than float by and ask the white partiers if everything is all right now if youre a young black and wealthy nfl running back and ex university of texas star named cedric benson and you own a 30 foot party boat and youre on lake travis with your boys and some women and the same music is playing that was heard on the by white partiers just five minutes before well youre getting busted and if you say a word youre getting sprayed

2299901 beware the green eyed monster which doth mock the meat it feeds on
2299902 again at eight oclock when the dark lanes of the forties were lined five deep with throbbing taxi cabs bound for the theatre district i felt a sinking in my heart forms leaned together in the taxis as they waited and voices sang and there was laughter from unheard jokes and lighted cigarettes made unintelligible circles inside imagining that i too was hurrying toward gayety and sharing their intimate excitement i wished them well
2299903 ive been living in an incredible state of pressure and scrutiny
2299904 spur of the moment willy nilly i can frolic in canada
2299905 what matters to me is how the court overall is perceived
2299906 its about time someone recognized that team canada should steer clear of joe thornton

2299911 ive got some kids here i can save that i can make a difference in their lives
2299912 n ature cleaned it up faster than we ever could
2299913 the sea eats oil alive that place up there nature cleaned it up faster than we ever could
2299914 we expected the natural decay rate was 25 a year but very little of the oil actually disappeared
2299915 whats left is going to be there a long time
2299916 the theory has been that on a rocky shore its not going to stay for that long that waves will wash it away
2299917 we made a lot of assumptions about what would happen to the oil a lot of those didnt play out
2299918 i want to destroy america i want to destroy alaska
2299919 thats a year removed we dont dwell on those things you guys do
2299920 i just try to keep things as simple as possible i try to lead a lap to get the five bonus points and try to lead the most laps if i can and try to finish as good as i can without sticking it in the fence
2299921 fortunately we have been lucky enough to win seven races we can only hope that we win a couple more and try to get further ahead of the competition when the chase starts
2299922 yes i think so i think a lot of it might have been not so much the competition itself but the personalities the dale earnhardts the darrell waltrips the bobby allisons and others
2299923 we have a lot of great personalities now but the sport itself has become a whole lot more corporate and a lot less personal in that respect you have to be a whole lot more stale today than you want to be
2299924 the racing was different but i personally dont think it was better then i think actually if you laid down two races side by side what we have today and what they had then i think you would sell more tickets to what we have today but i think if you ask the fans what lot of drivers they would prefer they might say the old guys i would
2299925 i wouldnt like to see it done just by watching the race last week there was really no passing unless someone ran off the racetrack
2299926 i thought goodyear did an excellent job of showing how prepared they were for that
