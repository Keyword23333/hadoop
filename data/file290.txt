2900059 the controls were just too fun to waste on one set of game rules
2900060 our greatest glory is not in never failing but in rising everytime we fall
2900061 people who ve been exposed to libraries realize that there are a lot of other cultures and things out there that a small town of 4 000 doesn t provide access to the library is literally a window on the world
2900062 if they close off the libraries you dont have to worry about a brain drain youll close off the mental capabilities of the people
2900063 feeling good doesn t equate to voting yes for a library referendum
2900064 we feel you are not going to use these funds what you say you will
2900065 no kid should have an excuse for not having a book or knowing how to do research if you dont have a computer at home you can go to the public library
2900066 its one of the few things that truly can provide a sense of community it doesn t belong to anyone but to all of us its a good lesson in respect being quiet signing up for internet time returning books on time its kind of a good building block in respect
2900067 its a gathering place where lots of different people can listen to someone elses ideas whether spoken or written
2900068 it represents a commitment by the community to cultural and intellectual activities
2900069 an executive is a person who always decides sometimes he decides correctly but he always decides
2900070 the principle is valid however few administrators or the members of their governing authorities have the tolerance and flexibility needed to maintain the balance of power and still make the right policy and operating decisions few have learned how to navigate the troubled waters when administrators disagree with their bosses on the board yet i remember a strong director who was faced with board opposition to acquiring video formats because it competed with a local store wisely agreeing to acquire the library collection from that store the discount in purchasing locally was a bit lower but everyone was happy
2900071 if you would take the time and be honest and sincere in your efforts you could ask people for ideas and be assured they will come up with most of the solutions required for them to do their best both for themselves and for the good of their team and organization
2900072 i value you as a person your opinion is important to me us the team the organization
2900073 the ego we concluded can be a very damaging thing inflated overbearing egos create rules for rules sake egos complicate procedures and keep good people down egos squash good ideas and can take the best of an organization and turn it on itself
2900074 are best positioned to provide the testing and hardware configurations for a great customer experience
2900075 one director said this was all well and good but that the current generation of directors needed to give their
2900076 she has no idea of all the innovations were implementing
2900077 he gets paid so much and he doesn t do anything
2900078 whats the deal with that librarian she was such a jerk
2900079 i went to use the librarys computers and someone was looking at porn
2900080 back when i had dial up at home it used to be that going to work was my great escape from the slow speed at home now that i have amazingly reliable verizon dsl at home however going to work is like sliding into a nice pool of tepid tar
2900081 where did i go right youre no one in hollywood unless someone wants you dead
2900082 the thing is when anyone talks about michael jordan i thought he elevated the nba to a whole new level and michael jordan our player is a guy that you watch him and he plays the game so well
2900083 hes good at it he gets hits he throws people out he can steal he can play every position
2900084 he plays like hes seven feet tall and some teams make the mistake of looking at his size he does things that kids twice his size twice his strength wish they could do
2900085 a lot of people are surprised most of the people i play against dont think i have an arm they think just because youre short you cant play baseball or you cant hit for power we have just as much power as the big people do
2900086 when people say that size cant play i try to prove them wrong that size can play no matter how big or how small you can as long as youve got a heart and a passion
2900087 hes a little small guy and he gives you all he has hes a smart kid on the baseball field and the one thing you could say about him when he walks away from the field he gives it his all he doesnt hot dog it
2900088 this is a kid thats really taken advantage of the rbi program not just baseball wise but as a person developed himself and become a leader out there
2900089 this gives him the opportunity that without rbi he wouldnt be able to play baseball because he couldnt afford to play baseball
2900090 hes matured tremendously in the four years that ive known him through the rbi program
2900091 this kid is a stud hes a five tool player besides the height hes got it all and hopefully that one person will give him that opportunity to go to the next step in his life
2900092 even though these kids are much bigger than he is height wise when he tells the kids hey lets do something they gravitate to michael
2900093 he has that x factor you may see when he talks to his teammates they listen they do what he says
2900094 hes a leader of example he plays hard he plays good so its much easier for him to become a leader because he plays the game the way its supposed to be played
2900095 the just for fun respondents are the heaviest users of the library reporting an
2900096 while the just for fun voters are the heaviest users of the library they are the least likely of all probable supporters to vote in favor of an increase in library funding p 71
2900097 they see the library as a place to relax hang out and socialize with others and recognize the librarys role as a community gathering place however they are not as emotionally connected to the library as other segments on the probable supporters tier and are less likely to support it financially p 71
2900098 the just for fun segment represents almost a quarter of all library visits 23 9 p75
2900099 the just for fun segment has a greater awareness of what is available at the local public library than average for all voters in particular its members see the librarys internet access as a big draw and they love to read they have the same positive associations with the library that are common across all probable supporters segments but have less of an emotional connection than other segments on this tier compared to other probable supporters just for fun respondents are less likely to see the library as a place that helps them improve intellectually creatively or personally the library is a place to hang out and socialize and just for fun respondents value the librarys role as a community gathering place and social hub p 76
2900100 the library is seen less by just for fun respondents as a place to better themselves intellectually creatively or personally p 79
2900101 kid driven respondents visit the library more than average with 19 visits reported annually they are typically accompanied by at least one child they regularly check out materials for children and participate in the childrens programming kid driven respondents are willing to support the library financially because of the role it plays in educating and inspiring their children to be the best that they can be p 80
2900102 the kid driven voters are emotionally connected to the library seeing it as offering an exciting and diverse experience that inspires them and helped shape their identity they hope the library will do the same for their children p 85
2900103 fulfills a practical function and is more about knowledge than a personal connection
2900104 library as office respondents are more likely than other segments to operate businesses or work in the same towns where they live they have a tendency to live in smaller rural towns across the midwest p89
2900105 the library as office voters feel that they always leave the library having learned something new their connection to the library is practical rather than emotional and their ideal library would offer services tailored to the business user p 93
2900106 the ideal library a resource for small businesses provides all of the resources a small business would need including f ree temporary office space computers with internet access phone copier scanner and fax machine it would also provide access to online databases like abi inform as well as other business related resources like books about finances marketing etc resource for tax preparation provides tax forms access to tax preparation resources and step by step guidance during tax season workforce training center provides instructor led classes on entrepreneurship presentation skills computer skills sales generation financial planning marketing and other business related topics in order to improve the workplace skills and marketability of community members
2900107 look to librarians voters have the foundation of a strong emotional relationship with the library and they see the library as a place where they can better themselves intellectually and feel like they belong they also see the library as a place to escape from everyday life p 97
2900108 this is the only segment to rank public libraries as the number one priority for an increase in taxes across all seven public services surveyed outranking the police and fire departments and public schools p 97
2900109 look to librarians voters volunteer in their community and at the library and are active participants in local organizations they have a long standing and ongoing relationship with the library this relationship has led to a strong emotional connection and a sense of belonging p 102
2900110 enough of the people who copy and listen to grateful dead tapes end up paying for hats t shirts and performance tickets in the new era the ancillary market is the market
2900111 if you cant retrieve the actual data then i challenge you to complete the experiment
2900112 almost any district at any time facing a funding crisis can say heres an easy fix
2900113 theyre looking at what programs are mandated instead of what programs are effective
2900114 the need for the librarian and the expert in the field hasnt changed it has just multiplied
2900115 we have the physical space to take care of plus we have the virtual space
2900116 they played around with it and found that they could actually create a ghost image put it in a hidden partition and using a flash drive with a run time version of norton ghost on it they could actually redo the c drive within three to four minutes between each use
2900117 all they had to do was basically insert the thumb drive and we set it up to boot off of usb
2900118 they essentially turned the laptop off put in the thumb drive turned it on and the c drive rewrote itself and then it beeped at them when it was done
2900119 residents who visit the library said they didnt want to see cuts but could withstand minimal cuts to slower hours as long as nights and weekends werent taken away
2900120 theres a really inflammatory headline and opening paragraph in an article in the times online in the uk stating that book piracy on the internet will ultimately drive authors to stop writing this claim is actually unsubstantiated by history which has actually shown book piracy ends up helping authors or actually by the rest of the article rather than a reactionary riaa style response from the uks society of authors the article shows that the group isnt so much fearing internet piracy but simply noting that business models need to change
2900121 according to the research firm more than 60 of 25 to 34 year old job seekers rely on the internet to find employment information making career sites the second most common source of new hires for large companies forrester expects that popularity to increase as generation x and y employees begin to comprise a larger percentage of the total workforce yet the study showed that job seekers can expect poor performance from career sites across the board ten of the 12 sites reviewed scored below zero the report reads a passing score on all 25 criteria forrester examines would be a 25 or higher with a score range of between 50 and 50 yahoo hotjobs fared the best at 10 which is 15 points shy of a passing score merrill lynch fared the worst at 18 the average score across all of the sites evaluated was 8 8 forrester reports forrester evaluated american international group aig citigroup merrill lynch and the goldman sachs group in the financial services industry for retailers the research firm examined jcpenney kroger macys and rite aid and for job search web sites the research covered careerbuilder com dice monster and yahoo hotjobs common problems across all industries including missing content and functions flawed navigation flows illegible text and poor use of space as well as poor error handling and missing privacy and security policies according to forrester companies need to design career sites with the user in mind and begin revamping by first fixing problems that inhibit site usability
2900122 our hypothesis u s public libraries are facing marketing and advocacy challenges that have been faced by other super brands lessons learned and successes achieved can be applied to increase library funding utilizing marketing and advocacy techniques targeted to the right community segments with the right messages and community programs we can improve the state of public library funding
2900123 respondents who have the strongest beliefs that the library is a source of transformation are those who are most passionate about the need to protect support and fund the library
2900124 instead the research indicated a need to appeal to both the heart and mind of the potential voter positioning the library as an important
2900125 the financially strapped generally believe that the public library already has sufficient funding the financially strapped segment is more than twice as likely 53 as the average for all voting respondents 23 to believe the library should be able to operate on its current budget this segment is not willing to increase taxes for library funding
2900126 the most defining characteristic of this segment is its members lack of
2900127 they are more likely to have internet access at home than other voting respondents and think
2900128 not only are the detached respondents uninvolved with their local libraries they
2900129 i dont want to pay to help the poor or someone else
2900130 wow i didnt know the library had books like this
2900131 we should move to face out shelving because the stats increase
2900132 at a typical borders superstore the reduction of inventory will be between 4 675 and 9 350 titles out of about 93 500
2900133 make borders vulnerable to a marketing campaign from barnes amp noble that promotes its own vast selection the average 25 000 square foot barnes amp noble superstore stocks approximately 125 000 to 150 000 book titles and the chain says it has no intention of cutting back
2900134 each publisher is reviewing their entire audiobook list to confirm each title author
2900135 education level is a good predictor of library use should this make us worried that the people who may be the least likely to use the library may be those who need us the most
2900136 when a black man goes into a realtors office the realtor tells him the only houses that are available are in the ghetto when a white man goes in the realtor suddenly has more openings in nice areas
2900137 it was a fine political message to say we serve everyone equally
2900138 in a place like phoenix with 13 libraries to serve 1 4 million people you have to redefine what access means lots of hours and uniform schedules are critical to that
2900139 the fact that digital preservation is done by others outside nara isnt an excuse for nara to abdicate their responsibility but an argument that they should be capable of fulfilling it he said

2900146 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2900147 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2900148 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2900149 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2900150 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2900151 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2900152 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2900153 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2900154 everything is packed all you need is your wallet and phone
2900155 in sacramento theres a pall over it many state legislators see it as a problem and that perception has to change
2900156 we need to promote the good things were doing its absolutely important we have to get the message out that technology is not something to be scared of
2900157 we need to focus on risk mitigation not risk elimination
2900158 and we need state it staff to own projects instead of vendors
2900159 a banner ad is placed on the page and the users can mouse over the ad and up will pop the lawyers profile information including information about the firm its attorneys where its offices are located some history and the types of cases they handle
2900160 i am not practicing law and i am not involved in any of that that is between the client and the attorney
2900161 certainly we are going to do seo and sem we are going to do significant television radio and outdoor ad campaigns focusing on target markets at first and hopefully growing it into a national ad campaign wed like to become the lending tree of legal services
2900162 the brands that we do business with are used to buying content
2900163 they value the context and they understand the price you have to pay for that
2900164 really being able to target in a much more nuanced way
2900165 in the beginning when we launched them we really had to position them as brands in the marketplace
2900166 these brands are household names and are well known by people who buy media as well
2900167 we are still planning to trial the technology but have not started doing so yet we are currently working on some things before we can begin but are expecting the trials to commence soon
2900168 we are looking for a network based opt out solution instead of one using cookies but this is not holding up the trial
2900169 there are other things we are working through its a separate issue
2900170 this is a positive step toward ensuring that australias benchmark equity market indices reflect the increasing globalisation of the australian market the end result is more representative indices which better meet the needs of index users
2900171 this change removes a key impediment to large international listings on asx australian fund managers investment banks brokers and asx all have a strong interest in growing the international side of asx listed equities so that our market keeps pace with the growth in australian superannuation
2900172 if there were a group of questionable donations all with the name abdullah that were funneled through a guy in jordan who is a jordanian national who is under investigation for war profiteering and it were barack obama instead of john mccain would this be a bigger deal

2900176 what good is it for a man to gain the whole world yet forfeit his soul
2900177 he would arrive at the factory sometimes as early as 4 00 am extremely drunk his car would be parked right at the factorys gate so that when it was time for us to enter and punch in at 6 00 am we would have to line up to kiss mr ong
2900178 every woman who had to report for work early in the morning had no choice but to kiss mr ong youre considered lucky if had to report at 10 am when mr ong would most likely be at his office or asleep
2900179 i immediately refused the promotion i refused outright and told mr ong i would not be shamed in front of my co workers and my husband who was also in the same department he retorted i should kiss him when my husband is not around it was embarassing
2900180 we didnt like it nobody liked it but we had no choice we all feared we would lose our jobs
2900181 he was drunk and put operations to a halt at 10 00 am we then decided to go home and as i punched out my time card he shouted and asked that i approach him at first he said he wanted to know if i was the one responsible for trying to organize a union in the factory i denied this and asked if i can leave he ignored my request and said it was good that i wasnt starting a union at that point he pulled his zipper down and grabbed my hand he asked if i would touch him as he tried to bring my hand closer to his private part i was able to pull away and ran towards my co workers outside i was shocked and shivering
2900182 for over a decade it was tolerated and even encouraged by the management we had no union and we didnt know where to turn to not one sexual harassment case was filed against mr ong
2900183 as contractualization and unemployment worsen women find it more and more difficult to find their voices inside the workplace they risk losing their jobs unfortunately the existing law against sexual harassment has failed to curb the commission of the crime in workplaces
2900184 it has been ten years we believe it is time for amendments to be introduced
2900185 the employer head of office in a work related education or training environment or institution shall hereby be mandated to adopt a comprehensive detailed written policy on sexual harassment and so that there shall be a 48 hour deadline within which to act on complaints against sexual harassment in these places
2900186 crisis begets violence women become all the more vulnerable to gender violence sexual abuse and harassment in the midst of poverty women workers would have no other choice than to endure these sexual advances rather than face joblessness in the workplace violence against women becomes all themore prevalent in the absence of a womens committee or worse in the absence of a union
2900187 it is not just the sexual harassment that goes unabated when workers are without union
2900188 we know that organizing ourselves into a union would give us leverage we have had several attempts in the past ten years but the management always found a way to stop us
2900189 the stoppage of operation and bringing out of the machines are illegal attempts of the management to establish a runaway shop we picketed the gate and lay on the passageway to keep the trucks and the machinery from leaving
2900190 what good is it for a man to gain the whole world yet forfeit his soul
2900191 how does classroom of the future promote student centred learning
2900192 will the gst hike make the lower income group unable to make ends meet
2900193 will the increase in the number of erp gantries affect the livelihood of cab drivers

2900197 i fought him in the world championships and he did the exact same thing
2900198 it was a rough fight nobody in there wants to box me so i guess im going to have to slug it out bang out the body shots and then go back to boxing
2900199 we were very close to being in the quarterfinals and now we are very far
2900200 before the game nobody gave us a chance and i think we played pretty good you can look at his as half empty or half full
2900201 when i scored that goal we went and picked it up
2900202 when i came in they said they werent sure and so i said ill take it
2900203 you just blast it on goal and see where it lands
2900204 ive played in many big games but the energy tonight was different i think they knew that history was being made tonight obviously it was a proud moment for their country as it is for ours you could feel the electricity
2900205 the excitement of it the anxiousness of it the anticipation was just crazy
2900206 im kind of glad its out of the way now this game was just over the top
2900207 he basically came up to us and said im here to support you our country supports you and so go out there and kick some butt
2900208 so i think that it will be good for us
2900209 you just had to smile because you couldnt write it any better
2900210 i have as much authority as the pope i just dont have as many people who believe it
2900211 im completely in favor of the separation of church and state my idea is that these two institutions screw us up enough on their own so both of them together is certain death
2900212 think of how stupid the average person is and realize half of them are stupider than that

2900222 we havent modelled that but we would not expect it to have any impact
2900223 senator what i am saying is that the prices you are talking about are generally set in international markets and this would not have any impact on those prices
2900224 as far as we are aware no approaches have been made to treasury for a meeting from the north west shelf
2900225 just because you want to achieve a particular result to use one policy tool such as the carbon production reduction scheme or whatever its called that doesnt mean you need to have an uneven situation for another policy tool
2900226 we would not expect this to have any impact on exploration in other areas but we have not necessarily modelled that in particular either

2900234 an estimated 1 5 billion people or a quarter of the worlds population depend directly on land that is being degraded
2900235 the loss of biomass and soil organic matter releases carbon into the atmosphere and affects the quality of soil and its ability to hold water and nutrients
2900236 israels major sources of drinking water including the sea of galilee and the mountain aquifer are below their red lines meaning they are not recommended to draw water
2900237 our experiences tell us that environmental stress due to lack of water may lead to conflict and would be greater in poor nations
2900238 population growth will make the problem worse so will climate change as the global economy grows so will its thirst many more conflicts lie just over the horizon
2900239 the greatest challenge we face is to try and reduce the dependence on the import of grains whether by increasing local production or whether by making more efficient use of raw materials in feeding livestock
2900240 this must be done despite all limitations mainly the lack of water
2900241 if the desalination and recycling projects are implemented a lack of water is not expected in 2013
2900242 i dont even like to go there its a disaster
2900243 we just threw everything to the floor and hope that next year is better
2900244 the decision is really simple you choose the part of your fields that are hardest to get water to and you destroy them
2900245 its frustrating because you work hard to make it grow the point is to be big and efficient enough to survive but right now its hard
2900246 because it uses observations to demonstrate the sensitivity of extreme rainfall to temperature
2900247 such changes in extreme rainfall are quite important in my view as flash flooding is produced by the extreme rain events
2900248 in the u s flooding is a greater cause of death than lightning or tornadoes and presumably poses similar risks elsewhere
2900249 the better your infrastructure for dealing with extremes the less vulnerable you are

2900307 sure honey you can do anything you want if you put your mind to it
2900308 im sorry to bother you dearling but my body seems to be trying to launch of my internal organs through my esophogus
2900309 the defense tonight was ridiculous i mean the guys were making plays all over the place and diving for balls and picking balls
2900310 especially in conditions like this with the wind blowing in
2900311 here it is hit it thats why you have nine guys out on the field who can make plays and some guys make spectacular plays and they did that for me
2900312 i just didnt play it good they took advantage of that one mistake that i made and really poured it on
2900313 we had a good idea he would pitch well in the rotation
2900314 we gave him the opportunity and he ran with it
2900315 were looking for a huge lift from him and so far weve gotten it
2900316 this is definitely not good news to see him leave the game maybe hell catch a break and well catch a break and its nothing more than a funny pitch that sent him a stinger
2900317 i told you about all this werent you listening to me
2900318 please reset cpu or memory frequency in the cmos setup
2900319 the new phonebooks are here the new phonebooks are here
2900320 if we get lost well just pull in somewheres and ask for directions
2900321 we control this region no matter what you may think and never ever forget it
2900322 russia has applied unprecedented military power and it is of such amplitude that it would have scared much bigger states
2900323 this war has changed the whole system of values of pro western liberal minded people i dont want to be a bad prophet but why would russia stop here there are other countries where russia thinks it has a claim to territory
2900324 it aint about how hard you hit its about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward how much you can
2900325 i think that as long as fair er trade ultimately leads to fair trade then it ia alright but if fair er trade is substituted for fair trade then there is a problem because there is still the element of exploitation in the process
2900326 despite differences in language culture and economic status people around the world are united in their fundamental need to connect discover and interact ebay fosters human connections through social commerce
2900327 despite differences in language culture and economic status people around the world are united in their fundamental need to connect discover and interact
2900328 this is a major disappointment at a time when food and fuel prices are high and the global economic outlook is uncertain the worlds poorest people are increasingly vulnerable a decent trade deal could have given them a chance to prevent worsening poverty
2900329 rich countries should have shown the political leadership to deliver trade reform that reduced poverty instead they defended vested interests and put poor countries under intense pressure to make concessions that have no place in a development round
2900330 this is another missed opportunity for trade reform that poor countries badly need and have been long promised it was brought about by rich countries failure to keep their word
2900331 it would be outrageous to blame poor countries for the failure to get a deal if the eu and us had made meaningful offers that lived up to their promises we might have seen progress instead they demanded harsh concessions from developing countries in exchange for largely illusory reforms and limited flexibilities

2900334 well see where they are tomorrow its still an evaluation stage were going to take a good look at this tape and see where we go with the quarterbacks
2900335 we were in much better position we put pressure on the quarterback all day long and those are good things
2900336 these guys are amazing and this is the best team ive ever seen together just like john force and amatos teams in their time
2900337 its unbelievable not only have we won a lot of races but weve won some of the most difficult races with so much pressure and for whatever reason i feel like i am driving my best right now
2900338 what are we going to do to get a good finish
2900339 i was happy we had a good car strategy got messed up there at the end
2900340 if the caution hadnt come out wed been sitting rosy
2900341 hopefully well break the record by a little more in the final
2900342 if i dont get on the night relay it would be kind of devastating but i believe in the coaches and if it doesnt work out that way hey ive always got 2012 and the olympics in london
2900343 coming back from injury his game may not be at the a level but he has the whole country to carry and that sometimes can be a little tiring
2900344 this game is very important for china because of the nba players on the u s team
2900345 i hear they have like three hundred million people here playing the game
2900346 we felt if we could win this battle we were doing something right a lot of people were paying attention to this game so we wanted to play it the right way
2900347 you see how global the game has become how much fans want us to be here and how much we want to be here
2900348 this game its like the best thing going in all the olympics
2900349 i think i was willing them into the hole at that stage
2900350 you have to get focused and give it a go
2900351 but i guess thats the way things go sometimes the only thing i can do is go back home with my head up high and keep working on it
2900352 lets try to keep this as positive as we can please
2900353 ive been a duke fan for the past forty some years and ive been waiting for someone since steve spurrier to come in and turn around this program
2900354 i went to their spring game and i liked what i saw i just like his enthusiasm and i like the way he has the kids involved in the community
2900355 ive been a season ticket holder for 25 years and ive suffered a little
2900356 when i heard he was coming i have been his biggest cheerleader
2900357 he wants to go to a bowl game and he can do that with his enthusiasm his coaching ability just the good person he is he can do that we can do it
2900358 you could bring in uscs football coach you could bring in floridas coach it doesnt matter who you bring in nobody would be bigger than coach k
2900359 the rivalry actually has been pretty good lately because both teams have been so bad
2900360 a successful football program is not just going to be about the players
2900361 its going to be about you and i we cant do it without you guys
2900362 to be a force to be reckoned with means a lot this year has just been phenomenal its just crazy
2900363 i cant believe we dont win a race in three or four weeks and were in a slump
2900364 i never could get the runs in the right spots
2900365 i needed to stay with him to be close enough to try to make a move in a braking zone we never could get close enough to get an opportunity
2900366 i hope i can give the wood brothers a shot in the arm that they need to really get the momentum to move forward
2900367 we talked about how the best thing we could do was try to play volleyball
2900368 well have to see if we played technique really really well
2900369 i think we flew around and had a lot of energy
2900370 the major thing is that this year i had to come back and prove i can be a guy we can go to big plays jump balls running after the catch
2900371 so far i have shown the coaches i can do that
2900372 if you dont feel that you played well as a unit typically youre not dominating people up front
2900373 as soon as lezak came off that last wall i started going crazy were a team we went in as a team and now were exiting as a team and were going out with that gold that we needed to get back
2900374 ive been on the last two relays where we come up short
2900375 to be honest with you i got really tired of losing
2900376 real bad joses an unbelievable guy his injury is not an easy one
2900377 china is very quick and athletic loves to get up and down and loves to penetrate and kick
2900378 thats their game theyre able to hit a lot of 3s off penetration and kicking the ball so for us its going to be really important to continue to apply pressure and contain them and keep them in front of us
2900379 china gets after it but thats what im conditioned to do get up and down
2900380 if anything thats when i think were at our peak
2900381 today i just did one set which is all i wanted to do normally i would do two sets i could have run faster after i warmed up on the first set so im very confident im where i was at in the nationals
2900382 its the perfect time to make mistakes to get the nerves out we have our world title from last year we feel like we are the world champions and we want to show the world that
2900383 i am totally surprised its some type of nerves i just have no explanation
2900384 both of us have hoped and prayed that when this day came we would be 1 and 2
2900385 whether it was her first or me first it didnt matter
2900386 obviously i was trying to win but thats it its not disappointing
2900387 hes such a talented player that its just a matter of time
2900388 we are ready to showcase our talent on the field this year
2900389 ill tell you what though a rough ride will beat a smooth walk any day
2900390 i think this year well be able to see for certain what williams can do this will be his true test and hell do just fine
2900391 whether its finesse whether its being a pounder or 4 yards and a cloud of dust whatever it takes getting the job done
2900392 as long as its productive and were winning games whatever it takes
2900393 i could have taken the line of the shot but that would have put me in the stands or i could have gone back to the tee i had to go in there and try to hit something i tried to hit a 3 wood and i didnt get it out
2900394 it was my first time in the last group in a major and i dont think it will be my last time
2900395 it was tough weather and it hurt to miss those par putts but im just proud of myself the way i hung tight
2900396 ive said it before there were times i didnt know if i was going to be playing anymore
2900397 i honestly didnt know there were some scary times too
2900398 those are all behind me now hopefully im just really really happy now
2900399 to be able to get back to the big leagues its special
2900400 its not about him playing right field and getting a hit today its just the matter of him getting back out getting back in the fray and i think thats going to in the long haul benefit him in a lot of different ways
2900401 when i post new things will my friends actually see them
2900402 have my friends posted something that im not seeing the news feed is cluttered right now with people i dont care about

2900442 i read a disturbing article in the ny times last friday about dan kaminskys talk at the black hat conference hes been beating the drum for a while now warning of what sounds like a serious security hole in domain name server software offering an open door to hackers of websites containing confidential information and into email which could allow phishing for usernames and passwords for otherwise protected sites the technorati seem to agree that hes identified a serious problem and it seems that not all affected parts of the internet infrastructure have applied patches or upgraded their software

2900446 there are more and more examples of how standard hacking techniques apply in healthcare with serious consequences recent issues include rfid hacking and interference issues recently a talk at blackhat regarding hacking medical devices including pacemakers has begun appearing in popular blogs what is most dangerous about this is not actually the hack itself but the fact that the hacks could become widespread think about it there is no real benefit to a hacker to simply kill a person it is a serious crime and unless there is something to gain by doing it it is unlikely to generate new interest with blackhat hackers
2900447 because i recently had rotator cuff surgery my output has declined and maybe it allowed me to sit back and think of the state e health telehealth today in the us sadly with some exceptions i am not impressed but in parts of the world we dont even compare why perhaps its lack of leadership or our e health telehealth leaders are risk adverse what may be lacking in my opinion is we dont have any e health telehealth statesmen
2900448 when secretary of health and human services mike leavitt announced here last month that our region had been selected as one of the four sites for medicares impending electronic health record demonstration project it was a huge coup for the local sponsor the pittsburgh regional health initiative and a reinforcement that pittsburgh is a national center of health care innovation

2900487 nasdaq omx delivered solid results during the quarter on the strength of our diversified business model
2900488 weve made excellent progress on the integration of omx and now expect this transaction to accrete in first quarter of 2009 significantly ahead of schedule driving this acceleration is our confidence in realizing the 100 million expense synergy target by the first anniversary of closing the deal and the integration of our most recent acquisition the philadelphia stock exchange is also well underway and is expected to accrete to our shareholders by the end of 2008 as always we will continue to follow our long standing operating philosophy of leveraging massive scale against the extreme efficiency of our core technology
2900489 when looking at our results on a pro forma non gaap basis we delivered strong net income growth both sequentially and year over year
2900490 our integration with omx is moving forward better than expected and the integration of phlx is well underway despite closing the transaction only two weeks ago these integrations coupled with the planned acquisitions of the boston stock exchange and certain assets of nord pool provide us with a platform to drive continued efficiencies and improved performance this year and well into 2009 and beyond

2900528 in the 14 days since we launched its been a rocky road and we know the pain some people have been suffering
2900529 a literary success without precedent in the field of portuguese ufological studies
2900530 fatima was a modern event yet it is already clouded with the distortions of belief
2900531 there have been many modern miracles of the fatima type but they rarely gain much attention outside of religious circles the flying saucers get much more publicity than the miracles
2900532 between the years 1937 and 1945 an entity who identified herself as the queen of the universe appeared more than 100 times to four young girls in the tiny hamlet of heede germany
2900533 on sunday june 18 1961 four young girls were playing marbles outside of the little village of garabandal spain when they suddenly saw an angel
2900534 soon after these initial experiences the girls began to go into trances termed a state of ecstasy by religionists during which they would see the lady
2900535 the lady was accompanied by two angels on this occasion the angels were dressed alike as if they were twins the lady had long thin hands a long angular face with a fine nose and lips which were a bit thin she seemed to be rather tall
2900536 the angels in all these cases sound suspiciously like our celebrated little men
2900537 the many messages conveyed by the lady have conformed precisely to catholic dogma using phrases and references which are significant to trained theologists but would be meaningless to children
2900538 on friday june 18 1965 conchita entered a trance and was purportedly given the following statements by the lady
2900539 as my message of the eighteenth of october has not been complied with and as it has not been made known to the world i am telling you that this is the last one
2900540 there is a wealth of evidence and testimony which leaves little doubt that these children of garabandal were being possessed by some outside influence and were undergoing a supernormal experience
2900541 the nation of the third eye there is no reason to think that the four children of garabandal
2900542 had ever seen or even knew about the eye symbol on the great seal of the united states ie
2900543 those mysterious men in black who travel around the world in unlicensed cadillacs have reportedly been seen wearing lapel pins bearing the symbol they have also identified themselves directly as being from the nation of the third eye so we call the symbol the third eye
2900544 why did the third eye appear beside the vision of garabandal was it a symbol of identification or was it a warning
2900545 eight young girls on the island of cabra in the philippines began to suffer visions in the early part of the year march 1968 and the feminine voice of the virgin promised a miracle
2900546 among the many correlations you will note that the month of march and april have often played an important part in these events just as march and april have always produced many of our principal ufo sightings

2900550 for the mystery of iniquity doth already work only he who now letteth will let until he be taken out of the way
2900551 they have healed also the hurt of the daughter of my people slightly saying peace peace when there is no peace
2900552 and god saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually
2900553 this generation shall not pass till all these things be fulfilled
2900554 i have set before thee an open door i e the pre tribulational rapture and no man can shut it for thou hast a little strength and hast kept my word and hast not denied my name
2900555 evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse deceiving and being deceived
2900556 now we beseech you brethren by the coming of our lord jesus christ and by our gathering together unto him
2900557 that ye be not soon shaken in mind or be troubled neither by spirit nor by word nor by letter as from us as that the day of christ is at hand
2900558 but beloved be not ignorant of this one thing that one day is with the lord as a thousand years and a thousand years as one day
2900559 let no man deceive you by any means for that day shall not come except there come a falling away first and that man of sin be revealed the son of perdition
2900560 behold he cometh with clouds and every eye shall see him
2900561 but i keep under my body and bring it into subjection lest that by any means when i have preached to others i myself should be a castaway
2900562 then said jesus again unto them i go my way and ye shall seek me and shall die in your sins whither i go ye cannot come
2900563 and he antichrist shall confirm the covenant with many for one week the 70th week of daniel and in the midst of the week 3 1 2 years or 1 260 days into the tribulation week he antichrist shall cause the sacrifice and the oblation to cease and for the overspreading of abominations he shall make it desolate even until the consummation and that determined shall be poured upon the desolate
2900564 who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called god or that is worshipped so that he as god sitteth in the temple of god shewing himself that he is god
2900565 here is wisdom let him that hath understanding count the number of the beast for it is the number of a man and his number is six hundred threescore and six
2900566 all manner of sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven unto men but the blasphemy against the holy ghost shall not be forgiven unto men
2900567 and they worshipped the dragon satan which gave power unto the beast the antichrist and they worshipped the beast saying who is like unto the beast who is able to make war with him and there was given unto him a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies and power was given unto him to continue forty and two months and he opened his mouth in blasphemy against god to blaspheme his name and his tabernacle and them that dwell in heaven
2900568 and the beast the antichrist was taken and with him the false prophet that wrought miracles before him with which he deceived them that had received the mark of the beast and them that worshipped his image these both were cast alive into a lake of fire burning with brimstone
2900569 remember ye not that when i was yet with you i told you these things
2900570 for precept must be upon precept precept upon precept line upon line line upon line here a little and there a little
2900571 and now ye know what withholdeth that he might be revealed in his time
2900572 you know what restrains him the antichrist now so that he the antichrist may be revealed in his time
2900573 yet thou shalt be brought down to hell to the sides of the pit they that see thee shall narrowly look upon thee and consider thee saying is this the man that made the earth to tremble that did shake kingdoms
2900574 and the beast antichrist was taken and with him the false prophet that wrought miracles before him with which he deceived them that had received the mark of the beast and them that worshipped his image these both were cast alive into a lake of fire burning with brimstone
2900575 for the mystery of iniquity doth already work only he who now letteth will let until he be taken out of the way
2900576 for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against powers against the rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places
2900577 i would have you wise unto that which is good and simple concerning evil
2900578 only he who now letteth will let until he be taken out of the way
2900579 only he the holy spirit who now restrains will continue to restrain until he the holy spirit be taken out of the way at the pre tribulational rapture
2900580 then was the secret revealed unto daniel in a night vision then daniel blessed the god of heaven daniel answered and said blessed be the name of god for ever and ever for wisdom and might are his and he changeth the times and the seasons he removeth kings and setteth up kings he giveth wisdom unto the wise and knowledge to them that know understanding he revealeth the deep and secret things he knoweth what is in the darkness and the light dwelleth with him i thank thee and praise thee o thou god of my fathers who hast given me wisdom and might and hast made known unto me now what we desired of thee for thou hast now made known unto us the kings matter
2900581 but ye are not in the flesh but in the spirit if so be that the spirit of god dwell in you now if any man have not the spirit of christ he is none of his
2900582 and grieve not the holy spirit of god whereby ye are sealed unto the day of redemption
2900583 and i give unto them eternal life and they shall never perish neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand
2900584 i said therefore unto you that ye shall die in your sins for if ye truly believe not as demonstrated by your life that i am he ye shall die in your sins
2900585 whosoever abideth in him sinneth not whosoever sinneth hath not seen him neither known him
2900586 for it is god which worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure
2900587 not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think any thing as of ourselves but our sufficiency is of god
2900588 if ye keep my commandments ye shall abide in my love even as i have kept my fathers commandments and abide in his love
2900589 and we are his witnesses of these things and so is also the holy ghost whom god hath given to them that obey him
2900590 ye are the salt of the earth but if the salt have lost his savour wherewith shall it be salted it is thenceforth good for nothing but to be cast out and to be trodden under foot of men ye are the light of the world a city that is set on an hill cannot be hid
2900591 until he the holy spirit be taken out of the way
2900592 for i am now ready to be offered and the time of my departure is at hand
2900593 and i jesus christ if i be lifted up from the earth will draw all men unto me
2900594 by faith enoch was translated that he should not see death and was not found because god had translated him for before his translation he had this testimony that he pleased god but without faith it is impossible to please him for he that cometh to god must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him
2900595 that be far from thee to do after this manner to slay the righteous with the wicked and that the righteous should be as the wicked that be far from thee shall not the judge of all the earth do right
2900596 i was delivered out of the mouth of the lion and the lord shall deliver me from every evil work and will preserve me unto his heavenly kingdom to whom be glory for ever and ever amen
2900597 for the time is come that judgment must begin at the house of god and if it first begin at us what shall the end be of them that obey not the gospel of god
2900598 for if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged
2900599 tribulation timeline part 1 part 2 part 3 and part 4
2900600 come out of her my people that ye be not partakers of her sins and that ye receive not of her plagues
2900601 then the magicians said unto pharaoh this is the finger of god and pharaohs heart was hardened and he hearkened not unto them as the lord had said
2900602 let both grow together until the harvest and in the time of harvest i will say to the reapers gather ye together first the tares the wicked and bind them in bundles to burn them but gather the wheat the nation born in a day at the second coming isaiah 66 8 into my barn
2900603 but in the fourth generation they shall come hither again for the iniquity of the amorites is not yet full
2900604 surely the wrath of man shall praise thee the remainder of wrath shalt thou restrain
2900605 who is like unto thee o lord among the gods who is like thee glorious in holiness fearful in praises doing wonders
2900606 and then shall that wicked be revealed whom the lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming
2900607 and i saw heaven opened and behold a white horse and he that sat upon him was called faithful and true and in righteousness he doth judge and make war his eyes were as a flame of fire and on his head were many crowns and he had a name written that no man knew but he himself and he was clothed with a vesture dipped in blood and his name is called the word of god and the armies which were in heaven followed him upon white horses clothed in fine linen white and clean and out of his mouth goeth a sharp sword that with it he should smite the nations and he shall rule them with a rod of iron and he treadeth the winepress of the fierceness and wrath of almighty god and he hath on his vesture and on his thigh a name written king of kings and lord of lords and i saw an angel standing in the sun and he cried with a loud voice saying to all the fowls that fly in the midst of heaven come and gather yourselves together unto the supper of the great god that ye may eat the flesh of kings and the flesh of captains and the flesh of mighty men and the flesh of horses and of them that sit on them and the flesh of all men both free and bond both small and great and i saw the beast the antichrist and the kings of the earth and their armies gathered together to make war against him that sat on the horse and against his army and the beast the antichrist was taken and with him the false prophet that wrought miracles before him with which he deceived them that had received the mark of the beast and them that worshipped his image these both were cast alive into a lake of fire burning with brimstone and the remnant were slain with the sword of him that sat upon the horse which sword proceeded out of his mouth and all the fowls were filled with their flesh
2900608 even him whose coming is after the working of satan with all power and signs and lying wonders
2900609 put on the whole armour of god that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil
2900610 yet michael the archangel when contending with the devil he disputed about the body of moses durst not bring against him a railing accusation but said the lord rebuke thee
2900611 whom resist stedfast in the faith knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world
2900612 and he the second beast out of the earth or the false prophet exerciseth all the power of the first beast the antichrist before him and causeth the earth and them which dwell therein to worship the first beast whose deadly wound was healed
2900613 and with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish because they received not the love of the truth that they might be saved
2900614 but the wisdom that is from above is first pure then peaceable gentle and easy to be entreated full of mercy and good fruits without partiality and without hypocrisy
2900615 and for this cause god shall send them strong delusion that they should believe a lie
2900616 for many deceivers are entered into the world who confess not that jesus christ is come in the flesh this is a deceiver and an antichrist
2900617 that they all might be damned who believed not the truth but had pleasure in unrighteousness
2900618 behold i will cast her into a bed and them that commit adultery with her into great tribulation except they repent of their deeds
2900619 and hereby we do know that we know him if we keep his commandments he that saith i know him and keepeth not his commandments is a liar and the truth is not in him
2900620 and he that keepeth his commandments dwelleth in him and he in him and hereby we know that he abideth in us by the spirit which he hath given us
2900621 who hath heard such a thing who hath seen such things shall the earth be made to bring forth in one day or shall a nation be born at once for as soon as zion travailed she brought forth her children
2900622 and laban said unto him jacob i pray thee if i have found favour in thine eyes tarry for i have learned by experience that the lord hath blessed me for thy sake
2900623 whosoever shall fall upon that stone jesus christ shall be broken saved but on whomsoever it shall fall the second coming it will grind him judge him to powder in the lake of fire
2900624 because thou hast kept the word of my patience i also will keep thee from the hour of temptation which shall come upon all the world to try them that dwell upon the earth
2900625 the lord knoweth how to deliver the godly out of temptations and to reserve the unjust unto the day of judgment to be punished
2900626 for ye shall not go out with haste nor go by flight for the lord will go before you and the god of israel will be your rereward literally rear guard
2900627 watch ye therefore and pray always that ye may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass and to stand before the son of man
2900628 whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust
2900629 for we dare not make ourselves of the number or compare ourselves with some that commend themselves but they measuring themselves by themselves and comparing themselves among themselves are not wise
2900630 now i beseech you brethren by the name of our lord jesus christ that ye all speak the same thing and that there be no divisions among you but that ye be perfectly joined together in the same mind and in the same judgment
2900631 and the eye cannot say unto the hand i have no need of thee nor again the head to the feet i have no need of you
2900632 whose fan is in his hand and he will throughly purge his floor and gather his wheat into the garner but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire
2900633 all these things that shall come to pass and to stand before the son of man
2900634 for the lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the archangel and with the trump of god and the dead in christ shall rise first then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the lord
2900635 and he antichrist shall confirm the covenant with many for one week the 70th week which equals 7 years and in the midst of the week 1 260 days into the tribulation he shall cause the sacrifice and the oblation to cease and for the overspreading of abominations he shall make it desolate even until the consummation and that determined shall be poured upon the desolate
2900636 the lord knoweth how to deliver the godly out of temptations and to reserve the unjust unto the day of judgment to be punished
2900637 but every man in his own order christ the firstfruits afterward they that are christs at his coming
2900638 why call ye me lord lord and do not the things which i say
2900639 follow peace with all men and holiness without which no man shall see the lord
2900640 father i have sinned against heaven and in thy sight and am no more worthy to be called thy son
2900641 if it be so our god whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace and he will deliver us out of thine hand o king but if not be it known unto thee o king that we will not serve thy gods nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up
2900642 they a total of 8 nations including russia and china will bomb the nuclear warehouses of america
2900643 the lord knoweth how to deliver the godly out of temptations and to reserve the unjust unto the day of judgment to be punished
2900644 i was delivered out of the mouth of the lion and the lord shall deliver me from every evil work and will preserve me unto his heavenly kingdom to whom be glory for ever and ever amen
2900645 and thine ears shall hear a word behind thee saying this is the way walk ye in it when ye turn to the right hand and when ye turn to the left
2900646 open thou mine eyes that i may behold wondrous things out of thy law
2900647 o send out thy light and thy truth let them lead me let them bring me unto thy holy hill and to thy tabernacles
2900648 raptures pre and mid trib finally what ive felt is articulated
2900649 the government has its centrepiece building wa a package of infrastructure projects with such long lead times that many wont come to fruition until its time to vote again in another four years when victoria park mla ben wyatt is premier
2900650 i was elected by a strong majority of 63 percent
2900651 ive received the endorsements of the county firefighters sheriff david gee the police union public defender julie holt the labor unions all the groups im aware of have endorsed me and also the vast majority of the county bar presidents twenty past bar presidents have endorsed me
2900652 i believe i have the superior skills in terms of time management effective use of court time control of the court setting and decisiveness when it comes to ruling
2900653 those are skills that ive developed over the past 13 years as a sole practitioner running not only the business end of my practice but every aspect of the clients case because i do not have associates or paralegals
2900654 i have the judicial experience the education and career background to serve in this position and the wisdom to do the job based on that experience
2900655 i would judge each case on a case by case basis treating everyone fairly and i would always abide by what the law is
2900656 the only judicial candidate in all these races thats board certified
2900657 ive also been part of the management of the public defenders office for many years and dealt with other agencies in the justice system who solve problems that we experience in the court system
2900658 i do believe in the system and i certainly believe in the administration of justice
2900659 i believe my experience makes me qualified i feel like i can make a significant difference in the system
2900660 triple the experience in the courtroom and i have the leadership skills to handle not only dockets but the variety of cases and issues that would be presented in a big courtroom setting as a result of my prior litigation experience and my leadership
2900661 i think that in a nutshell i have a broad base of support not only from the legal community but the support of sheriff gee as well as several of the city and county firefighters and the union that i think is indicative of their confidence in my ability to serve objectively and fairly
2900662 i think that i am exceptionally qualified for the bench i think between the two of us i bring a good perspective and a good balance between my life experience and my legal experience that will allow me to be immediately effective in a number of areas
2900663 i believe that if you have a major felony conviction whether its cocaine trafficking or mortgage fraud you should not be in a position of trust such as a mortgage broker would have with access to personal financial data and with opportunity to steal from people
2900664 it seems me that there should be a period of time after which you come out of prison that youre not given the right to have a license in professions that have that type of quality
2900665 what this investigation did to us good guys the white hat wearing brokers is that it devalued our license
2900666 there needs to be an iron wall between the consumer and a felon in dealing with mortgages
2900667 the debt for a persons wrongs can be paid in full people can be forgiven by their creator
2900668 he arranged nearly 3 million in fraudulent loans and fleeced 30 people many of them elderly and disabled
2900669 the key to this is proper hiring techniques and doing proper background investigations
2900670 to me the focus should be on the people in charge
2900671 in this case the focus does need to be on people who have been convicted of financial related crimes
2900672 just like you dont want to give firearms authority back to someone who has committed armed robbery
2900673 then we need to give people that second chance otherwise we might be forcing them back into a life of crime and thats not what we want to do we believe in rehabilitation
2900674 if that means we purge all white collar criminals from our ranks great if it means removing all criminals thats probably better but what we have to have is swift action we have to reinstate trust in the profession
2900675 i would generally support the attorney general on this for consumer protection
2900676 but there may be unintended consequences its a bit of a broad brush there are many felonies that had nothing to do with fraud that give you no reason to think theyd be involved in mortgage fraud
2900677 you might be preventing someone from rehabilitating themselves and getting their lives back on track
2900678 he saw this as an opening since its a hot political topic
2900679 its an emotional appeal not a logical one we know that nationwide the majority of people that created the foreclosure crisis are not people previously convicted of a crime this is simply a drop in the bucket of the larger problem of foreclosures
2900680 but i certainly would not have raised this but for the fact that it has direct bearing on the issue at hand im interested in the safety and security of the people of florida thats what they elected me to do i would be very remiss if i didnt do this
2900681 we want to win it but we know we are facing an uphill battle
2900682 it has been parti keadilan rakyats seat for several terms
2900683 what is more important is that members focus on our target whether to capture the seat or just to decrease the opponents majority
2900684 it should not be tied to anything that might have an effect on party elections
2900685 i dont think the party leadership will put someone who has no credibility or is unqualified we surely will put up the best candidate but it is up to the voters to choose
2900686 i have given a warning and have been vocal about it
2900687 i do not want to put the blame on anybody but it should be taken seriously
2900688 overall our results sustain our faith in our strategy to build organic growth to widen the product and service offering to our customers and to pursue complementary acquisitions
2900689 the professional division showed growth in software sales consulting and maintenance revenue
2900690 this reflects our growth in market share and continued rollout of products to existing customers strengthening our position as a provider of choice for top accounting firms
2900691 the test of the athlete revealed that she had tested positive for epo
2900692 moreno left china the evening of the test before she knew of the results
2900693 her accreditation has been cancelled and withdrawn by the ioc we have asked the sports governing body the international cycling union uci to follow it up as any disciplinary measures will be complete after the games finish
2900694 rugby leagues given me so many great things and this club has as well
2900695 there might be an opportunity out there to make a bit more money but i think i owe the club and game plenty
2900696 im not thinking about 300 games or breaking any records im always thinking about my next game and thats all im focussed on
2900697 if i happen to pass those sort of records then thats great and ill look back one day when i do hang the boots up and be happy with that achievement
2900698 i think the georgian issue is helping the market to focus back on the supply side that has really changed the market quite a bit
2900699 the task of the russian forces at present is to ensure control of south ossetia the pipelines would be in danger only if the war escalated
2900700 i didnt go in planning to break the world record im very excited it was a great swim she said
2900701 its kind of weird because when you are little you dream of being famous its weird to become that person you dont expect it to happen to you
2900702 gori is being bombed massively from the air and from artillery as well
2900703 are not there yet but it looks like they are getting ready for it
2900704 georgia expresses its readiness to immediately start negotiations with the russian federation on a ceasefire and termination of hostilities
2900705 in certain zones near tskhinvali russian peacekeepers met active confrontation
2900706 i expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn bombing outside of south ossetia
2900707 we must find the means for an immediate ceasefire accepted by both sides we must talk about negotiations and a political solution there is no military solution
2900708 they were on a mass scale and were directed against individuals
2900709 hes got enormous courage browny to get out there but hes got a lot of things that hes coping with
2900710 anyone who goes to training knows he just cant get out there wednesdays so hes barely getting out there from week to week
2900711 its very difficult when you do that because you de train a little bit just playing weekends and getting up for the following weekend it makes it very tough to play anywhere near the level you are capable of
2900712 hell play all the games by the look of it
2900713 i sort of feel like from fourth to 12th you cant say that fourth is a better team than 12th
2900714 but someone will finish fourth and fifth and sixth because theyve won more games than the team that finishes 12th and its probably going to be a handful of games
2900715 i believe we have the capabilities to play finals and we have to win the last three to do that and thats a big percentage ask
2900716 the kangaroos have won their last five and we had every chance of beating kangaroos if we played a better last few minutes
2900717 its a matter of which game you take so on that basis i think weve got the same capabilities as the teams that are in and around the top eight
2900718 the circumstances of your offending brings into sharp focus the need to protect public health judge lacava said
2900719 you knew you were hiv positive and you did not tell the woman of that fact
2900720 fortunately you did not infect the woman with the hiv virus but you could have and you knew you could have
2900721 we think we are tighter and lighter but we also have other services we differentiate with the ability to do live and we have a business unit for the live streaming business
2900722 i have a beautiful sailboat in my barn it will not be wet this year or next
2900723 angel tours and iguana currently operate vehicles in a mechanically unsafe operating condition which if operated would pose an imminent hazard to the public
2900724 we dont know the answer to that question thats why were here
2900725 isaac didnt read music but you couldnt believe a guy could sit at a piano and come up with the sounds he did
2900726 when people talk about the memphis sound that was isaac
2900727 they said shaft was a relentless character and it had to denote some kind of action or drama
2900728 i asked her as details on the verification have yet to be decided can i take it that the delisting wont happen today
2900729 this dialogue is aimed at coming up with concrete ways or looking into how to find and return the survivors
2900730 im sure all of our guys are having a rough time with it
2900731 it was just a tremendous explosion and blew all the windows out of the house just blew the house up and i just managed to get out of there in time
2900732 at present we do not know anything about how the explosions occurred and we are waiting to learn about its cause
2900733 we werent even advised that they were going to be there
2900734 they just moved in and weve been concerned since they were there that something like this would happen
2900735 this stupid stupid girl is trashing a beloved well respected lady
2900736 we have sought for some time to expand our scope beyond hospitality applications and sas with a corporate culture remarkably similar to ours will provide ideas with the resources to stretch its wings
2900737 in many companies and industries pricing remains relatively static with relatively infrequent changes
2900738 while it may make sense to increase prices during periods of very high demand it may also make sense for prices to be much lower when demand is lower
2900739 hey you sucked but you sucked a little less by the end of the season
2900740 this stupid stupid girl is trashing a beloved well respected lady

2900749 anyone with half an eye on houston sports news knows that this just went down last week as ron artest brought his 20 points per game to join yaos 22 and tracy mcgradys 22 and try to bring life to the successful but stagnant rockets
2900750 but it wasnt this week it was 30 years ago
2900751 it was the biggest one year improvement in rockets team history
2900752 it will only get worse as the by election nears however in the end i believe the voters will not be swayed and will throw their support behind me
2900753 kein staat hat das recht das staatsgebiet eines anderen staates mit milit rischen mitteln zu verletzen nur weil einige b rger dort p sse des intervenierenden staates besitzen
2900754 jedes mal wenn sich in europa ein staat dieses recht herausgenommen hat f hrte das zu einem krieg und wir haben die pflicht uns daran zu erinnern wie sich adolf hitler vor etwas mehr als einem halben jahrhundert dieses recht herausgenommen hat um weite teile mitteleuropas anzugreifen
2900755 alle beteiligten m ssen jetzt eine friedliche l sung anstreben
2900756 die bundesregierung wird versuchen dies auf diplomatischem weg zu unterst tzen vor allem sind jetzt aber die konfliktparteien gefordert wir brauchen so schnell wie m glich einen waffenstillstand
2900757 the real make up of an athlete and their muscle and power
2900758 its something that will increase what we do for the public and serve them much better many younger people believe they can do a text message today to 911 and they cannot
2900759 in this era where everybody is texting it is very imperative that we accommodate the way people communicate
2900760 if you give them a lot of data you have to give them a way to digest it all
2900761 and for gods sake wash your ass smells like youre smuggling a stockyard back there
2900762 but in recent years notebooks have matched most desktops and its becoming much easier to find a desktop replacement from every major vendor that easily outpaces all but the more advanced towers just three years ago the concept of a desktop replacement was a pipe dream back then the super hot components running desktops were incapable of running in notebooks while the industry was failing to address battery issues that plagued them and made them less than ideal desktop replacements but with the availability of intels core duo and core 2 duo chips all that changed power conservation became a key element in the newest generation of processor technology and that shrank the difference between desktop and laptop processors now the key differentiator between laptops and desktops is the number of cores and for most uses that doesnt have a big impact on performance unless more software is made that leverages multiple processing cores desktops will lose the major advantage they have relied upon to stay relevant
2900763 but i do believe the audio book market without d r m is going to be the future
2900764 there is too much stuff out there and if you dont engage your brain you wont get results
2900765 guilty of improper exercise of judicial functions the cumulative effect of which was to lower the dignity of his office and undermine the confidence of the public in the administration of justice
2900766 indeed justice ramaswami had made it clear to the chief justice that he did not recognise any such jurisdiction in any body or authority
2900767 supreme court is filled with fera violators amp bride burners
2900768 air 1988 sc 1208 when chief justice of india justice e s venkataramaiaha admits that
2900769 in every high court there are 3 4 judges who are out every evening to party in foreign embassiies or at advocates places drink dine
2900770 if theres government assistance it will be better for us as we can sell more hybrid cars
2900771 its my pleasure to share this important moment with all of you
2900772 there has been a lot of talk about the air quality in china heres how bad it is they say that if snoop dogg were to roll down the windows of his limo in beijing smoke would actually pour into the limousine
2900773 i had warned the bar council not to proceed with the open forum but they chose to ignore my warning what is it that they want to conclude from such a forum
2900774 this things going to crest a half a billion soon
2900775 it helps out a lot because moving up to the nfl you have a lot of doubts about what you can and cant do
2900776 having that opportunity to go out there and make some plays was big for me
2900777 his first five touches he looked faster then everybody else on the field and thats what we thought we got you cant bounce the ball too much in this league or youre going to lose some ground especially there at the end of the game
2900778 i think it was a good start for him hes got more speed than anyone else
2900779 i think thats what the whole stable of running backs offer we can all go in there and hold our own
2900780 hes more of a scat back type guy but he showed hes able to carry some of the load take some hits and keep us on the field thats what coach stresses protect the ball he told me to remind steve to hold on to the ball and stay inbounds keep the clock going
2900781 i didnt know what it was going to be like and then it went and got a little easier from there
2900782 he knows that we need him im sure his interests are conflicted but hell be back when hes ready as soon as he can be back hell be back
2900783 i cant say absolutely that mccutcheons absence didnt affect players
2900784 our main goal here is to take a medal in this olympics and no one understands that more than hugh
2900785 he stressed it for a long time thats all we talk about almost every day in practice
2900786 how about that for four days of swinging the bat getting pitching and playing good defense
2900787 when youre in a hole the first thing you shoot for is to get to the break even point and see what you can do after that
2900788 youre certainly not going to make the playoffs especially in this division under 500 when we get to 500 who knows
2900789 he threw me an off speed slider and i hit it in the right spot and it went over
2900790 that gave us a good cushion when you can give your starting pitcher that kind of cushion its good for everybody in the dugout
2900791 you cant replace carlos obviously and its just a good example of guys stepping up
2900792 obviously its good to hit a home run and its certainly perplexing when you go long periods without hitting a home run
2900793 you can run into one on accident and hit it out of the ballpark another unexplainable phenomenon thats frustrating and perplexing
2900794 i concentrated on my location i didnt have it in chicago on tuesday and today it was good
2900795 i told wandy when he came out you need to come over and thank that guy because that guy saved you alot of runs today
2900796 whenever you get off to a good start like that in a game it certainly helps your starting pitcher
2900797 it doesnt look severe it looks like were pretty fortunate
2900798 i kind of see him like andre johnson coming off that groin injury a week ago if we were in the season wed push it harder and try to get him back quicker
2900799 right now well be smart about it well list him as day to day
2900800 after what weve been through last season and how important he is to the team and how good of a camp hes had to have that happen on a play where you dont even get touched its kind of deflating in a way but we know were going to get him back and so weve got to just stay positive and get these young players ready
2900801 were running the same plays but some of the cuts and reads are different some of the guys are still getting used to that
2900802 chris taylor needs to get better in pass protection slaton 11 carries for 37 yards and four kickoffs for 97 yards showed why hes here hes got the speed hes faster than anybody out there hes got a chance to make some big plays
2900803 all three of those guys taylor walker and slaton have to become complete players they have to protect the quarterback better theyre going to get a ton of reps with ahman missing some time
2900804 we went on that field and we were preaching running the ball better
2900805 our team expects that the thing i liked about the game was the mentality at the end we were able to run the ball even though that was a lot of our backup players fighting for a spot out there thats the way you want to be able to do things i think it was a step in the right direction do we have a long way to go you bet
2900806 i thought im good im going to make it to the final so i slowed my tem po down a little bit
2900807 i wasnt expecting it i didnt go in plan ning to break the world record i swim really well when im feeling happy and my life is balanced also with my parents and boyfriend in the crowd
2900808 the 100 back has been the biggest progressing event in my opinion i ex pected that
2900809 its exactly where i wanted to be going into the finals im happy with that i just need to recover and focus on my final
2900810 i talked to vera prior to this performance and she taught me what to say to nastia
2900811 nastia had a little mistake on our third dive and i had to give her a little boost
2900812 i said were not going to lose it like that
2900813 but ive worked really hard for these olympics and i hope god rewards me for that were all working hard here everybody wants the gold whoever is the luckiest and strongest mentally that day is going to win
2900814 its going to be a tough competition but whatever happens happens for a reason ill be happy with any outcome since i already have a medal it doesnt matter im going to enjoy my silver medal its like gold to me trust me
2900815 some guy came up to me and said georgia is no
2900816 i said where are we he said i didnt notice so i figured we werent up there very high
2900817 this is the first time weve been considered the underdog in the big 12 south in a while
2900818 it sounds like some people dont think were going to win the conference some people dont think were going to be a top 10 team
2900819 only at texas can you be under the radar but be ranked 10th in the country
2900820 people have us losing a lot of games or a lot more than we are probably used to
2900821 we feed off it a lot of people feel like were not even going to win 10 games we use that as a motivational tool and inspiration to work even harder
2900822 we have not stopped the pass for two years consistently
2900823 and when you start looking at the quarterbacks across this league and their ability to throw the ball you better be able to stop the pass
2900824 we want to win more than 10 games this year
2900825 weve won 10 games the last couple of years and we need to win more than 10 this year
2900826 not that hes not a good player but i dont think thats someone were interested in
2900827 weve had some preliminary conversations via e mail with scouts to get their thoughts on who might be available at this point in time and see what fits for us
2900828 because of my travel schedule i havent had a chance to talk to cooper about where we are in the next couple of days well have a chance to have that dialogue
2900829 in the meantime getting reggie abercrombie up there gives us depth off the bench and its great to have a guy like darin erstad with our club that can play left field for us
2900830 if hell play for the minimum salary which borris has said bonds would do i would certainly take a flier on that
2900831 anyone with half an eye on houston sports news knows that this just went down last week as ron artest brought his 20 points per game to join yaos 22 and tracy mcgradys 22 and try to bring life to the successful but stagnant rockets
2900832 but it wasnt this week it was 30 years ago
2900833 it was the biggest one year improvement in rockets team history
2900834 you are the last you are the last of the sacrifices
2900835 that got them right back in the game and its something jones has had a problem with
2900836 hes got to protect the ball hes trying to do too much
2900837 at some point when you cant get to the edge you have to stick your foot in the ground and get 4 or 5 yards and let the offense come on the field if you reverse your field and lose ground thats not something we teach thats him trying to make a play but the bottom line is hes still swinging the ball
2900838 he brown was always on his feet he was very athletic he had no problems assignment wise
2900839 one of the things that really jumped out at me when i watched the game on tape was his enthusiasm to play the game he just loves to play hes handling everything well
2900840 we dont have any fourth and 20 plays for matt its unfortunate that he came up about 6 inches short of a first down
2900841 we played extremely well in the red zone and we found a way to get turnovers
2900842 when you do that you have a chance to win every week
2900843 the guy that flashed at me was defensive end n d kalu
2900844 n d has got a knee thats bothered him and a body thats beat up through years of service but i saw a guy who was hungry to help this team play
2900845 he stepped out and played with a tremendous amount of effort
2900846 like anything you use for the first time were going to get better at it
2900847 when the system shut off we went back to hand signals
2900848 its not a big adjustment its easier when you dont have to look to the sideline to get the call i can just stand there and listen
2900849 but were always going to take our hand signals into every game because you never know when its going to shut down
2900850 i took my first hit and it kind of shocked me
2900851 i had to shake it off and then was like ok now im back playing football
2900852 i have been hard on him he hasnt had a lot of reps he knows this is kind of a really important cap on his career and with a few reps he went in there and led the team i was impressed with him
2900853 kite masih mude la makan jela pape yg kte boleh kalu dah 30 an nnti time tu kne makan high fiber biskut and so on
2900854 dont ask what the country give to u but pls ask yourself what u contribute to the nation

2901078 i saw that the city hospital was completed destroyed and around it lay corpses and injured people a lot of them and the injured lay there dying for three days because no one could get to them
2901079 where were the russian troops for the first three days now they say on television that russia defended us they saved south ossetia but thats rubbish
2901080 russian tanks only came this morning when we had already pushed the georgian forces out of tskhinvali we did it ossetians ourselves at the cost of many lives and russia came only at the end to take up positions that we had already won and now im lying here and my friends go on dying there
2901081 ossetian patriots first let us cleanse our markets of georgian spies then forward to liberate the homeland
2901082 we are sending men who have done military service so teenage lads dont go to die
2901083 in tskhinvali you cant find one brick standing on top of another the city is still disputed there are georgian strong points on the hills surrounding it im going back to fight tonight ive got my own team of guys
2901084 my cousin came from dmenis village last night he got two bullets in the back were going to go there and slaughter the georgians like the fascist pigs they are if the russians let us well smash them all the way to tbilisi we are a warrior race we know how to fight

2901090 empower pet owners to make optimal healthcare decisions for their pets
2901091 i recommend vpi pet insurance to every new pet owner who comes through our hospital
2901092 i also point out the importance of getting health insurance for pets while theyre young

2901094 but what choice do i have my pets are part of the family too

2901097 it is my idea to go back to france to visit the scene of the accident it will be emotional but we are really looking forward to the trip it will give me a bit of closure as well as a bit of relaxation nice food and fine wine
2901098 last year it was marks birthday when it happened and we never got to celebrate it hes 36 this time and hopefully this year we can celebrate properly and make it extra special

2901100 im booked in to give an assembly at lever house primary school in leyland to speak to the children about how im still the same person as before just sitting down
2901101 while it is instructive informative and indeed fun to study such subjects as the carnivals in the french revolution the image of the virgin mary in the middle ages or the role of the doughnut in the canadian psyche we ought not to forget the aspect of history which the great nineteenth century german historian leopold von ranke summed up as what really happened

2901119 weve got three backs down right now but ive just gotta concentrate and pick up the slack
2901120 i was just thinking about keeping my feet moving and just trying to be tough and try to impress these coaches out here cause ive got a lot to prove

2901123 the right to be let alone is indeed the beginning of all freedom
2901124 it was against a background poignant with memories of evil procedures that our constitution was drawn
2901125 as nightfall does not come at once neither does oppression in both instances there is a twilight when everything remains seemingly unchanged and it is in such twilight that we must be most aware of change in the air however slight lest we become unwitting victims of the darkness
2901126 an arrest is not justified by what the subsequent search discloses
2901127 the framers of the constitution knew human nature as well as we do they had lived in dangerous days they knew the suffocating influence of orthodoxy and standardized thought they weighed the compulsions for restrained speech and thought against the abuses of liberty they chose liberty
2901128 those who won our independence believed liberty to be the secret of happiness and courage to be the secret of liberty
2901129 restriction of free thought and free speech is the most dangerous of all subversions it is the one un american act that could most easily defeat us
2901130 what a man thinks is of no concern to government
2901131 a requirement that literature or act conform to some norm prescribed by an official smacks of an ideology foreign to our system
2901132 words uttered under coercion are proof of loyalty to nothing but self interest
2901133 when a man knows how to live dangerously he is not afraid to die when he is not afraid to die he is strangely free to live

2901137 i you have a little ballerina living in your home shes going to love this
2901138 to complete their review of the program before moving ahead with legislation
2901139 i am concerned that some of the procedural requirements included in the bill may limit the programs effectiveness
2901140 too soon to consider legislation until the oversight subcommittee can answer critical questions about the program
2901141 the work with the cougar revealed that this could be at the state scale i think that was an exciting breakthrough
2901142 you should understand something your security is based on the state of our relationship
2901143 the revelation if true lends enormous credence to what was generally talked about in pakistans streets about the likely killers of benazir bhutto it also lends significance to the last e mail she had sent to her lobbyist in the united states pointing out dangers to her life and indicating who she suspected could be involved if something happened to her
2901144 in the final analysis nothing remains secret and it is a law of nature to expose killers tyrants and brigands in ways one cannot even comprehend
2901145 this exhibition represents the museums interest in ideas that connect the arts and artists to contemporary thinking and points of view
2901146 exploring these provocative ideas creates an opportunity for interdisciplinary discourse

2901155 if she is admitted to enter cuba aguero will be back to beijing to play for the quarter finals
2901156 as we plan to see her coming back to beijing soon there will be no substitute to make up for her absence they the players will remain 11
2901157 first of all is the sorrow of the girl all the other considerations come after her decision to go to cuba to be with her 61 year old mother her absence in the first games of the olympic tournament is one more obstacle for us but this is a team used to overcoming adversity gritting their teeth and going forward anyway i am confident the team will do it this time as well
2901158 i lost my voice and i was definitely pretty emotional out there
2901159 ive been on the last two relays where we come up short
2901160 to be honest with you i got really tired of losing i finished real strong
2901161 as soon as lezak came off that last wall i started going crazy were a team we went in as a team and now were exiting as a team and were going out with that gold that we needed to get back
2901162 if it means anything it should be pretty funny the reviews have all pointed out how it accentuates the comedy and its also only about 90 minutes
2901163 for foreign funds equity is definitely no longer the preferred asset class
2901164 they are quite wary of it and indian ipos do not fit their strategy now
2901165 we have decided we will march to muzaffarabad with fruit trucks tomorrow
2901166 i dont think there is anything wrong in it if they want to take their trucks to muzafarabad we are supporting them
2901167 i hope it will not be done and it should not be allowed they should not take that route its wrong for them and us also
2901168 you pour water into a glass and it becomes the glass
2901169 the major western auction houses have built their record russian art sales by largely selling works of artists that fled the country and created large bodies of work in the west a rare opportunity exists as many of the artists who produced the highest quality works and are most revered in their own homeland never left russia these artists often have major works available at a lesser price even though many have more museum placements than those who fled the price of these artists work will see substantial growth as it equalizes with works of similar quality selling in the west following the lead of astute western investors and collectors together with the new russian billionaires who are acquiring such russian artwork in volume informed investors now have the opportunity to scoop up museum quality works before the full awareness of these artists importance raises prices

2901178 why wont america and nato help us if they wont help us now why did we help them in iraq
2901179 the world realy is drawing lines here should the us support thier key ally or do we ignore them and how would that make the us look i doubt that it would make more countries pro us so if we leave our allies out to dry who will come to our aid
2901180 it is perhaps still too early to conclude that ppi growth has peaked
2901181 the sharp acceleration in producer price inflation seen in recent months is a concern to policymakers as this poses a strong upside risk to cpi consumer price index growth
2901182 in the next few months the authorities will likely further tighten monetary policy and impose price curbs to deal with this inflation risk
2901183 i was in the right place in the right time
2901184 with my husband screaming call 911 call 911 i picked my daughter up miraculously hoisting her over my very large nine month pregnant belly and performed the heimlich maneuver on her
2901185 color quickly came back to her face and her blue lips returned to their normal shade of pink
2901186 there is nothing scarier than watching a loved one in an emergency situation but also nothing more rewarding than helping them with a little medical know how and training
2901187 but we would discuss the value of giving someone a chance
2901188 i knew he was gone long before they called it
2901189 but it does help to know that you were educated and did the best you could
2901190 when i go around and give talks it seems like people dont really understand their risk of being the victim of insider sabotage
2901191 if you have it then it can happen to you
2901192 when these things happen it forces us to focus on it
2901193 im sure were all looking at this in disbelief and everybody is going to go back and visit their layers of security
2901194 its rare to have a shutdown of this magnitude in a big city
2901195 this is the type of failure that would only be caused by a major problem a major disaster or something like it
2901196 he wanted to look like a hero but unfortunately he was arrested
2901197 it was like we had control of the house but we were unsure of which rooms he had access to
2901198 we didnt know to what extent he had access or if there were potential vulnerabilities in the system
2901199 its sort of pretty shocking that they didnt have any decent oversight of their own network
2901200 forget whether this guy was planning any bad actions what happens if he has a heart attack and they need to access the system thats just crazily bad management but its not uncommon management
2901201 they will never be able to get back in amongst the people in iraq where they have to live and operate in order to be able to be successful
2901202 having lost that support in iraq i think theyre looking where else can they be effective
2901203 any additional force that is sent to afghanistan must come as a result of a reduction in iraq
2901204 many al qaeda leaders are leaving iraq now because they no longer have many places left to hide
2901205 there is no question that the absence of pressure on the pakistani side of the border is creating an opportunity for more people to cross the border and to launch attacks
2901206 they provide money training and strategic propaganda value to the fight
2901207 the whole issue was created by separatist leaders who would like to stop the hindu pilgrimage the real motive is a complete islamisation of the valley after having successfully forced kashmiri hindus to leave the valley
2901208 this is not a struggle merely for 100 acres of land this is the struggle for the identity of our motherland
2901209 then somebody wants to psychoanalyze you stretch you out on the couch go into the differences that might exist
2901210 all i know is i am very proud of the relationships he has established with different leaders
2901211 its also russian prime minister vladimir putin he gets criticized for that but i think its smart and wise and right that he has pleasant relationships with people and that they trust him i think hes developing that with french president nicolas sarkozy i know its there with putin
2901212 it doesnt mean you approve of what putin is doing or his denial of human rights in russia thats the thing that gets me about some of these critics they think if you establish a personal relationship that youre then signing off on everything that person does and thats not right
2901213 and i tell people one reason why was not only did he know what he was doing he was a fabulous father
2901214 theres a huge window thats open and i do believe theyve got to close that
2901215 the new security proposals must be workable and should strike the right balance between the need for security and for mobility
2901216 weve worked very closely with industry to garner as much input with respect to what is operationally feasible
2901217 provide a standard of security for a community that doesnt have one right now
2901218 i said wait a minute the community doesnt even know anything about it
2901219 we were sold down the river before anybody even knew what this thing was
2901220 it appears that the undersecretary responsible for this program may have corrupted the site selection process by putting his thumb on the scale in favor of a particular site and its contractor in violation of his own rules and over the objections of his own advisers
2901221 the risk reward ratio is something that needs to be discussed in more detail
2901222 i was very firm with vladimir putin in beijing on friday he and i have got a good relationship just as i was firm with the russian president
2901223 right now our focus is on working with both sides with the europeans and with a whole variety of international institutions and organizations to get the fighting to stop
2901224 that a democratically elected president of georgia and i quote must go
2901225 is your governments objective regime change in georgia the overthrow of the democratically elected government of georgia
2901226 kita lihat saja calon calon presiden yang diajukan partai partai besar umumnya orang orang lama yang gagal dalam memimpin kita sudah tahulah manuver manuvernya
2901227 there certainly is a level of isi complicity in the militant areas in pakistan and organisations such as the taliban
2901228 i cant say to what level of leadership that goes to but there are indications of complicity on the part of isi to the extent that they are facilitating these militant groups that come out of the tribal areas in pakistan
2901229 unfortunately we see a higher number of non pashtun non afghanistan fighters this year than this time last year
2901230 they are really from a variety of ethnic groupings some are from areas in pakistan some are from places like uzbekistan or chechnya some are from europe and some are from other arab countries
2901231 but when you have a problem of porous borders and fighters and weapons and resources and command and control and logistics being brought in from outside of afghanistan that adds a complicating context to the insurgency
2901232 we come with militaries that have advantages in command and control in speed in lethality in logistics in intelligence in all those things
2901233 if nations provide forces with restrictions what it does is it decreases those advantages
2901234 how fast we can get there i dont know but it is important that the international community remain committed to afghanistan
2901235 the statements from the whole group result in a total lack of coherence from which we easily conclude that theyre all lying
2901236 i am appealing to you as a fellow human being to work with us if possible to include us and to remember that we are madeleines parents lack of communication is torture
2901237 there is a sense of anger frustration and great sadness theyve waited for this evidence of sightings for a long time its work they could have started 15 months ago but this is the time for them to keep focus and consider everything carefully before deciding what course of action to take then they will have their day they will make their views clear
2901238 i believe he can recommend charges or action be taken against the police as a whole as well as individual officers
2901239 the early stages of the investigation led by detectives in portimao really were very poor
2901240 a number of people had touched the window and entered madeleines and the twins room prior to the arrival of the gnr local police
2901241 her eyes met mine as i walked past and thats when i saw the little blemish in her right eye it was like a little fleck
2901242 intelligence suggests that a paedophile ring in belgium made an order for a young girl three days before madeleine mccann was taken somebody connected to this group saw maddie took a photograph of her and sent it to belgium the purchaser agreed that the girl was suitable and maddie was taken
2901243 one must suppose that the child madeleine mccann could have died inside the apartment
2901244 the whole attitude throughout was one of we think theyre involved there are some vague indications lets throw caution to the wind and see if we can get a conviction
2901245 the documents are a field of potential leads and any one of them could unlock the case they will never give up the search for madeleine
2901246 a network with all kinds of criminal activities really does exist but the authorities dont want to look into it
2901247 in general paedophiles ask for a particular type of abuse rather than a particular child
2901248 the majority of sexual abuse occurs in the home or by people the child knows
2901249 he hadnt been chief minister very long and that in itself was a difficulty because his record in office was quite short
2901250 a lot of people were probably quite upset by the timing of the election they werent convinced by the reason the chief minister gave
2901251 its not their gig they like to be friendly with all the parties because they cant pick and chose whose going to be in national power
2901252 i think they would run a mile rather than get caught up in some local political shindig
2901253 we deliberately didnt touch on that out of respect for the moment and just acknowledged each others path and what happened on the weekend as member for nelson and member for blain
2901254 it was absolutely amazing within several days after that email being circulated a number of people came to our door and said we heard youre strapped for cash heres our cheque
2901255 their record on education and education is one of the big issues has been appalling through their whole government and basically the chicken has come home to roost
2901256 theres a very very high level of community concern about crime across the northern territory
2901257 both side of politics should commit to auditing the police force and seeing where our resources are
2901258 we are crappy therefore liberal are crappy so why change as the result will be the same
2901259 this swing againt labour would not have been so great if the party had kept clair martin as their leaded for this election
2901260 its obvious that the public has quickly become disenchanted with rudd and the labor brand and the coalition must capitalise on that now
2901261 our policy is that we will not commit to any policy we have no significant policies and will not have any significant policies that is our policy
2901262 a veces me siento a veces me siento como me ha atado a los azotes despu s

2901312 when i called them after the race it sounded like they had half the village in the house
2901313 we had our fingers crossed arms crossed everything crossed our son craig is in australia and we were keeping in touch via text when she crossed the line we went mad we spoke to her after the race and she was ecstatic we are so happy for her
2901314 im very excited it is such a fantastic achievement for nicole this was the ultimate goal for her
2901315 we had a lovely celebration in the village when she won the gold at the commonwealth games in manchester a few years ago and this will probably be a bigger party because its a long time since wales had an olympic gold medallist
2901316 she was about 10 and the first thing she said to me was that she wanted to be like sally hodge the welsh cyclist who almost became olympic champion well nicole has outdone sally
2901317 nicole was always a fighter she always had a look of grit and determination on her face come rain hail or snow she used to cycle the six miles to school and back every day
2901318 best done with conscious thought for simple decisions but left to unconscious thought to sleep on it when the decision is complex
2901319 claims that we make superior snap decisions by trusting intuition or through the power of unconscious thought have received a great deal of attention in the media dr newell said
2901320 at best these sort of headlines are misleading at worst theyre outright dangerous
2901321 the nhs should be available to all who need it yet 1 300 cancer patients were denied the treatment that could have made all the difference to them this audit shows that the exceptional cases process is in chaos and patients are suffering
2901322 there has to be a better way we urge the government to accept our 10 point plan to end this bizarre and demeaning lottery
2901323 the current system is not working bail is too easily granted frequently breached and improperly enforced
2901324 public confidence is undermined when bail conditions are routinely breached offenders hold the criminal justice system in contempt and new victims of crime are created unnecessarily it is time to tighten the bail laws
2901325 when i left the basement i saw that a tank had shot right into the side of the building thank god that no one was left there
2901326 i saw a car stopped in the middle of an intersection
2901327 inside the car were a mother father and their two children they were all dead shot by a tank
2901328 we live in the 21st century after all and we shouldnt stoop so low as to wage war
2901329 there should be no hatred between athletes and people in general well leave this to the politicians to figure out
2901330 if the world were to draw any lessons from what i did there would never be any wars
2901331 when it comes to sports we will always remain friends and nothing will affect our friendship even in such a scary event as shooting
2901332 we are friends indeed weve been shooting together for a long time we dont get mixed up in political things sport is beyond politics
2901333 we have our own point of view about what is going on but we think this is a matter for the un not the beijing olympics
2901334 if we need to we are ready to go back to georgia like soldiers but after the president has asked us to stay here we have to respect this
2901335 all of us here journalists officials competitors we are very nervous i dont know why the russians hate us nobody expected what has happened it has exploded for us the olympic games are second now
2901336 you need to have the food so that the audience can experience the mayhem and people are loving the fact that they feel part of the 13th episode
2901337 this single gene variation is potentially only one of many factors influencing such a complex trait as anxiety still to identify this first candidate for genes associated with an anxiety prone personality is a step in the right direction
2901338 it might be possible to prescribe the right dose of the right drug relative to genetic make up to treat anxiety disorders
2901339 we used the startle reflex because its a very old evolutionary indication of anxiety its not something you can manipulate or fake the startle response is stronger when they were watching a negative image and there was a significantly greater startle response from the met met women compared with the rest of the group
2901340 anxiety is a very complex phenomenon and many genes are responsible for it but this particular genetic variation although involved in a small part of the anxiety response is an essential part of it
2901341 we are both so happy to have two british girls on the podium i dont think either of us expected it and especially a gold and a bronze its absolutely amazing
2901342 it hasnt sunk in yet im just over the moon
2901343 i didnt really know what to expect this morning because it was a hard swim last night to get into the final for two british girls to get on the podium is amazing and i am so happy for both of us its great for british swimming
2901344 it was a lot harder this morning we just tried to ignore the times and race the final
2901345 i dont think either of us are natural sprinters we dont do the 100m free so we are naturally suited to the back half of the race
2901346 we didnt panic when we were a little bit behind i didnt see anyone past katie i didnt know what was going on i couldnt see what there was on the other side of the pool i saw katie and just tried to catch her
2901347 i went out a bit slow yesterday so i wanted to go faster today and managed to hold on
2901348 im confident i like being the underdog i like going in and being someone that no one really recognises
2901349 i knew there was a small chance someone would pull out and i just smashed my pb there so im really happy
2901350 i found out last night at 10pm so that had me up for another two hours
2901351 i was mostly relieved and then i knew i could make the final im feeling a bit lucky in this meet so hopefully if all goes well you never know what can happen anyone in the final is going for a medal and thats what im going to be doing
2901352 the last 12 hours have been an emotional rollercoaster for me but anything that doesnt kill you makes you stronger im gaining all the experience i need so im really happy
2901353 meteorites are fascinating because they give us a sample of space further out than astronauts have been able to go

2901357 we have made it clear to the russians that if the disproportionate and dangerous escalation on the russian side continues that this will have a significant long term impact on u s russian relations
2901358 georgia expresses its readiness to immediately start negotiations with the russian federation on a cease fire and termination of hostilities
2901359 not withdrawing but regrouping including heavy armour and increased attacks on tskhinvali
2901360 russia further escalated its aggression overnight using weapons on an unprecedented scale
2901361 is the goal of the russian federation to change the leadership of georgia
2901362 record i am an arab and my identity card is number fifty thousand
2901363 there was a halo around him in my mind until i met in him in 1996
2901364 he was no longer the poet of resistance he was soft he was living a luxurious life i was shocked i could not imagine that he was the one who had written record i am an arab
2901365 darwish was moving away from the narrow palestinian circle to universality
2901366 he had crossed the borders of palestine and entered the world
2901367 he was giving roses to people who came to listen to his poetry
2901368 when he shook hands with me and gave me a rose i felt he was saying farewell
2901369 you are coming with us to tskhinvali you are not going back i promise you
2901370 why do this why do this to us we are just ordinary people we havent harmed anyone
2901371 you can see nobody wanted to help us the un and the americans they all sat there while we got bombed it was the russians who saved us one more day and this whole place would no longer exist and nor would any of us
2901372 that is human flesh the georgians had not given us time to bury our dead when they attacked
2901373 there are volunteers here from all over the caucasus and russia
2901374 stop asking your questions i havent slept for six days
2901375 look at that the georgians fired the ammunition but it was provided by the british and the americans
2901376 he may be a good man as you say but the georgians are holding many of our good people
2901377 why cause you scared of me scared im a say something youre right
2901378 my success has come from me being able to talk about the truth that has evolved around my life and not being afraid see richard pryor taught me that people love for you to go up there and express about your pain you gotta be able to tell the truth about yourself
2901379 i came from a place where there wasnt a lot of joy
2901380 i decided to try and make other people laugh when there wasnt a lot of things to laugh about
2901381 my first monologue that i did eight years old i got a spanking
2901382 i used to mimic people i was mimicking my grandmother and my grandfather at the dinner table
2901383 i was so into the joke i did it again thats how dedicated i was to the joke it started then
2901384 you got to come with a little extra to satisfy them
2901385 the findings are important because of the role drink plays in for example unsafe sex
2901386 but if it sounds more like a pep rally i would say thats going overboard
2901387 being a journalist means making a certain amount of sacrifices
2901388 and a lot of that is not showing partisanship in any public setting
2901389 adnan wirawan lutfi hakim dan muhammad ali mereka on the way kemari

2901393 the evangelical belief that a revival is underway in america that requires christian youth to assume leadership roles in advocating the causes of their religious movement
2901394 the loss of manufacturing jobs lack of affordable health care negligible opportunities for education and poor job security has left many millions of americans locked out this ideology is attractive because it offers them the hope of power and revenge it sanctifies their rage
2901395 day until you change the way money works you change nothing by carolyn baker
2901396 surely there can be no higher duty for academics and other intellectuals at this time than to expose the big lie of 9 11 thereby undermining the primary pretext for the global domination project
2901397 posits that in every culture and society there are facts which tend to be suppressed collectively because of the social and psychological costs of not doing so like all other observers i too have involuntarily suppressed facts and even memories about the drug traffic that were too provocative to be retained with equanimity
2901398 critical thinking is the intellectually disciplined process of actively and skillfully conceptualizing applying analyzing synthesizing and or evaluating information gathered from or generated by observation experience reflection reasoning or communication as a guide to belief and action in its exemplary form it is based on universal intellectual values that transcend subject matter divisions clarity accuracy precision consistency relevance sound evidence good reasons depth breadth and fairness
2901399 it is important to stress that all of the theories about 9 11 are conspiracy theories
2901400 once we realize that none of the theories can be dismissed on the grounds that it is a conspiracy theory the real question becomes which conspiracy theory correctly describes the 9 11 conspiracy
2901401 the issue never gets resolved and lingers in the domain of limbo beclouded by suspicion but unresolved so far as opinion makers are concerned and thus ignored
2901402 9 11 and the 9 11 wars understanding the supreme crimes
2901403 with or without 9 11 as a pretext for war without end the post 1991 global capitalist experiment has failed as a form of economic organization that serves human life and conditions on our planet
2901404 parameters of power in the global dominance group 9 11 and election irregularities in context
2901405 we are past the brink of totalitarian fascist corporatism challenging the neocons and the gdg global dominance group agenda is only the beginning of reversing the long term conservative reactions to the gains of the 1960s re addressing poverty the un declaration of human rights and our own weapons of mass destruction is a long term agenda for progressive scholars and citizen democrats
2901406 we dont need to talk about a cervelat crisis anymore
2901407 these new latin american markets have recently increased their deliveries of intestines we are able to guarantee 100 percent of our cervelat production

2901412 wow we dont see many of those around here anymore
2901413 do you think tommy lee will always be a character in your life
2901414 i like filmmaking and im a bit of an exhibitionist ive found a way to combine both passions
2901415 is that we tend to want there to be instant success in the world and the task in iraq is going to take awhile its just going to take a long time for the ideology that is hopeful and that is an ideology of freedom to overcome an ideology of hate well succeed unless we quit
2901416 what i was hearing was not just that the war was going to go on indefinitely but that it would get larger eventually larger than it had ever been

2901424 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2901425 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2901426 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2901427 can now claim the title as the worlds greatest breaststroker
2901428 this is whats been going through his head four years
2901429 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2901430 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2901431 children obey your parents in the lord for this is right
2901432 if anyone comes to me and does not hate his own father and mother and wife and children and brothers and sisters yes and even his own life he cannot be my disciple
2901433 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2901434 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2901435 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

2901494 i know very well that the terminal does not operate during weekends but this is a special case and all the omcs must call on the ndola refinery to collect their orders and they will be served accordingly i must hasten to emphasise that people should not panic because this is a temporary setback
2901495 these increases are in line with the cost plus model which takes into account the cost of importing feedstock on cargo basis among other things

2901542 the continuing investigation turned up a witness who saw the old couples son loading the shotgun approximately six weeks prior to the fatal incident it transpired that the old lady cut off her sons financial support and the son knowing the propensity of his father to use the shotgun threateningly loaded the gun with the expectation that his father would shoot his mother the case now becomes one of murder on the part of the son for the death of ronald opus
2901543 further investigation revealed that the son ronald opus had become increasingly despondent over the failure of his attempt to engineer his mothers murder this led him to jump off the ten story building on march 23 only to be killed by a shotgun blast through a ninth story window

2901580 so youre telling us that if we could travel back in time with a catholic and visit a service in an early church that it will resemble a protestant church rather than a catholic one
2901581 i thought this made the catholic claim empirically testable and i wanted to test it i discovered in the early church such catholic elements as the centrality of the eucharist the real presence prayers to saints devotion to mary an insistence on visible unity and apostolic succession furthermore the church fathers just smelled more catholic than protestant especially st augustine my personal favorite and a hero to most protestants too it seemed very obvious that if augustine or jerome or ignatius of antioch or anthony of the desert or justin martyr or clement of alexandria or athanasius were alive today they would be catholics not protestants

2901583 gary millers kennedy vs the machine was one of the most important things to happen in the blogosphere in the last two years

2901585 gary fifteen years later and youre still to the rescue more acute and heroic than ever
2901586 gary miller who started kvm and is as good a blogger as exists has not wavered in his criticism of zogbys methodology
2901587 despite the fact that you have taken a few petty and gratuitous shots at me i want to quote your web site great point on the federalist papers
2901588 smart folks are already following kennedy vs the machine for news of that us senate race
2901589 new local blogs for candidates have cropped up drawing national sized audiences like kennedy vs the machine
2901590 minnesotas conservative blog community spawned kennedy vs the machine which pushes senate candidate mark kennedy by bashing state and national democrats
2901591 from national issues to state issues to fun facts that help to personalize public figures kvm informs and educates in an insightful and often amusing way

2901601 the push to develop a diesel engine is worthy because of the limited availability of aviation leaded fuels
2901602 we dont expect revolutionary advances at this stage but we are making incremental steps in that direction
2901603 from my point of view a bigger drawback of refuelling is that it detracts from the racing by turning the grand prix into a series of low fuel sprints between pit stops in the days pre 1994 when you carried your entire race fuel load on board the car there was a much bigger role for the driver in managing the tyres and brakes these days in dry conditions you very rarely see anyone win from further back than the second row of the grid because race pace largely mirrors qualifying pace which is not surprising when the conditions are so similar
2901604 i think we need regulations like reducing testing we shouldnt be testing during the season plus longer life engines that will reduce costs and i dont think anyone can argue that shouldnt be the way we go

2901644 for me personally it is very difficult to believe in that al qaeda is in the gorge
2901645 because to come from afghanistan to that part of georgia they need to cross at least six or seven countries including the caspian sea no al qaeda influence cant be in the country
2901646 the georgians are euphoric because they have been equipped trained that they have gained military experience in iraq it feeds this revanchist mood how can south ossetia be demilitarized when all of georgia is bristling with weaponry and its only an hours ride by tank from tbilisi to tskhinvali
2901647 well since israel and the us are against chavez putin and ahmadinejad they must be good
2901648 russia needs to realize that the empire is gone austro hungarian empire is not coming back the ottoman empire is not coming back and nor is the soviet empire
2901649 as president mikheil saakashvili deflowers his own revolution and shuts down the opposition media he could well try to divert attention away from his political problems by ginning up a fresh conflict with the breakaway regions of abkhazia and south ossetia both of which are protected by russian troops and regional militias
2901650 saakashvili the great democrat is busy charging anyone who opposes him with being a pawn of the russians and therefore guilty of treason but the west is calling on him to restore civil liberties and in an apparent effort to propitiate his western benefactors he has lifted some restrictions and called new elections widespread and growing opposition to his strong arm tactics even among many of his former supporters spells political trouble for saakashvili and his corrupt cohorts however and an appeal to georgian ultra nationalism which was always the real ideological motivation of the rose revolutionaries would bolster him in the polls and provide a much needed distraction at least from the ruling partys point of view
2901651 in the event of an outbreak of hostilities expect the u s to do what they have done for the duration of georgias political crisis proffer unconditional support to saakashvili with russia aiding and giving political and diplomatic support to the abkhazians and the ossetians and the americans letting loose a flood of military aid to tbilisi this could be the first theater of actual conflict in the new cold war
2901652 when violence broke out in the caucasus on friday morning john mccain quickly issued a statement that was far more strident toward the russians than that of president bush barack obama and much of the west but as russian warplanes pounded georgian targets far beyond south ossetia this weekend bush obama and others have moved closer to mccains initial position
2901653 obama accused russia of escalating the crisis through its clear and continued violation of georgias sovereignty and territorial integrity
2901654 its called the american dream because you have to be asleep to beleive it

2901657 now were sitting with about 2 000 in the bank
2901658 and it costs us around 17 000 to run a full season of boxing

2901660 we have a lot of them that come up here that think theyre just the toughest dude in town

2901669 we were at parity or better in performance which as a chemical company you can imagine was a huge surprise
2901670 i cant keep my calendar clear of associate marketing managers our entry level positioning and marketing people asking how do i work on this project or people coming to me and announcing my parents are members of sierra club everyone wants to be involved

2901690 an ever changing work in progress as authentic as a pair of designer jeans
2901691 its the thing that nobody wants to talk about but its obviously a huge factor
2901692 change we can believe in barack obamas plan to renew americas promise
2901693 we are proud to have published two best selling books by barack obama and are thrilled to have the opportunity to continue to work with his campaign on such an important and inspiring book at this critical moment in our country
2901694 the voter registration officials simply take the word of the registrant with no follow up
2901695 some states that require some backup documentation merely ask for a utility bill or a drivers license neither of which prove citizenship in other words legal or illegal aliens can easily register to vote in local and national elections
2901696 while the news media perpetuated the assertion that bush and the gop stole the election it could very well have been illegal aliens voting in florida that made the outcome so close
2901697 bush may have beaten gore by more votes if illegals were excluded since immigrants tend to vote for democrats or gore could have won decisively had there been prior screening before people were allowed into the voting booths
2901698 there was absolutely no mention in the mainstream media regarding suspected voter fraud by illegal or legal aliens it was much easier for the agenda driven newspeople to accuse republicans of stealing the election
2901699 florida is not unique thousands of non citizens are registered to vote in some states and tens if not hundreds of thousands in total may be present on the voter rolls nationwide these numbers are significant local elections are often decided by only a handful of votes and even national elections have likely been within the margin of the number of non citizens illegally registered to vote
2901700 there is no reliable method to determine the number of non citizens registered or actually voting because most laws to ensure that only citizens vote are ignored are inadequate or are systematically undermined by government officials those who ignore the implications of non citizen registration and voting either are willfully blind to the problem or may actually favor this form of illegal voting
2901701 americans would be shocked to discover that hundreds of thousands of general election voters are illegal aliens green card immigrants and criminals whove murdered raped and robbed us citizens and guess which political party benefits the most from their votes the one thats pushing for amnesty and a bag full of free goodies
2901702 to keep non citizens from diluting citizens votes immigration and election officials must cooperate far more effectively than they have to date and state and federal officials must increase their efforts to enforce the laws against non citizen voting that are already on the books
2901703 while the liberal media and the liberal establishment ignore what is a huge scandal american voters are having their rights violated when an illegal aliens or felon or other person prohibited by law to vote their votes cancels out those of american citizens
2901704 liberals want illegal aliens and felons to vote they benefit from such rampant fraud
2901705 seven words that can change the world reveals the astonishing simple truths that have the power to forever transform our world for the better while freeing our minds from the enslavement of limiting beliefs this is not a text for the simple minded it is a guiding philosophy for the mindful intelligent few who are wise enough to seek out and recognize the higher simplicities of truly purposeful living
2901706 cheated on more times than a blind woman playing scrabble with gypsies
2901707 some places were unprepared some places just couldnt handle it
2901708 people know its going to be a historically high turnout whether they can do anything about it is another question
2901709 tens and sometimes hundreds of thousands of voters are disenfranchised sometimes raising serious questions about whether the intended choice of the voters was certified as the winner
2901710 the first couple of primaries get all the attention its decided and nobody turns out for other elections later on in the primary season
2901711 and that didnt happen this time and i think thats where some elections administrators in later primaries got caught
2901712 some might get lost or replaced or the person didnt fill out all the information and theyre not on the rolls
2901713 barr conceivably could be to john mccain what ralph nader was to al gore in 2000 ruinous
2901714 you have in ralph naders candidacy a genuine arab american who has a lot of notoriety and publicity it would be detrimental to obamas candidacy
2901715 obama cannot take the peace vote for granted there are peace candidates running from across the political spectrum
2901716 on the right are bob barr and chuck baldwin on the left are cynthia mckinney and ralph nader he needs to earn the vote of americans opposed to further war

2901719 i want energy to be declared an emergency i want them to give us corridors to move the power out of the central united states to the east and west coasts
2901720 ive been going there as an individual businessman for 40 years to washington
2901721 the richer i got the more polite they were did i get anything done hell no
2901722 i want to get to a million people by the time congress comes back in after recess
2901723 if they see with me a million people that are gonna write to them say something to them put pressure on them theyre going to listen to us i can promise you that
2901724 i dont have any profit motive in this im doing it for america
2901725 it will be similar to the eisenhower interstate highway period in the 1950s
2901726 he said it was an emergency i want it to be declared an emergency i want them to give us corridors to move the power out of the central united states to the east and west coasts
2901727 and weve had a pretty good drop in the oil price
2901728 he believes in global warming i do too but global warming is on page 2 for me on page 1 its the 700 million going out the back door from our dependency on 70 percent of imported oil
2901729 and its also driving the key challenge for us which is energy independence
2901730 ive been working on this since i was elected in 1996 so i get excited whenever anybody else joins this effort
2901731 hes saying if you are not going to listen because im wealthy im going to shame you into listening to people its a great approach
2901732 he wasnt successful but he made a lot of money at it
2901733 eliminates peoples jobs and then asks the taxpayers to fund his new venture
2901734 american people are desperate for answers and if they get robbed in the process
2901735 ralph nader is not a protest candidate he is not for sale and neither is my vote
2901736 i am not voting for a third party or a third person nor is my vote a protest vote and obama has the support of democrats not necessarily liberals liberals like myself are backing ralph nader
2901737 third or fourth party presidential candidates could garner enough votes in november to make a difference in some of the hotly contested swing states
2901738 i cant vote for anybody who doesnt call for an immediate end to the war in iraq
2901739 the war under post nuremburg laws is a criminal war of aggression its illegal we have no right as a nation to debate the terms of the occupation we have no right to be there
2901740 a few things we wont tolerate personal attacks obscenity vulgarity profanity including expletives and letters followed by dashes commercial promotion impersonations incoherence and shouting
2901741 personal attacks obscenity vulgarity profanity including expletives and letters followed by dashes commercial promotion impersonations incoherence and shouting
2901742 campaigns and parties often use dirty tricks to suppress the vote
2901743 its the first big unequivocal test about what this possible president really thinks
2901744 youve got to be sure that you get the right person the person has got to be of presidential stature has got to be someone you can be comfortable with work with and help you as president compatibility is very crucial
2901745 the chemistry between us had been correct but not warm
2901746 you dont want it to be a reason for people to question your judgment
2901747 you dont need any proof you just see it its in here everyday
2901748 you can see the rivers turning color and dead fish
2901749 i see where i live i live in costa rica at the moment and its very beautiful and clean
2901750 i see the difference about how the us is treating all its resources
2901751 i ride a bike i dont drive a car little things but i still us too much
2901752 its the price of gas i think that has made people think a little bit more about improving their lifestyle and giving back to the earth
2901753 my goal is to show people how to cook local produce
2901754 it doesnt have to be transported all the way across the country or across the globe
2901755 the one constant in republican victories in fall elections has been large margins in springfield and those surrounding counties
2901756 if you dont campaign hard in a region of the state that is growing that represents a lot of votes
2901757 a good performing republican will get 65 percent of the vote in greene and surrounding counties
2901758 this race will be fought and won in the margins
2901759 if youre a democrat and cant get north of 40 percent in greene county youre in trouble
2901760 a lot of things hes said have really turned off and angered a lot of people including greene county democrats
2901761 the threat of obama is enough to get the hard core conservatives out
2901762 is designed to give an appearance of solidity to pure wind
2901763 loony liberalism a kind of ideological m nage a trois between timothy leary karl marx and al gore
2901764 matriarchal environmentalist multicultural anti male anti family anti individual and public hygiene shibboleths are enforced by orwellian regulatory agencies commissions and tribunals better known as the smoke smut seat belt thought language and calorie police
2901765 my goal for upper arlington is for obama to win to get 51 percent
2901766 we had people write checks saying im sick of seeing their signs
2901767 in this community theres probably a lot of people who are still waiting for obama to start to make some specifics where people can hang their hats and say yeah this is the change that were looking for
2901768 you dont want to step outside the boundaries and we did
2901769 we wanted to reach out to those people who might have shied away from confrontation with their neighbors or family members
2901770 i didnt bring it into the courts mr gore brought it into the courts
2901771 richard nixon when he lost to john f kennedy thought that the election had been stolen in chicago which was very likely true with the system at the time
2901772 but he did not even think about bringing a court challenge that was his prerogative so if you dont like the courts getting involved talk to mr gore
2901773 bear in mind that the issue wasnt whether or not the election was going to be decided by a court or not it was whether it was going to be decided by the florida court or by the united states supreme court for a federal election
2901774 i mean one side or the other was going to feel that was a politicized decision but that goes with the territory
2901775 i dont think our legal system should be that complex i think that any system that requires that many of the countrys best minds and they are the best minds is too complex
2901776 if you look at the figures where does the top of the class in college go to it goes into law they dont go into teaching now i love the law there is nothing i would rather do but it doesnt produce anything
2901777 i called my partners and said i think i just met a future president of the united states
2901778 i went from being a senator a young senator to being considered for vice president running for president being a vice presidential candidate and becoming a national public figure
2901779 all of which fed a self focus an egotism a narcissism that leads you to believe that you can do whatever you want youre invincible and there will be no consequences
2901780 he could have been a force in american politics for a very long time
2901781 the fact that he had not spent his life in politics was his greatest asset people at the time were saying he didnt have enough experience and hadnt been tested actually hed been tested in ways other people had not
2901782 if youre an incumbent one of your nightmares is a fresh face coming out of the woodwork with the resources to be competitive
2901783 has shown a remarkable disrespect for his office for the moral dimensions of leadership for his friends for his wife for his precious daughter
2901784 i suspect the first thing he thought about is im going to protect myself politically he was worried about his family finding out he was worried about the rest of the staff finding out he was worried about the press finding out
2901785 consistent moderation placed edwards among the center right of senate democrats
2901786 he climbed onto the slab at the funeral home laid there and hugged his body and promised that hed do all he could to make life better for people to live up to wades ideals of service
2901787 as he told me later edwards had recounted the exact story to him almost in the exact same words a year or two before and with the same preface that hed never shared the memory with anyone else
2901788 he wanted to be vice president and said what he had to
2901789 the thing that would surprise me is if he doesnt continue to serve in some way hes been underestimated many times
2901790 im not sure i had a political career for the future anyway
2901791 im not sure that politics was what i wanted to spend my life doing
2901792 i dont know whats possible and whats gone i dont think anythings ended i see no end my lord and my wife have forgiven me so im going to move on
2901793 i think the market is responding to the fact that we are here talking
2901794 employees here dont know where hell get the ethanol there are only gas pumps here
2901795 tensions and hostilities between georgians and ossetians are in no way justification for russian troops crossing an internationally recognized border
2901796 russia to immediately and unconditionally withdraw its forces from the territory of georgia
2901797 the consequences for euro atlantic stability and security are grave
2901798 talks among all sides and said the united states the u n security council and other parties should try to help bring about a peaceful resolution
2901799 its both sides fault both have been somewhat provocative with each other
2901800 senator lieberman supports both democrats and republicans and he gave to the committee as a senior member of the caucus
2901801 want to continue flying in your private jet and air conditioning your 16 000 square foot mansion and not worry about hurting the environment then send us your money and well offset the damage youre doing by planting trees
2901802 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
2901803 the un secretary general has not uttered a word meaning that he respects our laws and justice system why should a lesser mortal from the us say that malaysia is not up to their standards
2901804 why should gore and the us president give their evaluation of a country does he not know the meaning of the udhr universal declaration of human rights and the un charter respect for the internal affairs of a country
2901805 both obama and mccain need to make their running mate choices very carefully because after all the influence that cheney and gore developed people are going to analyze their choices very carefully
2901806 we will never go back to the days when the vice presidency held little influence the national government is involved in too many things for a president not to have a strong partner standing at his side
2901807 even selecting himself as the running mate something that has never been done in history
2901808 theres something healthy in the vice presidency becoming a separate entity
2901809 in the next month one man either the democratic presidential nominee or the republican presidential nominee will choose the next vice president of the united states
2901810 their choice will be ratified by their party conventions and we the people will accept it but the idea that one person will select somebody who has a one in three chance of becoming president of the united states is to my mind very problematic
2901811 presidential candidates usually get vetted for a couple of years but the vice president just gets picked by one guy
2901812 its kind of weird process if you stop and think about it
2901813 it ought to be a more competitive process at the early stages
2901814 maybe people should run for vice president i dont know but we should be talking about it because the process now is fundamentally unhealthy it is not democratic for one man or woman to be able to pick the next president of the united states
2901815 an anonymous secondhand quotation from sen barack obama at a closed house democratic caucus meeting on july 29 caused an uproar among partisans it is an excellent example of how the pernicious use of unnamed sources so pervasive in washington can backfire on journalists and sources
2901816 this is the moment that the world is waiting for i have become a symbol of the possibility of america returning to our best traditions
2901817 in response to what one of the house members prefaced the question by
2901818 said i wish i could take credit for that but i cant because its not about me its about america its about the people of germany and the people of europe looking for a new hope new relationships as we go forward in the world so he expressly said that its not about me
2901819 lots of people are reading the quote about obama being a symbol and getting it wrong his entire point of that riff was that the campaign is not about him
2901820 the post left out the important first half of the sentence which was something along the lines of it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all
2901821 it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all its about america i have just become a symbol
2901822 anonymous quotes should be used sparingly this one wasnt worth it if you werent there be careful about judging the context
2901823 i have become the symbol of america returning to our best traditions
2901824 it scared me to see how the mainstream media were propping up george bush while faithfully reporting every stupid lie that the bush campaign made up about al gore
2901825 ill use every talent i possess and all my energy to try to bring back tolerance decency and generosity to the country i love
2901826 john and i will tell you there were interesting races four years ago and eight years ago but in many ways this is one of the most interesting races in all of american history we have a chance to lift our country to a new way of thinking this can be a transformative election but make no mistake its close closer than it should be
2901827 mccain has promised and reaffirmed his commitment to continue the same policies weve had these past eight years for another four
2901828 we cannot do that barack obama has lifted our spirits and led us to believe yes we can solve the global climate crisis address the other issues we have to take on and has said we can come together and create a new century with bright hope
2901829 you want some advice make iraq the 51st state and lets get the hell out of there
2901830 these are not normal times the relationship between the planet and ourselves has been irrevocably and dramatically altered were a bull in a china shop today as the sun sets we will have put another 70 million tons of global warming pollution into the atmosphere
2901831 just so you all know we did set a record
2901832 ive been involved in fundraising a long time and to have two incredible men who were nominees and both should have been president and also the fact i got a nobel prize winner and an academy award winner this is too much even for me
2901833 he promised america it would be a campaign of respect of ideas not insults and the american people wanted a better campaign and he gives you paris hilton and britney spears
2901834 if he cant keep his word about the campaign and he cant keep his word about the issues that are really important to the american people and he makes the wrong judgments about how to protect america then his candidacy is in fact dangerous in terms of americas security and you cant trust it and you cant trust him thats what this is about
2901835 clearly we shouldnt relax our guard just because we are automating the elections
2901836 this is the electronic equivalent of ballot boxes stuffed with ballots even before the voting has started
2901837 even though 27 votes each were recorded for their running mates
2901838 whether it paid bribes to win a venezuela election contract in 2004
2901839 the current way computers are used to record count and tabulate votes threatens the basic democratic principles of voting in secret and counting in public in dre you are already counting in secret
2901840 more than a technological problem election fraud is really a social problem and therefore calls for social solutions supported by technological means the only effective social solution to fraud is elections is eternal vigilance and punishment for the cheats
2901841 the lives of people especially the youth who will sign up on the red list will definitely be in the red meaning stepping into the danger zone
2901842 our dependence on foreign oil means that we are buying from our enemies
2901843 how bout some friends and a few a holes that better
2901844 the american people know something is wrong as far as energy is concerned
2901845 i hope he grabs that part of middle america that we failed to reach
2901846 i want him to make more money in wind than he did in oil
2901847 it was my first experience in the takeover field expansion by acquisition
2901848 people had splashed water all over the counters thrown paper towels on the floor and boone pickens couldnt stand to see his investment in disarray so without a word he started picking up the paper towels and wiping down the counters himself
2901849 i think the rest of us were so embarrassed we started to clean up quietly around him
2901850 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
2901851 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
2901852 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
2901853 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
2901854 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
2901855 you dont have to win over everybody to gain from a campaign stop
2901856 the military is not monolithic it leans republican but it doesnt mean there arent people in the military and military spouses who might be persuaded to support obama
2901857 this taps into a side of the military that takes a beating when it comes to deployments but doesnt get a lot of media attention theres a good bit of frustration in that segment of the military and it might be possible to persuade them to support barack obama
2901858 sitting next to someone on a senate committee has sparked more than a few deep friendships
2901859 obviously my name was linked to it but other than that theres nothing that can be said
2901860 he was a governor who tried to not ruffle feathers
2901861 as a debater i felt like i was in the twilight zone show you want to reach over and slit the arm to see if theres flesh and blood or just wires
2901862 one of my big accomplishments was at one point in the debate he started to sweat
2901863 is it boring to win five times as a democrat in a state thats overwhelmingly republican
2901864 obviously the people of indiana think theres something exciting about him
2901865 if black people kill black people every day why not have a week and kill white people
2901866 are you better off now than you were four years ago
2901867 we have to free ourselves from the domination of the big oil companies that have the ability to manipulate the price
2901868 if every american were to pitch in 2 000 we could pay off this years deficit or if we handed over each of us 500 gallons of gasoline or in terms we could all really understand if every american gave up 666 lattes for a year we could pay off this years deficit
2901869 the people who can affect the price of oil would prefer a republican presidential candidate watch the price of oil if it goes down which it may very well it could help john mccain quite a bit
2901870 its not only obamas youth eloquence and energy that have stolen hearts across the atlantic obama has raised expectations of a chance for the nation to redeem itself in the role that europe has loved respected and relied upon
2901871 the 200 000 plus crowd confirmed his rock star status and his more cooperative sounding rhetoric was what the crowd wanted to hear
2901872 mr obamas weeklong tour of war zones and foreign capitals is noteworthy because it is so unusual to see a presidential candidate act so presidential overseas
2901873 sen obama is not just tacking gently toward the center hes lurching right when it suits him hes zigging with the kind of reckless abandon thats guaranteed to cause disillusion if not whiplash
2901874 however you feel about her politics i feel that received some of the most unfair hostile coverage ive ever seen
2901875 if theres anything we need to rescue us from the last eight years its brains good judgment and experience obama has the first two gore has all three
2901876 i have fundamental differences with on the issues and always have i dont have any problem criticizing john mccain
2901877 obama is something special a man who makes difficult tasks look easy who seems to touch millions of diverse people with a message of hope that somehow doesnt sound pollyannaish
2901878 ive been covering presidential campaigns since 1960 i have always said i have never seen the media as much entranced by a candidate than when they were in my very first campaign in 1960 when they were for jfk but im telling you right now the enchantment with obama beats the jfk syndrome
2901879 i knew ronald reagan ronald reagan was a friend of mine barack obama is no ronald reagan
2901880 the technology has changed and the political and environmental landscape has changed if youre concerned about climate change wheres the power coming from thats why youre not hearing the same opposition you heard 20 years ago
2901881 we get blamed by people for being neanderthals but just because something is new doesnt mean its a good idea to include it in the debates
2901882 this has been something weve explored in the past and for a variety of reasons logistical and scale it couldnt come together
2901883 we offered our functionality with the notion that we knew the goal of these debates is all about information and education
2901884 its a way for americans to educate themselves in a different manner and ideally make a more informed choice when choosing their leader
2901885 i think it will change the process for elections to come
2901886 when he wasnt writing dirty jokes and yelling at people on the radio he found time to avoid paying his taxes in 18 different states
2901887 im not proud of every joke ive ever told but i know theres a difference between what you say as a comedian and what you do as a u s senator
2901888 the two candidates are polar opposites on many major issues notably the wars in iraq and afghanistan and drilling in the arctic national wildlife refuge coleman has been with bush on both and franken is energetically against both
2901889 despite all the talk about sexism in the presidential campaign the majority of women voters laid the blame for hillarys loss squarely on her and her strategists shoulders they largely reject gender as a cause of her demise
2901890 as we come closer to the peoples vote they get closer to corporate power
2901891 things are getting so bad for libertarians and liberals theres starting to be a convergence of interests
2901892 you cant focus on voters rights and ignore candidate rights
2901893 for all practical purpose we are no much better than the chinese political model expect that in china there is no gridlock and things are getting done
2901894 i am really beholdin to corporate interests they give me a great paycheck and have provided me with the highest standard of living in history comment by lackeynlovenit august 6 2008 at 5 05 pm
2901895 we have regular exchanges with malaysian diplomats in washington on a number of subjects including with the malaysian charge daffaires yesterday
2901896 anwar ibrahims case was one of the topics of conversation
2901897 we take note of the many serious questions raised within malaysia including by the malaysian bar council concerning this case
2901898 for the second time gore is goring us repeating the 1998 goring
2901899 we hope he will stop goring as it is about time he re examines the goring process within himself and his country
2901900 there is no way other countries should look down on us in the administration of our own laws our criminal procedure code and the penal code emanate from the common law
2901901 therefore there is no reason whatsoever for any other power in the world to criticise us in administering justice and the rule of law
2901902 dia moreno sudah cukup tahu apa yang akan dia lakukan
2901903 why is obama not doing better in the national polls after his overseas trip
2901904 is mr obama really struggling are these summer polls truly evidence of underperformance or fundamental weaknesses in his campaign
2901905 voters might just not be ready to make a decision quite this early
2901906 the idea was simple give u k readers frustrated with the bush administration a way to help drive him from office the left wing newspaper targeted one swing county in one swing state in ohio and invited readers to send one on one letters to independent american voters
2901907 the response was huge and immediate more than 11 000 guardian readers across britain and soon around the world signed up for the project but almost as soon as operation clark county was announced right leaning media and bloggers counterattacked they masqueraded as interested lefties and got the paper to hand over some of the voters addresses
2901908 consider this stay out of american electoral politics unless you would like a company of us navy seals republican to a man to descend upon the offices of the guardian bag the lot of you and transport you to guantanamo bay where you can share quarters with some lonely taliban shepherd boys
2901909 in 2000 al gore won clark county by 324 votes
2901910 kerry won every gore county in ohio except clark nowhere among the gore counties did more votes move from the blue to the red column than in clark
2901911 so why isnt obamas camp and the democrats offering a more spirited defense is the party too smug or cocky or decent to roll up its sleeves and fight fire with fire
2901912 the only issue that hit home is the war because of him
2901913 i cant understand why there arent rings of young people blocking bulldozers and preventing them from constructing coal fired power plants
2901914 the gap between the carbon price and the cost of ccs
2901915 i hope that the strengthening of carbon markets will bring forward a sufficiently good price for carbon that it will provide some of the financial incentive for ccs will it be enough i do not know
2901916 as a fig leaf to give unabated coal fired power stations an appearance of environmental acceptability
2901917 has no right to withhold approval for a conventional plant
2901918 thanks i wont include hope to get the set of draft conditions out today or tomorrow
2901919 our dangerous dependence on foreign oil has been thirty years in the making and was caused by the failure of politicians in washington to think long term about the future of the country
2901920 this is one emergency we cant drill our way out of
2901921 any time you pick up a newspaper and see the terms climate change or global warming just think jobs for michigan
2901922 believe me the production people can do it if they really try
2901923 axelrods not the type to drop a refrigerator on a guys head hell take the refrigerator apart drop one piece at a time and save the biggest piece for last
2901924 weve been through two very tough elections at the national level and its very easy to lose confidence
2901925 after one president in the pocket of big oil we cant afford another
2901926 this is a classic washington story anonymous quotes from armchair quarterbacks with no sense of our strategy data or plan
2901927 yuck im only a half a mile into the run and its so smoggy i cant even see the spectators on the side of the road stop doing this
2901928 which many historians believe would have collapsed of its own weight no matter who was commander in chief
2901929 at the same time were seeing our national security experts saying were highly vulnerable with 70 percent of our oil coming from foreign countries the largest reserves being in the most unstable region of the world the persian gulf
2901930 we are being told by scientists around the world particularly the international group that is charged with studying this and reporting to world leaders that we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
2901931 if a person is too safe and conservative hes not likely to come up with great ideas
2901932 pick your failure apart as if you were a commentator at a golf tournament
2901933 being fired teaches you that your workplace doesnt define you as much as you thought it did
2901934 dont be too blas too self blaming or too defensive
2901935 my expectations about my previous job were off and i also lacked some of the resources i needed
2901936 we tend to overreact to failures and ignore the successful aspects of these experiences
2901937 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
2901938 the consequences of climate change are very real and very negative but cheney is not convinced of that he believes not quite as much as senator james inhofe that this is a hoax but that the earth has been changing since it was formed and to say that climate change is caused by humans is incorrect
2901939 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
2901940 from their own website yes the owl is scamming you but yes you lefty libs are so desperate to believe in ghosts and goblins that you will look the other way when the obvious smacks you upside the head
2901941 deliver superior investment performance by taking a long term investment view and integrating sustainability research within a rigorous fundamental equity analysis framework
2901942 the most insignificant office that ever the invention of man contrived or his imagination conceived
2901943 do you think running a campaign ad in which you feature britney spears and paris hilton with barack obama is respectful
2901944 its a bit of humor its a way to draw people into the ad
2901945 were not deciding whos our favorite celebrity who we are fans of
2901946 the only strategy theyve got in this election is to try to scare you about me
2901947 well you know hes got a funny name and he doesnt look like all the presidents on the dollar bills and the five dollar bills
2901948 what obama was saying is theyre trying to scare you
2901949 theyre trying to scare the american people and believe me im an expert on how they do that
2901950 to insinuate that his celebrity is somehow all he has
2901951 theyre trying to say to america somehow hes not like you
2901952 the mccain campaign is to use barack obamas words raising the question is he a risky guy but it has nothing to do with his name or his skin color it has to do with his lack of experience and bad judgment his unreadiness to be president
2901953 in 2000 al gore gave me the extraordinary honor of being the first jewish american to run for national office and al gore said he had confidence in the american people that they would judge me based on my record not on my religion
2901954 and i urge barack obama to have the same faith in the american people that they will judge him on his record or lack of record certainly not on his name or his race
2901955 break americas gridlock by honoring a bipartisan effort if that is the only way to move us towards alternative and renewable fuels
2901956 when john mccain brings american troops home from iraq theyre staying home
2901957 i think liebermans going to want to be part of the stronger democratic majority
2901958 seluruhnya ada enam gram kurang lebih tapi tidak bagian kepemilikan satu orang bersama sama
2901959 mungkin baru kali ini mengalami seperti ini ditahan di kantor polisi dengan dugaan kasus narkoba
2901960 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
2901961 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
2901962 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
2901963 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
2901964 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
2901965 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
2901966 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
2901967 everyone is proud it felt great all the flags and the people cheering it was a great game great atmosphere
2901968 we have a huge gap with them so were satisfied with the result
2901969 only if you think that not doing so almost immediately would result in an uninhabitable planet
2901970 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
2901971 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
2901972 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
2901973 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous

2901975 friday item 24 adam schwabs plea for electric cars is heartfelt i am sure but he is mistaken about the environmental effects of these vehicles if you flooded sydney streets with electric cars if every one owned one the environmental impact would be disastrous these things have to be recharged and the thought of plugging them all into the coal fired grid would send al gore into hyperspace it just cant be done the germans did the estimates years ago and ran a mile from pushing for electric cars electric cars are an answer if they are recharged by some means other than base load power which is invariably polluting the energy has to be self creating as in a hybrid or come from something like solar or wind otherwise it is an idea whose time will never come and another thing the electric batteries are the big unspeakable polluters that present more than just minor problems tim falkiner writes i am not going to tell car makers what sort of cars to build but i am not going to buy a new car until i can get something efficient maybe electric with a top up diesel engine the car makers have a huge gap to bridge before i give up my reliable falcon dinosaur the who killed the electric car video makes it clear that we need to bring our intellectual property laws into line with modern areas of law to give manufacturers the right to use modern technology upon payment of a reasonable fee intellectual property rights should carry with them obligations and be balanced against environmental and social considerations paul keating ross davidson writes keating the greatest hits so far

2902010 how can people seriously think they are going to have a positive impact on energy prices in the medium term or the long term if they are not really doing anything about either supply or demand

2902053 algae has always been one of those promising things that is just a few years away
2902054 we discovered there are a number of speed bumps in the process that add up to be a show stopper if you have a problem with every step it adds up to something that just doesnt work our approach was not to think of algae as a crop but as an industrial process
2902055 we love the sun but we dont want to have direct sunlight algae only consumes a small part of the suns spectrum less than 10 percent some of the other rays are actually harmful to the algae we believe that if you can get the right wavelength to the algae cells then you will have much more efficient growth

2902105 very many military servicemen were killed probably in the hundreds
2902106 we would be particularly troubled if these attacks are continuing now as the georgians are pulling back

2902120 we are already down 25 basis points due to easing inflation expectations
2902121 yields should range trade after that unless we see a further drop in oil prices
2902122 i think right now the market is pricing in a 25 basis point hike after that the market is slowly ruling our more rate hikes because of improving oil prices
2902123 i thought we could have won it sometimes you win sometimes you lose they came back they hit a great shot give them credit
2902124 if you consider this loss its not that important but its emotionally important it puts a lot of pressure on you in the next game and the following one so were going to have to play great and really step up
2902125 it was great we won the game we really feel good about that but there is still a long way to go
2902126 we cant get too rattled in the beginning with good streaks
2902127 if we get worried it wont help us we have to keep that in mind from here on out
2902128 everyone is proud it felt great all the flags and people cheering it was a great game great atmosphere

2902135 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2902136 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2902137 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2902138 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2902139 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2902140 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2902141 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2902142 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2902188 you have got to play well the whole game and its always good to get in front of a team and make them chase you and when we got up by five goals in the second and third quarters st kilda came at us in the last quarter we were good enough and strong enough to resist that challenge and kick a few goals late
2902189 continue doing what you were doing we were playing well and the boys down forward were giving a good contest we werent taking too many marks down forward but we managed to kick goals from crumbs and even paul medhurst who has kicked a lot of goals for us this year didnt kick a goal tonight but he was involved in four or five goals through his crumbing work and winning contested ball and it was great to see jack anthony kick three goals again tonight too
2902190 medders has actually done a lot of preseason work in the midfield and hasnt had much of a chance to play there so a few of our players might have been a bit sore in the game medders has always been wanting to get back in the midfield through the season and got that chance and actually played well
2902191 fraser was fantastic obviously came back last week and copped a bit of criticism after his performance but this week he is back to his best he might have had 20 touches and 20 hit outs and had a fantastic tap on to john anthony in the goal square in the last quarter which results in a goal
2902192 it was like silent murder the pain was there but there was no screaming no cheering so it was very bizarre
2902193 i never received direction from george tenet or anyone else in my chain of command to fabricate a document from habbash as outlined in mr suskinds book
2902194 initially crews made entry into the building but finally it became so bad the crews had to back out
2902195 i obviously hold a lot of european players who i grew up watching in high esteem
2902196 to believe that i achieved something they hadnt is very special
2902197 i have no regrets of anything i did out there
2902198 things go easier you have more fun things flow better when youre having success im going to continue to just ride it out
2902199 you hear it all the time youve got to keep your mind in the moment
2902200 its easier said than done but its something youve got to be conscious of if you feel yourself thinking about the past or trying to think about the eighth inning in the fourth inning youre in trouble already
2902201 did a good job moving his fastball around made some adjustments as the game wore on overall another real good day for cliff
2902202 he always makes me look like i know what im doing
2902203 i can call any pitch and he can execute it
2902204 he attacks the hitters he goes out there and works the plate hes been doing it all year its fun to watch i hope he can continue this stretch and finish strong
2902205 felt good some at bats a little tardy on other ones
2902206 i know that it has been a tough situation here in regards to football
2902207 i came in here with an open mind and i havent been disappointed yet
2902208 the players we have out there are committed to the program and have a great attitude they listen well and are helping each other out learning my system i couldnt ask for a better group of young men to work with
2902209 theyre picking things up pretty quick and i think everything should be in place when the season starts
2902210 i was pleasantly surprised to see our size on the line
2902211 they have really meshed well in practice and seem to be working well together it doesnt matter who is in the backfield if the front line isnt getting the job done then no one is
2902212 its really hard to tell how a defense is until the games start
2902213 were getting to the right spots in practice but its hard to tell how much theyve developed and learned until the action starts
2902214 so if an injury happens we could be in some trouble well make what ever adjustments we need if that happens but we cant worry about it
2902215 we just to need to go out and play football
2902216 when you think of soul music you think of isaac hayes the expression the sound and the creativity that goes along with it
2902217 they could go to the bathroom they could get a sandwich or whatever
2902218 the rappers have gone in and created a lot of hit music based upon my influence
2902219 a lot of artists owe isaac his career because a lot of music was based on his foundation
2902220 a person that speaks his mind hes sensitive enough to care for children hes wise enough to not be put into the wack category like everybody else in town and he l o o o o ves the ladies
2902221 there is a place in this world for satire but there is a time when satire ends and intolerance and bigotry toward religious beliefs of others begins

2902263 aku melihat rasa lapar yang sangat pada diri nabi s a w aku segera mengeluarkan kuali yang di dalamnya ada satu takar gandum dan kami punya juga seekor haiwan kecil sebangsa anak kambing kacung
2902264 aku melihat sesuatu pada diri nabi yang bila saja aku melihatnya tentu aku tidak akan sabar apakah kamu mempunyai sesuatu
2902265 janganlah kau membuatkan aku malu di hadapan rasulullah dan orang orang yang bersamanya kerana makanan yang dibawa hanya sedikit
2902266 kami mempunyai sedikit makanan yang telah kami buat kemarilah engkau wahai rasulullah bersama seorang atau dua orang sahaja
2902267 katakanlah kepada isterimu agar periuknya jangan diangkat dulu dari tungku begitu adunan rotinya sampai aku datang
2902268 allah dan rasul lebih mengetahui kita membuat roti apa yang ada pada kita sahaja
2902269 kami dapat makan dan memberikannya kepada tetangga dan setelah rasulullah s a w keluar maka makanan itu pun habis pula
2902270 celakalah aku kerana ku lihat makanan ini terlalu sedikit benar benar celakalah aku kerana bermaksiat dengan memanggil mereka lalu mereka semua akan berkumpul
2902271 maka mereka pun makan sampai kenyang dan aku juga ikut makan hingga kenyang sesudah itu aku mengangkatnya ternyata keadaannya seperti keadaan asal hanya sahaja di sana ada bekas jari jari rasulullah s a w

2902315 la suppression de la pub fait partie dun plan global
2902316 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2902317 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2902318 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2902319 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2902320 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2902321 hahaha we destroyed the hopes and dreams of a generation of faux romantics
2902322 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2902323 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2902324 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2902325 if your investment falls by 50 youll need a 100 rise just to get you back where you started so when speculating in the stock markets protecting the money you do have is just as important as making some more

2902340 one of the things ucr does best is help them achieve the kind of college degree that will make them more successful in their future and we hope happier and better able to afford the vacations and the parties

2902348 as im sure youre all aware foreign formats have increased in popularity as the basis for us television development and production
2902349 what is often overlooked or not fully appreciated are the complexities associated with negotiating format deals coupled with the fact that often times what is appealing in the format may be nothing more than a general underlying premise which in and of itself may be no reason to license the underlying property
2902350 degree of creative control involvement typically to be rendered from a foreign location adding perhaps an unnecessary layer to the creative process
2902351 let me assure you that we continue to be actively competitively and aggressively engaged in developing product based on foreign formats and our decision whether or not to get into negotiations will be premised purely on creative need and our legal analysis as to whether underlying rights are required
2902352 the point about a format is the twist or the way an idea is executed that is what makes it so valuable the premise is often not enough
2902353 formats cost money for a reason they are valuable because they have some unique properties it is a false economy to try and do something in the same area but without making the show you really want
2902354 american broadcasters have been pretty good at importing formats from around the world and respecting these formats abc have been the leaders in this
2902355 generally speaking the balance is regarded as fair but when something like this comes along it makes people think the broadcaster wants a shift
2902356 we have been made aware of the memo and we are looking at it
2902357 those whove seen it are shaking their heads in disbelief
2902358 blesses anyone who brings foreign formats to abc studios first so that the studio can steal the idea without paying the fat licensing fees that would accompany an up and up deal
2902359 the renewed fighting in north cotabato goes to show that when the government bungles the peace negotiation it is the citizens who suffer
2902360 the imminent refugee crisis is an unacceptable cost of the governments mismanagement of the peace process a peace process should lead to the protection of life and property and yet whats happening is the opposite
2902361 we never looked at an agenda of term extension that is not the ultimate objective
2902362 does anyone believe that it is possible to win the nomination without over these next two months raising all these issues on him wont a single tape of the reverend jeremiah wright going off on america with obama sitting there be a game ender
2902363 i worked with a guy like that down in philadelphia
2902364 i think people feared brian and thats way down the road for kenny hes still trying to learn the defense and limit the mistakes i know in college he was a very active and physical guy and when we drafted him we anticipated hed be the same
2902365 thats whats encouraging i look at it and athletically i say i can play this game
2902366 you always thank the big man that you live to fight another day
2902367 this little guy appears and youre like i love you i dont know who you are or what youre going to be but i love you its an unbelievable feeling
2902368 that was uh not something we wanted them to do
2902369 that was more of something they probably saw on hard knocks that the cowboys were doing well get that corrected
2902370 normally at lunch id go home but of course i cant go home usually id not take as many snaps id go hit golf balls whatever now obviously i cant do that
2902371 youve still got to have some down time in camp but every time i have 15 minutes if im not studying i feel like im cheating myself
2902372 at some point like i did last night im looking at the playbook and im just staring at it i got to put it up
2902373 ive always felt like in any offense or defense throughout the nfl theres too much volume
2902374 the coaches have way too much free time you dont have to have 1 000 plays to be successful you have to run five or 10 of them very well bottom line is you run 70 plays in a game you repeat half of those well condense it down theyre throwing everything at me right now
2902375 like in a game he pumped and laid it in there before the safety got over there
2902376 if we can take two of three from here on out well be sitting pretty
2902377 i was hoping wed play a little wed get rain theyd take him out and wed get to the bullpen early it didnt work out that way
2902378 i definitely want to be out there but plaxico burress has to take care of plaxico burress
2902379 thats what im going to do im going to make all the right judgments as far as my health ive stressed that to them when i get out there im going to be running 100 miles per hour with no restrictions thats what im trying to accomplish
2902380 why wouldnt everybody want that for me i think everybody would be a lot happier when im 100 i know my quarterback would be i dont see why it would be a problem
2902381 i just want to get in good football shape and basically dont put myself through the things i went through last year
2902382 i told myself that i wasnt going to out and do that because in the long run it just hurts me ive got to take care of myself and when im ready to go everybody will be the first people to know it
2902383 i dont think you guys will see him around here anymore
2902384 ill have to call my mom so she can tape it off espn
2902385 its weird because its a penalty lap and you have to do it because you did something bad but people were cheering
2902386 hes one of the guys so put the ball on the ground him and nick run
2902387 thats the way we talked about it thats the way he wanted it its the way i wanted it
2902388 its not punishment its more of a team unity thing
2902389 i told eric on day 1 that unless i pass out im going to try to do everything that everyone else does im not different aside from being a little gray headed and a little bit older
2902390 some coaches believe in doing things like that it all serves its purpose in the end youre trying to build unity the crowd was cheering and all of that stuff im not embarrassed by it i think its kind of funny yet it serves a purpose
2902391 barangsiapa yang megetahui dan meyakini bahawa hanya aku yang mampu mengampunkan segala dosa maka akan aku ampunkan dosa dosanya selama mana dia tidak mensyirikkan aku dengan sesuatu
2902392 wahai anak adam sekiranya engkau berdoa dan memohon keampunan dariku maka akan aku ampunkan segala dosa dosamu wahai anak adam sekiranya dosa dosa yang telah engkau lakukan menggunung setinggi langit kemudian kau memohon keampunan dariku maka akan aku ampunkan dosa dosamu wahai anak adam sekiranya kau datang kepadaku dengan dosa sebanyak seisi dunia dan kau tidak mensyirikkan aku dengan sesuatu maka akan aku datangkan padamu maghfirahku sebanyak seisi dunia
2902393 orang yang bertaubat daripada dosa dosa yang dilakukannya seumpama tidak ada dosa bagi dirinya
2902394 youll get that in this business with modern journalism but its possible were trying weve one or two options were looking at and hopefully we can get something done before the start of the season
2902395 we had dominated possession and had good chances in the match
2902396 but if youre making chances as many as we made today you shouldnt worry about it
2902397 but i think its the team that has to play in a manner that can get success from them the team has got to realize what quality ball weve got to give them
2902398 it has been pressing since the end of last season
2902399 we like to operate with four strikers and we have not been able to do that
2902400 i cant answer the question because i dont have the right answer
2902401 it is possible i will sign someone this week we are trying and we are looking at one or two options
2902402 wes only missed two games last season and was absolutely outstanding
2902403 it is certainly a dilemma looking at it i dont think gary will play all the time if we get 35 games out of him i would be delighted so wes brown can do a job there
2902404 gary could play in a friendly that would not be a problem because he needs games
2902405 but i would like him to play a few with us before he got to that crucial moment when you get back into international football
2902406 gary had an hour today which was perfect for him

2902412 california democrat nancy pelosi may be trying to save the planet but the rank and file in her party increasingly are just trying to save their political hides when it comes to gas prices as republicans apply more and more rhetorical muscle but what looks like intraparty tension on the surface is part of an intentional strategy in which pelosi takes the heat on energy policy while behind the scenes shes encouraging vulnerable democrats to express their independence if it helps them politically according to democratic aides on and off capitol hill
2902413 i understand why the republicans think they have that issue but the vast majority of the american people blame george bush and the oil companies for high gas prices
2902414 so i think that is an issue that ultimately will not help them

2902427 mobile satellite services have the tremendous advantage of being able to cover most of the eus territory thereby reaching millions of eu citizens across borders they represent an unprecedented opportunity for all europeans to access new communication services and this not only in metropolitan areas but also in rural and less populated regions
2902428 however these satellite services depend on substantial investment and therefore need simple and swift procedures as well as long term legal certainty this is why the commission in close cooperation with the european parliament and the council of ministers set up in a record time of only ten months a single eu procedure for selecting interested operators of mobile satellite services there is now one market not 27 in europe for mobile satellite services henceforth the ball is in the camp of the industry i expect intense competition among operators offering satellite based communication services reaching consumers from the north of sweden to the south of spain this could pave the way for first satellite launches already in the course of 2009

2902452 personally im disappointed in nikons coolpix efforts since the 8800 and the p6000 actually increases that disappointment my advice is to look at the ricoh gx 200 and the panasonic lx 3 if you want a quality compact camera in the near term both have true raw support both are excellent photographer centric cameras and with care using raw conversion both produce fine results at low iso values looks like i need a new coolpix bumper sticker to add to my collection skip the p6000
2902453 the coolpix p6000 looks like a very sweet camera the advanced controls the built in gps and the ethernet port are just the features im looking for in an advanced compact but if nikon is arrogant enough to not let me access my own camera raw data except through a system that makes me a hostage of both nikon bad and microsoft worse i think ill pass on this one

2902463 its going to be lousy monday evening because the moon will be almost full and will wash out all but the brightest meteors
2902464 but the perseids are the most reliable meteor shower of the year so after the moon sets it should be a nice show
2902465 what i recommend is to find a location where a building or trees are near the western horizon to help block out the bright light from the moon then youll see a little more
2902466 you tend to see long trails because theyre fairly far away passing through a lot of high atmosphere
2902467 up north is the best place to see them i wont go out aug 12 its hot and muggy and there are a lot of bugs out
2902468 ive drawn him so many times i knew god was going to be on my side this time
2902469 sixty four boxers in the worlds and i drew him in the first round
2902470 anywhere gerry shows up i always do good he missed the last eus but hes been here and hes been in the training camp and the village
2902471 i lack belief sometimes but once i believe in my potential i can do anything
2902472 if this guy beats you anymore hes going to bring you home and put you on the mantelpiece
2902473 i kind of knew i was up i could hear the crowd
2902474 you just have that feeling when youre winning and i could see it in his kates eyes that he was weak after the second round
2902475 because in the last couple of fights he had me gone in two rounds he was in control
2902476 he wanted to know the score but i wouldnt tell him
2902477 ive seen it before when hes behind hes not bad but when hes ahead he panics he runs and hides and i didnt want him doing that i wanted him to keep doing what he was doing
2902478 so i just told him not to worry about the score
2902479 i could have boxed better but theyre the tactics you need to beat him just round by round taking it slowly
2902480 usually as a tournament goes on the better i go
2902481 and thats why i was hoping to get a good draw but god didnt give me a good draw he gave me the toughest man i could have expected in the first round a man who has beaten me the last three times in just over a year
2902482 so beating him the way i beat him is some achievement in the worlds he scored 32 points against me he got just five today hes been my bogeyman hes been torturing me for the last year drawing him in the first round everywhere i go
2902483 i needed to come up with something special and i did happy days
2902484 and itll be hard to bring him down a little bit so again thats a bit of a problem hes up on a high now theres expectation with him and the jitters will come again people are expecting him to do it so youve got to try and control it again keep everything on an even keel
2902485 hes so quick hes going to give any boxer here a lot of problems

2902496 only at texas can you be under the radar but be ranked 10th in the country
2902497 people have us losing a lot of games or a lot more than we are probably used to
2902498 we feed off it a lot of people feel like were not even going to win 10 games we use that as a motivational tool and inspiration to work even harder
2902499 we have not stopped the pass for two years consistently
2902500 and when you start looking at the quarterbacks across this league and their ability to throw the ball you better be able to stop the pass
2902501 we want to win more than 10 games this year
2902502 weve won 10 games the last couple of years and we need to win more than 10 this year

2902527 society is saved just as often as the circle of its rulers contracts as a more exclusive interest is maintained against a wider one
2902528 the bourgeoisie wherever it has got the upper hand has put an end to all feudal patriarchal idyllic relations
2902529 it has pitilessly torn asunder the motley fuedal ties that bound man to his natural superiors
2902530 and has left remaining no other nexus between man and man than naked self interest than callous cash payment it has drowned the most heavenly ecstasies of religious fervour of chivalrous enthusiasm of philistine sentimentalism in the icy water of egotistical calculation
2902531 it has resolved personal worth into exchange value and in place of the numberless indefeasible chartered freedoms has set up that single unconscionable freedom free trade
2902532 in one word for exploitation veiled by religious and political illusions it has substituted naked shameless direct brutal exploration
2902533 constant revolutionizing of production everlasting uncertainty and agitation distinguish the bourgeois epoch from all earlier ones

2902536 in place of the old wants satisfied by the productions of the country we find new wants requiring for their satisfaction the products of distant lands and climes
2902537 in place of the old local and national seclusion and self sufficiency we have intercourse in every direction universal interdependence of nations and as in material so also in intellectual production the intellectual creations of individual nations become common property national one sidedness and narrow mindedness become more and more impossible and from the numerous national and local literatures there arises a world literature

2902550 inflation is going up with prices of food utilities and petrol increasing
2902551 combine this with the credit crunch making it hard for people to borrow money and we are seeing more people having their homes repossessed
2902552 homelessness has a devastating effect on people and their families yet so many people arrive at court without legal help we are acting fast to set up this emergency court scheme in bury and colchester to help more people keep their homes
2902553 the more time an adviser has to prepare the better the chance people have of keeping their homes therefore getting early advice is still the best advice if people have housing or money problems they should try and get early advice from a qualified source

2902562 it is a record number of blood donors since the blood donation drive at symbiosis began
2902563 we were very motivated by the efforts that our seniors had put in to accomplish it we needed strategic planning followed by a course of action to motivate the students to volunteer for blood donation
2902564 the students made posters audio visual presentations and also performed skits at various symbiosis centers to spread their campaign
2902565 it was thoroughly a learning process we had to plan our campaigns and set our targets while knowing the tentative difficulties that would come our way
2902566 in the army things are expected to be organized but here we had to personally go to the students convince them and explain them the facts and clear their myths shared devanhalli
2902567 we were surprised to see a record number of students wanting to volunteer the blood donation
2902568 such kind of an activity gives the students a practical exposure and helps them learn things out of their books all they need is the correct guidance and motivation

2902576 nor am i greatly moved by the fact that many of the individuals we strike down in war are innocent that seems in a way to make war not worse but better all men die and most men miserably that two soldiers on opposite sides each believing his own country to be in the right each at the moment when his selfishness is most in abeyance and his will to sacrifice in the ascendant should kill each other in plain battle seems to me by no means one of the most terrible things in this very terrible world of course one of them at least must be mistaken and of course war is a very great evil but that is not the question the question is whether war is the greatest evil in the world so that any state of affairs which might result from submission is certainly preferable and i do not see any real cogent arguments for that view
2902577 i must disobey if i am called on by lawful authority to be a soldier
2902578 whole world was wrong until the day before yesterday and now has suddenly become right
2902579 i think the duty of non resistance is here stated as regards injuries simpliciter but without prejudice to anything we may have to allow later about injuries secundum quid that is in so far as the only relevant factors in the case are an injury to me by my neighbor and a desire on my part to retaliate then i hold that christianity commands the absolute mortification of that desire no quarter whatever is given to the voice within us which says hes done it to me so ill do the same to him but the moment you introduce other factors of course the problem is altered does anyone supposed that our lords hearers understood him to mean that if a homicidal maniac attempting to murder a third party tried to knock me out of his way i must stand aside and let him get his victim i think it equally impossible that they supposed him to mean that the best way of bringing up a child was to let it hit its parents whenever it was in a temper or when it grabbed at the jam to give it the honey also it seems unlikely that they christs audience would have ever supposed our lord to be referring to war war was not what they would have been thinking of the frictions of daily life among villagers were more likely to be in their minds

2902601 so at this point im thinking she was interested in me
2902602 so she agreed to have coffee and i said stop by sometime
2902603 never leave the next move up to the woman never never never
2902604 this is going to sound crazy but promise me youll do it
2902605 i want you to go to her apartment building and ring every bell of every apartment when people answer say im very sorry to bother you but i met a young lady here the other day and i failed to get her number do you know stephanie shes about this tall and describe her jim she will be so impressed women like assertive guys it will show her that your assertive and i promise you she will really be impressed
2902606 oh and a single rose one rose in a vase go there holding a rose and ring the bell of every unit in the building until you find her promise me youll do it
2902607 it is romantic jim you have to do this dont do it tomorrow do it today as soon as you get home jim you have to do this too often we let opportunities like this go by and then we have a dry spell and we end up kicking ourselves for the rest of our lives
2902608 okay well ill do it since you suggest it ill do it
2902609 i wonder if you could help me i met a young lady here the other day we exchanged pleasantries and agreed to meet i think her name is stephanie shes about five foot
2902610 i always find a reason to come back to theatre every time i get an opportunity
2902611 i am talking to veteran theatre personality barry john my mentor and guru who taught me theatre for seven years i would like to return to the stage with him since i am comfortable acting under his guidance i told barry a few days ago to think of a play in hindi in which we can team up together on stage
2902612 i have done my bit for the delhi stage i spent 11 years in the capital doing theatre for almost 18 hours a day
2902613 we were so engrossed with the stage and so happy that we almost forgot our dream of making it big in mumbai till of course shekhar kapur came to our rescue and reminded us that we had to pay our bills
2902614 we ashish vidyarthi piyush mishra and myself wanted to excel everyday and every hour piyush spent almost 10 years on the stage and ashish nearly seven years i do not have any regrets
2902615 i told them give some time to yourself there is no one to help them in mumbai no godfather and no uncle
2902616 but qualitatively it is as good in contrast western indian metropolises have a very commercial and vibrant gujarati stage because it caters to the masses
2902617 marathi theatre used to be good and experimental once upon a time with towering personalities like vijay tendulkar kolkata had equally good theatre but television has taken its toll people are now reluctant to leave the cushy comfort of their drawing room and their lcd and plasma television screens to watch theatres
2902618 i have come across so much talent on my journeys to native state bihar who cannot afford to come to delhi or mumbai
2902619 the media has a big role to play in popularising theatre
2902620 uljhaan and holi went on to become super hits i have also acted in brechts drums in the night directed by robin das
2902621 translating amrita pritams character into reality was tough because the character was so deeply rooted in literature and personally 1971 was the best film i have done till date

2902666 people harbor a vague fear over rapidly spreading unidentified epidemics
2902667 in the 2000s new epidemics such as sars anthrax and bird flu broke out zombie films capitalize on peoples fear that humans are unprepared for these possible epidemics

2902702 if the dvd is shown in just half of our congregations and schools and if it provides the needed encouragement to only a couple students in each of those institutions that would ultimately mean several thousand additional musicians who might one day be leading our congregational song

2902715 its very clear that green energy is now front and center in the minds of the business sector
2902716 not only will you see panels on the roofs of your local stores but i suspect very soon retailers will have stickers in their windows saying this is a green energy store
2902717 we want to keep pushing as many as we possibly can
2902718 its going to be the wal marts of the world that will buy these things over acres and make a difference

2902728 we are still investigating but so far cannot say for sure who shot the maasai youth
2902729 actually we only told the maasai not to graze in the area during day time they are free to bring their cattle at night
2902730 hes obviously sold out to special interests groups most of which are from phoenix
2902731 and the most disappointing thing is that i had thought that mr sposito had principles and its obvious now that he doesnt he sold those principles to the highest bidder
2902732 its unfortunate if frank has decided to go negative in this campaign it had been a good honest run for office for all of us
2902733 now hes on the defensive which tells me he has something to hide
2902734 at least the people giving me money can vote for me

2902736 i think businesses need to be accountable if theyre not following the law

2902747 one of the people that worked at the laboratory told me they had better security at a 7 eleven than they did at the laboratory where they had the most dangerous substances known to mankind
2902748 i think that anyone who is handling materials like this has a very heightened duty to make sure that they remain in a secure environment and that duty also extends to hiring employees who would be working in that environment to make sure that they are of sound mind
2902749 this guy was clearly a nut case and he wasnt a secret nut case and yet he was allowed to operate with unfettered access to these very lethal pathogens

2902767 i have a repeated opinion on you you are trying to cross the dark nights and reach to the world of love and light your letter suggests that you are very near to that light
2902768 i remember what you had told i am happy and satisfied with my life once you had explained me about your view on love
2902769 it is better to live and laugh than to be serious all the time
2902770 everything is okay we are living and surviving but our country is in peril people are killing people of the same nationality i think there is no meaning of sympathy to man
2902771 everything and one seems as if they are weeping for peace and security i cant remember the moment when mothers wait for their young sons to return from places of labor
2902772 see one has to compromise and deal with some problems in order to build or shine in the future

2902793 we had seen some strange lights while we were leaving indiana beach on lake shaffer
2902794 none of these objects made any sounds the only sound we heard was when a military jet flew over us and headed towards the objects the objects disappeared and never returned after a short chase by the military jet as we were driving home my sons mom called him to see if we had seen the strange lights in the sky she lives in rochester indiana which is about 40 miles from where we were at she said she was on the lake on her boat and noticed the lights darting around and flaring up
2902795 i heard a lot of noise that sounded like jet engines they were really low i stopped at a gas station to take a look and seen jets everywhere it was between nine and ten at night and they were chasing this big bright light that glowed red and yellow i guess all this was happening miles away from me in the sky but it looked closer i was at a gas station and everyone was looking at all this when i went inside the cashier said that he thought it was a ufo and everyone in there said the same thing i stopped somewhere between brookston and monticello
2902796 i heard you on coast to coast and wanted to report a bright light i seen near main street and 31 on the 24th 7 24 08 in rochester the light looked like a spotlight they use for store openings and i saw jets around it at 11pm my kid was with me and he got scared i called my wife and asked if she seen it we live near fulton avenue across town and she said the light was high in the sky above our house she didnt see the jets but heard them

2902953 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2902954 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2902955 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2902956 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2902957 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2902958 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2902959 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2902960 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2903030 california democrat nancy pelosi may be trying to save the planet but the rank and file in her party increasingly are just trying to save their political hides when it comes to gas prices as republicans apply more and more rhetorical muscle but what looks like intraparty tension on the surface is part of an intentional strategy in which pelosi takes the heat on energy policy while behind the scenes shes encouraging vulnerable democrats to express their independence if it helps them politically according to democratic aides on and off capitol hill
2903031 i understand why the republicans think they have that issue but the vast majority of the american people blame george bush and the oil companies for high gas prices
2903032 so i think that is an issue that ultimately will not help them

2903174 una volta il test della follia per un ministro era la volont di provare a riformare le ferrovie o le poste oggi la riforma della pubblica amministrazione
2903175 mi do un anno se a maggio 2009 mi accorgo che lencefalogramma della pubblica amministrazione ancora piatto allora mi dimetto se invece si vedranno i primi risultati della mia rivoluzione allora sar il momento di cominciare a lavorare di fino comparto per comparto e di realizzare un progetto a cui tengo molto una grande scuola per la pubblica amministrazione che sia un hub al centro di reti tra pubblico privato istituzioni italiane e straniere un catalizzatore del cambiamento
2903176 in queste condizioni un miracolo che qualcosa funzioni bisogna che la politica torni a comportarsi come un datore di lavoro i dirigenti a dirigere il mercato e gli utenti devono poter far sentire la loro voce i sindacati devono tornare a fare i sindacati invece che cercare di avere un ruolo da cogestori alla jugoslava
2903177 siamo nello slot temporale buono perch lingresso nelleuro ci ha privato dello strumento della svalutazione competitiva che drogava la crescita ora siamo costretti a cambiare oggi la gente si incazza pi di prima perch diventato palese che le imprese e le famiglie muoiono se non possono contare su una pubblica amministrazione efficiente

2903184 dal primo gennaio 2009 il cittadino consumatore che finora non aveva voce potr rivalersi contro la pubblica amministrazione con lassistenza delle associazioni dei consumatori in tempi brevissimi un giudice amministrativo verificher se lunit amministrativa contro la quale agisce il cittadino ha rispettato gli standard di qualit da essa stessa stabiliti se cos non stato o si ripristina il diritto violato o si caccia via il dirigente e un correttivo indispensabile in un mercato dove manca il piede invisibile che ne calcia fuori gli elementi inefficienti
2903185 sar un grande bypass nel sistema oggi la pubblica amministrazione monopolista del contatto con lutente io voglio aggiungere nuovi punti di contatto dove poter richiedere gli stessi servizi che fino ad ora solo limpiegato statale poteva offrire

2903187 il berlusconismo il centrosinistra doc noi riproponiamo la formula che ha portato al boom economico dellitalia
2903188 le cifre del documento sono calcolate sul livello attuale di crescita intorno al mezzo punto di pil precisa il ministro chiaro che se si ha pi crescita si possono tagliare le tasse io miglioro i servizi cos da stimolare la ripresa il mio obiettivo trasformare la pubblica amministrazione dalla palla al piede che stata finora in un fattore di sviluppo oggi linefficienza del settore pubblico ci costa tra il 30 e il 40 per cento della differenza di crescita che c tra noi e gli altri paesi europei bisogna anche considerare che i miei risultati produrranno leffetto equivalente di una riduzione della pressione fiscale perch le tasse non sono alte o basse in astratto ma in proporzione alla qualit del servizio che si ottiene in cambio
2903189 quello che immorale non la quantit di spesa pubblica ma linefficienza un abominio che viene pagato dai pi deboli che non possono comprarsi nel mercato parallelo privato servizi che la pubblica amministrazione non offre chi ha i soldi non ha problemi paga per avere gli arbitrati la sanit privata la scuola privata

2903196 it shows community wide prevention programmes are feasible among maori and likely to result in significant reductions in the incidence of diabetes
2903197 while the focus of tb control is on prompt case detection and effective treatment better housing conditions and reduced levels of crowding also have a role in controlling the spread of this disease
2903198 unlike some previous studies we were able to control for the effects of known risk factors notably poverty and migration from high incidence countries linking to census data also allowed us to include a relatively large number of cases
2903199 the finding that tb rates are associated with crowded living conditions fits with what we know about the transmission of this bacteria via small airborne droplets
2903200 household crowding increases opportunities for active cases to infect other household members particularly children
2903201 regrettably the answer is that we didnt find any decrease of thick melanoma over the last decade
2903202 there was the possibility that early detection and greater public awareness may have had an impact on later development of thick melanoma but so far that is not the case
2903203 the problem is that it is often quite difficult to identify thick melanomas early on
2903204 they tend to have a nodular shape but dont necessarily stick out above the surrounding skin or have an irregular edge theyre not always dark either and can be quite pale and flat
2903205 i dont think its in anyones interest whether it be telstra or anybody else to be continuously associated with workchoices
2903206 i dont think its in telstras interests to be seen to be the company that is still trying to implement workchoices
2903207 in a democracy if people want to be a member of a union then the unions got a right to represent them and companies should recognise that
2903208 it will certainly say to telstra and to other companies that if a majority of the employees want to try collectively bargaining then the employer has to join them at the bargaining table and have a go at it in good faith
2903209 we did not have many chances but we managed to score on set pieces

2903345 russia is fighting a war with us in our own territory
2903346 we on our own cannot fight with russia we want immediate cease fire immediate cessation of hostilities separation of russia and georgia and international mediation
2903347 ive expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn the bombing outside of south ossetia
2903348 russian aggression must not go unanswered and that its continuation would have serious consequences for its relations with the united states
2903349 russia for lord only knows what reason seems to have imperial ambitions in the tiny insignificant territory of south ossetia
2903350 how many divisions do you think i should use to invade the soviet union
2903351 i think we should step back and let another country of the un take the reins preferably one in europe
2903352 gee i wonder where those pesky russians ever got the idea to expand their empire into tiny insignificant countries that had nothing to do with 9 11 i dont get it
2903353 the majority of the roughly 70 000 people living in south ossetia are ethnically distinct from georgians they say they were forcibly absorbed into georgia under soviet rule and now want to exercise their right to self determination
2903354 in my view the strongest force of all one which grew and took fresh shapes and forms every day war the force not of any one individual but was that unmistakable sense of unanimity among the peoples of the world that war must somehow be averted the peoples of the british empire were at one with those of germany of france and of italy and their anxiety their intense desire for peace pervaded the whole atmosphere of the conference and i believe that that and not threats made possible the concessions that were made
2903355 non democratic nation russia has the right to invade a democratic nation georgia
2903356 the next question is what should the world do about it
2903357 it is well known that georgia has wmd harbors terrorists is an imminent threat to russia and was involved in the 9 11 attacks russia has every right to invade georgia and anyone who says otherwise is with the terrorists
2903358 the russians needless to say are not neutral as between mccain and obama
2903359 john mccains top foreign policy adviser lobbied for and has a vested interest in the republic of georgia and mccain has mirrored the position advocated by the government said obama spokesman hari sevugan
2903360 john mccains top foreign policy adviser lobbied for and has a vested interest in the republic of georgia and mccain has mirrored the position advocated by the government
2903361 the mccain camp responded with this statement the obama campaigns attacks on randy scheunemann are disgraceful mr scheunemann proudly represented a small democracy that is one of our closest allies in a very dangerous region today many are dead and georgia is in crisis yet the obama campaign has offered nothing more than cheap and petty political attacks that are echoed only by the kremlin the reaction of the obama campaign to this crisis so at odds with our democratic allies and yet so bizarrely in sync with moscow doesnt merely raise questions about senator obamas judgment it answers them
2903362 isreal has sent an armored division and a couple of fighter wings to georgia
2903363 fighting erupted after georgia attempted to retake control of south ossetia a small pro russian separatist province on thursday night russia poured tanks and troops across its southern border into georgia to push tbilisis troops back
2903364 its all a big distraction anyway while you people are freaking out over this little skirmish
2903365 i condemn russias aggressive actions and reiterate my call for an immediate ceasefire
2903366 russia must stop its bombing campaign cease flights of russian aircraft in georgian airspace and withdraw its ground forces from georgia
2903367 i strongly condemn the outbreak of violence in georgia and urge an immediate end to armed conflict
2903368 now is the time for georgia and russia to show restraint and to avoid an escalation to full scale war georgias territorial integrity must be respected
2903369 you do understand youre talking about civilians killed by georgia do you
2903370 it is often said that obama is not ready to be president but i dont think this is exactly right it seems pretty obvious that obama given his temperament his self regard his blithe ignorance of history and of the material conditions of life on this planet will never be ready to be president
2903371 the most compromised and the most intellectually weak leadership group in our nations history
2903372 so lets drive our suvs eat as much as we want and keep our thermostat on 72 degrees at all times and tell everyone else to go to hell will that work for you
2903373 its all a big distraction anyway while you people are freaking out over this little skirmish this is now going on
2903374 what constitutes a definition of fascism and fascist governments is a highly disputed subject that has proved complicated and contentious historians political scientists and other scholars have engaged in long and furious debates concerning the exact nature of fascism and its core tenets similarly fascism as an ideology is also hard to define
2903375 though the matter would have been simplified if obama had the sense to go along with mccains proposals
2903376 it really annoys me how conservative sic throw these words around but do not have a basic understand sic of their meanings i guess its just another scare tactic to win votes
2903377 socialists defenders of old style capitalism example sir ernest benn maintain that socialism and fascism are the same thing some catholic journalists maintain that socialists have been the principal collaborators in the nazi occupied countries the same accusation is made from a different angle by the communist party during its ultra left phases in the period 1930 35 the daily worker habitually referred to the labour party as the labour fascists this is echoed by other left extremists such as anarchists some indian nationalists consider the british trade unions to be fascist organizations

2903448 these actions have raised the costs of mortgage credit and reduced its availability
2903449 policy makers had been hoping they would move forward to provide more credit and now theyre just hoping they dont pull back
2903450 the cost of mortgage credit is getting pushed higher by the issues in the marketplace
2903451 they cant reduce their market exposure and that means more expensive mortgages

2903500 young children will be forced to celebrate the life of a man whose claim to fame is his sexual orientation

2903586 i do know that if it were mitt romney instead of john edwards this would be on the front page of the new york times
2903587 its not a rock and roll or rap thing people just love good music
2903588 kanye west and trent reznor we the exact same artist in different genres
2903589 the two sides of bernie thats a quiet weapon that i have
2903590 people say bernie hard he tell it like it is he curse they like for me to tell it if i came out doing bill cosby or billy crystal theyd have a fit one thing i do understand is this is an act im acting when i get offstage im done that man is dead when youre offstage thats the footprint thats the man gods gonna judge
2903591 bernie mac just says what you want to say but cant
2903592 then somebody wants to psychoanalyze you stretch you out on the couch go into the differences that might exist
2903593 all i know is i am very proud of the relationships he has established with different leaders
2903594 its also russian prime minister vladimir putin he gets criticized for that but i think its smart and wise and right that he has pleasant relationships with people and that they trust him i think hes developing that with french president nicolas sarkozy i know its there with putin
2903595 it doesnt mean you approve of what putin is doing or his denial of human rights in russia thats the thing that gets me about some of these critics they think if you establish a personal relationship that youre then signing off on everything that person does and thats not right
2903596 and i tell people one reason why was not only did he know what he was doing he was a fabulous father
2903597 people were probably saying to themselves here is memphis the buckle on the bible belt and isaac hayes is coming out onstage dressed as black moses
2903598 if you notice that album opened out with flaps kind of like a crucifix that was seen as pretty heavy for those times and that was the mystique about him wearing those chains
2903599 the first few shows i did with him he didnt wear the chains
2903600 but then he started wearing them and i think it represented to him the coming freedom of the black man
2903601 his music represented an identity of what it meant to be black
2903602 it was exciting in a kind of strength of course it all coincided with the civil rights movement and for a musician his was a different image coming out there onstage with no shirt and those chains man it was a whole other world
2903603 i remember we had been on the road and he came offstage and people were howling and grabbing for him and one of the musicians said man you are the black moses people will follow you anywhere it was really radical
2903604 so everything you hear on his albums he had hummed to himself first
2903605 he made the giraffe with his very long neck and the toucan with gigantic beak god must have had fun creating each one and all in just under a week
2903606 our ambitious plans for ruabon are aimed at rejuvenating the towns economy and providing jobs for local people
2903607 the location is ideal for such a development close to the centre of ruabon and adjacent to the major road links between wrexham and oswestry and represents an opportunity to revitalise ruabon
2903608 we are confident in delivering a high quality scheme which will be a valuable asset for the town and will attract much new business into the area acting as a major catalyst for the future regeneration of the town
2903609 sainsburys and liberty properties want to hear the views of as many local residents and businesses as possible and we are hosting a public exhibition where the plans will be on show and representatives from the project team will be available to discuss the development in greater detail
2903610 though there were areas of overlap we found that common motivations for self benefit included interaction with the birds a sense of achievement social interaction personal stimulation and enjoyment
2903611 past research shows that people take part in wildlife activities for many reasons and so require a sophisticated level of management our findings reinforce that
2903612 though self satisfaction motivations were mentioned most often people also had many unselfish reasons for taking part in conservation including helping this vulnerable species preserving nature for future generations and serving the community
2903613 with declining budgets most wildlife agencies are not well equipped to manage the growing number of species at risk so they are depending more on volunteers to help with wildlife management operations
2903614 for a long time in robotics there was this focus on a smart machine
2903615 you might have some complex robot that is sent to mars has a technical problem and then the mission is basically over
2903616 when the army made a daring advance ahead of the kilali jaffna forward defence lines sunday morning
2903617 sophisticated optical devices that are mechanically robust yet fully biodegradable biocompatible and implantable don
2903618 for example at a low cost we could potentially put a bioactive silk film in every bag of spinach and it could give the consumer a readout of whether or not e coli bacteria were in the bag before the food was consumed
2903619 we have optical devices embedded with enzymes that are still active after almost a year of storage at room temperature this is amazing given that the same enzyme becomes inactive if forgotten and left unrefrigerated for a few days
2903620 the third step for a de escalation would be the withdrawal of all troops on both sides but a withdrawal accompanied by observers
2903621 i said this violence is unacceptable i not only said it to russian prime minister vladimir putin ive said it to the president of the country dmitry medvedev
2903622 and look i expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn bombing outside of south ossetia
2903623 and i was very firm with vladimir putin just like i was firm with the russian president
2903624 there needs to be a international mediation there for the south ossetia issue
2903625 i dont know if either one of us has a lot to be proud of today
2903626 i spent a lot of time in the fitness trailer ive got an elbow issue
2903627 so i was warming it up and then id go practice then re warm it up and then go to practice again
2903628 the designers have delivered a fantastic overall look and i am confident that team gb will make an impact
2903629 royal indian culture is the inspiration for my colourful collection because indian culture and tradition is simply fascinating
2903630 indian tradition offers so much variety and it is up to the designer to create unusual and different designs from that
2903631 i wanted to do it for a long time but it never happened due to my other work commitments its better late than never
2903632 bridal wear is an important part of indian collection and it needs to be addressed though it was not easy to achieve but finally i have made it and i am happy about it
2903633 my collection has something for everyone the usp of my collection is the revival of the sari

2903646 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
2903647 youve lied to us and fucked with us and treated us like garbage for nearly two decades how can it get worse bite me
2903648 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
2903649 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
2903650 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
2903651 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
2903652 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
2903653 russian aggression must not go unanswered and that its continuation would have serious consequences for its relations with the united states
2903654 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
2903655 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
2903656 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
2903657 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
2903658 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
2903659 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
2903660 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
2903661 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
2903662 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
2903663 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
2903664 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
2903665 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
2903666 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
2903667 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
2903668 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
2903669 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
2903670 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
2903671 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
2903672 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
2903673 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
2903674 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
2903675 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
2903676 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
2903677 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
2903678 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
2903679 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
2903680 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
2903681 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
2903682 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
2903683 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
2903684 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
2903685 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
2903686 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
2903687 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
2903688 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
2903689 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
2903690 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
2903691 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
2903692 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
2903693 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
2903694 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
2903695 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
2903696 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
2903697 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
2903698 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
2903699 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
2903700 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
2903701 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
2903702 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
2903703 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
2903704 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
2903705 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
2903706 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
2903707 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
2903708 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
2903709 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
2903710 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
2903711 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
2903712 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
2903713 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
2903714 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
2903715 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
2903716 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
2903717 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
2903718 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
2903719 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
2903720 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
2903721 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
2903722 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
2903723 who are open to doing something on the production side
2903724 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
2903725 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
2903726 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
2903727 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
2903728 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
2903729 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
2903730 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
2903731 if there is no struggle there is no progress those who profess to favor freedom and deprecate agitation are men who want crops without plowing up the ground they want rain without thunder and lightning power concedes nothing without a demand it never did and it never will
2903732 is really a tale of two affairs one that news outlets want to hype and one that news outlets want to ignore
2903733 every kid is always talking about what his parents have been through
2903734 and no kid has any clue what hes talking about
2903735 but now i realize had i been given the opportunity what i could have been and im about to die
2903736 we have a choice we can keep complaining about greed fraud and cutthroat business practices we can put up with the daily stress of unsuccessfully juggling jobs and family we can tell ourselves theres nothing we can do about policies that damage our natural environment create huge gaps between haves and have nots and lead to untold suffering or we can join together to help construct a saner sounder more caring economics and culture
2903737 now to highlight what a charade proper air pressure is the mccain campaign has started handing out barack obama energy plan tire gauges you see its a great way to drive home what a ridiculous plan this is plus its an easy way to check your tire pressure and that can save you a lot of money thats not just me talking the governments own website says that proper tire inflation can save up to 12 cents a gallon immediately so thank you for the tire gauge senator mccain and good work you stuck it to all the left wing nutjobs who advocate proper tire inflation radical liberals like your potential vice presidential nominee florida governor charlie crist arnold schwarzenegger joe lieberman triple a and the pinkos over at nascar ive had my eyes on those guys ever since they had that car sponsored by the aclu
2903738 security is very tight for the olympics in china which has been very hard on the locals there many stores and factories in beijing have been forced to close and people have been forced out of their houses sort of like here in the united states only for them it ends in a couple of weeks
2903739 a hardworking person is going to work and out of the darkness is gunned down its one of those horrible things
2903740 regrettably the answer is that we didnt find any decrease of thick melanoma over the last decade
2903741 there was the possibility that early detection and greater public awareness may have had an impact on later development of thick melanoma but so far that is not the case
2903742 the problem is that it is often quite difficult to identify thick melanomas early on
2903743 they tend to have a nodular shape but dont necessarily stick out above the surrounding skin or have an irregular edge theyre not always dark either and can be quite pale and flat
2903744 are these birds really and truly cute are people just trying to humour me will placing these birds in our twig and flower centrepieces be way over the top are my little feathered friends tacky
2903745 because you see tacky is in the eye of the beholder and there is always always going to be someone who sees things differently than you
2903746 ik voelde me zo goed voor de partij maar er lukte vrijwel niets
2903747 we zakten helemaal weg we probeerden van alles maar er is geen moment geweest dat we echt in de wedstrijd zaten
2903748 het zou ons in ieder geval goed uitkomen als pohl en rau van de amerikaansen verliezen we hebben normaal gesproken kansen tegen ze

2903851 i really needed to recover so when i touched the wall at the finish and saw i was second i was really excited
2903852 every process in our industrial world creates waste heat it s energy that we just throw away
2903853 now that we have access to intermediates that were not previously available people will want to do careful studies on their pharmacological activity and we were getting yields of 100 to 200 milligrams per litre which is respectable for potentially valuable molecules with relatively simple optimisation of the fermentation you could obtain 10 or 100 times more than this
2903854 its very exciting that plant alkaloid pathways are starting to be reconstituted in microbes very importantly smolke has also shown how this strain can be used to discover new enzymes that catalyse biosynthetic transformations
2903855 we are now hoping to extend the pathway both ways to get a broader range of intermediates downstream including the end products and to be able to start with simpler substrates upstream
2903856 the system will also allow us to start producing non natural alkaloids by using enzymes from different sources and in combinations that do not occur in nature

2903858 usually it takes three men and two months to build any type of ship but this time we needed at least five to 10 builders to work on it over eight months to make it ready it was a hard but enjoyable job
2903859 the most difficult part will be circumnavigating around the cape of good hope where many shipwrecks are testimony to the difficult conditions there

2903927 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
2903928 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
2903929 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
2903930 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
2903931 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
2903932 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection
2903933 we had one that we used in a sting for school zones
2903934 hopefully well have the new one by the time school starts again
2903935 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
2903936 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
2903937 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
2903938 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
2903939 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
2903940 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
2903941 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
2903942 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
2903943 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
2903944 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
2903945 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
2903946 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
2903947 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
2903948 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
2903949 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools

2903956 it passed so quickly that i wished to go again because it was so much fun
2903957 if chinas team has a good competition i think the gold medal
2903958 i like to draw it is an activity i rely on a dependency of sorts drawing gives me an immediate return for my effort and the result is commensurate with my involvement it is an activity that requires solitude it is the most concentrated space in which i work

2903961 if chinas team has a good competition i think the gold medal
2903962 the medal around my neck that was my motivation i saw katie and just said lets try and catch her and thats what i did
2903963 it feels absolutely amazing it hasnt sunk in yet im just over the moon
2903964 were very proud to be british two british girls on the podium what more could we ask for
2903965 i just congratulated her and told her its been way too long
2903966 i think this is definitely the best british team weve ever had and were getting better and better
2903967 i dont know what happened i just couldnt get myself into shape we italians havent got used to the competition in the morning we never practice that
2903968 i felt like i should have got my hand on the wall first
2903969 the race was very difficult it was slower than last night but it was more about racing
2903970 i dont think either of us panicked when we were behind
2903971 he confirmed this in writing to the swimming federation weve also spoken with the national olympic committee and they have underlined to us that all their athletes compete here in the right spirit against athletes from any nationality
2903972 we take both the athlete and the national olympic committee at their word on this
2903973 it passed so quickly that i wished to go again because it was so much fun
2903974 i can probably speak for all of them and say we all want to be out on the mat competing we all want to be no 1
2903975 the thing is if you lose youve got to be there to support the ones who won its an individual sport but you cant do it alone
2903976 nobodys ever going to read about them in the paper
2903977 back home friends are going hey youre going to beijing and its like yeah but im not an olympian its tough to be able to say ok this is the guy that beat me but im going to help him win the gold that takes a pretty special person
2903978 you have to go witness the olympic games and really go see what its about
2903979 that was the thing to see these guys to out there and wrestle their hearts out it chokes you up to know that youre a part of that you are invested because it is us against them
2903980 but the perspective i give them is its all vital and this is where the team aspect comes in every medal we win a piece of that is attributed to them
2903981 youre here for a job you go from being selfish to selfless if theyre waking up at 7 im waking up at 6 i understand the stress theyre under and the pressure i want to make sure the energy is already felt as they walk in to practice and not have to create it on their own so my job is to basically get the party started
2903982 the medal around my neck that was my motivation i saw katie and just said lets try and catch her and thats what i did
2903983 it feels absolutely amazing it hasnt sunk in yet im just over the moon
2903984 were very proud to be british two british girls on the podium what more could we ask for

2903990 i dont think either of us panicked when we were behind
2903991 a champion for working families and one of the most effective and empathetic voices in the country today
2903992 obama started negative campaigning on john mccain long before we started punching back and i think a lot of our effort is really to get back into this game try and galvanize some of the public attention back onto this race make sure everybody understands theres two people in this race not just one and i think weve been successful in doing that
2903993 taong 2005 pa nakakakuha na kami ng balita na nagbubuo sila mga pi ol ng mga vigilante group laban sa milf at sa npa new peopless army sa north cotabato

2903998 pangalawa kahit na nasasaklawan ng bje ang potensiyal na mga rekurso ng enerhiya tulad ng langis at natural gas sa lugar mananatili ito sa operasyon ng sentral na gobyerno grp sa panahon ng national emergency o kung kinakailangan ng pampublikong interes

2904001 the market was still going strong and budgets were more robustt and there were a few more during that era

2904008 we have approached these testing market conditions fully aware of the likely implications for our businesses from a higher cost and reduced availability of funding to a possible deterioration of credit quality across the sector
2904009 im focused on getting everything done i can get done between now and january 19th
2904010 we believe there is a possibility of a real economic downturn here and further continued difficulties in the credit market
2904011 if you look at the consensus forecasts theres a strong possibility of further declines in uk house prices and this type of scenario needs to be built into firms business models
2904012 when we come through that history tells us thats not something thats going to play through in months its going to be well through the year end
2904013 wed expect people to plan on that type of assumption and weve been working with individual institutions to ensure we are comfortable with their longer term plans
2904014 we deem the longer term plan to be that sort of time horizon
2904015 if people want to dampen down these cycles and to ensure banks are less likely to violently react in a downturn to some degree they will have to accept there will be less on the upturn as well
2904016 the volatile global capital market conditions have made and continue to make business conditions uncertain and forecasting in the short term difficult
2904017 i would be delighted for rio if he was made england captain
2904018 obviously i hope its rio as he is a team mate of mine and it would be great for the club
2904019 he is certainly the best defender in the club at the moment and it would be well deserved
2904020 but if it was one of the others then i wouldnt be too disappointed because the most important thing is to play and anything else is just a bonus
2904021 rio is now the best centre half in the world by far
2904022 that was an exemplary performance he did not give one foul away and intercepted every ball that came towards him
2904023 he broke out of defence in comfort so many times it was unbelievable he is a magnificent player
2904024 he is almost 30 now and because he has experience his potential is now being fulfilled in a big way
2904025 i am sure we will find out in due course
2904026 of course it would be an honour but my main concern at the moment is manchester united

2904028 i got to thinking about the point in every freelancers life where he has to decide whether he wants to a have a social life and do art in his spare time or b do art and have a social life in his spare time it has always seemed to me that if you have any hope of making a living as an artist writer musician whatever you absolutely must learn to tell people to leave you alone and to mean it and to eject them from your life if they dont respect that this is necessary not because your job is more important than anyone because a great many people will think of you as not having a job oh how wonderful you can work whenever you want to well yes to a point but generally whenever you want to had better be most of the time or else you wont have a roof over your head
2904029 were talking about the death of a man its a big investigation
2904030 israel should be proud of its military which trained georgian soldiers
2904031 the russians have lost more than 50 tanks and we have shot down 11 of their planes they have enormous damage in terms of manpower
2904032 gal hirsh and israel ziv are mainly training and consulting georgian arm units
2904033 to every israeli agent representing an israeli defense company is attached a cousin of the defense minister who opens the doors for him
2904034 the israeli military industries upgraded in recent years the georgian air force sold unmanned aerial vehicles uav advanced artillery systems and trained infantry units
2904035 indeed the media was quick to call both the moves as an attempt to revamp old alliances and indeed as yet another sign that modi is planning on entering the national political scene sooner that later
2904036 in addition to the drupa trade show which can be deemed satisfactory overall we have also been putting a great deal of work into our medium to long term strategy this has made it clear that the all in all increasing costs call for a further significant adjustment to our cost structures the package of measures adopted takes into account all key areas

2904043 at present we do not know anything about how the explosions occurred and we are waiting to learn about its cause
2904044 we werent even advised that they were going to be there
2904045 they just moved in and weve been concerned since they were there that something like this would happen
2904046 ive expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn the bombing outside of south ossetia
2904047 russian aggression must not go unanswered and that its continuation would have serious consequences for its relations with the united states
2904048 the vice president expressed the united states solidarity with the georgian people and their democratically elected government in the face of this threat to georgias sovereignty and territorial integrity
2904049 he listened politely i cant read his mind but i do know that every time i met with him i pressed the point
2904050 we dont want adults sending mixed messages to children that its ok to shoot up drugs in order to become a star because its not ok
2904051 we cannot just go out alone on this and talk and act unilaterally
2904052 were alarmed by this entire situation and every escalatory step is a further problem
2904053 right now our focus is on working with both sides with the europeans and with a whole variety of international institutions and organizations to get the fighting to stop

2904223 the jobs market has been one of the few bright spots in the uk economy but cracks are appearing in the face of an increasingly uncertain economic outlook
2904224 even if we avoid the scale of jobs fallout suffered in previous downturns the era of the candidates recruitment market is already over with people in work becoming increasingly anxious that their p45 might soon be on its way
2904225 with pay pressure still subdued mounting job insecurity is being compounded by a significant squeeze on workers real incomes but the absence of any sign of an emerging wage price spiral at least offers greater hope that the bank of england might soon be able to cut interest rates to head off the threat of recession
2904226 companies are now reacting to deteriorating market conditions with sales slowing and input costs rising but scope to raise prices limited by weakening demand finances are under pressure costs the main area over which businesses retain control are taking the strain with employers seeking both to keep a lid on pay settlements and in increasing numbers planning for redundancies the labour market is suddenly looking a lot less resilient

2904236 he told me about the new way of doing it and i said that was fine with me
2904237 but as little incision as possible would be great for me because it would heal faster
2904238 i had no discomfort at all around the actual incision
2904239 the goal is not to just have one incision the goal is to remove a gallbladder safely

2904264 the projected supply of skilled networking workers is not expected to keep pace with demand resulting in an 8 gap or 60 000 full time skilled workers each year over the next three years
2904265 wireless networking skills will have the highest growth and the greatest skill gap percentage of all the specialties we examined
2904266 by 2011 there will be a demand for nearly 45 000 it professionals with wireless networking skills nearly 132 growth from 2007 at the same time only about 28 000 such professionals will be available in north america this leaves a gap of nearly 38 of demand
2904267 one strategy leveraged by enterprises facing a skills shortage is to short circuit the need for years of experience and instead require a certification in a relevant technology
2904268 one strategy that companies use to mitigate the impact of the networking skill gap is to share job roles and tasks between multiple workers
2904269 perform several network jobs network design installation configuration and so on in addition to performing work in other areas of it and even non it related work for their companies

2904277 the big changes are expected next year when the league is expected to go to proportionate sizing for the first time meaning equipment will be based on goalies size and weight

2904279 i didnt think much about this when it was announced last week but apparatley the 6 20 per game season ticket package is flying off the racks so to speak as of wednesday the 300 level season ticket deal offered here had sold over 650 tickets im not sure how many are left but i would have to think that theres not many left
2904280 so expect to hear another deal coming soon that offers a full season package for 1 599 to sit in the lower level south end zone that averages out to 39 per game for lower bowl tickets at this rate getting into the building the hockey season might be a bit difficult to pull off if you are hoping to pick and choose single game seats

2904334 georgia expresses its readiness to immediately start negotiations with the russian federation on a ceasefire and termination of hostilities
2904335 in certain zones near tskhinvali russian peacekeepers met active confrontation
2904336 i expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn bombing outside of south ossetia
2904337 we must find the means for an immediate ceasefire accepted by both sides we must talk about negotiations and a political solution there is no military solution
2904338 they were on a mass scale and were directed against individuals
2904339 i think the georgian issue is helping the market to focus back on the supply side that has really changed the market quite a bit
2904340 the task of the russian forces at present is to ensure control of south ossetia the pipelines would be in danger only if the war escalated
2904341 id made the top ten riders in the regional before

2904364 it has slowly been growing as a target people are more and more interested in
2904365 there are a lot more people getting into it and really getting their hands dirty
2904366 ive been seeing a lot of reverse engineering on the apple platform
2904367 windows developers take their code and make it work on apple
2904368 they could take potential vulnerabilities with them or possibly create new ones because they are working on an entirely different platform
2904369 it shows people are getting proficient at analysing apple software

2904390 to call it aphobia fearlessness is without meaning this is just thesis expressed as antithesis
2904391 dogs in a pack find courage to take on a lion each hound knows his place he fears the dog ranked above and feeds off the fear of the dog below fear conquers fear this is how we spartans do it counterposing to fear of death a greater fear that of dishonor of exclusion from the pack
2904392 but is this courage is not acting out of fear of dishonor still in essence action out of fear
2904393 you young men imagine we veterans have mastered fear but we feel it as keenly as you fear lives within us 24 hours a day
2904394 we cobble our courage together fear of disgracing the city the king the heroes of our lines fear of proving ourselves unworthy of our wives and children i know all the tricks i know how to close with my man how to convince myself that his terror is greater than my own i employ care for the men serving beneath me and seek to forget my own fear in concern for their survival but it is always there
2904395 when a warrior fights not for himself but for his brothers when his most passionately sought goal is neither glory nor his own lifes preservation but to spend his substance for his comrades not to abandon them not to prove unworthy of them then his heart has truly achieved contempt for death and with that he transcends himself and his actions touch the sublime

2904399 as long as i hung in there i knew i would get my opportunity
2904400 and the putts there was no question i was just fully focused on holing them
2904401 its nice when youve got to hole a putt that you see the line right away
2904402 it was an easy putt to read it was a double break i hit it a cup right of the hole
2904403 i knew the pace was about right i wanted to see it break i was just saying go on keep going keep going break it broke right left and got just inside the left half and dropped very nice
2904404 you are no duke with a famous name no broad american with a red indian figure level brooding eyes and a skin tempered by the air of the prairies and the rivers that flow through them you have never journeyed to the seven seas and voyaged on them wherever they may be i dont know where so why pray should a pretty girl like myself go with you
2904405 you forget that no automobile swings you through the street in long thrusts i see no gentlemen escorting you in a close half circle pressing on your skirts from behind and murmuring blessings on your head your breasts are well laced into you bodice but your thighs and hips make up for that restraint you are wearing a taffeta dress with a pleated skirt such as delighted all of us last autumn and yet you smile inviting mortal danger from time to time
2904406 yes were both in the right and to keep us from being irrevocably aware of it hadnt we better just go our separate ways home
2904407 you are no shlongy with a cock the size of your forearm to please me no flash harry with a silver tongue to moisten my loins you cant even hold your drink and your vomit reeks to high heaven that shriveled scrap of gristle dangling between your legs is of less use to a pretty girl like myself than a bicycle is to a salmon
2904408 ill admit the drink made me dizzy that youre here in my bed is proof positive but its that festering fishpot youre harboring between cellulite thighs that made me sick is it any wonder my stomach rebelled as bad as the stench of my puke may be it cant but improve on your tunaboat there

2904420 i think theres such a hunger for change and you saw that in how smoothly things went said gov deval patrick of massachusetts a platform committee co chair

2904422 caucuses inherently disenfranchise the elderly disabled shift workers single parents and others whose circumstances prohibit participation in caucuses further the 2008 primaries illustrated that a caucus vote is worth more than a primary vote because each delegate elected by caucuses represents fewer votes than each delegate elected by primary

2904482 after taking two devastating losses like we did in the last minutes it was good to be able to come back and answer the call when all the adversity was against us and they had the momentum on their side

2904488 we came out like gangbusters and gave them an opportunity to come back

2904526 i just kept it simple broken english so he could understand me
2904527 you got to tip your hat off to somebody that does something like that in a pressure packed race thats a hell of a swim and he is a true champion
2904528 you definitely had to bring your a game to win a medal and those three guys that beat me did
2904529 were seeing world records get broken like its the easiest thing in the world and its not everyones swimming fast everyones got a smile on his face and its been fun so far
2904530 i think thats the first time hes worn a jammer in two years
2904531 i hope to talk him into something that will cover more of his body
2904532 i dont want to be the center of attention going into the final
2904533 i dont swim well when im the center of attention
2904534 we are definitely not out of it to get a team silver or gold
2904535 i was delighted by the way the team took up the challenge and attacked the course and we were pleased with the way they all finished afterwards all our horses are good jumpers but you never know what the cross country may have taken out of the them
2904536 hes a relentless galloper but i was concerned about that fence and yogi knew it
2904537 the horses were generally finishing better than we had thought we were lucky with the weather although the course became pretty slippery in several places
2904538 i was really really pleased with him said cook of the 10 year old miners frolic
2904539 hes a super jumper but we had not had the smoothest of weeks
2904540 the plane journey really took it out of him but the morale throughout the team has been very high it was a do or die effort and he put his best foot forward
2904541 we are both so happy to have two british girls on the podium i dont think either of us expected it and especially a gold and a bronze its absolutely amazing
2904542 it hasnt sunk in yet im just over the moon
2904543 i didnt really know what to expect this morning because it was a hard swim last night to get into the final for two british girls to get on the podium is amazing and i am so happy for both of us its great for british swimming
2904544 it was a lot harder this morning we just tried to ignore the times and race the final
2904545 i dont think either of us are natural sprinters we dont do the 100m free so we are naturally suited to the back half of the race
2904546 we didnt panic when we were a little bit behind i didnt see anyone past katie i didnt know what was going on i couldnt see what there was on the other side of the pool i saw katie and just tried to catch her
2904547 i went out a bit slow yesterday so i wanted to go faster today and managed to hold on
2904548 im confident i like being the underdog i like going in and being someone that no one really recognises
2904549 i knew there was a small chance someone would pull out and i just smashed my pb there so im really happy
2904550 i found out last night at 10pm so that had me up for another two hours
2904551 i was mostly relieved and then i knew i could make the final im feeling a bit lucky in this meet so hopefully if all goes well you never know what can happen anyone in the final is going for a medal and thats what im going to be doing
2904552 the last 12 hours have been an emotional rollercoaster for me but anything that doesnt kill you makes you stronger im gaining all the experience i need so im really happy
2904553 es un gobierno justo que gobierna para todos y a todos atiende sin distingos de colores partidistas
2904554 a pesar de que juan sabines no es pri sta cumple con ser gobernador para todos sin colores partidistas
2904555 no votaste por mi en tu comunidad no te voy a dar apoyos
2904556 eso es muy mezquino porque cuando se llega a ser gobierno se tiene que gobernar para todos las cuestiones de partido se deben hacer a un lado aunque es l gico que hay preferencia para quienes votaron por l pero no se puede hacer a un lado a todos los dem s no se puede partir a un municipio y negar apoyos a quienes no votaron por l deber an de aprender del ejemplo del gobernador juan sabines
2904557 a nadie de ustedes se le ha pedido ni un centavo
2904558 set out the framework within which each government department will be expected to operate and deliver our manifesto commitments
2904559 this conference in a very very very important one for the party its got to set a very clear idea of where were going
2904560 whats that funcom you have age of conan thats cute we just printed the end user agreements from 700 000 of our subscribers and used them as liner in our 3 million exotic bird aviary
2904561 this innovative scavenger hunt enables us to reward our target audience and give them a direct call to action to go see tropic thunder
2904562 with this piece of delicious dama gazelle carcass we hope to reward our target bengal tiger using this innovative snare
2904563 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
2904564 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
2904565 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
2904566 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
2904567 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
2904568 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
2904569 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
2904570 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
2904571 is your senior portrait session really the last time youre allowed to feel pretty cute amp special
2904572 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
2904573 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
2904574 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
2904575 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
2904576 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
2904577 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
2904578 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
2904579 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
2904580 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
2904581 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
2904582 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
2904583 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
2904584 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
2904585 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
2904586 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
2904587 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
2904588 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
2904589 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
2904590 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
2904591 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
2904592 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
2904593 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
2904594 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
2904595 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
2904596 the lord of the rings the return of the king
2904597 its almost unheard of summer doesnt usually afford films that much of a wide open playing field
2904598 it has taken on a life of its own and in doing so got so much positive press and word of mouth that older audiences who normally dont rush out to see movies or maybe only see two three movies a year are coming out in large numbers
2904599 its a question of weve been reading about this for three four weeks now
2904600 quite frankly its nice to know that everything else is still kind of doing some business
2904601 were so very satisfied to be at 40 million plus after five days you couldnt ask for more
2904602 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
2904603 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
2904604 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
2904605 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
2904606 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
2904607 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
2904608 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
2904609 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
2904610 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
2904611 the weather was perfect the crowd was bigger than we thought it would be and the handle was terrific
2904612 from a money aspect it seems like we have the sponsors to do something maybe well combine some of the smaller stakes into one big one perhaps we can start our own tradition
2904613 we were very appreciative of the reaction from the crowd
2904614 we had one hiccup that we couldnt control other than that it was a great day it was one of the tops in my 30 years
2904615 its especially rare in races for 2 year olds theyre just learning the game its a risky wager but thats racing
2904616 when you think about the adios and all of the people its quite a feeling its quite a feeling
2904617 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
2904618 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
2904619 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
2904620 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
2904621 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
2904622 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
2904623 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
2904624 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
2904625 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
2904626 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
2904627 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
2904628 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
2904629 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
2904630 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
2904631 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
2904632 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
2904633 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
2904634 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
2904635 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
2904636 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
2904637 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
2904638 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
2904639 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
2904640 my wife and i will stay in england where democracy is more important
2904641 what happened to me and my family and my close relations resulted from efforts to get rid of me from politics
2904642 he cannot vote we have also heightened our security in the camp and others camps in the philippines in connection with the armm election
2904643 im very happy they are the olympic champions so even when we had 20 points in the third game we could not take anything for granted it wasnt until we got that final point that we could celebrate
2904644 now we have a day off and we just hope to keep the momentum going
2904645 its okay we have thought this before losing we tried our best and have no regrets
2904646 unbelievable jason finished that race way better than we could have even asked for
2904647 for that last 50 i was thinking this is going to be one close race
2904648 the last 10 to 15 meters were incredible i lost my voice and i was definitely pretty emotional after that
2904649 i knew i had to accelerate but it got harder
2904650 the renewed fighting in north cotabato goes to show that when the government bungles the peace negotiation it is the citizens who suffer
2904651 we have been at peace for over 20 years and the peace process has been mishandled we are being victimized every now and then by small groups that threaten to bomb or occupy some areas
2904652 the imminent refugee crisis is an unacceptable cost of the governments mismanagement of the peace process a peace process should lead to the protection of life and property and yet whats happening is the opposite
2904653 can they deliver their troops dictate to their people in the group to stop the hostilities i dont think they have the moral ascendancy to actually end this
2904654 we were thinking how can we take it to the next level
2904655 and that led to a review of district policies and the teacher contract
2904656 we dont have enough control of our own decisions on site how and when we hire teachers determining our own schedule and calendar i could go on and on
2904657 this is what they want us to do this year
2904658 we chose these books and curriculum or this behavior code or this structure to our schedule because it fits best with our beliefs of how we can serve our students
2904659 ill sort of do what they told me to do even if much of it doesnt make much sense to me
2904660 even if hamdan were acquitted of the charges that are before him
2904661 he would still be considered an enemy combatant and therefore would continue to be subjected to subject to continued detention of course that said he would also have the opportunity to go before the administrative review board and they could determine whether he is a suitable candidate for release or transfer but in the near term at least we would consider him an enemy combatant and still a danger and would likely still be detained for some period of time thereafter
2904662 we expect to have a few students there for about a week
2904663 i must apologise again for deciding to come to live inengland if i am fortunate enough i will return and die onthai soil just like other thais
2904664 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2904665 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2904666 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2904667 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2904668 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2904669 although there has been no news it could even be someonein the middle east someone like emirates because there is stillstrong growth in that region and those carriers are less impactedby oil prices
2904670 but china eastern is still quite hostile to air china
2904671 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2904672 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2904673 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2904674 its possible that there are differences but its extremely improbable
2904675 this is still an open investigation so i cant go into details or provide you a description of samples
2904676 however we stand by our test results which demonstrated a genetic match to the serotype salmonella saintpaul in both samples of water used for irrigation and composite samples of serrano peppers
2904677 its not the mexico you think of with the donkey pulling the plow
2904678 what makes this outbreak notable is the number of persons that has become sickened with this same strain
2904679 weve eaten peppers since i was a little girl and have never had a problem
2904680 its as if they were to tell us not to eat tortillas
2904681 obama has criticized bush for his fiscal irresponsibility and now hes using bushs baseline as a yardstick by which to measure fiscal responsibility
2904682 congress hasnt agreed to extend the bush tax cuts because they dont have the money to pay for it
2904683 its not unreasonable to say were inheriting a budget thats going to have substantial deficits into the future
2904684 said a democratic congressional aide who spoke on condition of anonymity so he could speak candidly
2904685 proposed and agreed to at the third quarterly communication preceding the
2904686 that if a brother should be a rebel against the state he is not to be
2904687 a mason is obliged by his tenure to obey the moral law
2904688 should live honestly that is to say without reproach 97 should injure nobody and render to every one his just due
2904689 this things going to crest a half a billion soon who knows maybe it will be a 1 billion marketplace at some point in time
2904690 however what i really liked is in the past year hes made a concerted effort to be a better rebounder and use his size inside to take advantage of matchups
2904691 coach rick barnes said he needed a bigger version of a j abrams
2904692 look i had five dunks in one game thats because of the crowd
2904693 last time i had five dunks in a game i was like 17 so thats all because of the energy in this crowd i think they knew that history was being made tonight and obviously it was a proud moment for their country as it was for ours you could feel the electricity
2904694 it was our first game we were very anxious we missed shots that we normally would hit but at the end of the day you win by almost 30 points youve got to take good things out of that
2904695 we played very very hard we give ourselves a chance defensively every night thats what its all about with us
2904696 we came out a little tight we knew that it was going to be a very emotional game for both teams especially china playing in front of their home crowd
2904697 we withstood the storm we calmed down and we just played a lot better basketball
2904698 create a caring community of students helping one another grow
2904699 i was a high school teacher and a lot of my friends were teachers and i just saw the huge difference in teacher quality across schools
2904700 things are really different in predominantly minority schools from the schools in neighborhoods for mostly caucasians the reading levels are very different
2904701 young teachers want to be dealing with their education and helping them learn not getting them out of trouble
2904702 austin has one of the most segregated school systems which equals one of most inequitable
2904703 thats the sad part because those are the kids who need the best teachers we give the worst were giving them teachers who can barely pass the certification test
2904704 these were out of state folks who complained to us about this company
2904705 we took quick action because of the chance for real harm
2904706 we believe this litigation is going to give us more complaints we only have a handful of folks that have been affected by this right now
2904707 what we want to know of course is if others are out there who have been scammed
2904708 im sure all of our guys are having a rough time with it
2904709 it was just a tremendous explosion and blew all the windows out of the house just blew the house up and i just managed to get out of there in time
2904710 its kind of nice because it sits on the hill and some nice breezes come up here
2904711 one of the things that we like about including other builders is the fact that you get some diversity into the neighborhood
2904712 a mixed income community makes for a healthier community across the board
2904713 building ownership into this part of the community is really good
2904714 they are sort of easy listening and some of their albums get a little spacey in a good way
2904715 when i was a teenager i listened to the beatles and stones and some of the doors
2904716 you can talk about records before it or records after it
2904717 kind of like you can talk about painting before and after picasso or music before and after the rite of spring
2904718 whenever im at a party or meeting with friends especially if they are into older stuff or something kind of oddball ill talk with them
2904719 also i tend to be the type that will look through the dollar section or the stack of 78s that are a quarter and take chances when its only a dollar or a quarter you can take chances ive gotten some real shit that way but ive also picked up a lot of great gems
2904720 there are too many genres and too many time periods that can confine it
2904721 originally it was a lot more ramshackle and helter skelter than it is now i would just grab records and try to make something of it now its very well planned out sometimes they are thematic or ive done whole shows devoted to one artist sometimes one genre or time period like a couple of months ago i did one on 20s and 30s blues records
2904722 i think when i started collecting records 20 years ago i was trying to find the answer what answer i have no idea but at 18 i was like theres got to be an answer this is something weird it continues i havent found it yet
2904723 if you think about a typical day your hottest period of the day is around 3 oclock in the afternoon the coolest is probably midnight
2904724 the chillers ramp up to meet the cooling demands for the 3 oclock time and ramps down at midnight
2904725 when you have the load growth youre talking about its how do you meet that load its a lot easier to justify a project thats going to cost 12 million than one thats going to cost 40 million
2904726 theyre using them to drive from residence halls to class which is a two or three block commute
2904727 we thought how can we provide an incentive to get them out of that behavior
2904728 i think a big draw is the just the environmental aspect
2904729 and honestly i think that anything free when youre in college is good especially something like a bike that is worth something
2904730 what we will be targeting is the nuisance crimes that make the appearance of downtown to be unsafe
2904731 that is not the case and we need to change that perception
2904732 we want to use this initiative to start the school year off on the right track to set the standard so then hopefully for the remainder of the year we can use what i call maintenance to maintain a safe environment for those that live visit and recreate in the city of austin
2904733 we have a number of businesses that depend on good air service
2904734 its going to be much harder for us to convince a high tech company that they should come here
2904735 they all bring something different to the table and the competition is only great for our team
2904736 its a committee with more than one person trying to win the starting spot
2904737 you would think with three guys going for one spot that there would be some guys that are a little bit self centered but all three help each other on and off the practice field
2904738 they get excited when the other one picks up a blitz they get excited when the other one makes a run thats what you want
2904739 to me its whatever i can do to help the team
2904740 i stopped eating mcdonalds and started eating salads it was difficult but it had to be done
2904741 b team the previous evening in the preliminaries touching with a time of 3 minute 8 24 seconds nearly 4 full seconds below the 15 hour old mark of 3 12 23
2904742 as soon as lezak came off that last wall i started going crazy were a team we went in as a team and now were exiting as a team and were going out with that gold that we needed to get back
2904743 ive been on the last two relays where we come up short
2904744 to be honest with you i got really tired of losing
2904745 i think this unifying way of looking at the illegal immigrants as a coherent population also deviates from the dialogue when you want to talk about statistics and truth
2904746 i think that in the same way that some groups do not make the link between the economy and migration the same can be said that we cannot make immediate links between enforcement and migration
2904747 the tank force that went into afghanistan in 1979 or czechoslovakia in 1968
2904748 initially when he was hospitalized we expected him to come back home but as the weeks went on i kind of knew
2904749 he was a hard man and he made no apologies for that
2904750 when it came to me and my mother and my daughter he was the softest
2904751 i kind of figured he was going to get a lot of backlash
2904752 telling that joke at that time probably wasnt the best idea but thats him
2904753 im sad that my daughter will never know or be able to feel how much he loved her
2904754 i think he will always be remembered as one of the original kings of comedy
2904755 i think what made him so special to people was that even though he was a celebrity he just seemed so down to earth and so much like a part of your family
2904756 what i really strove to do with this book is to get womens voices into islamic history
2904757 i was thinking about aisha and her strengths id read about what a strong witty influential leader she was
2904758 shes got the world debating a book no one has even read
2904759 if i do have threats of violence shes done it by alerting the muslims by calling it soft core porn by saying it made fun of islam
2904760 we understand the book is not historical documentation but it still uses the real characters of aisha and muhammad
2904761 it would be very tough to convince religious people that the novel isnt pretending to be the correct history
2904762 when combined with falsification of the islamic past it exploits americans who know nothing about aisha or her seventh century world and counts on stirring up controversy to increase sales
2904763 we are not part of the problem we are the solution

2904766 we believe that the recent resolution of the turkish political situation has removed a high level of uncertainty from the forestry permit application process the visit this week to a successfully rehabilitated sulphuric acid leach site is an important milestone in the forestry permit application as it will demonstrate that mine sites can be effectively reintegrated back into the community once a mining operation has ceased we believe we have submitted a world class mine closure and rehabilitation plan and through our constant engagement at all levels of local and national government we remain positive about our application prospects and anticipate a favourable outcome in the relatively near term

2904948 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2904949 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2904950 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2904951 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue

2905006 aceptaron la herencia del sistema pinochetista al comienzo por fuerza mayor pero se dieron cuenta que es m s f cil gobernar dentro de un sistema casi dictatorial que dentro de un sistema democr tico donde los gobernantes tienen que justificar sus acciones

2905275 we cannot just go out alone on this and talk and act unilaterally we dont have much impact i believe in terms of our unilateral declarations anymore with the administrations approach to the world

2905277 if those russian ships leave that port in the black sea and if ukraine decides that it is not going to allow those ships back into that port that is a potentially much greater conflagration involving a wider regional area

2905296 i hope that anybody who has enjoyed something that i have worked on before or who wants to follow superboy prime or wants to see what happens to the green lanterns a thousand years from now will give the book a shot because weve put in 185 percent on this from top on down
2905297 when the book comes out it will take you a half and hour to read it
2905298 its not directly tied in but the characters and where jim has them are jim shooters work on the legion is a huge influence hes one of the greatest comic writers in any generation from his work at valiant marvel and now again at dc

2905306 i was happy for kevin do i say gee why couldnt that have happened here yes but i dont harbor bad feelings against anybody that an nba title was my goal and you had him here so it seems like it was the best chance of having a person of that caliber we tried to bring people in around him but quite frankly the last couple of years we were going nowhere
2905307 so low key so unassuming if you ran into him on the street youd never know
2905308 they put the guys they trust the most the closest to the money
2905309 i dont defend myself and i dont defend kevin and say mistakes havent been made
2905310 people think im way too loyal to kevin and i should replace him
2905311 if i worried about kevins integrity he wouldnt be here for a minute if i worried about whether he really cared or not those are the things that are critical to me i know he doesnt do anything bad because hes lazy or because hes not intelligent he takes risks and he has been wrong on some of those risks if i knew somebody who could make it right all the time i wouldnt have any trouble having that person work for me
2905312 practice hard play hard be good all that type of stuff
2905313 i asked him to help me out and he jumped in
2905314 its a learning process youve got to give him the tools the people around him who will challenge him who will question him earlier in the process we have done that and he has not fought that some people fight that type of thing
2905315 we sit down as a group now and im telling you they dont always agree with kevin and kevin doesnt always agree with them but i think the results are better theyre coming up with better conclusions
2905316 hes in every meeting hes in on everything i dont know that fred would make better decisions than kevin would whats interesting now is they dont always agree thats interesting to me they challenge each other i think they make each other better
2905317 in some of your businesses you try to maximize profit my co owners with the timberwolves we want to win we dont have to make a lot of money doing it but we dont want to lose money either

2905421 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2905422 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2905423 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2905424 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2905425 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems

2905427 after school we were supposed to clean the bricks with a chisel
2905428 at 7 years old i thought it was a blast
2905429 at the end of the month mom and dad sat us all down they gave me 2 i was so proud that i had cleaned 200 bricks
2905430 he was trying to teach us the value of hard work to work for what you want
2905431 when my mother and father divorced he became my father
2905432 he was most caring and protective not only of me but of my mother
2905433 life was hard in andersonville where he grew up the hispanic children were not allowed to attend public school at that time so grandma arranged for her children to go to the catholic elementary school in town which was much farther to walk to
2905434 the kids had chores to do at the school in order to pay their tuition and dads was to be there very early in the morning to shovel the coal into the stoves so that the rooms would be warm once the other children arrived
2905435 he said it was the first time in his life he had three meals a day
2905436 he worked full time as a cook while he was in school
2905437 he proceeded to knock down the side of the back porch and he broke through a retaining wall
2905438 dad got a big bucketful of dirt it went up in the air it kept going up the dirt just went on top of us
2905439 people trusted him he would give people guidance he gave back not only to his community but to his state and to the country
2905440 we need her to send the message to move on
2905441 when you have 18 million votes for a candidate who is not going to be on the ballot thats hard for people people want an opportunity to vote for hillary
2905442 i dont think hillary delegates are in any way trying to disrupt the convention they just want to have a voice for the 18 million people who voted for her and we need those 18 million to win as a democrat im not afraid of that in the end on thursday night that unity will be there
2905443 i say let them have their voice let them have their hour or two let them understand obama will have the votes and then well move on i dont want them to feel disenfranchised we need them in november
2905444 if hillary clinton says no i do not want a roll call vote i want my delegates to support one roll call vote for barack obama then hey its done i will honor that
2905445 my husband keeps saying you gotta get over it sixteen years ive been working for the democratic party sixteen years i backed gore and then kerry and im tired of losing i dont want to get over it you cant just throw things aside and say it will be ok thats not the way politics works
2905446 i told them i had two friends in the race personal friends richardson and clinton
2905447 they lost and i love them dearly but now i have to look at what i have to do and my goodness there is no question this is about the issues lets think in terms of who it is we have to elect to get this country on the right track to help our families to get out of this immoral war hillary has already said she supports obama and im following her lead
2905448 if her name is not placed into nomination our votes for her are counted as present i dont want to vote for present waive the rules have a roll call obama will win so whats the fear to have a single name in nomination is contrary to democratic convention history not having a vote is unprecedented did people tell dennis kucinich to just get out gary hart jesse jackson what is this a coronation
2905449 its almost like every day is her birthday so last night we just wanted it to be quiet and you know have a nice quiet evening together
2905450 to sit in an audience and watch other people be nervous
2905451 it will be an unimpeachable document supported by documentary evidence of all the acts of omission and commission committed by musharraf that make him liable to impeachment several times
2905452 we are in the government now and have access to many previously confidential documents after going through these documents we are surprised over the horrendous nature of the crimes committed by president musharraf during his almost nine year rule
2905453 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2905454 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2905455 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2905456 on condition that the actors of that drama cool down their emotions and stop escalating the conflict

2905475 well my supervisor said i should observe her with the geri group since ill be taking it over once i get better acquainted with the job i asked her if she ever uses music she said sometimes i said what about live music she said no i told her i had my guitar in the car and she said that maybe i should bring it so we go to the session and i am just in my element i get two ladies to cry and open up about losing their husbands one said she felt like she died when he did one guy who usually sits in the corner and doesnt talk was openly discussing his favorite singers gomer pyle jim nabors and kate smith and a man who constantly says how terrible life is was singing can you believe it singing and requesting songs that were significant to his current state amazing grace and blowin in the wind it was great my supervisor was totally impressed
2905476 well that sounds wonderful how does this experience feel to you
2905477 i can tell there is something else you are thinking about
2905478 well i work with two other allied therapists besides my supervisor
2905479 one of them how does it feel to hear that
2905480 good you know me i always strive to be accepted
2905481 i just like to feel like im part of a group
2905482 you still feel like that isnt the cause of your good mood
2905483 no im annoyed at you ah shit right you are me
2905484 maybe but i think its better if you figure it out
2905485 you do know youre just not ready to accept it yet so you cant name it

2905487 i love this feeling im warm and cozy i cant wait to go back to work there i cant wait to get to know my coworkers better i cant wait to have more sessions
2905488 its good to focus on how you are feeling do you think you do that enough
2905489 definitely not most of the time i forget or i get sidetracked or i start thinking about oh
2905490 only because i just realized how i completely demoralize myself on a regular basis
2905491 for the past four months ive been telling myself over and over again with my fear with my negativity with my insecurity with my daggers of self hatred that i suck as a music therapist
2905492 its bittersweet it hurts and feels great at the same time it makes my heart ache
2905493 realizing that i am a good therapist that i can do this that i am capable that i am more than capable that others realize how great i am at my job that i realize it yet it hurts me to realize how long ive been telling myself i suck and ill never amount to anything
2905494 it does suck imagine how i feel i know you we does that make us schizophrenic are capable i know you are good at what you do but i have to sit here and listen to you constantly belittling yourself grinding yourself into pulp striking yourself over and over again with bolts of negative lightening i keep trying to scream out what i know but the roar of the hatred you have for yourself is just way too loud
2905495 to understand how to achieve satisfaction a company must deconstruct it into its component experiences because a great many customer experiences arent the direct consequence of the brands messages or the companys actual offerings a companys reexamination of its initiatives and choices will not suffice the customers themselves that is the full range and unvarnished reality of their prior experiences and then the expectations warm or harsh those have conjured up must be monitored and probed

2905734 to me that was a strong indication of her love she is a fabulous person
2905735 very very very happy to report her condition is upgraded
2905736 theyre not at the point where they want to discuss the specific nature of the injuries
2905737 beijing is a safe city but unfortunately we are not immune to violent acts
2905738 your government has been very attentive very sympathetic and i appreciate that a lot
2905739 my wife and i have traveled to reside in england
2905740 if i still have luck i would come back and die on thai soil like every other thai person
2905741 what happened to my family and me is like fruit from a poisonous tree the fruit will also be poisoned
2905742 there is a continuation of dictatorship in managing thai politics which is followed by interference in the justice system
2905743 saac and carroll shelby reach agreement to end legal battle
2905744 basically everything was developed by students for students thats the big thing here
2905745 i feel that it has given me invaluable career training
2905746 the one thing weve all learned is how to do better in the workplace and secure a good job
2905747 ive always had a problem with that im very shy
2905748 when we made that comic book we really needed to speak up
2905749 if something is going wrong and you dont say something the whole book could be lost
2905750 ive never really had anybody telling me what to draw before
2905751 there were some days when they all wanted to kill each other
2905752 look what they are going to do to us next
2905753 we gotta toe the line keep the country safe beware of terrorism at all costs
2905754 i show 2 much love for u to be a hater i am home everyday but im gettin my paper
2905755 it is in progress and hopefully before the year ends we will launch it for now we own 100 percent of the venture
2905756 we are already down 25 basis points due to easing inflation expectations
2905757 yields should range trade after that unless we see a further drop in oil prices
2905758 i think right now the market is pricing in a 25 basis point hike after that the market is slowly ruling our more rate hikes because of improving oil prices
2905759 it is in progress and hopefully before the year ends we will launch it for now we own 100 percent of the venture
2905760 is the story of the racialization process for euro americans within their own white world of experience that they must undergo in order to attach and sustain class privilege as a right of race
2905761 the doctors wouldnt even look at foua and nao kao theyd only look at us and jeanine they saw us as smart and white and they were concerned the lees were neither
2905762 each had accurately noted the same symptoms but dan would have been surprised they were caused by sole loss and lias parents would have been surprised to hear that they were caused by an electrochemical storm inside their daughters head that had been stirred up by the misfiring of abberant brain cells
2905763 because i dont know anything here i dont know your language american is so hard you can watch tv all day and you still dont know it i cant dial the telephone because i cant read numbers my children go to the store to buy food because i dont know what is in the packages
2905764 wenn sich die wichtigen akteure vorher verst ndigen gesch ft zu garantieren ist das m glich
2905765 dass solche angriffe erfolgreich seien k nnen zeigt das beispiel amerika dort haben alternative handelsplattformen signifikant marktanteile gewonnen
2905766 youd cut off one of your legs to have a year like hes having everythings going right you build that momentum before the chase starts its hard to break that
2905767 we can probably finish eighth every week and give up a couple races
2905768 we dont want to do that but the room is there
2905769 and they took it very seriously confidentiality especially in the national media marketing market is of core important and these students were able to finish a great analysis without duress
2905770 weve seen more people getting into investing and more company executives doing more aggressive marketing and sales with the knowledge that they are backed by a diverse number of share holders
2905771 im thrilled to report record growth in the national media marketing sector
2905772 this signifies that anyone who invested their money more than three years ago saw a 25 return on their money which is fabulous
2905773 but we have a strong relationship with our top investors and they know the national media marketing field very well as a result no one gets gun shy or cold feet
2905774 i always tell my national media marketing clients to wait at minimum 18 months before evaluating the success of a particular investment
2905775 that way those who get jittery early on allow themselves a chance to see the investment through
2905776 but its really no different than the enigma of day trading or forex people are not necessarily afraid of investment process but merely of the high risk involved
2905777 its better to look through the mid range national media marketing companies for ones with strong growth potential
2905778 be prepared for a wait of on average 3 5 years before expecting any sort of return that is the way the national media marketing market works and with patience you can walk with big money
2905779 with the internet and vast array of research information available starting up is much easier and significantly less costly this allows us to push profits right away and to establish a solid presence in the national media marketing field quickly
2905780 i think the potential for success marketing in most all countries so why not casino games
2905781 i believe that online casinos can thrive in the east if they are marketed correctly that means outstanding customer service a realistic gaming experience and good deposit options
2905782 i think the 175th anniversary just means that were been coming together in the community for a long time
2905783 but its nice to see the new people too homecoming sunday is always exciting
2905784 it informs you of where youve been as a faith community

2905813 it seems that if our species ever eradicates itself through war it will not be because it was written in the starts but because it was written in our books

2905891 buat catatan prestasi anda setiap bulannya ketika saya melakukan hal ini saya menyadari bahwa kesuksesan yang didapat orang lain memang karena prestasinya dari catatan prestasi saya kadangkala kita sadar bahwa kita tak cukup perform sehingga belum siap jadi manajer
2905892 terkadang bukan kedekatan dengan pucuk pimpinan gaji dan fasilitas atau kenaikan jabatan yang membuat orang lain cemburu dan kesal tapi lebih pada bagaimana cara kita bersikap

2905895 actually for a problem like burma which seems so complex the solution can be surprisingly simple if only governments and the united nations stopped talking so much and started doing more
2905896 what we are seeing in burma today is a totally avoidable man made disaster caused by a particularly nasty regime but this regime survives only because it is propped up by aseans impotence chinas money and indias weapons
2905897 when you see villages marked for relocation state sanctioned mass murder gang rapes disappearances and torture you have a moral obligation not to engage that government in business
2905898 many burmese groups working underground and under dangerous conditions are changing the way people think they are teaching people about their rights what to expect from a government about democracy economics security they are working to empower them
2905899 many very brave people including youths and women are learning and then sharing this information in towns and remote areas all around the country
2905900 thats a key part to changing burma i feel ultimately it has to come from within i feel hopeful for burma because when and not if democracy comes the people will be ready
2905901 i know for a fact that casey was not the first guy she slept with or the last
2905902 there were at least two others i know that 110 percent

2905904 the ok wedding cover didnt sell as well as they hoped and even her recent marie claire cover underperformed all things considered
2905905 christina has an inflated sense of her own value and seems to expect an extortionate amount of money for these baby pictures im not sure ok or much of the industry thinks is a dollar figure thats worth it she hasnt proven to be a real seller
2905906 nothing would make her more upset than to see those two babies on the same cover even if it wasnt at the same time
2905907 we dont comment on the details of potential editorial arrangements with any celebrities
2905908 comme la majeure partie des r sultats ont t publi s au japon comme aux etats unis on assiste un recul temporaire des craintes qui y sont li es tandis que la baisse du p trole et la hausse du dollar contribuent apaiser les pr occupations inflationnistes
2905909 mais il ne sagit que dun soulagement temporaire les craintes li es aux institutions financi res am ricaines pourraient bien refaire surface et les r sultats des hedge funds attendus le mois prochain vont une nouvelle fois rendre les investisseurs nerveux
2905910 they spent the mesne with regard to the moralization jurisdiction they might and main repute
2905911 thieves mainly target roofs causing substantial damage in the process
2905912 a lot of properties affected are community buildings and facilities such as village halls and churches places that cannot afford the cost of replacing the stolen material or repairing the damage caused
2905913 we are reminding anyone who looks after these types of buildings as well as nearby residents and workers to remain vigilant and be alert to any suspicious activity
2905914 in some cases the metal taken would be too heavy for one person to carry and a suitable vehicle would be required to take the material away

2905927 we thought cano had a chance to dive for it
2905928 we were shocked we didnt know the game was over half our guys were wondering what happened
2905929 i was counting the hops all the way down to first base
2905930 it would be awesome to win 20 games but look at today
2905931 i feel the same way with a no decision when the team wins in the back of my mind i still got the win
2905932 since the story broke late saturday that barack obamas real birth certificate now in republican hands has the name barry soetoro and not barack obama as we predicted a couple of weeks ago i notice that many people are still confused about the implications of dual citizenship for obama
2905933 these revelations raise several troubling issues for obamas electability and eligibility foremost there is the concerted attempt to conceal his background and dual citizenship identity from the electorate secondly there is a potential constitutional problem with a potus having held dual citizenship article ii of the constitution requires the potus and commander in chief to have only one loyalty to country and that must be to the us
2905934 russian aggression must not go unanswered and that its continuation would have serious consequences for its relations with the united states as well as the broader international community

2905944 for several years i like everyone else just referred to the post cold war world
2905945 the more i traveled though the more it became apparent to me that this system had its own logic and deserved its own name globalization globalization is not a phenomenon it is not just some passing trend today it is the overarching international system shaping the domestic politics and foreign relations of virtually every country and we need to understand it as such
2905946 globalization and the increasing openness of borders the quality of your state matters more not less
2905947 as party members we must view this problem seriously and i regard umno now being in a danger zone if money politics continues unabated
2905948 ive received unofficial reports that it has become rampant at all levels and it is frightening if this becomes normal practice in future
2905949 i have a feeling america would see it say thats awful and go right back to eating their dinner

2906169 kami berharap karya kami memperkuat usaha para pembuat undang undang maupun pembuat kebijakan dalam mengurangi masyarakat yang menjadi perokok pasif
2906170 sudah lama ada hipotesa bahwa kontak yang dalam jangka panjang dengan asap rokok orang lain dapat menyebabkan kerusakan paru paru namun metode sebelumnya yang menganalisa perubahan paru paru tidak cukup peka untuk mendeteksi hal itu
2906171 dengan teknik ini kami dapat memeriksa struktur paru paru hingga tingkat mikroskopis

2906193 the military conflict in georgia is the key factor in pushing up oil prices this morning so much has happened so quickly since we first heard of russias attack last week
2906194 there is also some degree of a technical rebound after oils sharp fall on friday
2906195 although plaintiffs and others repeatedly admonished defendants that nepa requires them to address and as warranted to mitigate the predictable increases in pollution from the refining of oil transported through the pipeline defendants refused to consider these environmental impacts and permitted the pipeline without the benefit of this important information

2906202 nicotine interacts with a variety of neurochemical pathways within the brain to produce its rewarding and addictive effects
2906203 however during the early phase of tobacco exposure many individuals find nicotine highly unpleasant and aversive whereas others may become rapidly dependent on nicotine and find it highly rewarding we wanted to explore that difference
2906204 while much progress has been made in understanding how the brain processes the rewarding effects of nicotine after the dependence is established very little is known about how the mesolimbic dopamine system may control the initial vulnerability to nicotine that is why do some individuals become quickly addicted to nicotine while others do not and in some cases even find nicotine to be highly aversive
2906205 importantly our findings may explain an individuals vulnerability to nicotine addiction and may point to new pharmacological treatments for the prevention of it and the treatment of nicotine withdrawal
2906206 while i was running an experiment at the caltech brain imaging center a group of students happened to pass by on a tour and i volunteered to explain what i was doing
2906207 as part of the experiment a moving display was running on my computer screen with dots rapidly expanding out somewhat like the opening scene of star wars
2906208 does anyone else hear something when you look at that
2906209 i queried a few hundred people and three more individuals turned up
2906210 do you hear sounds when you see things move or flash
2906211 people with auditory synesthesia may be even less likely than people with other synesthetic associations to fully realize that their experience is unusual these individuals have an enhanced soundtrack in life rather than a dramatically different experience compared to others
2906212 synesthetes had an advantage because they not only saw but also heard the visual patterns
2906213 this translation might result in actual sound perception in synesthetes perhaps due to stronger than normal connections says saenz who has begun brain imaging experiments to study this connectivity in synesthetes and nonsynesthetes
2906214 we might find that motion processing centers of the visual cortex are more interconnected with auditory brain regions than previously thought even in the normal brain
2906215 at this point very little is known about how the auditory and visual processing systems of the brain work together understanding this interaction is important because in normal experience our senses work together all the time
2906216 we are best at discriminating the facial features that are typical of our neighbors and if they happen to be parrots we become very good at recognizing individual birds
2906217 ultimately we are interested in what happens in a natural environment
2906218 but some questions require more control over the properties of visual stimuli than a picture of a natural scene would allow
2906219 the response of individual neurons can be strongly influenced by simple stimuli in the surround of the receptive field a phenomenon known as contextual modulation
2906220 context is an important part of how we perceive visual stimuli
2906221 and these results show how individual neurons might adjust their properties in different natural environments such as on a beach or in a forest

2906245 tim truly sorry to hear of your dreadful experience of the french health service and indeed of the dog
2906246 like you i have relatives and many friends who are current or retired uk nhs professionals all of them hard working and dedicated and like you i rather think that the uk nhs has become an easy aunt sally however my own experiences of the french system are completely at odds with yours on various occasions in recent years from emergency trips to the local urgences to gp advice to friendly help from the pharmaciste right through to serious surgery every experience and that of my family too has been exemplary timely attentive utterly professional care delivered with great consideration and good humour ive never been humiliated spoken to officiously or made to wait in line unnecessarily maybe the odd bit of old fashioned starchiness from senior doctors but i must confess i quite like that hospital stays have actually been a pleasure comfortable with good food yes even a wine list and that was just the local regular hozzie not a grand clinic and talk about clean above all theres a real feeling that youre being looked after and despite being suspicious of folk tales about the nhs what my health professional friends tell me doesnt match up to what france in my experience delivers theyd love to be able to but they cant
2906247 sorry to hear about this i hope the dog is ok
2906248 what this shows has to do not simply with the french health system have you tried
2906249 any person or persons capable of standing will wait on the red line until such time as the necessary documentation has been filled in and processed
2906250 ambitions are big but the means are small youd think a first step might be to give soldiers the means to do their job if not it would be better to leave them in france
2906251 the soldiers outfits are green unsuitable for the afghan terrain and their footwear
2906252 because of budget restraints the armoured vehicles in afghanistan will not be equipped with these
2906253 theyre too wide to go through some of the villages and since the roads wont allow them to travel fast theyll be sitting ducks for the taliban

2906255 sarkozy is part of the first generation of presidents truly familiar with opinion polls

2906257 makes major changes in the first few months after being elected the tyranny of the status quo will assert itself and prevent further change
2906258 widely regarded as one of the worst in the unions history
2906259 what should europe do now that ireland has rejected the lisbon treaty
2906260 oh well never mind well ignore your vote and pass the constitution anyway
2906261 my wife and i will stay in england where democracy is more important
2906262 what happened to me and my family and my close relations resulted from efforts to get rid of me from politics
2906263 i am hoping that a small miracle might come my way
2906264 it could still be a fascinating historic moment if we get across the line with postal votes
2906265 this has been an enormous shift and i am not going to concede defeat until we count those last few votes
2906266 so the vast majority of older australians are on the pension and a very very significant number of these people have very small additional amounts of private income as well as the pension
2906267 most pensioners also have very low levels of assets in fact 30 per cent report having bank balances of less than 1 000
2906268 that represents a 30 a week increase it would cost about 1 billion
2906269 prices are rising inflation is an issue mr rudd had the opportunity to address pensions in the budget and he chose not to do so
2906270 pensioners cant wait while the government fiddles around with yet another review of whether they can struggle on the current pension we know they cant
2906271 pensioners should not be forced to wait and live below the poverty line
2906272 i was assured no economic blockade shall be allowed and every effort will be made to keep the highway open
2906273 i request you dont go by the other road it is not good for us and not good for you as well
2906274 this is a big wake up call for mr rudd
2906275 this is an extraordinary swing and it underlines the disillusionment australians are seeing and feeling with the lack of leadership from the new federal labor government a government that promised so much
2906276 last year kevin 07 was everywhere dripping with empathy draping himself across petrol station forecourts shopping centre aisles promising to stop prices going up
2906277 and all weve got is one watch after another fuelwatch grocerywatch and who knows what the next watch exercise will be
2906278 he promised action and delivered nothing thats why australians are so disillusioned
2906279 i dont think that we can construe from the northern territory some grand lessons for western australia
2906280 obviously were going to wait and see the results to be finalised during the course of this week
2906281 obviously generally the public says to politicians they want them to serve their term and get the job done
2906282 but circumstances can bring early elections on and thats whats happened in western australia
2906283 nevertheless when elections come and go theres always a lesson for politicians in them
2906284 i think the lesson from this election as prime minister kevin rudd has said and its a lesson for all politicians is youve always got to be in touch with the electorate and cant take anything for granted
2906285 the nt election result clearly shows that people will not just sit back and accept this proposal
2906286 on the weekend residents took their opinions to the ballot box and voted for candidates opposing the uranium project
2906287 the government now has the opportunity to put community voices ahead of corporate interests
2906288 the waste from a uranium operation would remain here long after the companies have packed up and left town
2906289 of course people have concerns but we need to make sure they are safe
2906290 they have averaged in the six seats in which they stood 16 per cent of the vote
2906291 we actually stood in half as many seats and our vote overall has gone up
2906292 were moving closer and closer to not just influencing elections but winning seats
2906293 ten years ago a strike would have been inconvenient to the customers but since they had no other place to go verizon would not have lost business
2906294 however today the customer increasingly has choice if they want todays customers can give their business to one of verizons competitors and walk away from verizon altogether
2906295 i enjoy our conversations our relationship is constructive and its important and also very candid
2906296 i had a very uplifting experience going to a church
2906297 it just goes to show that god is universal god is love and no state man or woman should fear the influence of loving religion
2906298 and this is very illegal so the following material is for educational use only
2906299 normally at lunch id go home but of course i cant go home usually id not take as many snaps id go hit golf balls whatever now obviously i cant do that
2906300 youve still got to have some down time in camp but every time i have 15 minutes if im not studying i feel like im cheating myself
2906301 at some point like i did last night im looking at the playbook and im just staring at it i got to put it up
2906302 ive always felt like in any offense or defense throughout the nfl theres too much volume
2906303 the coaches have way too much free time you dont have to have 1 000 plays to be successful you have to run five or 10 of them very well bottom line is you run 70 plays in a game you repeat half of those well condense it down theyre throwing everything at me right now
2906304 like in a game he pumped and laid it in there before the safety got over there
2906305 the jobs that are not meant for the government shall be privatised
2906306 four years ago we werent getting no cheers from nobody
2906307 this year we had chinese fans with us we had u s fans with us and im pretty sure we had a couple of other little countries out there too
2906308 we fought our hardest we tried to make it a good game i think we lost to a strong team
2906309 when you think of soul music you think of isaac hayes the expression the sound and the creativity that goes along with it
2906310 even in his later years he never hesitated to appear for a cause or endorse something that he felt was for the good of mankind he will be sorely missed
2906311 they could go to the bathroom they could get a sandwich or whatever
2906312 the rappers have gone in and created a lot of hit music based upon my influence
2906313 a lot of artists owe isaac his career because a lot of music was based on his foundation
2906314 a person that speaks his mind hes sensitive enough to care for children hes wise enough to not be put into the wack category like everybody else in town and he l o o o o ves the ladies
2906315 there is a place in this world for satire but there is a time when satire ends and intolerance and bigotry toward religious beliefs of others begins
2906316 has no problem and hes cashed plenty of checks with our show making fun of christians
2906317 we were actually getting ready to schedule a trip to memphis to talk to isaac
2906318 isaac hayes was a wonderful human begin and his spirit will live long in the form of his music
2906319 the military conflict in georgia is the key factor in pushing up oil prices this morning so much has happened so quickly since we first heard of russias attack last week
2906320 ive expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn the bombing outside of south ossetia
2906321 russian aggression must not go unanswered and that its continuation would have serious consequences for its relations with the united states
2906322 the vice president expressed the united states solidarity with the georgian people and their democratically elected government in the face of this threat to georgias sovereignty and territorial integrity
2906323 historically ordinary people have achieved extraordinary things by taking direct action to prevent immoral or unsupportable actions
2906324 we are willing to put ourselves at risk of arrest if it will help convince the governments of australia that expanding the export coal industry is putting everyones future in jeopardy
2906325 we are standing together today to call on the federal government in particular to help this region move away from coal and stop this mad expansion that will come at such a terrible cost
2906326 we call on the delegates at todays 2020 ideas summit to remember that coal exports is australias number one contribution to climate change as well as our fastest growing if australias response to climate change fails to include a plan to phase out coal it will be a failure
2906327 many of us here today have never done anything like this before but we are doing it now because we may not get another chance

2906343 i jumped into the air and about fell into the pool i was so excited
2906344 a gold medal around my neck that was my motivation
2906345 i saw katie lets try to catch her and thats what i did i dont think anybody expected two british girls on the podium it was amazing
2906346 i thought im good im going to make it to the final so i slowed my tempo down a little bit
2906347 i wasnt expecting it i didnt go in planning to break the world record i swim really well when im feeling happy and my life is balanced also with my parents and boyfriend in the crowd
2906348 the 100 back has been the biggest progressing event in my opinion i expected that
2906349 its exactly where i wanted to be going into the finals im happy with that i just need to recover and focus on my final

2906353 he always walked past my house and around the block he last did that about three or four days ago he waved and gave me a little bow she said
2906354 i read a lot of agatha christie but i didnt want a real one on my doorstep she said

2906403 our troops have to defend civilians and avert a humanitarian catastrophe
2906404 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2906405 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2906406 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2906407 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2906408 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

2906418 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2906419 so the vast majority of older australians are on the pension and a very very significant number of these people have very small additional amounts of private income as well as the pension

2906421 that represents a 30 a week increase it would cost about 1 billion
2906422 prices are rising inflation is an issue mr rudd had the opportunity to address pensions in the budget and he chose not to do so
2906423 pensioners cant wait while the government fiddles around with yet another review of whether they can struggle on the current pension we know they cant
2906424 pensioners should not be forced to wait and live below the poverty line
2906425 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us

2906525 watch the child jesus what he does over the waves of the sea
2906526 jesus is instructed to watch israels house and not leave the place while the master goes away on a tour to collect clothes to be dyed but no sooner has israel left the house than jesus runs out with the boys
2906527 the most amazing part of the story of the nine year old jesus playing a form of cricket with the boys at the sea shore is that he would go on playing the game on water over the sea waves
2906528 he jesus would take the boys to the seashore and carrying the playing ball and the club he would go over the waves of the sea as though he was playing on a frozen surface hitting the playing ball
2906529 but the apocryphal story shows that for a ball game even jesus would forget work and would go to have fun with the boys

2906547 days are very long during the olympics as coach athlete commentator and as a spectator
2906548 but while those at home have the luxury of turning on the tv and getting live action from all dozen venues that day moving around an olympic city can be a competition in endurance all by itself

2906604 animals are arranged into food chains based on their rank and diet and whether they swim fly or live on land
2906605 each turn you have a chance to save unfed animal populations from starvation by feeding them with lesser ranked cards as well as the opportunity to redesign your food chains to be more resilient for the struggles of the next round
2906606 the game is rife with stealing and a fun cooperative dynamic emerges as groups of players coordinate their actions to stymie whoever is closest to winning
2906607 during your opponents turns you must watch their progress and try to find weaknesses in their ecosystems

2906610 we were in awe of her because of her on screen image i was wondering what she would be like and whether she will talk to me at all i was also nervous about touching her and doing all the romantic scenes with her but bipasha made me very comfortable she was very nice to all of us and she shared meals with everyone she is sweet
2906611 i remember in switzerland it was cold there was a scene where minissha and i were on a bike shes not as tall as i so she had to sit on two sand bags for the shooting it was freezing and she was wearing this thin patiala salwar i dont know how she managed
2906612 we had to shoot on this tall mountain right at the edge there was this helicopter that left us there when it was to drop me on the mountain i felt that was my last day in the world when minissha came she was so excited but a big cloud was coming and we couldnt shoot there we had to move out immediately
2906613 we went to all these nice beautiful places we would never have if it wasnt for the film it was somewhat unreal
2906614 we also shot on this beach in italy that was pebbled and the stones were poking us
2906615 well i did try to help i screamed at the pigeons
2906616 i am writing this review from the standpoint of a ballet dummy i e someone who knows barely anything about ballet i never did it as a kid and i am ashamed to admit that i fell asleep during the nutcracker at the royal opera house at londons covent garden
2906617 i like to see him challenged because that really brings out his best
2906618 he allegedly sent the e mail to air chinas office in tokyo from his computer last friday
2906619 the e mail threatened to blow up air china planes unless the company halted all its flights
2906620 it also threatened to force its planes to crash onto olympics sites
2906621 the nsc is similar to a call center that handles inbound and outbound calls but it also serves as a knowledge base center where operators upload all acquired information into the election day management platform edmp which can help in developing quick response actions
2906622 there certainly is a level of isi complicity in the militant areas in pakistan and organisations such as the taliban
2906623 i cant say to what level of leadership that goes to but there are indications of complicity on the part of isi to the extent that they are facilitating these militant groups that come out of the tribal areas in pakistan
2906624 unfortunately we see a higher number of non pashtun non afghanistan fighters this year than this time last year
2906625 they are really from a variety of ethnic groupings some are from areas in pakistan some are from places like uzbekistan or chechnya some are from europe and some are from other arab countries
2906626 but when you have a problem of porous borders and fighters and weapons and resources and command and control and logistics being brought in from outside of afghanistan that adds a complicating context to the insurgency
2906627 it was just a tremendous explosion and blew all the windows out of the house just blew the house up and i just managed to get out of there in time said robert helman said on ctv
2906628 live instructor led web based training is growing for a number of reasons
2906629 economic concerns and convenience are part of it but its also an effective way to get to a large audience in a short period of time
2906630 its not just that live online training saves travel time and costs
2906631 we think theres a big opportunity for resellers to add training to what they offer and become more valuable to their clients live online fits that model well
2906632 which helps build up their service margins and cement their role as a trusted solution provider with their customers
2906633 live online classes rate more highly with partners even than leader led and a fair number of people will use it because of its convenience
2906634 this year alone weve instructed over 1 000 students via this model

2906638 i was down and he stamped on me i thought he could have avoided me there was no need for it
2906639 after being out so long i was just happy to get out there with the lads and be part of it again
2906640 it was good to get some minutes under my belt this is the beginning for me but i dont feel any great sense of achievement
2906641 ive got to improve and hopefully with minutes on pitch that will happen usually id get up and down more than i did today and i think a bit of sharpness on the ball was missing
2906642 when you think neville has been out for that length of time and come back the way he has been is remarkable
2906643 hes a remarkable man his enthusiasm his determination the quality in his game is absolutely superb
2906644 i dont think gary will play all the time hopefully we will get 30 or 35 games out of him this season
2906645 he is a very important player for us with experience
2906646 its that experience we need and he will be ready
2906647 i just want to try and contribute when youre not playing you feel you are not with the lads or helping them
2906648 there are times when you think they can benefit from more squad players and experience

2906654 weve got ample evidence here that science fiction is alive well and kicking ass
2906655 just five days its our first time out with her
2906656 what a wonderful evening for a first time out you all look just wonderful
2906657 an equally elborate yet lo fi record oddly structured yet beautifully messy with the sole intent of taking you on a ride where youve never been before

2906660 is from the vast new wealth and array of modern capabilities that will be available to a regime whose strategic ambitions clash with those of the united states
2906661 largely stems from its role as a major source of foreign aid trade and investment
2906662 if i were to become a cracked out hooker who owns an ice cream shop and wears mittens over my ears would you still love me
2906663 we have made it clear to the russians that if the disproportionate and dangerous escalation on the russian side continues that this will have a significant long term impact on u s russian relations
2906664 georgia expresses its readiness to immediately start negotiations with the russian federation on a cease fire and termination of hostilities
2906665 not withdrawing but regrouping including heavy armor and increased attacks on tskhinvali
2906666 russia further escalated its aggression overnight using weapons on an unprecedented scale
2906667 its like saying that you didnt know that a physician was a perfect lunatic at a hospital the expectation is that a hospital would have sufficient monitoring to detect lunacy
2906668 one of the people that worked at the laboratory told me they had better security at a 7 eleven than they did at the laboratory where they had the most dangerous substances known to mankind
2906669 i think that anyone who is handling materials like this has a very heightened duty to make sure that they remain in a secure environment and that duty also extends to hiring employees who would be working in that environment to make sure that they are of sound mind
2906670 this guy was clearly a nut case and he wasnt a secret nut case and yet he was allowed to operate with unfettered access to these very lethal pathogens
2906671 can i understand there will be no delisting on today the 11th
2906672 the palestinian leadership has been working on establishing a palestinian state within the 67 borders
2906673 if israel continues to oppose making this a reality then the palestinian demand for the palestinian people and its leadership would be one state a binational state
2906674 im focused on getting everything done i can get done between now and january 19th
2906675 theres no doubt that the stability and calm has created a good atmosphere that has allowed us to make more summer camps and oversee the youths
2906676 im sure all of our guys are having a rough time with it
2906677 it was just a tremendous explosion and blew all the windows out of the house just blew the house up and i just managed to get out of there in time
2906678 at present we do not know anything about how the explosions occurred and we are waiting to learn about its cause
2906679 we werent even advised that they were going to be there
2906680 they just moved in and weve been concerned since they were there that something like this would happen
2906681 the military institution says it is ok to kill and use the most horrible weapons and that killing the enemy is heroic
2906682 i respect dick for having humanity over his military obligations
2906683 the regular people and the government wanted to surrender but the military people didnt want to surrender
2906684 i believe it is the stubbornness of the military people that caused the bombing of japan
2906685 the whole issue was created by separatist leaders who would like to stop the hindu pilgrimage the real motive is a complete islamisation of the valley after having successfully forced kashmiri hindus to leave the valley
2906686 this is not a struggle merely for 100 acres of land this is the struggle for the identity of our motherland
2906687 i got a crappy jump on the ball so now i have to dive
2906688 there certainly is a level of isi complicity in the militant areas in pakistan and organisations such as the taliban
2906689 i cant say to what level of leadership that goes to but there are indications of complicity on the part of isi to the extent that they are facilitating these militant groups that come out of the tribal areas in pakistan
2906690 unfortunately we see a higher number of non pashtun non afghanistan fighters this year than this time last year
2906691 they are really from a variety of ethnic groupings some are from areas in pakistan some are from places like uzbekistan or chechnya some are from europe and some are from other arab countries
2906692 but when you have a problem of porous borders and fighters and weapons and resources and command and control and logistics being brought in from outside of afghanistan that adds a complicating context to the insurgency
2906693 we come with militaries that have advantages in command and control in speed in lethality in logistics in intelligence in all those things
2906694 if nations provide forces with restrictions what it does is it decreases those advantages
2906695 how fast we can get there i dont know but it is important that the international community remain committed to afghanistan
2906696 he hadnt been chief minister very long and that in itself was a difficulty because his record in office was quite short
2906697 a lot of people were probably quite upset by the timing of the election they werent convinced by the reason the chief minister gave
2906698 its not their gig they like to be friendly with all the parties because they cant pick and chose whose going to be in national power
2906699 i think they would run a mile rather than get caught up in some local political shindig
2906700 we deliberately didnt touch on that out of respect for the moment and just acknowledged each others path and what happened on the weekend as member for nelson and member for blain
2906701 it was absolutely amazing within several days after that email being circulated a number of people came to our door and said we heard youre strapped for cash heres our cheque
2906702 their record on education and education is one of the big issues has been appalling through their whole government and basically the chicken has come home to roost
2906703 theres a very very high level of community concern about crime across the northern territory
2906704 both side of politics should commit to auditing the police force and seeing where our resources are
2906705 we are crappy therefore liberal are crappy so why change as the result will be the same
2906706 this swing againt labour would not have been so great if the party had kept clair martin as their leaded for this election
2906707 its obvious that the public has quickly become disenchanted with rudd and the labor brand and the coalition must capitalise on that now
2906708 our policy is that we will not commit to any policy we have no significant policies and will not have any significant policies that is our policy
2906709 england 1303 when edward prince of wales met piers gaveston it was the start of a passionate and defiant relationship that was to bring england to the brink of civil war
2906710 most historians do believe it was edward longshanks that fathered the child and not edward ii
2906711 at the time of edward iiis birth she isabella was pretty much exclusive with roger mortimer
2906712 right lads its just after 1pm time to go get em
2906713 huwag na lang ako may mas qualified na magmartsa kesa akin please excuse me there are people who are more deserving to march
2906714 ive been to chiang mai for the asian olympic eliminations and even then i didnt feel any pressure to perform
2906715 all i need is to gain more experience my parents are already happy that they have a daughter competing in the olympics
2906716 he was very happy when she agreed and he showed it
2906717 it was his chance to see kobe bryant and the rest of the nba superstars i guess the president didnt want to disappoint him
2906718 there is going to be a steady stream of activities for the first three days of the convention
2906719 would howard dean and nancy pelosi have kept his name off the ballot
2906720 are the usual kind of process that occurs at conventions
2906721 eh so u wanna teach me ant or u too selfish to teach
2906722 wai wad are u trying to say dont say things lidat lei i angry lei wad selfish

2906725 well who will tell me what to do for my son he is so ill and not getting any better
2906726 every day you help people everyday you make friends every day you bring people hope and happiness that is your purpose that is what the meaning of it all is for you
2906727 the people i help had no where else to go for help you would have failed then like you did me
2906728 i didnt ask for this i just couldnt watch them make the same mistake as i did asking you for help
2906729 this is no life i have nothing for me i have used all my energy making other peoples lives better but nothing for me
2906730 that i never would have needed to meet if you had been there for them i am now a tired old man who has spent his life and his energy to be told there is nothing in this life to make me feel whole
2906731 god is gone today is there some thing i could help you with
2906732 i have searched far and wide not really ever finding any thing that made me feel complete i have seen and witnessed many things felt great joy and great loss but still at the end of the day i still feel there is something missing
2906733 well the answer is not up there best advice i can tell you is dont waste your time doing some else work
2906734 which shitty thing you had a lot of shitty things happen to you just this year
2906735 what is the chance the scan will make things worse is such a scan safe
2906736 show me the data on the safety of prenatal ultrasound
2906737 we dont know because there is not sufficient scientific data to prove the safety of prenatal ultrasound
2906738 what is the chance that a scan will make things better
2906739 what is the chance a defect will be correctly identified true positive screening test and what is the chance a defect will be incorrectly identified false positive screening test
2906740 is there a better chance my baby will survive the pregnancy and birth if an ultrasound scan is done and what are the data
2906741 the casual observer might be forgiven for wondering why the medical profession is now involved in the wholesale examination of pregnant patients with machines emanating vastly different powers of energy which is not proven to be harmless to obtain information which is not proven to be of any clinical value by operators who are not certified as competent to perform the examinations
2906742 because they want to maintain the vaginal tone of a teenager and their doctors can find a medical explanation that will suit the insurance company
2906743 i must say i have heard some great things about cytotec myself just be careful the stuff turns the cervix to complete mushie
2906744 we will wait forever for the bureaucrats at the fda in washington dc to approve drugs so we must try them out ourselves if we want progress
2906745 both candidates in this election pledge to end this war and bring our troops home the great difference is that i intend to win it first
2906746 the surge has succeeded yet senator obama commits a grave error by insisting that even in hindsight he would oppose the surge even in retrospect he would chose the path of retreat and failure for america over the path of success and victory
2906747 what is missing is the judgment of a commander in chief
2906748 first he opposed the surge and then he confidently predicted it would fail and then he tried to prevent funding for the troops that carried out the surge
2906749 alejandro gamboa es un dirigente que proviene del fraude es un presidente espurio como felipe calder n
2906750 no solamente las fuerzas de la derecha est n boicoteando la consulta nacional que realiza el prd en torno a la reforma energ tica sino tambi n algunos que se dicen compa eros y no lo son los malos perredistas tomaron la direcci n del prd aqu en chiapas y en otros estados y esos pseudos izquierdistas quieren convertir al prd en un partido al servicio del poder y de la derecha
2906751 con el apoyo del gobernador se instalaron casillas falsas para imponer a jes s ortega la derecha de los chuchos quiere convertir al prd en un partido palero en un partido de bur cratas lo que hacen esos pocos no es el prd
2906752 cuando calder n le rob la presidencia a l pez obrador estaba claro que iba a entregar el petr leo a las petroleras internacionales
2906753 no quedarse cruzados de brazos y acudir a la consulta organizada por el presidente leg timo andr s manuel l pez obrador
2906754 bacalah dengan mnyebut nama tuhanmu yang telah menciptakan dia telah menciptakan manusia dari segumpal darah bacalah dan tuhanmulah yang maha pemurah yang mengajar manusia dengan perantaraan qalam dia mengajarkan manusia apa yang tidak diketahuinya

2906756 tidaklah aku ciptakan jin dan manusia kecuali agar mereka menyembahku
2906757 the grass is always much greener on the other side
2906758 i did it myself and i did it my own way
2906759 i have one of two choices stay in the post office and go crazy or stay out here and play at writer and starve i have decided to starve
2906760 one of the biggest frustrations is what arrogance these people think we are stupid
2906761 we are in the business of gymnastics and we know what a kid of 14 or 15 or 16 looks like you dont have to be a gymnastics coach to know what they look like at 16
2906762 they are 12 14 years old max and they line them up for the world and having the government back them
2906763 since they forced an age limit it has gotten worse and worse the fig is running away from the age problem they set an age limit and now they cant control it
2906764 the only situation is to lift up the age limit it would be an even playing field for everyone
2906765 and by all accounts the new nova is no different to the old
2906766 the company is making money selling franchises though lots of people are buying them
2906767 oh i couldnt make the money i make here elsewhere ohh its so easy there arent so many jobs in japan nowadays i just do my work and go home
2906768 well i dont know what the union has to gain by
2906769 and apparently the union has gained the concessions listed above didnt you read them
2906770 i solemnly swear that i will never bitch complain or be suprised by nova g coms poor working conditions i have chosen to ignore the fact the company went bankrupt due to not following the law of the japanese government and i am still willing to work for them i am choosing to ignore the way the new company g com has treated my fellow employees messing them around saying they are going to renew them then deciding not to and not giving them any 28 days paid notice upon non renewal i am choosing to ignore gcom not respecting the conditions that are mandatory for all full time employees under japanese law and outlined in their own contracts i am choosing to ignore the way that employees have been treated in the past and present and will be treated in the future because i am too lazy to find a job elsewhere i will not bitch or complain or be surprised by the way nova g com behaves because i have been given ample evidence of how nova gcom behaves in the past and the present i am willing to make money for a company that acts dishonestly because i think i couldnt find a job that pays more elsewhere and i dont have the motivation to look for a job somewhere else because i am making an informed choice about this and i am a responsible adut i will not complain or be surprised by the way nova gcom behaves with regards to working conditions or feel entitled to conditions that are not met by nova gcom as outlined in their contract or japanese law
2906771 i dont work for nova now anyways but the few years i did i never felt they had any teeth im sure they do their best in really difficult circumstances so maybe i am being harsh and there is definately a place for the union
2906772 if anyone can tell me why you should stay at nova please do so
2906773 wah nama ini harus jadi nama yang keren dah pokoknya
2906774 oui je suis sponso roxy parce que je suis une championne de surf et toi
2906775 because israel is not prepared to face a second holocaust
2906776 janet and i are relieved that john mark is all right
2906777 he will be stiff and sore from the accident but doctors assured us he sustained no serious injuries
2906778 the wind suddenly became so fierce that it threw me across the street and into a cyclone fence
2906779 shingles garbage cans recycling bins and branches just flew past me and i kept praying nothing would hit me
2906780 currents were so strong divers were unable to get to the location
2906781 the former president would be intrigued by court service and many would cheer him on
2906782 you may recall recent trial balloons that mr clinton was perhaps interested in becoming u n secretary general if he is grasping for a similarly large stage to fill his ambitions and ego what better place than the nations highest court where could serve for life if he wanted
2906783 court arguments are not televised and most justices shy away from publicity as a matter of respect for the courts integrity
2906784 everything has two sides the outside that is ridiculous and the inside that is solemn
2906785 return links to pages that have the greatest amount of high quality information about specific search terms
2906786 o dawud wij hebben jou tot gevolmachtigde op aarde aangesteld oordeel daarom volgens de waarheid tussen de mensen en volg niet de begeerte hawaa want die zal jou doen afdwalen van de weg van allah
2906787 hij geeft jullie een vergelijking met julliezelf zijn er voor jullie die over slaven beschikken deelgenoten in de voorzieningen die wij jullie hebben geschonken zodat jullie daarin gelijk zijn en vrezen jullie hen zoals jullie elkaar vrezen zo leggen wij de tekenen uit aan een volk dat begrijpt maar degenen die onrecht pleegden volgden hun begeerten hawaa zonder kennis en wie kan dan hen leiden die allah deed dwalen en voor hen zijn er geen helpers
2906788 en voorwaar de meesten doen de mensen zeker dwalen door hun begeerten hawaa zonder kennis voorwaar jouw heer hij kent de overtreders beter
2906789 o mensen van het boek overdrijft uw godsdienst niet ten onrechte noch volgt de begeerten hawaa van een volk dat voordien afdwaalde en velen deed dwalen en van het rechte pad afweek
2906790 en de joden en de christenen zullen nooit behagen in jou vinden totdat jij hun godsdienst volgt zeg o dat is de leiding
2906791 en voorwaar de meesten doen de mensen zeker dwalen door hun begeerten hawaa zonder kennis voorwaar jouw heer hij kent de overtreders beter
2906792 en volg niet de begeerte hawaa want die zal jou doen afdwalen van de weg van afdwalen voor hen is er een harde bestraffing
2906793 de tijd voor het avond gebed is ook al voorbij
2906794 waarom ben je zo stil kom hier bij me en neem mij dat is toch hetgeen waarvoor je achter me aan kwam
2906795 ik ben gekomen met drie vragen als ze u beantwoordt dan zal ik weg gaan voor u een grote hoeveelheid rijkdom achterlatend die ik met me mee heb gebracht van de keizer van rome wat de vragen betreft dat zijn
2906796 o mijn beste vader ik zal hem beantwoorden en hem het zwijgen opleggen
2906797 maar de vlam is gewoon licht en verspreid zich naar alle vier de richtingen het noorden zuiden westen en het oosten
2906798 als dit tastbare licht zich in alle vier richtingen verspreidt waardoor u me niet kan vertellen welke kant het opgaat wat verwacht u dan van de nur al samawaat wa l ard god het licht van de hemelen en de aarde licht op licht god richt zich tot alle richtingen op hetzelfde moment
2906799 je kunt nu naar je land terugkeren jongeman het weten dat je zoekt heet geduld
2906800 allah twintig jaar lang heb ik geleerd geduld te oefenen en het scheelde maar een haar of ik had zojuist mijn zoon gedood hoe onberekenbaar is onze zwakheid en hoe oneindig is uw wijsheid hoe onuitputtelijk uw barmhartigheid
2906801 dit is de openbaring die god aan die en die gaf
2906802 het woord van de heer kwam naar jonas de zoon van elmitaeh
2906803 vele mensen hebben geschreven over deze man het lijkt me daarom passend dat ik dit ook doe
2906804 deze woorden komen van god en hier zijn ze dit is een openbaring
2906805 al sinds je een jonge man was heb je de schriften bestudeerd alle schriften die ge nspireerd zijn door god
2906806 iedereen die iets wegneemt van dit boek of er iets aan toevoegt is vervloekt
2906807 het gras wordt dor de bloemen vervagen maar het word van onze god zal voor altijd blijven bestaan
2906808 dit is het boek waaraan geen twijfel is een leidraad voor degenen die zich van god bewust zijn
2906809 denken zij dan niet na over de quran en wanneer die niet van allah afkomstig was dan zouden zij hierin vele fouten vinden
2906810 zeggen zie dit en dat zeg hun dan dit en dat
2906811 o mensheid sta stil bij dit of dit heb je nagedacht over dit en dit
2906812 jezus was god want hij werd in de hemel opgenomen
2906813 je hebt god nog nooit gezien en je hebt nog nooit zijn stem gehoord
2906814 zijn vijanden zeiden het dus hij zal het ook wel gezegd hebben
2906815 toen isra l jong was hield ik van hem en vanuit egypte riep ik mijn zoon
2906816 hoe ziet mijn vader eruit dan is hij lang of kort heeft hij een bril
2906817 oh ja je hebt gelijk je hebt hem inderdaad ontmoet
2906818 bewijs het maar vertel me iets zodat ik het weet dat ik zeker weet dat u erbij was toen het universum begon
2906819 voorzeker wij bouwden de hemel door onze macht en waarlijk wij zijn het die hem uitbreiden
2906820 ive expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn the bombing outside of south ossetia
2906821 russian aggression must not go unanswered and that its continuation would have serious consequences for its relations with the united states
2906822 the vice president expressed the united states solidarity with the georgian people and their democratically elected government in the face of this threat to georgias sovereignty and territorial integrity
2906823 he listened politely i cant read his mind but i do know that every time i met with him i pressed the point
2906824 we dont want adults sending mixed messages to children that its ok to shoot up drugs in order to become a star because its not ok
2906825 we cannot just go out alone on this and talk and act unilaterally
2906826 were alarmed by this entire situation and every escalatory step is a further problem
2906827 right now our focus is on working with both sides with the europeans and with a whole variety of international institutions and organizations to get the fighting to stop

2906837 referees decisions will tip the scales when athletes are relatively well matched but have relatively small influence when one is clearly superior
2906838 although there is a need for further research including research on the effects of different colors our results suggest a need to change the rules or support referees by providing electronic decision making aids in those sports in which this color bias may be a problem

2906851 tbilisi south ossetia and advancing toward the city of gori in central georgia in its first direct assault on a georgian city with ground forces during three days of heavy fighting georgian officials said the maneuver along with bombing of the georgian capital tbilisi seemed to suggest that russias aims in the conflict had gone beyond securing the pro russian enclaves of south ossetia and abkhazia to weakening the armed forces of georgia a former soviet republic and an ally of the united states whose western leanings have long irritated the kremlin russias moves which came after georgia offered a cease fire and said it had pulled its troops out of south ossetia caused widespread international alarm and anger and set the stage for an intense diplomatic confrontation with the united states

2906877 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
2906878 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here

2906927 what happened to my family and me is like fruit from a poisonous tree the fruit will also be poisoned
2906928 there is a continuation of dictatorship in managing thai politics which is followed by interference in the justice system
2906929 there has been a peaceful event today to celebrate un indigenous peoples day involving 20 000 people the indonesian security forces wanted to clear the people from the rally after they raised the four flags they have shot into the crowd without provocation and killed one of the organisers from the tribal council
2906930 this is clearly an act of state repression of the indigenous people and is an attempt to stop any free expression either political or cultural
2906931 castaway starring tom hanks and directed by fully discusses the same subject which is a story of a man who is left alone in an island and had to find ways and other means to survive and to be rescued
2906932 the detainees should be released as it is not credible for the indonesian police to charge these people on that basis of subversion performing a flag raising ceremony and protesting against indonesian authority is not an act which could over throw the government the demonstration was peaceful and such political expression should be a democratic right in west papua and indonesia
2906933 public remembrance of the past injustice from the soeharto period and the ongoing repression of human rights including the right to self determination is what indonesia government agencies seek to subvert by arresting these people
2906934 to arrest and detain this group charged under the subversion parts of the criminal code are draconian this symbolic protest in itself is clearly not going to overthrow the state of indonesia
2906935 this whole flag raising issue must be an embarrassment to the indonesian government
2906936 these community leaders who have been political prisoners after being arrested in the time of the soeharto dictatorship are now being arrested for similar crimes in the new amp democratic indonesia
2906937 these arrests demonstrate that previous political injustice in west papua from the soeharto period are not reconciled in indonesia or west papua
2906938 injustices of the past have been carried forward by the unreformed indonesian security forces into the present period so that authoritarian rule continues in west papua it is a serous problem and political freedom still does not exist in west papua
2906939 why are some released and yet others detained when all have committed the same crime of non violent protest against indonesian government
2906940 these fakfak prisoners and other prisoners arrested in timika manokwari and jayapura on similar grounds relating to west papuan flags and symbols since december last year should be released
2906941 there is a political problem in west papua that still needs to be fixed by repressing political decent and imprisoning west papuans the problem will not be fixed

2906956 this latest cholera outbreak started in april and has continued through to june 2008 based on information supplied from the ground the institute of papuan advocacy and human rights believes that the indonesian health department and provincial government response has been grossly inadequate it appears that people were treated in the community health centers when people were able to physically carried there but the government response in those affected villages was very limited
2906957 indeed for the government personnel the response was a matter of mutual blaming and a refusal to take responsibility everybody in the government has avoided taking responsibility and has blamed each other for what went wrong
2906958 cases of fatal diarrhea which include undiagnosed cholera have been increasingly reported in nabire and highland areas of west papua in the past few years
2906959 earlier this month our organisation alerted the world health organisation who of this current cholera outbreak but that organisation in indonesia appears to have not responded we contacted the who because previous experience is that the indonesian government agencies and provincial government would not mount an adequate response
2906960 although there are massive amounts of money available to government in west papua that money is not being used to control the contagious diseases which also includes hiv aids tb as well as malaria in the indigenous population little of the special autonomy funds budgeted for health is being effectively west papua remains closed to access from international ngo and the media so none knows what is happening
2906961 the special autonomy process which jakarta set up 7 years ago is not serving the peoples education and health needs many west papuans view the combination of lack of health services and military occupation as deliberate and genocide
2906962 west papua must be opened up to the world so the basic human rights including the right to adequate health of indigenous west papuan can be promoted there is a new set of diseases which have never been experienced by remote amp isolated highland communities which are continuing to spread into these communities
2906963 west papua should be opened to international health organisations to assist local communities in developing the ability for detection and treatment of disease and to assist in public health generally including pre and post natal care of mothers and babies
2906964 talk by international countries such as germany of swapping indonesias international debt in return for implementation of health programs by the global fund 1 will be most effective in west papua if there is increased political freedom
2906965 there is a need for a major rethink about how community health and human rights is addressed in west papua as the indigenous people do not trust the indonesia government
2906966 if the west papuan people are not empowered in the field of health the health of the west papuan people will continue to deteriorate

2906982 violence is never and will never be a remedy to any crisis problem or impasse it is never an option violence never gives long lasting solutions rather violence promotes internal instability disregards human dignity and human rights and further leads to pointless conflicts and unwarranted fears
2906983 the people have the right to know and to participate in all matters that affect and will affect them the government cannot and should not at any time hide behind the cloak of executive privilege in transactions it enters into in the guise of national security

2907010 on 23 march 1994 the medical examiner viewed the body of ronald opus and concluded that he died from a shotgun wound of the head
2907011 a person who sets out to commit suicide ultimately succeeds even though the mechanism might not be what he intended
2907012 the room on the ninth floor whence the shotgun blast emanated was occupied by an elderly man and his wife
2907013 when one intends to kill subject a but kills subject b in the attempt one is guilty of the murder of subject b
2907014 the continuing investigation turned up a witness who saw the old couples son loading the shotgun approximately six weeks prior to the fatal incident it transpired that the old lady cut off her sons financial support and the son knowing the propensity of his father to use the shotgun threateningly loaded the gun with the expectation that his father would shoot his mother the case now becomes one of murder on the part of the son for the death of ronald opus
2907015 further investigation revealed that the son ronald opus had become increasingly despondent over the failure of his attempt to engineer his mothers murder this led him to jump off the ten story building on march 23 only to be killed by a shotgun blast through a ninth story window

2907094 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2907095 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2907096 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2907097 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2907098 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

2907100 this place has a profusion of colors with the flowers
2907101 theres this juxtaposition of nature and the urban architecture plus all the people for me photography is a way of storytelling and there are so many stories here with all the people you see
2907102 just walking around i get a creative vibe this place is so full of everything
2907103 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2907104 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2907105 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2907106 if you dont write it down how do you know it happened
2907107 in bangladesh they say theyll pay 50 kuwaiti dinars 188 but the company only gives kd 20 a month 75
2907108 nobody believes wal mart closed for economic reasons everybody knows its because the people unionized
2907109 the meeting leader said i am not telling you how to vote but if the democrats win this bill will pass and you wont have a vote on whether you want a union
2907110 i am not a stupid person they were telling me how to vote
2907111 if anyone representing wal mart gave the impression we were telling associates how to vote they were wrong and acting without approval
2907112 we believe efca is a bad bill and we have been on record as opposing it for some time
2907113 we feel educating our associates about the bill is the right thing to do
2907114 we feel its important that our employee partners fully understand the implications that the employee free choice act could have on their work environment and benefits
2907115 weve always maintained the termination was not related to the union and that there was nothing unlawful about an answer provided an associate about merit pay
2907116 following the decision we were considering offering reinstatement but that is on hold since the union appealed the decision
2907117 this is a david and goliath confrontation but we believe well have enough stones in the sling to knock this out
2907118 i have the impression that they will want to close the garage
2907119 but if they do this we will help the workers find other places right away
2907120 the arbitrator is now working on the file so we cannot speculate on the outcome
2907121 we respect the process and we want to wait for the decision
2907122 if this happens in quebec this will be a big shot in the arm for wal mart workers everywhere
2907123 if this had been a regular file we would have had a collective agreement in 2005
2907124 a few years later we wouldnt even be talking about it any more
2907125 a change in the conduct of the doha negotiations is needed to really deliver benefits to the poor
2907126 developed country governments have to assume their responsibilities to contribute some fairness to the world trading system and not require huge sacrifices in return for minimal commitments on their side
2907127 any final deal must be analysed in terms of its benefits and impact for workers and the poor
2907128 the competitive pressures that cause violations of workers rights and unequal distribution of the benefits of trade require serious attention when talks resume if workers and the poor are to benefit from trade liberalisation an agreement that brings more hardship to workers in developing countries is simply not acceptable
2907129 both hamas and the palestinian authority are responsible for these outrageous assaults
2907130 in the process these palestinian governments are fundamentally damaging the palestinian cause
2907131 the tit for tat attacks on media must stop and the distribution ban on these newspapers should be revoked immediately
2907132 journalists and media should be allowed to do their job without fear a free press is vital for the people of the region and all palestinian voices must be heard in the debate about the future of palestine
2907133 received a message that two teachers were killed at the case has attracted a lot of international attention and condemnation
2907134 this is a photo mosaic made up of more than 2 000 photographs sent in by individual trade unionists from around the world in support of lovemore matombo and wellington chibebe the president and general secretary of the zimbabwe congress of trade unions zctu
2907135 these charges and bail conditions are clear breaches of free speech and freedom to associate
2907136 amnesty international believes they were arrested purely for exercising their rights to freedom of expression association and assembly and that they are prisoners of conscience
2907137 were calculated at inciting the workers to revolt against the government
2907138 hundreds of thousands of people in the uk have jobs in sectors where tipping is commonplace
2907139 when people leave a tip in a restaurant or elsewhere they expect it to go to service staff and as consumers weve got a right to know if that actually happens
2907140 this is an issue of fairness and common sense and its one many people clearly care a lot about
2907141 waiters and waitresses across the country have been hungry for the tips loophole to be closed and the announcement today will satisfy their appetites
2907142 it is great news that unscrupulous employers will no longer be able to use the tips left for staff to subsidise low wages
2907143 the government is right to make sure that workers can keep their tips and that the responsibility to pay the minimum wage rests squarely with employers
2907144 this is a welcome example of the government responding to the concerns of hard pressed vulnerable workers
2907145 far too many rogue employers have been using tips to make up the national minimum wage
2907146 organizations responsible for defending workers socio economic and occupational interests should be able to use strike action to support their position in the search for solutions to problems posed by major social and economic policy trends which have a direct impact on their members and on workers in general in particular as regards employment social protection and standards of living
2907147 adoption of a general practice of investigation without detention of workers and bringing section 314 of the penal code obstruction of business in line with freedom of association principles
2907148 ye are the branches of whom i have been speaking as i am the vine engaged to be and do all the branches need so i now ask you in the new dispensation of the holy spirit whom i have been promising you to accept the place i give you and to be my branches on earth
2907149 i will be a branch with all that may mean a branch very feeble but yet as like the vine as can be for i am of the same nature and receive of the same spirit a branch utterly helpless and yet just as manifestly set apart before god and men as wholly given up to the work of bearing fruit as the vine itself a branch nothing in myself and yet resting and rejoicing in the faith that knows that he will provide for all yes by his grace i will be nothing less than a branch and all he means it to be that through me he may bring forth his fruit
2907150 how can i learn to say this aright only be a branch and to live it out
2907151 whoever has my commandments and observes them is the one who loves me and whoever loves me will be loved by my father and i will love him and reveal myself to him
2907152 i have told you this so that my joy may be in you and your joy may be complete
2907153 amen amen i say to you you will weep and mourn while the world rejoices you will grieve but your grief will become joy
2907154 do not love the world or the things of the world
2907155 the jobs market has been one of the few bright spots in the uk economy but cracks are appearing in the face of an increasingly uncertain economic outlook
2907156 even if we avoid the scale of jobs fallout suffered in previous downturns the era of the candidates recruitment market is already over with people in work becoming increasingly anxious that their p45 might soon be on its way
2907157 with sales slowing and input costs rising but scope to raise prices limited by weakening demand finances are under pressure
2907158 ive expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn the bombing outside of south ossetia
2907159 russian aggression must not go unanswered and that its continuation would have serious consequences for its relations with the united states
2907160 georgia expresses its readiness to immediately start negotiations with the russian federation on a cease fire and termination of hostilities
2907161 not withdrawing but regrouping including heavy armor and increased attacks on tskhinvali
2907162 your agenda as an adviser can get in the way of the prospects agenda which is predominant
2907163 the nabagereka of buganda sylvia nagginda has advised ngos to use sports to lure children from the streets and to fight the hiv aids scourge
2907164 the idea is to give gift coupons to popular influential men in the gay community and encourage them to talk up condom use regular hiv testing and other responsible actions
2907165 n stan alla svenskar vill ha kvar kungahuset det r f nigt att sossarna har kvar texten om att ta bort monarkin att det r fel att rva en titel kan vi v l alla tycka men att skippa kungahuset vore helt idiotiskt
2907166 as president mikheil saakashvili shuts down the opposition media he could well try to divert attention away from his political problems by ginning up a fresh conflict with the breakaway regions of both of which are protected by russian troops and regional militias
2907167 saakashvili the great democrat is busy charging anyone who opposes him with being a pawn of the russians and therefore but the west is calling on him to restore civil liberties and in an apparent effort to propitiate his western benefactors he has lifted new elections widespread and growing opposition to his strong arm tactics even among many of his former supporters spells political trouble for saakashvili and his corrupt cohorts however and an appeal to georgian ultra nationalism which was always the real ideological motivation of the rose revolutionaries would bolster him in the polls and provide a much needed distraction at least from the ruling partys point of view
2907168 in the event of an outbreak of hostilities expect the u s to do what they have done for the duration of georgias political crisis proffer unconditional support to saakashvili with russia aiding and giving political and diplomatic support to the abkhazians and the ossetians and the americans letting loose a flood of military aid to tbilisi this could be the first theater of actual conflict in the
2907169 when violence broke out in the caucasus on friday morning john mccain quickly issued a statement that was far more strident toward the russians than that of president bush barack obama and much of the west but as russian warplanes pounded georgian targets far beyond south ossetia this weekend bush obama and others have moved closer to mccains initial position
2907170 obama accused russia of escalating the crisis through its clear and continued violation of georgias sovereignty and territorial integrity
2907171 its the first time lukes ever been invited to play outside of the country its a big deal
2907172 its a prestigious event to go to and he could do very well
2907173 hes a young man who constantly takes us by surprise with his capabilities
2907174 hes such a modest young man he has a sense of humor he takes delight in life
2907175 having the honor to represent the united states in chess means a great deal to luke and he has worked very hard to earn this privilege
2907176 other days i felt good because i beat him once
2907177 that helped me out so much im not the biggest guy im not the fastest guy but i tried to work hard
2907178 hes going to play a lot weve just got to get him more consistent in his knowledge of the calls hes plenty talented enough his motor his athleticism his toughness his physical play
2907179 all the qualities you want in a d lineman hes got
2907180 hes athletic he goes very hard and those two qualities alone can get you a long ways
2907181 football is what i want to do going up and singing is not bad either i love doing it you think about who youre singing for if you have someone to sing for its not hard at all if i love this person i can do anything for them
2907182 my mom is a single cheering section by herself shes so loud
2907183 i swear to goodness i can hear her even with 40 000 people
2907184 those are the things that create stability in the long run
2907185 if participants get assets like an education or a house we want them to have the knowledge to care for those assets
2907186 or at least in debt tuition is pretty high these days
2907187 it was funny at first making deposits none of the bankers knew what was going on ida what are you talking about they had to go get their supervisors
2907188 this reaches those folks who are at the edge of falling either way either building assets and being productive or falling the other direction and struggling needing other kinds of assistance
2907189 the goal is to lift families into a more stable and self sufficient situation so that after two years they will have a livable wage

2907194 theyre not at the point where they want to discuss the specific nature of the injuries
2907195 beijing is a safe city but unfortunately we are not immune to violent acts
2907196 your government has been very attentive very sympathetic and i appreciate that a lot
2907197 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
2907198 the meeting was very much focused on the sporting agenda they discussed sochi the russian city hosting the 2014 winter olympics there was no discussion of any political or global incidents
2907199 the sad reality is that out of the nations who were parading last night a number of them are in conflict and in an ideal world its not something we would like to see we can only bring the ideals of how sport can bring people together as friends
2907200 our athletes are doing what theyve prepared for years theres no politics
2907201 hes stupid a criminal mentally ill he should go to a clinic normally during the olympics countries try to calm down any conflicts they have
2907202 it is a terrible situation when you hear there is bombing going on in your country and it is a tiny country georgians and russians are both worried
2907203 i live in moscow but my family is in georgia right now and i am worried i hope everything gets better quickly
2907204 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
2907205 the circuits are there but you have to give them an extra push
2907206 what were doing makes sense when we work with these little kids and work and work and work and suddenly get through
2907207 almost every kid with autism has their own particular cause of it
2907208 this paper points to problems specifically in the way that experience sculpts the developing brain
2907209 join a growing list to suggest that autism is a synaptic disorder
2907210 i find that hopeful because there are ways that are being discovered to activate genes
2907211 this might be an unanticipated way of developing therapies in the long term for autism identifying these kids where all the right genes are present just not turned on in the right way
2907212 we have trouble getting through to these children but with repeated stimulation we can do it

2907226 the air and artillery bombardment left the provincial capital without water food electricity and gas horrified civilians crawled out of the basements into the streets as fighting eased looking for supplies
2907227 it all confirms our numerous warnings addressed to the international community that it is necessary to pay attention to massive arms purchasing by georgia during several years now we see how these arms and georgian special troops who had been trained by foreign specialists are used
2907228 russia has already begun consultations with the ambassadors of the nato countries and consultations with nato military representatives will be held tomorrow
2907229 we will caution them against continuing to further support of saakashvili
2907230 it is an undisguised aggression accompanied by a mass propaganda war
2907231 start military action against abkhazia however the abkhaz fortified region turned out to be unassailable for georgian armed formations therefore a different tactic was chosen aimed against south ossetia which is more accessible territorially

2907281 the type of leadership that an organization needs be it a college a country or a business for example depends largely on whether the organization is stable or in crisis
2907282 highly skilled employees who are ambitious self motivated and self sufficient are more likely to be harmful than beneficial in an organization based on teamwork
2907283 an explicit and enforced set of values is crucial to the success of any company or other type of organization
2907284 in todays rapidly and unpredictably changing world attempting to learn from the past is no longer the wisest strategy
2907285 the most important quality for a leader of an organization to have is not the ability to plan to organize and to solve problems but rather the ability to communicate the organizations mission and to inspire people to work toward fulfilling that mission
2907286 because technology has increased the speed of communication people are less able to communicate except on the most superficial level

2907300 opinion polls and other forms of surveys are greatly overused and often meaningless
2907301 in most businesses revising and updating old ideas and methods produces better results than creating and implementing new ones
2907302 employees who display any antisocial behavior toward their coworkers should be immediately dismissed
2907303 business executives deserve full credit for all successes in their company
2907304 managers should not promote or even retain employees who repeatedly express dissatisfaction with their jobs

2907310 each year a company should identify and fire the lowest performing members of its workforce
2907311 companies should not have the right to fire employees for behavior outside the workplace
2907312 in difficult economic times companies should substantially reward the best performing employees rather than give small raises and bonuses to all employees
2907313 to encourage successful cooperation and collaboration among employees companies should give salary raises and bonuses to teams rather than to individuals
2907314 employees committed to their own personal success usually make the most contributions to a companys success
2907315 in general the best managers are those who trust their employees to work on their own without close monitoring
2907316 people are more effectively motivated by myths and symbols than by logic and reasons
2907317 in these situations you should always watch your drink not shrink
2907318 its hard to kiss the lips at night that chew your ass all day long

2907360 i recently accepted a work from home job that will involve using my landline to talk to customers when i log into the phone queue my landline will ring ill put in a three digit code and then calls are routed to the phone line im on it essentially turns my landline into a softphone rather than using a regular handset or obtaining a nice business phone with a headset and speakerphone i would like to use my pcs modem in conjunction with a normal pc headset and soundcard i know the hardware is capable but the modem didnt come with appropriate software has anyone found anything cheap free that would suit this kind of usage just for clarity i dont want to use a voip solution i need to use my plain old landline my reason is this if im watching a movie or listening to an mp3 while im waiting for a call i dont want it to this is probably better to do in hardware than in software heres what id try get a phone that has a jack for a headset these are usually a 3 32

2907364 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2907365 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2907366 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2907367 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2907368 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2907369 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2907370 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2907371 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2907372 everything you ever need to know you learned in kindergarten yada yada yada
2907373 learning to forgive the weakness in others is learning to acknowledge and forgive the weakness in yourself
2907374 after careful consideration and many sleepless nights heres what ive decided theres no such thing as a grown up we move on we move out we move away from our families and form our own but the basic insecurities the basic fears and all those old wounds just grow up with us and just when we think life and circumstances have forced us truly to become an adult your mother says something like that or worse something like that we get bigger we get taller we get older but for the most part were still a bunch of kids running around the playground trying desperately to fit in

2907407 what they did not realise was that what they were watching was in fact computer graphics meticulously created over a period of months and inserted into the coverage electronically at exactly the right moment
2907408 londons telegraph newspaper reports that some of the fireworks which appeared over beijing during the television broadcast of the olympic opening ceremony were actually computer generated but hold on its not necessarily as bad as you think the faked fireworks were actually set off at the stadium but because of potential dangers in filming the display live from a helicopter viewers at home were shown a pre recorded computer generated shot it sounds dishonest but im not sure its such a terrible thing

2907430 the film is not about a casanova or a playboy as the title seems to suggest its about the three girls and their emotions and struggles my character raj meets them in the course of his life and the films about how they teach him something about life and love
2907431 siddharth is such a foodie there was always good food on the sets before we went to sydney he showed us pictures of the place and said we are going there i was really excited
2907432 we were in awe of her because of her on screen image i was wondering what she would be like and whether she will talk to me at all i was also nervous about touching her and doing all the romantic scenes with her but bipasha made me very comfortable she was very nice to all of us and she shared meals with everyone she is sweet
2907433 i remember in switzerland it was cold there was a scene where minissha and i were on a bike shes not as tall as i so she had to sit on two sand bags for the shooting it was freezing and she was wearing this thin patiala salwar i dont know how she managed
2907434 we had to shoot on this tall mountain right at the edge there was this helicopter that left us there when it was to drop me on the mountain i felt that was my last day in the world when minissha came she was so excited but a big cloud was coming and we couldnt shoot there we had to move out immediately
2907435 we went to all these nice beautiful places we would never have if it wasnt for the film it was somewhat unreal

2907450 vliegtuigen komen in zaventem toe maar kunnen niet worden afgehandeld en blijven dan ook werkloos staan
2907451 ze moeten niet naar zaventem komen want dat dreigen ze hier vast te zitten hun luchtvaartmaatschappij zal naar een oplossing zoeken
2907452 het is onze bedoeling snel tot een akkoord te komen

2907454 brothers in arms kreeg met de jaren een betekenis die het nummer zelf overstijgt
2907455 eigenlijk is het nu meer van het publiek geworden dan van mij vergelijk het met een fotograaf die een nieuwsfoto neemt maar achteraf vaststelt dat die overal weer opduikt en iconische proporties heeft aangenomen
2907456 in elk personage waar ik over schrijf zit een aspect van mezelf verscholen ik heb dus een zekere verwantschap met hen voel met hen mee in wat ze meemaken als songschrijver moet je tonen dat je een hart hebt dat je weet wat mededogen is toen ik brothers in arms schreef heb ik wat oorlogsromans gelezen om een realistische kijk op de zaak te krijgen als je echt wilt overbrengen wat zon man meemaakt kun je niet zomaar wat zinnen op papier zetten dan moet je echt in zijn huid kruipen
2907457 ik liep met mijn vrouw toevallig door zon hifizaak toen ik hem opmerkte hij stond gewoon wat uit zijn nek te kletsen tegen zijn collegas zat commentaar te geven bij alle clips op mtv toen ben ik achter een tv toestel ter plekke zijn opmerkingen zo letterlijk mogelijk beginnen te noteren het zou nooit hetzelfde effect hebben gehad als ik hem al in de eerste zin in de vernieling had geschreven als songschrijver moet je sympathie hebben voor al je personages ik maak geen onderscheid tussen de goeden en de slechten de karakters in mijn nummers zijn trouwens nooit nobele mensen
2907458 op den duur sleepten we te veel bagage achter ons aan de verwachtingen die aan de groepsnaam vasthingen werden onrealistisch en de enorme schaal waarop we genoodzaakt waren te werken zorgde ervoor dat de lol er uiteindelijk af was de podia waren te groot er hing te veel licht boven ons hoofd en er waren te veel mensen voor wie we verantwoordelijk waren het ontbrak ons aan flexibiliteit eigenlijk beschouw ik mezelf als een folkmuzikant ik speel liever in een kader dat qua omvang past bij het schilderij dat ik heb gemaakt bij dire straits moest het canvas per definitie enorm zijn en was het frame eromheen zo groot dat het nauwelijks nog de kamer binnen kon

2907504 le droit des brevets michel vivant dalloz 1997 pp 80 et suivantes
2907505 le droit de brevet est une droit de propri t ayant pour objet une invention

2907520 en r sum mes questions sont les suivantes 1 compte tenu de ma situation est il raisonnable dinvestir 2 dans cette perspective vaut il mieux que je vote pour ou contre la fusion
2907521 les notions quil utilise quotidiennement comme la nouveaut ou lactivit inventive dont il se soucit pour r diger une demande de brevet sont d finies dans le code de la propri t intellectuelle

2907526 the industry megabyte bit growth grew by a stunning 17 percent sequentially during the second quarter blowing isupplis forecast of 10 percent
2907527 the unit growth doesnt seem to be slowing down either and is even higher than that of the first quarter the positive side is that the pc market has been sound however oversupply may be inevitable in the third quarter due to oems aggressive inventory build up during the second quarter
2907528 the market share battle between hynix and elpida could delay the market recovery
2907529 elpida clearly wants to be no 2 soon while hynix will try to reduce its nand growth and to increase dram production to retain its market share

2907547 any idea that an entire national profession of patent attorneys like the french one could be merged into the profession of lawyers with bearable burdens for additional training and with all related consequences in view of the right to appear before all sorts of courts was received with disbelief and disaffirmation amongst german patent attorneys as far as i can tell in view of the german traditions of training lawyers i would even be prepared to go as far as to say that it appears to be inconceivable to launch any political project similar to that currently debated in france for the remainder of this century because of the german profession of lawyers never will be ready to co operate in such a game even if some political pressure were exerted by the german government

2907576 en interrogeant les jeunes de la profession aucun na exprim lopinion que cela serait un motif renoncer cette profession bien au contraire
2907577 un cpi est avant tout un technicien et non un juriste

2907580 parfois certains dirigeants d mocratiques font des choses qui cr ent de grands probl mes pour leur pays

2907588 the fear of asking for help from family and friends is a common issue that can be solved easily by working with someone such as a coach who will not judge your skill level
2907589 i talk with so many people who are afraid to admit that they dont know how to do something because their spouse always handled it these fears are genuine and hard to understand for someone who has not experienced this kind of loss
2907590 if looking for guidance would you seek to find someone who has never stepped out and onto the path marie is one who walks her truth i found solace in the home fire of maries warmth generosity of spirit and laughter
2907591 there is a period of mind numbing grief after losing a spouse but no respite from lifes demands maries experience in business makes her uncommonly qualified to navigate the financial practicalities of life her training and personal experience as a young widow make her a compassionate and empathetic counselor
2907592 an assessment of your lifes journey is just a road map to this point in time it gives you clues about what you may or may not want for yourself in the future to truly know the person you want to become requires objective contemplation in the end it all comes down to the desire to be happy which requires being whole

2907613 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2907614 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2907615 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2907616 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2907617 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2907618 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2907619 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2907620 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2907621 im pleased to see some of you with very solid focus here today
2907622 i know this subject can be hard and some of you are clearly frustrated but are keeping at it anyway and so special kudos to you

2907645 after taking two devastating losses like we did in the last minutes it was good to be able to come back and answer the call when all the adversity was against us and they had the momentum on their side

2907657 un grande toninho horta che per ha potuto esprimersi solo a tratti in un progetto che sembra prendere solo spunto da jobim come un pretesto il numero cospicuo di leader rende necessarie varie combinazioni di formazioni per far esprimere tutti a dovere col rischio per di proporre unesecuzione non basata su una matrice di gruppo ben identificata quanto piuttosto su alcune individualit

2907660 i just dont get it willow i mean if this old book has survived for i cant remember how many years and its sturdy enough to send by us mail why cant giles just go over and pick it up instead of sending us after it
2907661 youd just rather spend time flirting with riley finn is that even i mean hes the teachers assistant are you sure thats not against university policy or something
2907662 well cute guy or boring post office wheres the tough decision and if oz wasnt off at class youd be complaining right along with me wouldnt you
2907663 well maybe but giles is busy with his inventory so he couldnt go during business hours and hes not really certain how trustworthy his register girl is so what else is he going to do
2907664 anyhow he should just tell his friends to ship their stuff over by ups or something they take it right to your door
2907665 holy whos plane is that can i have one and wow
2907666 it sort of resembles a lockheed martin sr 71 but thats a military aircraft and not for any private individual and i think that one was definitely not the standard sr 71 because it was going way too slow so its a carefully modified plane based on a military design whoevers in that plane has access to military plans and some really good scientists
2907667 i used to think i wanted to go into aeronautical engineering before i knew about things going bump lockheeds practically the place to go they do a lot of innovative designs and well im descending into techno geek arent i
2907668 do you think it might be connected to those camouflage people
2907669 aero you mean designing airplanes wow so that plane is a sign of something being up right
2907670 yeah its a big probably doesnt show up on radar sign that things in sunnydale have just gotten a bit more complicated
2907671 lets just hope those are only figurative right we got your package
2907672 and we saw something sort of unexpected well more like really unexpected and possibly one of a kind
2907673 it was this neat looking black plane and it was pretty low
2907674 it wasnt just a plane it looked like a modified lockheed martin sr 71 complete with the radar reflective paint and the nifty angles that cut the radar profile down to almost nothing and it was only a little over the treetops only the military have those planes and they just dont fly that slowly which means that its been modified and modified with something pretty impressive and new like not even published yet type new and that means youre talking engineering geniuses and millions of dollars just to build the plane and whos got that besides the government and why is it in sunnydale
2907675 okay okay its not just a plane its a really expensive plane that shouldnt be here but its definitely not the ordinary thing to see and its sort of not covered in these books
2907676 indeed i suggest perhaps the two of you might try to figure out where it is and if there is any clue as to who or what was flying it possibly some hint as to why theyre here
2907677 right we can go be all looking around oh no if i dont get some help with that paper im doomed
2907678 she talked riley into promising to help her with it
2907679 im just going to go check out that direction maybe see if i see anything
2907680 yes i suppose youre right while i do occasionally wish she took her responsibilities a bit more seriously i wouldnt want her to not be buffy any longer

2907684 i havent been this anxious to play a basketball game since i was like a kid i couldnt sleep i didnt even rest today i was up the whole day just thinking about the game it takes you to walk out on the court to feel it it couldnt get no bigger than this
2907685 theyve lied to us in the past and spent a lot of money on its military budget that can help the poor in our country and help feed others in less fortunate areas
2907686 there will of course be stabilization and slowdown in terms of the high returns seen in a very short period as the uae market has now entered a mature stage
2907687 i believe this is a healthy sign considering that market correction is a global phenomenon what goes up has to come down overall a 10 per cent decline is a happy situation

2907698 it has a disproportionate influence on the space in terms of its overwhelming smell the cultural idea of it and the operational problems created by the mess it produces

2907700 popcorn is a contentious issue lots of people absolutely hate it and have asked us to ban it so were going to do exactly that
2907701 if its a success and ive no reason to suspect it wont be well roll it out across all our cinemas and make it a permanent fixture
2907702 audiences in three venues began asking for popcorn so we provided it
2907703 we have asked people to come out this morning and we hope this will demonstrate the huge scale of the store and exactly how big it is going to be
2907704 if it goes ahead we believe the impact will be catastrophic and lead to an irreversible and fundamental change to the town
2907705 shops that already exist in manningtree will in all probability close down and the effect of traffic congestion on what is already a quite busy road will lead to gridlock around the town
2907706 our proposals will do a lot to add to the vitality and vibrancy of the town centre
2907707 the existing buildings are embarrassing and hardly need to be preserved
2907708 at the moment theres no employment on that land whereas were going to give them more than 100 jobs suffolk homes
2907709 sarah john fraser and i have had a fantastic time here in suffolk it has been a great holiday and i want to thank all the people here for their warmth and hospitality
2907710 dads a celebration of fatherhood from britains finest and funniest
2907711 he left a lovely note to janice and myself to thank us for our hospitality and his wife sarah left the book for us
2907712 it is a very nice gift and i sat and read it and thought that you will learn more about the pm and his family and wife from that than anything else
2907713 from all accounts and from the letter that he left us the family had a wonderful holiday i think he did what everyone else does when they come to suffolk and southwold which is have a very restful time
2907714 my 5 year old daughter olivia wrote a note to mr browns two kids saying that they could use any of their toys my children got a lovely note back from mr browns children thanking them
2907715 you should understand something your security is based on the state of our relationship
2907716 the revelation if true lends enormous credence to what was generally talked about in pakistans streets about the likely killers of benazir bhutto it also lends significance to the last e mail she had sent to her lobbyist in the united states pointing out dangers to her life and indicating who she suspected could be involved if something happened to her
2907717 in the final analysis nothing remains secret and it is a law of nature to expose killers tyrants and brigands in ways one cannot even comprehend
2907718 brown is a very popular name so we did not pay to much attention to it when the booking was made but when he arrived it struck me as being very surreal as you would have thought he would go to a closed screening but the cinema was three quarters full with members of the public
2907719 because she is quite young and not really into her politics she did not recognise him
2907720 she served him like she would any other customer and it was only afterwards that we told her it was the prime minister
2907721 we had some comments from people in the cinema saying was that really the prime minister watching the film and there was a general buzz it was more parents pointing him out to their children so they can say in years to come that they watched a film with the prime minister of the country it was a very surreal experience but one that we are extremely proud of
2907722 its nice that the prime minister chose lowestoft to watch wall e he deserves a break and its pleasing that he came to lowestoft to see such a marvellous film
2907723 when i heard that he had come to the area i sent a note saying that if they would like to come they would be more than welcome i did not expect it to get through because i just sent it for their attention to shadingfield hall
2907724 but obviously it did get through and they took me up on the invitation
2907725 he shook my hand and asked me if i had had a good season
2907726 it was lovely and he was very charming and very chatty it is not everyday that you meet the prime minister and he is like everyone else and entitled to a holiday and to spend time with his boys it was a great pleasure and they seemed very nice

2907743 i think there are people who will not find this sort of thing difficult to believe just as there are people ready to maintain that the true meaning of plato or shakespeare oddly concealed from their contemporaries and immediate successors has preserved its virginity for the daring embraces of one or two modern professors
2907744 private persons must obey governments commanding them to do what they know is sin but perhaps it does mean i write it with some reluctance that the ultimate decision as to what the situation at a given moment is in the highly complex field of international affairs is on which must be delegated
2907745 a man is much more certain that he ought not to murder prisoners or bomb civilians than he ever can be about the justice of a war it is perhaps here that conscientious objection ought to begin i feel certain that one christian airman shot for refusing to bomb enemy civilians would be a more effective martyr in the etymological sense of the word than a hundred christians in jail for refusing to join the army
2907746 when we walked onto the court there was an unbelievable explosion of noise and it went the whole time from start to finish

2907907 nonostante le ultime appararizioni siano state abbastanza deludenti non penso sia il caso di suonare il campanello dallarme non sono per niente preoccupato i test estivi servono a provare e riprovare tante cose studiate in allenamento e soprattutto a capire e limare i punti deboli ci sono molti giocatori nuovi che necessitano tempo e modo per entrare in condizione ed essere giudicati dopo 20 giorni trarre conclusioni mi sembra un po affreattato sono molto fiducioso per limminente stagione la rosa stata adeguatamente rinforzata chi partito stato rimpiazzato con un altro giocatore sempre allaltezza della piazza di udine poi il mister pasquale marino giovane e molto preparato quindi ritengo che la squadra possa fare ancora meglio rispetto alla scorsa stagione
2907908 e una punta devastante gi acquistata due anni fa dalla nostra societ dal cobrolea ma lasciata maturare con calma in queste ultime due stagioni prima al colo colo e poi al river plate squadra dove il ragazzo molto maturato riuscendo a vincere anche il torneo di clausura euna punta da grandi giocate eccelle in velocit e dribbling se dovessi paragonarlo ad un giocatore direi robinho e credo che non appena si inserir negli schemi della squadra sar il grande artefice di tanti successi riponiamo tante speranze in lui lo testimonia il fatto che per dargli continuit abbiamo ceduto asamoah allestero
2907909 onestamente non sono a conoscenza di queste voci e tantomeno che si arrivata in sede unofferta ufficiale per il giocatore posso solo dirvi che si tratta di un centrocampista di grande livello che fa della tecnica la sua arma migliore per lui quest sar lannata della consacrazione di certo la societ punta molto su di lui e credo che rester con noi nel futuro prossimo
2907910 senza dubbio la dirigenza ha svolto un grandissimo lavoro fino a questo momento sono arrivati giocatori di enorme valore che faranno sicuramente bene in una piazza esigente come quella napoletana da tifoso di una maglia che mi ha regalato le soddisfazioni pi grandi nella mia carriera spero davvero che gli azzurri possano regalarci grandi emozioni i tifosi partenopei meritano sicuramente una serata come quella del 17 maggio del 1989 della magica stoccarda da addetto ai lavori posso dire che lorganico deve a mio avviso ancora essere rinforzato magari con un regista dai piedi buoni e un esterno sinistro di esperienza due pedine fondamentali al salto di qualit dellintero collettivo sicuramente qualcuno arriver da qui al primo settembre poich nelle dichiarazioni rilasciate dal vostro presidente c la piena intenzione di comprare ancora
2907911 raccontarvi solo un episodio sarebbe molto riduttivo di fronte al profondo amore che la vostra citt mi ha sempre dimostrato gli anni in maglia azzurra sono stati i pi belli ed emozionanti della mia carriera periodo in cui ho conquistato anche lazzurro della nazionale quindi sar sempre riconoscente alla vostra citt per avermi dato la possibilit di farmi conoscere a livello internazionale
2907912 il calcio lo sport pi amato del mondo proprio questo fatto mi porta a dire che in tutto il mondo possa esserci un futuro talentino basta essere organizzati a livello societario in modo da coprire lintero globo con osservatori capaci e lungimiranti e in tal senso credo che in questi anni ludinese sia un vero e proprio modello da seguire abbiamo creato unorganigramma davvero preparato e di grandi qualit che ci ha permesso di scovare giocatori e portare la societ tra le prime della classe nel nostro paese

2908531 its nice when youve got to hole a putt that you see the line right away
2908532 it was an easy putt to read it was a double break i hit it a cup right of the hole
2908533 i knew the pace was about right i wanted to see it break i was just saying go on keep going keep going break it broke right left and got just inside the left half and dropped very nice
2908534 there is never room for complacency its never safe to take any vote for granted

2908550 i dont want to me chriss son i want to be brian smith middle linebacker for notre dame
2908551 i said the first day the guy who is in position to make the most plays is that position inside
2908552 when we went through the spring the guy who was making the majority of the plays on a daily basis was him
2908553 he was bouncing back between an inside linebacker and an outside linebacker you really couldnt get a grasp for which hed be best at
2908554 when you say you are going to play more of that type on the field then his versatility became a huge asset rather than a initially a tough one to figure what are you going to do with him
2908555 because going back to the recruiting process we had viewed him as both an inside and an outside player we knew we would not be putting him in an unnatural position
2908556 we had already seen him playing there and playing at a high level
2908557 unlike some years previous there are some guys slotted in a spot and theyre going to have to get beat out i would have to say hes one of them
2908558 itll be a lot more aggressive this year its going to be fun this year
2908559 in high school they ended up moving me to defensive end because i was an attacking kind of guy and thats why the early stages of me playing linebacker i didnt quite have the drops and the reads so i was just going after whoever had the ball or whoever was around the ball
2908560 they put me at defensive end because i was an attacking kind of guy so this attacking style of defense suits me very well
2908561 im coming here because i grew up a notre dame fan and i wanted to play for notre dame
2908562 of course my dad played here but at the end of the day i want to make a name for myself
2908563 i think he already had a spirit and pride for the place which i think only makes him want to be successful that much more
2908564 i used to love kory minor and watching kory minor play especially because he wore the single digit the number four i wanted number on my back one day and to play for notre dame
2908565 we feel that a customer would want to buy products that cesar recommends since hes a specialist in his field

2908595 we have recorded one killed in action and 10 wounded from our troops as of this monday morning
2908596 but the military has information that there are also heavy casualties on their milf side
2908597 we have sufficient stocks of basic necessities for the evacuees
2908598 they milf are resisting heavily they would like to make it firm that they should be in those lands
2908599 law enforcement operations will not cease until the five towns are cleared
2908600 the guidance is to apply proportionate and justifiable force if the ground commander thinks that they will need to call for fire they will call for fire but this is not sustained and continuous bombing and shelling
2908601 the process has already started and 70 students have been admitted to the course globalising a resurgent india through innovative transformation grit which kalam will begin teaching from sep 12
2908602 kalam has already written to the students on 10 themes a student would have to primarily build upon
2908603 the themes are highly motivating for instance one of them is on reducing the urban rural divided the second is about energy security third is about water conservation and the fourth is about governance with discrimination the 10 issues are all basic issues relating to governance and policy making synergy between agriculture industry and the service sectors
2908604 the outcome of the course is also likely to be shared with the parliamentary standing committee as well which in turn could take it up with the respective bodies to initiate any changes they feel plausible
2908605 this would indeed be useful for many students and in case they step into politics their priority could be development which is not the case with contemporary politicians guided mostly by their political priorities
2908606 beware the jabberwock my son the jaws that bite the claws that catch beware the jubjub bird and shun the frumious bandersnatch

2908610 be strong everyone and i know your prayers are with us but use you are all greatly in our hearts
2908611 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2908612 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2908613 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2908614 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2908615 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2908616 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
2908617 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
2908618 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
2908619 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
2908620 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
2908621 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
2908622 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
2908623 by combining the two companies we will strengthen our global management team with near shore and off shore service delivery capabilities with an existing customer base in north america australia europe and india
2908624 this initiative opens up tremendous opportunities for acquiring new customers and offers an enhanced range of services to our existing customers in these locations
2908625 looking at the intensity of the case a joint director rank official is likely to probe the case
2908626 the sit will carry on the investigations until the cbi takes over the case
2908627 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
2908628 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
2908629 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
2908630 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
2908631 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2908632 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2908633 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2908634 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
2908635 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
2908636 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
2908637 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
2908638 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
2908639 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
2908640 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
2908641 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
2908642 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
2908643 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
2908644 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
2908645 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
2908646 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
2908647 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
2908648 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
2908649 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
2908650 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
2908651 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
2908652 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
2908653 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
2908654 today is a very big occasion as august 9 is celebrated as quit india movement day this movement was started to drive away english from india today there are certain religious forces who want to break this country on the name of caste and religion
2908655 the political leadership in this country is slave of money and whatever happened in the parliament in the name of confidence motion recently will put to shame any thinking intellectual person
2908656 people of china have every right to host the games olympics because these people the majority of them are not exposed to such openness and such ceremonies and they should enjoy this kind of ceremony but at the same time what we are worried about is that a lot of people are still subject to human rights violations and subject to unbearable torture and repressive measures
2908657 we are here to support the tibetan freedom movement because korea was invaded by japan we experienced the colonization that is why most koreans know the sufferings of being ruled by force many koreans were killed by japanese same thing same dirty history repeats itself again and again that is why i support the tibetan independence
2908658 i am here to make a contribution for peace and for freedom of the tibetans both inside and outside occupied tibet
2908659 we will not allow the company to mine our land our sacred place any compensation they offer is worthless to us
2908660 there is large scale migration into the state because of which the infrastructure has collapsed we have limited resources within which we have to manage
2908661 goa needs to be allotted special status to restrain people from buying land here the land dealings should be controlled or else we will not leave any land for our posterity
2908662 well i havent really thought about it too much it was just on my mind
2908663 now im starting to embrace it and it makes life easier
2908664 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
2908665 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
2908666 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
2908667 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
2908668 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
2908669 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
2908670 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
2908671 who are open to doing something on the production side
2908672 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
2908673 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
2908674 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
2908675 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
2908676 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
2908677 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
2908678 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
2908679 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
2908680 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
2908681 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
2908682 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
2908683 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
2908684 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
2908685 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
2908686 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
2908687 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
2908688 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
2908689 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
2908690 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
2908691 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
2908692 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
2908693 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
2908694 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
2908695 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
2908696 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
2908697 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
2908698 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
2908699 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
2908700 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
2908701 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
2908702 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
2908703 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
2908704 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
2908705 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
2908706 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
2908707 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
2908708 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology

2908710 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
2908711 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough

2908728 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
2908729 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1

2908734 god saw all that he created and behold it was very good

2908736 look at three things and you wont come to sin where you are going to the grave ethics of the fathers 3 1 ethics of the fathers does not say where you will be going in the future but where you are already going from the time we are born we begin a journey whose destination is our eventual death and entry into the afterlife thats why we must make the most out of every single day of our lives as the talmud states rabbi eliezer said repent one day before your death his students asked him does a person know when his day of death will occur he answered them then he should repent today perhaps he will die tomorrow thus all his days will be full of repentance this is what king solomon said in kohelet 9 8 your clothing should be white at all times there is an allegory which illustrates this a king invited his servants to a grand feast but did not inform them when the feast was to transpire the smart ones dressed in their finest clothes and prepared themselves by waiting outside the palaces entrance the foolish ones remained in their common clothes and continued to engage in their own pursuits thinking they had plenty of time suddenly the king asked for all to attend and only the smart ones were asked to sit eat drink and enjoy

2908775 have nowhere to go but up and consumers and airlines in the united states are being dragged along for a very uncomfortable ride

2908803 he seemed fit he wasnt rippling with muscles but he had a slim build he wasnt fat
2908804 in people over 50 its almost always due to coronary heart disease in a younger person it is still frequently due to coronary disease but more often due to other problems he said
2908805 an arrhythmia is almost always the cause of sudden death he said
2908806 the heart develops this chaotic rhythm it quivers and doesnt pump out blood and the person loses consciousness
2908807 this type of occurrence happens at least once in most city2surf races

2908809 it can still happen because some people have inherited predisposition to having problems of rhythmic generation or with the muscles of their heart
2908810 for almost 10 months the story of john edwardss affair remained the nearly exclusive province of the national enquirer through reports denials news of a pregnancy questions about paternity and finally a slapstick chase through a hotel in beverly hills

2908822 i imagine it was a pretty horrific scene with two people getting struck by a vehicle and not stopping and continuing on

2908834 regardless of whether bob was double teamed or even triple teamed hed still beat you there were times when he didnt even confront the opposition at all he would either jump over them go around them or strategically outsmart them by making the play
2908835 one of my goals was making the ryder cup team and with this finish it should be enough
2908836 youve got to have sergio on the team you cant leave him out
2908837 i think i found a really good space but i cant tell anyone its not trademarked yet

2908842 when you think of soul music you think of isaac hayes the expression the sound and the creativity that goes along with it
2908843 even in his later years he never hesitated to appear for a cause or endorse something that he felt was for the good of mankind he will be sorely missed
2908844 they could go to the bathroom they could get a sandwich or whatever
2908845 the rappers have gone in and created a lot of hit music based upon my influence
2908846 a lot of artists owe isaac his career because a lot of music was based on his foundation
2908847 a person that speaks his mind hes sensitive enough to care for children hes wise enough to not be put into the wack category like everybody else in town and he l o o o o ves the ladies
2908848 there is a place in this world for satire but there is a time when satire ends and intolerance and bigotry toward religious beliefs of others begins

2908854 jangan kamu berdusta ke atasku sesiapa berdusta ke atasku maka dia masuk neraka
2908855 ia merangkumi setiap pendusta ke atas nabi s a w dan semua jenis pendustaan ke atas baginda
2908856 tidak halal kepada sesiapa yang mengetahui ia hadis palsu meriwayatkannya dalam apa bentuk sekalipun melainkan disertai dengan menerangkan kepalsuannya
2908857 allah melihat kepada hamba hamba nya pada malam nisfu syaaban maka dia ampuni semua hamba hambanya kecuali musyrik orang yang syirik dan yang bermusuh orang benci membenci riwayat ibn hibban al bazzar dan lain lain
2908858 tidak pernah diriwayatkan daripada nabi s a w dan para sahabat bahawa mereka berhimpun di masjid untuk menghidupkan malam nisfu syaaban membaca doa tertentu dan solat tertentu seperti yang kita lihat pada sebahagian negeri orang islam

2908870 we have been made aware of the police investigation and he was immediately suspended which is normal procedure in situations like this
2908871 police cars will use bus lanes as well as hard shoulders on motorways or roads like the a14 so do not pull into them to make room for police cars try to make a gap the size of a lane

2908873 i was devastated because i had only been there for four days
2908874 i was grateful to my niece but i had lived by myself for eight or nine years
2908875 all in all it was a horrendous ordeal and the flat should have been built to standards
2908876 there should be some compensation from the developers or recognition of what has happened its not about the money its about what i have had to go through
2908877 guidelines for a long lived long valuable institution serve the long view and the long viewer foster responsibility reward patience mind mythic depth ally with competition take no sides leverage longevity

2908883 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
2908884 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
2908885 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
2908886 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
2908887 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas

2908891 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
2908892 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
2908893 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
2908894 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
2908895 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
2908896 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
2908897 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
2908898 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
2908899 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
2908900 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
2908901 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that

2908903 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
2908904 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
2908905 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
2908906 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools

2908921 i imagine it was a pretty horrific scene with two people getting struck by a vehicle and not stopping and continuing on
2908922 thats what were looking for once you find the vehicle thats the one piece of the puzzle
2908923 were trying to locate anyone connected with the driver were looking for the registered owner or anyone who had custody of the vehicle at that time

2908939 antes cuando el alumno suspend a un parcial se pon a enseguida las pilas y se apuntaba a clases para prepararse para el pr ximo examen ahora en cambio la dejan directamente para septiembre y no siguen trabajando en ella
2908940 en primero me pareci que la asignatura era muy dif cil por eso pens en prepararla en clases particulares
2908941 lo bueno de las academias es que te explican directamente lo que caer en el examen y van al grano
2908942 dej estructura de datos directamente para septiembre porque es muy complicada
2908943 id say for both our guys ive yet to see them get hot
2908944 theyll get their two hits here their three hits there but i havent seen them do what ive seen them do over the past two years
2908945 if they can get that going and finish strong they both have a shot it would be fun to see it come down to the two of them
2908946 what it comes down to in a lot of my starts
2908947 is that you cant give up a big inning ive allowed some critical hits
2908948 that can be a tricky ball to track because of the spin on it if they get a couple of runs there you never know
2908949 if i had perfect foresight i would never have taken this job in the first place
2908950 he felt it a little in chicago but thought it was getting better
2908951 its bothering him pretty good i dont know exactly what it is but its in his shoulder and could be a dangerous one as far as time is concerned
2908952 this time of year i cant have guys sitting around we cant fool around too many days this is starting to be crunch time and we have to go out there with all the ammo we have
2908953 i can be in the outfield and play every day i dont feel like a baseball player when i dh i dont know how to be the leader that i am from the bench i cant be a vocal leader
2908954 i cant talk to guys from the bench because i dont feel right about it im in a role now where i dont know what to do really the guys are out there busting their butts for nine innings they come in and they hit and they grind i just sit down and hit
2908955 thats all i do so i cant be in a leadership role from that position
2908956 i thought he was sluggish but i was proud of him
2908957 i dont mean he was brutal he just wasnt himself
2908958 he didnt take his best stuff or his best location out there with him but he still won the ball game thats pretty impressive
2908959 they have real good arms there will be no breathers were going to see four guys with real good stuff
2908960 theyre a very capable team a lot of people consider roy halladay the best pitcher in the american league
2908961 even if it had stayed a four run lead before the tigers tacked on four more in the eighth i would have brought him in because he hadnt pitched in three days
2908962 but it worked out perfectly because i thought it was a good time for him to get acclimated back to detroit not a lot of pressure not a huge situation
2908963 if i had perfect foresight i would never have taken this job in the first place
2908964 if i had perfect foresight i would never have taken this job in the first place
2908965 i managed to sleep for another three hours but the sleep didnt take away the pain that im dealing with now
2908966 my mother encouraged him to go fulfill his dream and make his father proud
2908967 this would have been his will i think any elite athlete could relate to this feeling sometimes you just feel deep in your heart what the right thing is to do
2908968 i know how hard this has been on alon and were just doing everything we can to support him
2908969 alon decided several years ago when he was probably half the size he is now and when i still as able to beat him up that he was going to be an olympian
2908970 we all thought he was crazy because his times were so much slower my father even bet him that if he made the olympic team he would shave his mustache
2908971 he shaved it the day alon left with the team for the olympics
2908972 if i had perfect foresight i would never have taken this job in the first place
2908973 they say this cat shaft is a bad mother shut your mouth
2908974 the voter registration officials simply take the word of the registrant with no follow up
2908975 some states that require some backup documentation merely ask for a utility bill or a drivers license neither of which prove citizenship in other words legal or illegal aliens can easily register to vote in local and national elections
2908976 while the news media perpetuated the assertion that bush and the gop stole the election it could very well have been illegal aliens voting in florida that made the outcome so close
2908977 bush may have beaten gore by more votes if illegals were excluded since immigrants tend to vote for democrats or gore could have won decisively had there been prior screening before people were allowed into the voting booths
2908978 there was absolutely no mention in the mainstream media regarding suspected voter fraud by illegal or legal aliens it was much easier for the agenda driven newspeople to accuse republicans of stealing the election
2908979 florida is not unique thousands of non citizens are registered to vote in some states and tens if not hundreds of thousands in total may be present on the voter rolls nationwide these numbers are significant local elections are often decided by only a handful of votes and even national elections have likely been within the margin of the number of non citizens illegally registered to vote
2908980 there is no reliable method to determine the number of non citizens registered or actually voting because most laws to ensure that only citizens vote are ignored are inadequate or are systematically undermined by government officials those who ignore the implications of non citizen registration and voting either are willfully blind to the problem or may actually favor this form of illegal voting
2908981 americans would be shocked to discover that hundreds of thousands of general election voters are illegal aliens green card immigrants and criminals whove murdered raped and robbed us citizens and guess which political party benefits the most from their votes the one thats pushing for amnesty and a bag full of free goodies
2908982 to keep non citizens from diluting citizens votes immigration and election officials must cooperate far more effectively than they have to date and state and federal officials must increase their efforts to enforce the laws against non citizen voting that are already on the books
2908983 while the liberal media and the liberal establishment ignore what is a huge scandal american voters are having their rights violated when an illegal aliens or felon or other person prohibited by law to vote their votes cancels out those of american citizens
2908984 liberals want illegal aliens and felons to vote they benefit from such rampant fraud

2908989 when you come here you know that rangers will play every season in europe and its a dream for the players
2908990 i was very disappointed sitting in my room it was raining and i didnt feel good
2908991 afterwards it was brighter and i thought my contract is four years and we will win the championship and there will be no worries
2908992 of course european football was a big reason for me coming here
2908993 i saw the uefa cup final last year and i knew that there would be the chance of champions league football every year so it was a dream
2908994 i want to play in the champions league next year but i can wait for europe its no problem i am 25 so i have time to play in europe
2908995 when you go to a big club everybody phones you your family and friends and says its fantastic
2908996 it was frustrating watching rangers go out but now its behind us and were concentrating on the league and we want to win trophies
2908997 we had a meeting on friday with the gaffer and the coach and he told us that the fans would roar us on if we did well and if not we would have a very bad season
2908998 we won and that is a big help we have to give 200 every game for the fans because there are 50 000 in every game at ibrox

2909000 the jobs market has been one of the few bright spots in the uk economy but cracks are appearing in the face of an increasingly uncertain economic outlook
2909001 even if we avoid the scale of jobs fallout suffered in previous downturns the era of the candidates recruitment market is already over with people in work becoming increasingly anxious that their p45 might soon be on its way
2909002 with pay pressure still subdued mounting job insecurity is being compounded by a significant squeeze on workers real incomes but the absence of any sign of an emerging wage price spiral at least offers greater hope that the bank of england might soon be able to cut interest rates to head off the threat of recession
2909003 companies are now reacting to deteriorating market conditions with sales slowing and input costs rising but scope to raise prices limited by weakening demand finances are under pressure
2909004 it looks as if employment costs the main area over which businesses retain control are taking the strain with employers seeking both to keep a lid on pay settlements and in increasing numbers planning for redundancies the labour market is suddenly looking a lot less resilient

2909039 the political calculus is edwards hopes that his admission of having an affair will allow the incident to blow over allowing him to proceed with his political career
2909040 in 2006 i made a serious error in judgment and conducted myself in a way that was disloyal to my family and to my core beliefs i was and am ashamed of my conduct and choices and i had hoped that it would never become public with my family i took responsibility for my actions in 2006 and today i take full responsibility publicly but that misconduct took place for a short period in 2006 it ended then
2909041 being in love with a still somewhat dysfunctional married man
2909042 in the context of admitting to an affair it may seem innocent for edwards to have misled abc about the starting point but the precise date is important over the course of nine months edwards would spend more than 114 000 of the one america committees budget on hunters films whether he did that in an effort to have hunter around or as a legitimate documentary project would likely make a difference to those who thought they were contributing to a poverty eradication effort
2909043 china is getting ready for the olympics the official motto for the olympics is one world one dream restrictions apply tibet not included
2909044 china has announced that during the olympics protesters will be allowed to assemble in designated protest areas yeah or as theyre commonly called in china jails
2909045 beijing skies are so polluted that chinese authorities are planning emergency measures for the olympics for example protesters will now only be run over with hybrid tanks
2909046 everybody going to the olympics is concerned about the air quality in china there is a lot of smog friends over there tell me that the air in china looks like the air in willie nelsons tour bus
2909047 theres excitement in the air over the olympics also lead arsenic benzene
2909048 for some reason theyre having the olympics in beijing which means the chinese government right now is very hard at work trying to cover up all the horrible things about their country its like when your mom comes to visit your dorm room
2909049 china has announced that theyre shutting down several of their largest factories for the rest of the summer so that there will be less pollution for the olympics chinese officials say sorry but for the next few months youre going to have to buy your lead coated toys somewhere else
2909050 china is upset because somebody leaked a video of the rehearsal for the olympics opening ceremony on the internet i dont want to give away too much but it ends with the lighting of a torch
2909051 but i think the u s is going to do well particularly in swimming i think we have a very strong swimming team this year for the olympics yeah thats right dick cheney in particular looks great in the freestyle waterboarding
2909052 now you think im exaggerating but they had a practice today in beijing for the olympics and a javelin thrower threw the javelin up into the air and it stuck
2909053 yesterday president bush gave the u s olympic team a rousing send off to the olympics again i dont think president bush is that up on geography like he told the athletes to get there a couple of days early to acclimate themselves to the fact that china is upside down
2909054 and china says it will ban entertainers they deem a threat to the government from taking part in any activities during the olympics
2909055 and human rights activists have sent a letter to president bush asking him to raise human rights issues with the chinese government during the olympics unfortunately they also sent a letter to the chinese government asking them to bring up human rights issues with president bush so its pretty much a wash

2909133 r amp d is basically seeking out new knowledge and the question is where are the good ideas
2909134 after world war ii the good ideas were loaded up in a small number of large companies
2909135 product markets got more competitive and those big companies couldnt sustain the long term investments in research that they could in the earlier period

2909265 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2909266 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2909267 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2909268 modern writers injure the smoothness of our tongue by omitting vowels wherever it is possible and joining the harshest consonants together with only an apostrophe between thus for judged in it self not the smoothest of words they say
2909269 poor old ben he ought to be very grateful that he is not alive to see what writers have done to the smoothness of our tongue today
2909270 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2909271 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

2909303 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2909304 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2909305 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

2909313 the hebrew writer of the bible was not so well acquainted with egypt as has often been imagined
2909314 d they sold joseph to the ishmaelites for 20 pieces of silver and they brought joseph to egypt
2909315 and josephs master took him and put him in the prison a place where the kings prisoners were confined
2909316 then pharaoh sent and called joseph and they brought him hastily out of the dungeon and he shaved himself and changed his garment and came in to pharaoh
2909317 and pharaoh took off his ring from his hand and put it upon josephs hand and arrayed him in garments of fine linen and put a gold collar about his neck
2909318 and pharaoh charged all his people saying every son who is born you shall throw into the river and every daughter you shall let live
2909319 and joseph ordered his servants the physicians to embalm his father
2909320 and these are the names of the sons of israel who came to egypt
2909321 but god made me joseph a father to pharaoh and lord of all his house and a ruler throughout all the land of egypt
2909322 go yourselves and take for yourselves straw where you can find it but do not diminish from your work anything
2909323 the lord god of the hebrews has met with us moses and aaron and now let us go we beseech you three days journey into the wilderness that we may sacrifice to the lord our god
2909324 but god made me joseph a father to pharaoh and lord of all his house and a ruler throughout all the land of egypt
2909325 and the egyptians made the people of israel serve with rigor and they made their lives bitter with hard slavery in mortar and in brick and in all kinds of service in the field all their service which they made them serve was with rigor

2909343 maybe its so bad it has actually wrapped all the way around and its good again
2909344 i like ross he did a good job for us i have nothing to say bad about him we had him on trade waivers and nobody claimed him
2909345 right now were not heading north and lately weve been headed south
2909346 there are things we have to find out about other guys hanigan has a chance to be in our future and we need to learn if he can be a regular or if he can be a no 2 next year
2909347 i was having fun playing at louisville its an honor to be up here but louisville was winning games and it was a fun team to be on now i shift gears try to learn the pitchers see how things go
2909348 i just try to put good swings on the ball im a catcher and im here for the pitchers but hopefully i can add some offense too
2909349 its not the big leagues but honestly im looking forward to it they are seven or eight games up and in a playoff race when i was down there before the guys were winning and there is good morale
2909350 his last outing was his best since ive been here
2909351 my advice to him was win and improve then come back here and continue to improve im big on showing improvement and if you do that youre showing me you have the ability to learn retain and apply what you learn
2909352 ive worked hard for this and ill take it for what it is take it for the experience ill get
2909353 definitely an honor ill do my best to learn and improve my game by being here
2909354 making this team is up to me and how well i play
2909355 i need to perform really well in all the preseason games and show the coaching staff that i am the type of player who can contribute
2909356 i gotta go to work every day and improve every day
2909357 if im not getting better at certain things its really not good for me and a waste of time for me its hard to keep that focus knowing that every day you have to do something better if you slip its hard to get that rope back i think that if i can keep working on the things i need to work on i can be a contributor
2909358 brad is another all around guy we played him at fullback we played him as a backup tight end hes smart and he can kind of do it all so that increases his value because he can do more things and so i think special teams will impact him as well so well give him an opportunity on special teams
2909359 why are they pitching him after only one rehab start in louisville have they looked at the standings do they want to ruin the guy bad idea
2909360 but everything i threw right over the middle of the plate they were sitting on my slider especially the first inning everything they hit was a slider
2909361 i wasnt getting good depth on the slider and it definitely wasnt the way i wanted to come back
2909362 it has been a bad home series for us all 1 6 including houstons four game sweep we have some soul searching to do and figure some things out
2909363 we helped a lot of batting average the last four games because every time i looked up they had double digits in hits
2909364 the problem i saw when i got here is that we had a dozen or so eligible free agents
2909365 when the season gets late if you are in the hunt through october then it can be a motivator if you are not in the hunt you see a lot more i have to look out for myself type of thing
2909366 i didnt say im seeing it here but ive seen it happen human nature makes sense
2909367 when you are 18 games out its tough to say im going to get that runner over from second to third with nobody out by giving myself up it is a lot easier when you are winning at this time of year
2909368 winning takes care of a lot of stuff including my sleep pattern
2909369 the next six weeks count a lot were looking at who still wants to win right now thats big if you want to win right now under these circumstances then how much better are you going to be in better circumstances
2909370 its like a broken record us getting behind early in every game
2909371 some weekend four losses to houston some week 1 6 on the homestand it wasnt just a bad game sunday it was a bad week
2909372 it could be you press guys wanting an interview something involving tickets or the logistics of practice at the olympics it could be for just about anything
2909373 it was horrific someone that we love and care about whose family was attacked
2909374 it was pretty silent for a while as a male sport we tend to hide our feelings a lot but it definitely became a moment where guys let out how they felt about the situation
2909375 we were trying to make decisions people were supposed to fly here should we tell them to come we didnt know if it was something related to u s athletes usa volleyball or a random act of violence which we now know it was
2909376 our knee jerk reactions were like probably any other human being youre angry upset and we wanted to talk to our friends and family that are here or back home and figure out how we felt about everything
2909377 i talked with my wife an hour about whether or not they should come here and shes a lot stronger than i am she puts things in perspective
2909378 she said unfortunately bad things happen back in fort wayne ind where were from but every day we still go to coney island downtown still go get gas still go to wal mart and thats kind of how you got to go about it
2909379 while your thoughts and prayers always are with the families they would want us to continue on this journey we started four years ago in the end youve got to keep living life
2909380 to me that was a strong indication of her love
2909381 its hard to put it in words thats not something thats supposed to happen
2909382 for all intents it appears to be a random attack by a deranged man
2909383 the only thing weve heard is they were not identifiable except for a small volleyball pin which would probably be invisible to a guy
2909384 we dont believe this was targeted at american citizens and we dont believe it has anything to do with the olympics
2909385 we wanted to do something with our jerseys but we didnt have time
2909386 so we put wizs moms initials and dads initials on the back of our shoes
2909387 obviously you look over to the bench for guidance in difficult situations and we had a couple today
2909388 interim coach larsen is completely capable but its also weird to look over and not see hughs face he puts so much passion in what he does
2909389 whenever i get a chance to put on cleats and play football offensive football im happy im just blessed to be out here
2909390 ive never had a problem with the pressure or expectations
2909391 they drafted me to be a running back so whatever that entails however they feel i can help the team running catching doing both thats what theyll work me into doing
2909392 im just trying to work hard show where i can help the offense at then its up to the coaches to see when they want to put me in
2909393 even if you work so hard you can still get injured and your season can be over with just like that it humbled me as a person and basically let me know ive got to work harder
2909394 know what type of player i am they just havent really seen it what theyre doing is holding people accountable i think im accountable im out here working trying to better myself
2909395 its going to be a packed house and a lot of fun and a great atmosphere for these young guys to put on their nfl uniform for the first time walk out on the field and say oh my gosh here i am it beats some of the places like the swamp university of florida and the coliseum southern california these guys have been
2909396 but the field doesnt change im just going out to play football im not worried about the crowd big time players show up in big time situations thats what i strive for
2909397 every year youre excited about getting to the first preseason game hitting somebody else and then seeing how your younger people respond in that environment
2909398 some guys are in an nfl game for the first time its always fun to watch their reaction see who seems comfortable and see who maybe seems a little out of their element
2909399 the games are different than practice theres no way to simulate it itll be fun to watch and see how they operate
2909400 we have an idea of what green bays going to do
2909401 what wed like to do is do our thing and find out how our guys react to things they havent seen before
2909402 its mostly about can they react under game time pressure this is a great atmosphere because its monday night and its green bay its going to be like a regular season game were going to find out if the lights are too bright for em or theyre ready to go
2909403 were not going to be distracted by the whole brett favre thing
2909404 that has nothing to do with the cincinnati bengals thats a green bay thing
2909405 were going to leave the distractions to the media and just go out there and hustle play hard and do our assignments
2909406 first of all this is something youve been doing your whole life
2909407 its still 10 yards for a first down you still have to cross the goal line to score a touchdown the main thing is go out and have fun because whatever you do if you have fun doing it youll do it a lot better
2909408 the urs tournament is a great tradition teams are glad to come play in it and give back a little bit into the community im a believer of if you take something out you put something back thats what were trying to do
2909409 ive just been trying to work on everything every single day to get better to be a well rounded heavyweight fighter and a contender in the ufc
2909410 mate you cant bring that in the car with you eh
2909411 come on mate i can see you trying to hide it behind your back can you please leave it here cause it is not coming in my car with us
2909412 you are a pretty stick the rules kind of girl arent you
2909413 its always tough when youve got a veteran guy who is a good person works hard does everything you ask
2909414 its a pretty difficult offense to learn and im sure the one ive been in the last 16 years has been difficult too itll take some time but i think well be fine
2909415 that seems like so long ago it seems like a dream

2909423 its my fourth trip to china and i know the way people here express their feelings about basketball its just like in america they love it and love to play it and most of all they love yao hes like their savior hes the heart of sports here
2909424 were clearly not at the level of the americans but we wont shy away from a chance of playing the best players in the world in front of all our fans its something ive dreamed about for a long long time
2909425 i dont think we understood what it meant to be an olympian and to put on a usa uniform we didnt realize all the people we were representing growing up i never thought about being an olympian all i thought about was playing in the nba
2909426 but in the last couple of years ive come to understand what this is about
2909427 and i know now this is 20 times bigger than an nba championship the whole world is watching here
2909428 the thing is we have a lot of winners on this team i dont have an nba championship or a gold medal but i won three of four state championships in my high school career and we went on to win 109 games and lose just six
2909429 i know what it takes to win and i think i know how to do it the right way on this team i think we all do now we understand what it takes to be an olympian
2909430 watch us on sunday well show you what it takes

2909483 the house that non deductible debt that is the killer
2909484 if you can get rid of the mortgage in 10 15 years then you can focus your entire finances on the rest of the stuff which is usually saving for retirement
2909485 the biggest thing that hinders the accumulation because debt takes so much money away into the wrong areas especially if the debt is not deductible like the house mortgage or the credit card
2909486 theres some big saving to be had by paying off a mortgage and its risk free you control how fast it goes down you control when you pay it off theres no additional risk because it is your mortgage you have already
2909487 its boring theres no excitement whatsoever to paying off debt but it works like a charm
2909488 one of the approaches weve had in the past is make your rrsp contribution but then use the tax refund that you receive and use that to pay down your mortgage more aggressively
2909489 the benefits of starting an rrsp early are significant because of the effects of the compounding interest

2909541 go get it look at the birth announcements on page eight ill get another cup of coffee while you do
2909542 ive got to buy that woman a decent pair of slippers for christmas this year
2909543 thats the same last name she had last time but what the
2909544 check out the list of the other children four others and a combined total of three different last names between the five of them
2909545 fathers day must be fun how old is this girl anyway
2909546 well i dont know exactly but according to my calculations she cant be more than twenty three
2909547 lets say shes twenty five five kids by the time youre twenty five years old with three different fathers makes for an extremely difficult life unless your last name is trump or hilton or one of the fathers is brad pitt
2909548 im stunned it seems like the last birth announcement was just a few months ago
2909549 i know i dont think it was even a year ago
2909550 the joys of small town life your personal business published for the whole village to gossip about
2909551 well as i remember it there was a hospital volunteer who came to my room and went over all of the relevant information with me i remember that she asked my parents names and the names of samuels parents i thought it was for the birth certificate but the enterprise published one of these announcements when alex was born so i think the hospital forwards the details to the newspaper
2909552 but there are a couple photos of other babies included in this article
2909553 those pictures had to have been submitted by the family
2909554 i just cant imagine trying to take care of all those kids when i was that age i couldnt even walk and chew gum yet
2909555 when you were that age you were in graduate school working two or was it three part time jobs and juggling at least as many men as i remember it including one professor
2909556 do you realize that by the time he and i were that age it was already over i was wearing bell bottoms the night we broke up i had been disco dancing with dave the night before its beyond ancient history girlfriend according to this blurb hes still married to the mrs and they are the proud grandparents of the five little rugrats ill bet the little mrs is helping raise them and hes providing financial support their house
2909557 remember the question i asked you a few weeks ago
2909558 well id better let you get ready for work and i have a ton of errands to run today im leaving on sunday remember
2909559 i have it on my calendar shall we have brunch before we head to the airport
2909560 theyre going fishing with a couple of sams buddies from work so it will have to be just us girls
2909561 excellent you pick the place my plane leaves at 3 00 p m so well have plenty of time to linger over our mimosas
2909562 youre not going to be happy until i do are you
2909563 nope i really want to know what you believe deep down inside in that dark vulnerable little corner of your heart that you have convinced everyone else has no address
2909564 you have to promise me that we will not speak of this again i will answer the question once but then thats the end of it talking about it incessantly is pointless the past is well the past we cant change history no matter how much we might wish we could
2909565 the answer is yes i believe in my what did you call it
2909566 the dark vulnerable little corner of your heart that everyone else thinks has no address
2909567 i believe that he would have had a better life if he had chosen me there i said it out loud i believe that all the way to the dark vulnerable little corner of my soul not just my heart if he had loved me even half as much as i loved him it would have been enough for me i would have married him given birth to all the little crumb crunchers he wanted and id be chasing all those grandkids around with him right now
2909568 he didnt love me did he so this is an entirely academic exercise i havent seen him in nearly thirty years so i have no way of knowing whether hes happy or not he might be flippin ecstatic every minute of every day for all i know i cant judge the quality of someone elses life even though i am completely convinced that under my value system we would have had a fabulous life together and i naturally enjoy imagining that hes completely miserable
2909569 she let her voice trail off and paused for a moment as she considered her words carefully his house is undoubtedly child proofed and hes probably lost more than a few nights sleep about his daughters circumstances i in contrast am enjoying my hard earned retirement my investment accounts are doing quite nicely in spite of the current economic climate there is no spit up or drool on my new living room furniture which by the way you still havent come over to see and i have to get to the travel agency and pick up my tickets and itinerary this morning i dont think about him except when i pick up the newspaper and see another one of these silly announcements o k satisfied

2909619 we do think there are many witnesses because at that time around 7 p m there were a lot of people in the park or in the surroundings of the park

2909632 the fault of dawkins as an academic was his scandalous and apparently deliberate refusal to present the doctrine which he appears to think he has refuted in its strongest form
2909633 an academic attacking some ideological position which he believes to be mistaken must of course attack that position in its strongest form this dawkins does not do in the case of einstein and his failure is the crucial index of his insincerity of academic purpose and therefore warrants me in charging him with having become what he has probably believed to be an impossibility a secularist bigot

2909661 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
2909662 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
2909663 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
2909664 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
2909665 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
2909666 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
2909667 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
2909668 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
2909669 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
2909670 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
2909671 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt

2909676 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba

2909678 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
2909679 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
2909680 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
2909681 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
2909682 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
2909683 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
2909684 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
2909685 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
2909686 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
2909687 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
2909688 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
2909689 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
2909690 saat 50 meter terakhir saya melihat bernard berada di depan dan saya katakan ini tidak boleh terjadi ini adalah ajang olimpiade dan saya harus meraihnya
2909691 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
2909692 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
2909693 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
2909694 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
2909695 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
2909696 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
2909697 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military

2909700 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
2909701 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
2909702 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
2909703 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
2909704 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
2909705 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
2909706 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
2909707 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
2909708 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
2909709 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
2909710 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
2909711 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
2909712 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
2909713 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
2909714 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
2909715 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
2909716 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
2909717 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
2909718 is it bright where you are have the people change does it make you happy youre so strange and in your darkest hour i hold secrets flame we can watch the world devoured in its pain
2909719 no penile mutilation in my threads the penis is an object of worship not sacrifice

2909721 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
2909722 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
2909723 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
2909724 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
2909725 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
2909726 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
2909727 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
2909728 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security

2909743 i gave it everything i possibly had but she got me in the end

2909746 what happened to my family and me is like fruit from a poisonous tree the fruit will also be poisoned

2909752 were in a black hole at the moment as far as research goes but it is hard to imagine a world in the future where these technologies are not deployed more widely
2909753 we need to get the evidence to see if these things can be deployed on a wide scale
2909754 the extreme environmentalists are preventing us from collecting the evidence we have to go public and try to move the public debate forward we know what the consequences will be but we need that debate
2909755 we have major concerns we have no idea what the interaction with wild trees could be there could be unforeseen consequences
2909756 there is a growing global movement for a complete moratorium on gm trees because of their ecological impact these trees could cross pollinate with wild trees over great distances if traits are passed on to native trees it can have a significant negative impact on biodiversity
2909757 gm trees are a very bad idea for a lot of reasons if these trees are released into the environment then contamination is inevitable we do not support any trials because there is no guarantee against escapes of the genetically modified traits
2909758 the real tragedy of the attacks on the field trials were that they actually prevented us accumulating the knowledge of just how useful they could be i cant see any justification for interfering with field trials
2909759 the whole area has had such a bad press that it would be a real bonus to find an example where they could show a conservation benefit to make people stop and think again that it could be beneficial rather than the entrenched positions almost knee jerk responses that some of the conservation groups have come out with
2909760 in other parts of the world people really are pursuing it much more actively than we are at the moment if these trees do offer benefits we will be left behind
2909761 we are always open minded and if there were a potentially significant gm breakthrough which for example would allow a reduction in pesticide use or would tackle a challenge thrown up by climate change such as from new pests and diseases then we would consider it within the context of sustainable forest management with partners in the environmental sector and in government

2909772 if the question is are there factors to chase the dollar higher then the answer would be no the dollar is unlikely to keep extending gains so one sidedly against the euro

2909774 all those short us dollar long commodities gains of the past six months are being squeezed away
2909775 i personally oppose the presidents power to sack the parliament and the government and believe it should be scrapped but i also oppose the presidents impeachment

2909785 while expressing in private the need for opposition co operation across the limpopo he later publicly changed his tune and started singing in the anti da dp caucus doubtless encouraged by the anc
2909786 whom he visited while claiming he had never done so
2909787 i thought such public disclaimers of known private realities revealed a troubling inconsistency it confirmed that while courage is a non negotiable of leadership particularly of any opposition force in africa it must be coupled to strategic coherence

2909796 there certainly is a level of isi complicity in the militant areas in pakistan and organisations such as the taliban
2909797 i cant say to what level of leadership that goes to but there are indications of complicity on the part of isi to the extent that they are facilitating these militant groups that come out of the tribal areas in pakistan
2909798 unfortunately we see a higher number of non pashtun non afghanistan fighters this year than this time last year
2909799 they are really from a variety of ethnic groupings some are from areas in pakistan some are from places like uzbekistan or chechnya some are from europe and some are from other arab countries
2909800 but when you have a problem of porous borders and fighters and weapons and resources and command and control and logistics being brought in from outside of afghanistan that adds a complicating context to the insurgency
2909801 it is more about weakness in other economies in the eurozone for instance
2909802 there was nothing really in the statement to confirm a 50 basis point cut come september when the rba meets
2909803 it is a bit of a relief rally for the aussie dollar

2909844 lets say a son was reviewing his fathers life insurance policy after the father had just passed away would he get the money
2909845 it depends on who the beneficiary is it also depends if there is a surviving
2909846 in that case the life insurance policy would be terminated and a check would be sent in the amount of the policy
2909847 after i got the check could i use that money for anything would i be able to pay off a gambling debt what if i wanted to set a mistress up in an apartment could i use it to support my drug habit
2909848 i am not sure why you are telling me all of that i am not really interested in hearing about any illegal or immoral activity but i can answer you to say that you can use the money for anything youd like however i would recommend consulting with your financial advisor on how it could be used for provide for you and your family i am not licensed to discuss such options but

2909865 it raised my eyebrows a bit when mississippi was selected
2909866 obviously there were factors other than what they were looking in the site visits the group that did the site visits were scientists and know what they were looking for i dont know what dhs was looking for
2909867 while i take the committees concerns to heart i do not concur with the low scores

2909880 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2909881 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2909882 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2909883 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2909884 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2909885 it is sooo amazing to me that i am living in your room
2909886 the muslim religion is not on trial here ladies and gentlemen
2909887 there certainly is a level of isi complicity in the militant areas in pakistan and organisations such as the taliban
2909888 i cant say to what level of leadership that goes to but there are indications of complicity on the part of isi to the extent that they are facilitating these militant groups that come out of the tribal areas in pakistan
2909889 unfortunately we see a higher number of non pashtun non afghanistan fighters this year than this time last year
2909890 they are really from a variety of ethnic groupings some are from areas in pakistan some are from places like uzbekistan or chechnya some are from europe and some are from other arab countries

2909894 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2909895 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2909896 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2909897 more than seven in ten pro choice mccain supporters have yet to learn that mccains position on abortion is directly at odds with their own
2909898 t heyll want to know this would mccain stock the supreme court with foes of roe v wade
2909899 the answer is unclear but probably no while mccain has positioned himself as pro life during this campaign his statements over the years show considerable latitude on the issue
2909900 i think it is outrageous that people give him a pass as they gave george w bush a pass
2909901 love to see a point where roe is irrelevant and could be repealed because abortion is no longer necessary but certainly in the short term or even the long term i would not support repeal of roe v wade which would then force x number of women in america to undergo illegal and dangerous operations
2909902 recognize d differing views on this question among americans in general and in our own party
2909903 i believe we are an inclusive party and we can be so without changing our principles
2909904 if you want a strongly pro life president dont support john mccain
2909905 it is difficult to argue that the courts opinion is not constitutionally suspect
2909906 he has never failed to cast his vote in favor of whatever abortion restrictions are arguably permitted under roe v wade bans against partial birth abortion abortions on military bases transporting minors across state lines to obtain abortions behind their parents backs and government funding for abortion both in the united states and abroad in addition mccain has voted to confirm every strict constructionist judge appointed by the various republican presidents who have served during his tenure
2909907 planned parenthood and naral pro choice america consistently award him ratings of absolute zero on their scorecards
2909908 it was one on which i disagreed with him from the beginning
2909909 wondered about the depth of mccains commitment to that position initially because i had the impression that it wasnt something that hed given a lot of thought to
2909910 when we really explored it it really came down for him to a sanctity of life question he did get very emotional one time we talked about it he truly believed
2909911 whether its abortion care birth control or comprehensive sex education mccain is not moderate or a maverick
2909912 we never ask and we never hear pro choice republicans question whether mccain will be with us on a vote hes always on the wrong side
2909913 ive expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn the bombing outside of south ossetia
2909914 russian aggression must not go unanswered and that its continuation would have serious consequences for its relations with the united states
2909915 today news reports indicate that russian military forces crossed an internationally recognized border into the sovereign territory of georgia russia should immediately and unconditionally cease its military operations and withdraw all forces from sovereign georgian territory what is most critical now is to avoid further confrontation between russian and georgian military forces the consequences for euro atlantic stability and security are grave tensions and hostilities between georgians and ossetians are in no way justification for russian troops crossing an internationally recognized border
2909916 i was in the right place at the right time
2909917 id suffered from bad headaches for years but just put it down to migraines
2909918 when i first came around from the anaesthetic and my family were telling me what had happened i thought they were lying
2909919 then i thought that the tumour had been cancerous and they were lying about that the staff say this was probably because of the after affects of the morphine i dont think it has still sunk in
2909920 the hospital was absolutely fantastic the nurses doctors everyone who helped me i couldnt say a bad word about even the food was good
2909921 my husband and i are hoping to do some fundraising too in the future because everyone was so brilliant
2909922 i want to thank all nurses and teams that work on the neurology ward and critical care and also nurses on gynaecology ward for their kindness to my family
2909923 also a big thank you to mr saxena for his minimal creative hairstyle
2909924 cara had a meningioma which is a type of tumour that develops from the membrane covering the brain
2909925 while these are not rare it is very unusual for her to have had such a large growth and not have a clue about it
2909926 normally patients would have symptoms like progressive weakness or numbness or they may present with fits
2909927 i have no doubt this operation saved her life and i have been very pleasantly surprised by how she has recovered so quickly from a major operation on the brain

2909933 this is going to give a huge incentive in going up further and becoming a dominant sporting power
2909934 weve won hockey golds in the past but the individual gold is going to give a huge fillip to all our sports the boys and girls will run that much faster and jump that much longer
2909935 before the race i felt as if i was going to vomit i was that nervous
2909936 but just before i went out to race i had an enormous sense of calm and i just said more than anything i want to walk away with no regrets
2909937 its my best time and an olympic gold medal thats more than i could have ever dreamed for
2909938 i was a little bit stressed before i swam i had a hard time in marshalling
2909939 my suit wouldnt zip up and i had to get in an old suit
2909940 no no definitely there has to be a very clear timeline
2909941 the talks are still ongoing theres been a great deal of progress the deal is very close it is about to be closed
2909942 our negotiators have really found compromises on all these issues
2909943 you may hear many dates but i caution you not to take any of these dates until you get the final document
2909944 these positive sampling results are the latest of several highly promising indicators of our singida gold propertys potential to host an economically significant resource base our concessions lie directly adjacent to and along strike from shanta gold limiteds singida project where initial exploration drilling has identified an indicated resource of 543 000 ounces of gold worth an estimated 500 million third party aerial magnetic surveys have highlighted possible gold anomaly hot zones and drill targets on our property and small scale operations by local artisan miners indicate ore grade gold mineralization on the surface
2909945 based on these factors vipr believes additional exploration of the singida gold propertys potential is warranted we are gearing up to move into the next phase of exploration preparing a strategy and budget for our discussions with potential investors and partners we are extremely pleased with the projects initial results and believe our singida operations will have a major impact on the companys growth

2909962 n amun islam hadhari yang diperkenalkan badawi tampaknya hanya sekadar retorika belaka sambil terus mempromosikan konsep itu dia melakukan kebijakan kebijakan politik yang sesungguhnya bertentangan dengan semangat islam hadhari misalnya dalam dua tahun terakhir pemerintahannya badawi adalah penguasa malaysia yang paling sering mengeluarkan daftar buku buku terlarang khususnya buku buku yang terkait dengan sejarah dan pemikiran islam
2909963 badawi adalah penguasa malaysia yang paling sering mengeluarkan daftar buku buku terlarang khususnya buku buku yang terkait dengan sejarah dan pemikiran islam
2909964 begitu luas dan tingginya ajaran agama islam itu sedangkan pemahaman umat islam kini masih lagi tertutup sehingga ada yang menganggap mempelajari sains pun adalah haram dengan memberikan alasan bahawa al quran diturunkan dalam bahasa arab sedangkan sains menggunakan bahasa inggeris atau bahasa asing yang lain bagi mereka hanya bahasa arab yang diperakui kesucian dan ketulenannya di sisi allah s w t
2909965 sebaiknya kita tak mengharamkan islam hadhari tetapi cukuplah cuma ia tidak perlu lagi menjadi ideologi sesebuah negeri jika ada orang perseorangan atau sesebuah entity bukan kerajaan yang mahu mengangkat islam hadhari menjadi ideology mereka silakan jangan larang

2909988 betul itu bukan kerja mudah tetapi saya yakin dato seri anwar penasihat keadilan itu mampu buat masih ramai lagi setiakawan setiakawan beliau ada dalam bn terutamanya seperti di sabah dan serawak dap juga pun saya yakin mampu main peranan di kalangan kerusi kerusi milik bukan melayu dalam bn

2909990 sebenarnya deb itu bukan undang undang ia hanyalah dasar atau polisi umno yang kemudiannya diserapkan ke dalam peraturan dan pekeliling kerajaan termasuk dalam soal pembahagian tender kontrak dan sebagainya
2909991 walau apa pun dr abdul aziz menyambung kita tidak pasti sama ada ia masih berjalan atau tidak kerana pada awalnya deb yang dimulakan pada 1970 hendak ditamatkan pada 1990 tetapi oleh kerana ia gagal maka ia pun dilanjutkan umno jelas takut dipertanggung jawabkan atas kegagalan deb itu
2909992 yang mengikat dan menjadi peraturan kita ialah perlembagaan dan ia mengikat semua orang tak kira melayu atau tidak
2909993 bagaimanapun pakar perlembagaan dari uiam itu menjelaskan ia bukanlah sampai ke tahap menggantikan
2909994 i would also like to take this opportunity to apologise for the sloppy editing in the news story of march 12 2008 which we mistakenly quoted you as commenting on the may 13 incident as well the inclusion of the fact was intended to give background on the establishment of the nep in 1971 nevertheless upon a thorough review the inclusion of that fact along with your quote may have been inappropriate
2909995 this is information that iran wants and it means its really critical to them therefore she might have agreed to pay a little higher price for the information if the israeli government would have just asked
