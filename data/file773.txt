7730015 its just that the political situation was so unstable and then the president resigned and factions had developed in the coalition government
7730016 there was an increase in taliban terrorist activity and the situation on the north west border with afghanistan was volatile so it couldnt happen
7730017 hopefully the situation will have improved in pakistan and it will be deemed safe to hold it or there is time to shift it elsewhere
7730018 the icc just ran out of time to do that on this occasion
7730019 there is only one worship war that can be properly described as such it is the war between god and satan in which being in christ or in satan is the bedrock issue our petty skirmishes about worship as ignoble silly and demeaning as they can become are nothing compared to the violence and tearing of the real and only war this war is simply not ours at our dithering local level it is the lords and if we were to better understand this one splendid fact we would be placing far less emphasis on what we do what style we do it in what we keep and what we throw out and what latest poll or societal insight we choose to use as our template

7730024 media companies fit for the modern media world need to be lean and agile

7730027 cost synergies associated with the merger of fairfax media and rural press and the acquisition of southern cross radio produced a further 53 million in savings

7730048 and in the end after all thats happened these past 19 months the barack obama i know today is the same man i fell in love with 19 years ago
7730049 hes the same man who drove me and our new baby daughter home from the hospital ten years ago this summer inching along at a snails pace peering anxiously at us in the rearview mirror feeling the whole weight of her future in his hands determined to give her everything hed struggled so hard for himself determined to give her what he never had the affirming embrace of a fathers love

7730094 all that the leader of the opposition has done is undertake the kentucky fried chicken kfc marketing overhaul of queensland politics
7730095 a couple of years ago kentucky fried chicken knew that people were no longer interested in eating fried chicken their tastes were changing and so they sat around the marketing table and said lets change our name from kentucky fried chicken to kfc and maybe no one will notice that what were selling is oily greasy chicken
7730096 the leader of the opposition has gone out there and said well no one really wants to vote for the liberal and national party any more so ive got a great idea were not going to call it the liberal national party were going to call it the lnp and no one will notice that its the same group of people with the same old ideas the same greasy good old boys
7730097 its incredibly exciting and something that i think will change the way i think
7730098 the chinese culture is changing and evolving so to be immersed in it is a rare opportunity

7730108 life is not a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in a pretty and well preserved body but rather to skid in broadside thoroughly used up totally worn out and loudly proclaiming wow what a ride
7730109 but well be looking as we always do to use the turnover figures and redeployment wherever we can to minimise the head count impact
7730110 were targeting good efficiencies but were arent doing that by quoting numbers of head count
7730111 obama begins with a broad assessment of life in america in 2008 and life is not good were a divided country were a country that is
7730112 we are extremely proud of him proud of his achievements but more proud of him as a person for the way he coped with those achievements
7730113 were very touched that people continue to remember him as they do so long after he retired from playing cricket i suppose it the level of interest does astound us it always astounded him he couldnt understand why people still remembered him so long after hed finished playing
7730114 the most distinctive thing about the collection is that the entire collection comes from the bradman family home and that is how my father wanted it to remain i played with this stuff in the backyard which people now handle with white gloves so it is very precious to our family

7730116 i didnt upset them by quietly mentioning it was where my little dog had weed

7730184 the belgian league has a lot of quality and their champions are used to getting into the group stages we had a tough match against anderlecht a few years ago so im not surprised liege caused us problems

7730258 we knew some folks would ask why we couldnt make it a move permanent so we decided to stay our clients may be homeless but this is their neighborhood their community and their neck of the woods uprooting them would be no more fair than if you did that to any other neighborhood

7730306 wanneer het echt niet uitkomt kan je het naar mijn idee beter gelijk zeggen
7730307 we dont know right now because thats what goldman is doing
7730308 capital access is more restricted now in the film business than its been in a decade
7730309 because the film business is hit driven there is enormous risk when financing films and the current credit squeeze has lessened investors appetite for risk
7730310 we feel that we closed the merrill lynch deal for ua when the market was a very tough market and we continue to have consultations with financial alternatives in the marketplace for financing an mgm slate
7730311 despite the things that weve done to shoot ourselves in the foot were still holding our share weve still got fantastic brands weve got wines that win medals and thats important to a point but it shows that theyre high quality what we have to do is transfer that into sales
7730312 akhirnya saya berinisiatif ke rumah korban usai senam ternyata saya temukan korban sudah tak bernyawa dengan kondisi berlumuran darah
7730313 ia pandai bergaul dan disenangi warga karena banyak membantu bila ada kesulitan tanpa diminta beliau selalu menolong
7730314 saya tahu kejadian ini dari kakak ipar saat perjalanan pulang kerja dari purwakarta saya tidak menduga peristiwa tragis ini harus dialami oleh orang sebaik istri saya
7730315 kami berbicara hingga setengah jam ia mengaku sedang sehat dan bahagia
7730316 pelaku mengaku sudah berada di rumah korban sejak pukul 03 00 dinihari namun batal masuk ke dalam rumah karena semua pintu terkunci namun tersangka terus menunggu di depan pintu hingga pukul 10 00 pagi
7730317 tentang motif pembunuhan sedang dalam penyilidikan kerugian lain belum dipastikan namun saat olah tkp kamar dan laci terlihat acak acakan
7730318 oh joh waarom maak jij je zo druk om je uiterlijk en afvallen je bent toch hardstikke leuk zo
7730319 je hebt zon mooie uitstraling je bent zo leuk door hoe je doet je hebt wel een lekker kontje hoor je ogen zijn mooi
7730320 they are definitely the toughest opponents weve had in a champions league qualifier i know people expect us to get through but its not as if were playing a mickey mouse team
7730321 the belgian league has a lot of quality and their champions are used to getting into the group stages we had a tough match against anderlecht a few years ago so im not surprised liege caused us problems
7730322 they caught us a bit cold in the first leg but you have to remember that they had gone something like 30 games unbeaten in their own league and they are a club with european pedigree
7730323 we didnt play well and we know well have to improve at anfield everyone knows how important it is for our season to get into the group stage
7730324 its always a funny time for us to have such a massive game before weve got going in the season some of our results have reflected that
7730325 we lost at home to ak graz in the year we won the competition and had a narrow win in the last minute against maccabi haifa two years ago so anyone thinking well win comfortably knows thats very dangerous
7730326 i believe im at the top of my game right now and like any player i want to win things
7730327 my fellow democrats my fellow americans it is so wonderful to be here
7730328 ich bin hier um meinen respekt f r zwei m nner zum ausdruck zu bringen die mein leben ver ndert haben barack obama and edward m kennedy ihre geschichten sind unterschiedlich aber sie teilen ein bekenntnis zu den zeitlosen amerikanischen idealen
7730329 if i were barack obama right now i would be hoping against hope that the celebrities would just keep quiet about me
7730330 life is a journey and love is what makes that journey worthwhile
7730331 oh its a collection of theater reviews by robert brustein
7730332 in three weeks england will have her neck wrung like a chicken
7730333 have written in areas that seem particularly disfavoured by the canadian legal establishment
7730334 we are uncertain of the extent of the legal jeopardy that apsa members might place themselves in should they make public arguments in canada or post those arguments online concerning hot button issues like homosexuality same sex marriage or the nature of the islamist threat to western civilization
7730335 there is a need to create provincial municipal and barangay task forces which will serve as front liners in their own areas once the disease enters the province
7730336 pero ella ya tiene 38 a os si quiere tener otro hijo debe pensarlo pues ya es riesgoso
7730337 no desde los 35 as que t cher si quieres tener hijos ap rate
7730338 the work begins anew the hope rises again and the dream lives on
7730339 that you work hard for what you want in life that your word is your bond and you do what you say youre going to do that you treat people with dignity and respect even if you dont know them and even if you dont agree with them
7730340 there are people who are not going to vote for him because hes black
7730341 and weve got to hope that we can educate people to put aside their racism and to put their own interests no 1
7730342 there is no doubt in anyones mind that this is barack obamas convention
7730343 feel an obligation to the people who sent them here
7730344 the democratic party strongly and unequivocally supports roe v wade and a womans right to choose a safe and legal abortion regardless of ability to pay and we oppose any and all efforts to weaken or undermine that right
7730345 really cant explain the price of gas or what has happened to the middle class
7730346 do we really want four more years of the same old tune
7730347 we are ready to compete in all 50 states in november
7730348 theres a moment that you want to enjoy your bitterness
7730349 to try to suppress the celebration that we all want to have about her achievements is what would tear this party apart
7730350 im getting a lot of calls and e mails especially from women who are quite upset that she was not vetted for vice president even though senator obama said she was on the short list
7730351 to stay wallowing in all of this is not productive
7730352 so we can talk about this forever or we can talk about how were going to take our message to the american people to women all across america to see the distinctions
7730353 to get a boob job a tummy tuck and some liposuction
7730354 no thank you im going to curves so i wont need any of that next year
7730355 dang looks like the party is just now getting started
7730356 im all about results and wish everyone the best of luck
7730357 but im really down with me winning this tournament so
7730358 and maybe ill just go study see what went wrong at wimbledon
7730359 thats the plan but i dont think either of us is aiming for 2
7730360 and i was taking the injections so i dont feel the pain when i was going on you know to play my matches otherwise i wouldnt be able to go on court and play but now its finished and now its just a matter of you know getting you know firm again getting all these muscles back and feeling like i used to feel before when i was fit and ready to play
7730361 somehow i started to go out there and started to believe im a player and i can compete with them
7730362 maybe before it was missing this and then i could not give them answers but now i go out there and for their game i can always give them my answer my game thats why i start to beat them
7730363 every day i talk with a couple ceos just encouraging them to sell assets recognize losses raise capital
7730364 i cant think of a time in history when a ceo of a financial institution has gotten in trouble or lost his job because they had too much capital
7730365 and the testament to our system is capital is available
7730366 firms that can weather it may realize that with the distressed sales prices out there today they probably would be much better off holding the securities
7730367 hes got to kick butt a little more about it
7730368 obama we think john mccain is a low life cheatin son of a gun we want you to go out tomorrow and dont even bother with fishing just spy on him and see just how he is cheating
7730369 if we didnt blog people would start to wonder about us
7730370 its a phenomenal promotion vehicle for a company or a great crisis tool or a great customer service tool
7730371 were trying to be as open and disclose as much information as we can
7730372 we gave a very loud voice to the people who said they werent happy about this decision
7730373 the blog at least helps people see how we think about it
7730374 thats the importance of public relations of advertising of everything we do
7730375 it is the virtual substitute for bill marriott visiting every hotel
7730376 second full tile make a line eyes forward hands to your side please
7730377 the reality is that everyone cant get into the school they want
7730378 i want to level the playing field and i want to do it this year

7730411 its premature to say that it was a valid threat or that these folks have the ability to carry it out
7730412 were absolutely confident there is no credible threat to the candidate the democratic national convention or the people of colorado
7730413 it could also turn out that these were nothing but a bunch of knuckleheads meth heads

7730428 hey what do you know a golden age dc run with no spanking
7730429 it is beautiful but there is a terrible curse that goes with it
7730430 i just dreamed that you gave me a pearl necklace for valentines day what do you think it means
7730431 ive always said it would be a last resort it appears that day is approaching
7730432 i was a 17 year old guy with testosterone what do you think
7730433 why not get something that would symbolize the loved ones who are no longer with us
7730434 pears began to experiment with soap purification and eventually managed to produce a gentle soap based on glycerin and other natural products
7730435 know how to kill but not have to use it
7730436 oh my god theres a deer i better shoot quick before he she is gone
7730437 i had a dream that no one would come but i was wrong said a delighted jamie bell one of the many organizers who fuelled the benefit effort
7730438 its just overwhelming said moore shaken by all the attention and support his loss has generated
7730439 we thought we had plenty and some would be saved for the build but it doesnt look that way she laughed after more than 700 sausages and hot dogs were served up before the night was over
7730440 its one of the largest if not the largest food recall in canada involving meat products
7730441 because of the wide ranging products and their level of distribution there are people fanned out across the country to ensure this is efficiently removed from market for sale
7730442 theres quite a long list of places it could be found
7730443 and theres quite a possibility that people on p e i have some of these products in their homes
7730444 we usually dont get involved but because of the extent of this recall theyre needing help
7730445 we can have this product list pulled and the product off the shelves in five minutes
7730446 we dont deal with maple leaf products at all but the inspector had to come back a second time because more items were added to the list monday
7730447 the inspector just went through my fridge and my freezer went through all my product with me and he just looked at me and said thank you very much for your cooperation you have no problems here and he just walked out the door
7730448 we dont use bologna and processed meats unless its salami or pepperoni on pizza and we didnt get any pizza in just in case
7730449 we get everything roast beef and roast pork and chicken all locally so really i have nothing to worry about
7730450 its fun so were going to put our own little spin on it
7730451 thats part of this study this report that the minister will be taking to cabinet fairly soon
7730452 weve sent a note to physicians outlining the symptoms and asking them to be aware of it
7730453 the major thing is fever which usually is described as a persistent fever there may be headache nausea vomiting and sometimes a stiff neck can develop with this bacteria
7730454 occasionally it can be up to 90 days after eating the food containing the bacteria
7730455 we respect the right of elected officials such as speaker pelosi to address matters of public policy that are before them but the interpretation of catholic faith has rightfully been entrusted to the catholic bishops given this responsibility to teach it is important to make this correction for the record
7730456 human life must be respected and protected absolutely from the moment of conception since the first century the church has affirmed the moral evil of every procured abortion this teaching has not changed and remains unchangeable direct abortion that is to say abortion willed either as an end or a means is gravely contrary to the moral law
7730457 it depends on the bishop of a certain region and fortunately for me communion has not been withheld and im a regular communicant so that would be a severe blow to me if that were the case
7730458 i wouldnt rank a team until at least midseason probably about october rankings are fun for people theyre a beauty contest i wish people that rated you high and were wrong got fired thatd be better than the coaches getting fired we dont get to say a thing about rankings all we have to do is sit and wait
7730459 we were starting a redshirt freshman quarterback colt mccoy who had never taken a snap so usually thats not a one or two ranking but
7730460 what we should do is at the end of the year coaches take a poll of everybody who screwed up the rankings and then not let them have a ranking the next year
7730461 i think thats best wed probably have as much turnover then as we do among coaches
7730462 getting on the field with our guys and learning how to react to certain situations are the things were going to have to work through
7730463 were gonna have to grow together on that as far as the other stuff shoot were just gonna play hard and were gonna expect good things to happen
7730464 were prepared to make adjustments as we go but they both know that theyre going to play
7730465 i think its a situation where we feel like weve got two starters
7730466 austens got a little more experience under his belt and only one guy can be there to take the first snap so hes going to be the guy to do that
7730467 its a completely different team each team develops its own personality its own chemistry i can tell you we have a confident football team but these are smart kids and they know we have a lot of areas we need to improve to become the kind of team we want to be
7730468 mccain stood with yankee in a downtown phoenix high school that his wife cindy mccain had attended as the democratic party opened the first day of its national convention daddy yankee will be flying on the straight talk air today to california
7730469 there is a possibility that this government document isnt real but what are the possibilities of getting a forged document on a government web site
7730470 i think this is a fantastic demonstration of where our future is headed electronic documents are totally different from paper documents it used to be that changing documents could be traced now weve got this brand new world where e documents are being accepted and used as common currency but theyre not verifiable theres no standard of proof
7730471 we only know the engine had problems and they did not make a successful landing
7730472 theres not a thing he can do at this point were working with the u s embassy to have all of the arrangements made for the repatriation of those who are deceased and medical flights for those living
7730473 there were farmers in the field where they crashed they pulled my husband out of the plane 30 seconds before the plane exploded
7730474 he has constant pain he says he can deal with hes just grateful to be alive
7730475 he did everything he was a carpenter a multipurpose utility player he was a very popular employee forever upbeat
7730476 he was very giving i think he was in africa last year
7730477 i am neither geek nor nerd i am not a hacker a phreaker a programmer or any variety of technoid dweeb
7730478 cia used aq khan network to sabotage irans nuclear program
7730479 3 swiss engineers are tied to cia efforts to take down global black market
7730480 israel must on no account attack iran speak of attacking iran or even think about it israel must defend itself only if attacked by iran but attacking iran on our own initiative is a megalomaniacal and reckless idea
7730481 it will have a negative effect on public opinion in the arab world
7730482 it is not possible for any agreement to conclude unless it is on the basis of full sovereignty and the national interest and that no foreign soldiers remain in iraqi soil after a defined time ceiling
7730483 important part of what im about what makes me tick
7730484 very supportive as soon as he saw what was happening he and i we connect on many levels i mean he knew immediately that i would want to go ive been to georgia with him i know the country
7730485 shes on the phone with the world food programme hes on the phone with saakashvili
7730486 it was a great picture of what theyll be like in the white house
7730487 theres a very serious land mine issue now because there are land mines being laid as we speak
7730488 theres a whole bunch of things going on right now and as we begin to move refugees from point a to point b or try to feed refugees who are stuck in pockets around the country were running into the issue of the blowing up of humanitarian vehicles that are trying to get to the refugees so its a whole morass of problems now
7730489 we went basically as an emergency team not knowing what wed be getting into
7730490 we discovered as did the kuwaitis that the iraqis had planted land mines in the playgrounds so we hadnt been there 12 hours and the first case we get is a young child who had gone outside to play on the teeter totter and stepped on a land mine that was my first experience with land mines
7730491 when people begin to run they run for places that they know are safe schools churches community centers and those are the first things that are mined
7730492 logo ap s a derrota para a desportiva o china deu entrevista a uma r dio dizendo que estaria colocando o cargo disposi o aceitei e j contratei o marcos nunes para o lugar
7730493 pintou essa oportunidade e eu a agarrei o vila um time de ponta do futebol capixaba e possui um elenco mais experiente com mais chances de classifica o
7730494 conhe o alguns jogadores do vila e sei que a equipe tem potencial mas preciso fazer uma avalia o do grupo para ver se h necessidade de contrata es s sei que precisamos de trabalhar muito
7730495 you are probably right that you dont hear this idea from many republicans but that is because too many of our politicians today lack vision
7730496 was consistent with that of a potential offspring of aafia siddiqui
7730497 he is an orphan and that his parents were killed in an earthquake in pakistan around october 2005
7730498 the child is an american citizen he is not a pakistani citizen
7730499 there have been leica cameras since 1925 when the leica i was introduced at a trade fair in leipzig from then on as the camera has evolved over eight decades generations of users have turned to it in their hour of need or their millisecond of inspiration
7730500 the ultimate goal is to select in each african country a number of skilful young men and women with the help of a local coordinator and to equip these people with high technology mobile phones with a small foldable keyboard where a special piece of software is installed to permit direct uploads of photos texts and videos to the skoeps server from where they are transferred to the africa interactive website for publication
7730501 i come here as a daughter raised on the south side of chicago by a father who was a blue collar city worker and a mother who stayed at home with my brother and me my mothers love has always been a sustaining force for our family and one of my greatest joys is seeing her integrity her compassion and her intelligence reflected in my own daughters
7730502 although he was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in his early thirties he was our provider our champion our hero
7730503 as he got sicker it got harder for him to walk it took him longer to get dressed in the morning but if he was in pain he never let on he never stopped smiling and laughing even while struggling to button his shirt even while using two canes to get himself across the room to give my mom a kiss he just woke up a little earlier and worked a little harder
7730504 i stand here today at the crosscurrents of that history knowing that my piece of the american dream is a blessing hard won by those who came before me
7730505 people like hillary clinton who put those 18 million cracks in the glass ceiling so that our daughters and sons can dream a little bigger and aim a little higher
7730506 people like joe biden whos never forgotten where he came from and never stopped fighting for folks who work long hours and face long odds and need someone on their side again
7730507 for the first time in my adult lifetime im really proud of my country
7730508 i come here as a wife who loves my husband and believes he will be an extraordinary president
7730509 in the end after all thats happened these past 19 months the barack obama i know today is the same man i fell in love with 19 years ago
7730510 hes the same man who drove me and our new baby daughter home from the hospital ten years ago this summer inching along at a snails pace peering anxiously at us in the rear view mirror feeling the whole weight of her future in his hands determined to give her everything hed struggled so hard for himself determined to give her what he never had the affirming embrace of a fathers love
7730511 nothing nothing is going to keep me away from this special gathering tonight
7730512 and this november the torch will be passed again to a new generation of americans so with barack obama and for you our country will be committed to his cause the work begins anew the hope rises again the dream lives on
7730513 leaders like them come along rarely but once or twice in a lifetime they come along just when we need them the most this is one of those moments
7730514 i have never had someone inspire me the way people tell me my father inspired them but i do now barack obama
7730515 republicans say john mccain has experience we say john mccain has the experience of being wrong
7730516 all democrats salute senator hillary clinton for her excellent campaign our party and our country are strengthened by her candidacy
7730517 im sure that doctor king is looking down on us here in denver noting that this is the first political convention in history to take place within sight of a mountaintop
7730518 freedom in american never rung on a higher mountaintop than today
7730519 there is no doubt in anyones mind that this is barack obamas convention as it should be and there is no doubt that what we are doing is tying to bring everybody together
7730520 haters thats what yall are haters youre not a democrat youre not a democrat
7730521 dont know her and the other are people who want to hang on to things like that to bring her down
7730522 so tonight in honor of my fathers memory and my daughters future out of gratitude to those whose triumphs we mark this week and those whose everyday sacrifices have brought us to this moment let us devote ourselves to finishing their work let us work together to fulfill their hopes and lets stand together to elect barack obama president of the united states of america
7730523 unfair but if anyone can handle it michelle obama can i think theyll find they need to find someone else to pick on she wont be bullied
7730524 i thought it was wonderful because it was so clearly genuine an american story that we all recognize
7730525 we have all talked about the things that make us uniquely american belief in country creating a better life for our children and the constant work to make that happen for our families
7730526 we received credible information that drug cartels in mexico have given permission to hit targets on the u s side of the border
7730527 cbp is on heightened alert ever since we became aware of the threats in mexico
7730528 theres a new kind of mrsa out there which is a community acquired mrsa we always thought in the past that mrsa was a hospital acquired organism theres been a major jump in the community and interestingly enough theres now a jump from the community back into the hospital so were seeing two separate kinds of mrsa one in and one out of the hospital so the lines between the two are blurring
7730529 its hard to get that concept of 15 seconds to kids but if you have them hum or sing the abc song completion of the abc song takes about 15 second
7730530 the san francisco rams football team successfully transmitted mrsa through the entire nfl the offensive line was truly offensive and you would be amazed at the lack of hygiene even at that level
7730531 my fellow americans it is so wonderful to be here
7730532 nothing nothing is going to keep me away from this special gathering tonight
7730533 i have come here tonight to stand with you to change america to restore its future to rise to our best ideals and to elect barack obama president of the united states
7730534 i will be there next january on the floor of the u s senate when we begin
7730535 there is a new wave of change all around us and if we set our compass through we will reach our destination
7730536 this november the torch will be passed again to a new generation of americans our country will be committed to his cause the work begins anew the hope lives on and the dream lives on
7730537 reminds us as a party and as americans what our core values are
7730538 it was thrilling not a dry eye in the house
7730539 for the younger generation it drew a parallel between the kennedy family and the obama campaign
7730540 have changed my life and the life of this country
7730541 commitment to the timeless american ideals of justice and fairness service and sacrifice faith and family
7730542 moral obligation to do everything possible to make this world a better place
7730543 as he built up to a climax the crowd roared and took him and accepted him with all its heart
7730544 people were shouting and hollering that one will always stick out for me
7730545 he is one of the veterans of the civil rights movement and the progressive era and obama is the rookie who is picking it up and carrying it into the 21st century there is so much history in this
7730546 he is the lion of the senate and the leader of the partys progressive forces
7730547 a shock and a shudder ran through the party when he was first hospitalized with the brain tumor but this video appearance shows that hes not going away
7730548 he speaks clearly and powerfully hes very natural on the platform using many poetic allusions
7730549 there is a magic about ted partly because of our devotion to jack but he has a charm of his own
7730550 that electrifying speech worried the carter people even though the votes were already counted in carters favor
7730551 it showed how much passion kennedy could arouse that cemented his reputation in the party
7730552 hes always inspirational but it will remind people that he is ill
7730553 teddy has been our conscience and its almost like a family where one sibling has been taking care of an aging parent and now that sibling will not be around what do we do now hes virtually impossible to replace whos there for the poor the sick
7730554 and one will expect that when a kennedy speaks the world is going to listen
7730555 these intense rains may produce life threatening flash floods and mudslides
7730556 most other olympics acquired their label during or after the games usually after emotions had coalesced or a big news event pushed other stories off the front page but the combination of fascination with china and increasingly intense churn of media attention has changed that
7730557 i was fishing here and there was a big shark coming through she was the first one to spot she told me oh whats that over there she thought it was a dolphin or something so i look and i said oh thats a shark the tail was about this big
7730558 it was right over there in the middle it was right over there when i saw the tail and then the other people who were fishing saw it and thought it was not a real one but it was a shark

7730560 the short turnaround times for planes and other forms of transport means they are sometimes not inspected as thoroughly as they used to be what should happen is a good vacuum around the back of seats and in the creases of seats any small gap is ideal for a bedbug which can go for quite some time without a meal
7730561 delays at airports dont help as people sit in airport terminals take things out of their bags and the bedbug jumps out and goes in search of another source of blood
7730562 the number one reason for the spread of bedbugs is the lack of public awareness people simply do not know how to detect them in the way they would have done in the 1950s and 1960s
7730563 they are a problem on buses trains and subway systems and on cruise ships too any form of transport where there is a high turnover really recently on an overground train in south london i pulled at the parting of the upholstery and found at least four months of dirt and debris
7730564 success requires no explanations and failure permits no alibis therefore dont quit before you have reached a goal as you are not a quitter a quitter never wins and a winner never quits
7730565 everyones been nice and taking their time and giving me autographs
7730566 tonights the only night we get to come because were heading back to school so were excited
7730567 at least we got a chance to see it before we go back
7730568 we get to see a whole bunch of tennis starts at once and we are really into tennis
7730569 we play a lot of tennis and so we want to see a lot of tennis
7730570 weve got over 700 00 people coming out to the tournament over 14 days
7730571 there are a couple of mets conflict dates so parking is always an issue we want to push mass transportation for everybody coming out here so there are a lot of variables involved and were trying to make sure that this is the most successful u s open weve ever had
7730572 im here to see nadal win the u s open
7730573 nobody will agree with me but i think federer is going to win

7730576 barack e eu fomos criados com muitos valores em comum como trabalhar duro pelo que se quer para a vida fazer de sua palavra um compromisso e cumprir o que se diz e tratar as pessoas com dignidade e respeito mesmo que n o as conhe a e inclusive se n o concordar com elas
7730577 estou aqui como uma filha criada na zona sul de chicago por um pai que era um oper rio e uma m e que ficava em casa com meu irm o e eu
7730578 vamos construir o mundo que deveria existir s na am rica um garoto que nasceu no hava e a menina criada em um sub rbio de chicago podem chegar casa branca por isso que amo este pa s

7730580 acho bom mesmo a igreja ficar fora da pol tica leiam bem a igreja e n o seus membros a cidadania direito e dever de todos
7730581 at hoje depois de 35 anos de convers o estou para ver um crist o que tenha entrado na pol tica e que n o tenha sofrido uma metamorfose ou melhor uma metan ia mudan a de mentalidade para pior
7730582 i brought in some extra defense to stop their attack
7730583 i thought they played hard for the first 40 minutes
7730584 we got the first two goals which was very important for our morale our triangle passing was much better and our defense is working well with jolly at sweeper
7730585 i am very relieved and its good to get it against a team that beat us
7730586 i expect at least a goal out of them each game
7730587 any way we can get goals i am willing to help
7730588 two assists are better than goals to me because they are the ones that make it happen
7730589 i think we did really good in the first half offensively
7730590 i think we controlled the field really well in the second half
7730591 next game our mentally needs to be just come out and play as hard as we did at the beginning of this game
7730592 as a starter he was someone that we were truly counting on some of those younger guys who are very talented are going to have to step up
7730593 i dont know what to expect from a lot of the younger players which makes me a little nervous and creates a lot of unknowns
7730594 we dont know if when they walk into a stadium of 70 000 people against a top 20 program with the caliber of athletes they have will they rise their game to a new level or will their eyeballs take up their entire facemask when they run out on the field
7730595 we have a chance to play on of the better teams in the country traditionally year in and year out with what theyve done
7730596 i know our players are excited and i think it will be a great measuring stick for where we are as a program and the progress that weve made in the last year
7730597 what concerned me the most was when bud foster made the comment that he thinks the defensive football team will be better than they were last year
7730598 he said he thinks they are quicker more athletic and we understand the challenge we have ahead
7730599 its speed and spectacle and raw power and family and the flag its hard to explain what produces the rush but its deep inside me when im at the track its about the people and the cars and the competitive spirit of america
7730600 i have a lot of friends in major league baseball
7730601 this time around we knew they were angry we beat them at their place
7730602 i thought it was going in but i dont know what happened to me
7730603 i got nervous i shot too hard and high and i missed it
7730604 i think that second one wouldve put them out its just a matter of inches i guess
7730605 we just took some chances to get that goal in
7730606 they countered quick and it cost us that third goal
7730607 i give them a lot of credit they really did come out just as expected
7730608 jordan can play forward midfield or defense and i had to adjust him three different times today
7730609 i took a look at the roster today if i could have an eight man senior squad with four or five juniors right behind them in a couple years i could be looking at building on something with that
7730610 for our young guys to step up to the varsity level and play like this i think thats saying a lot
7730611 estou aqui como uma esposa que ama o marido e acredita que ele ser um presidente extraordin rio
7730612 barack e eu crescemos com muitos dos mesmos valores que uma pessoa trabalha duro pelo que quer na vida que a palavra dessa pessoa lei e que far o que disser que faz

7730618 we both had done the math and kelly added it all up and knew she had to let me go i added it up and knew that i had lost her cause i was never gonna get off that island i was gonna die there totally alone i was gonna get sick or get injured or something the only choice i had the only thing i could control was when and how and where that was going to happen so i made a rope and i went up to the summit to hang myself i had to test it you know of course you know me and the weight of the log snapped the limb of the tree so i couldnt even kill myself the way i wanted to i had power over nothing thats when this feeling came over me like a warm blanket i knew somehow that i had to stay alive somehow i had to keep breathing even though there was no reason to hope and all my logic said that i would never see this place again so thats what i did i stayed alive i kept breathing and one day that logic was proven all wrong because the tide came in and gave me a sail and now here i am im back in memphis talking to you i have ice in my glass and ive lost her all over again im so sad that i dont have kelly but im so grateful that she was with me on that island and i know what i have to do now i gotta keep breathing because tomorrow the sun will rise who knows what the tide could bring

7730631 i hope i see some barack obama over the next four days
7730632 who names their kid barack obama so i figured this kid has to be weird
7730633 given all the tensions in black america over families and to see that positive image there for everybody to see man thats just awesome
7730634 mitt romney has no elvis and john mccain needs a little elvis on his ticket

7730644 when it comes to sports funding its not either or either community sport or elite sport well be doing both
7730645 the kids who are engaging in community sport a lot of them want to have the hope in their eyes that they can rise to elite representational levels as well
7730646 the government is funding a large slab of investment in community level sport school sports indigenous sports but also were not going to be back tracking when it comes to funding for olympic level sports either
7730647 we want to have another look at it because its a positive constructive idea lets see if it works
7730648 im just looking forward to seeing my mum and having a holiday

7730650 ahha now i can crawl up in the attic and root around in the dark and try to find 0 3 girl box to shove these in
7730651 this clearly shows the utter ignorance of administrator tomawis on the basic procedures and rules governing the authority the motive behind this transfer is to dislocate personnel of the authority who have settled in davao and force them to resign so he can appoint his all relatives all maranao employees who will all be subservient to his malevolent schemes
7730652 the thing is we have to get cooperation from both sides but if one party is not making the effort we will have to end the mission malaysia is actually prepared to continue with whatever humanitarian effort whether through negotiation or cooperation but if the situation remains negative and the government there feels it needs to review it and then we shall give them room to do so
7730653 there is apprehension of course and with the impending pull out of the imt we dont know what will happen we really cannot predict the future of the peace talks but we have been so many times urging the philippine government to resume the stalled peace talks and nothing has come up
7730654 since the imt arrived armed conflict between government and rebel forces significantly decreased in mindanao
7730655 this ugly turn of event in the peace process is taxing the patience of the milf and the bangsamoro people who may be compelled to resort to other means pacific or otherwise of resolving the mindanao conflict when they are pushed to the wall and become hopeless in the present peace process
7730656 this stance of the grp peace panel has virtually jeopardized the integrity of the peace process and to continue with the talks would virtually turn it into a circus
7730657 we are happy that people are active in caring for their environment and we will sustain this effort to ensure sulu remains a beautiful place in this part of the country
7730658 along this we are all reminded of our responsibilities which extend beyond our own backyards this clean up campaign demonstrates oneness among stakeholders in caring for the waters not just in sulu but in fact everywhere in the world
7730659 every day should be coastal clean up and cleaning the coast through picking up garbage is the least that we can do by giving mother earth a totally healthy environment we are also acting upon our moral duty for the people we both serve and hold dear
7730660 protecting the environment is important and crucial towards the progress of the nation if environment is not protected concerns in security may arise
7730661 the people are great and friendly and the place is magnificent
7730662 we have very beautiful places in sulu and we are working hard to promote these places
7730663 well if there is a block like this in jacksonville then there must be one in every american city
7730664 well if there is a block like this in jacksonville then there must be one in every american city
7730665 as a former resident of ladbroke grove i have watched the notting hill carnival go from strength to strength each year to become an internationally acclaimed event nothing beats the sounds of the steel pans the aroma of delicious caribbean food and the dazzling colours of the costume parade
7730666 the number of arrests is up on last year but that is predominantly because of proactive policing
7730667 to reach the very top of any sport requires years of hard work focus and complete dedication all traits which rebecca has in abundance
7730668 migrant workers can bring enormous benefits to local businesses and areas however many of these contributions such as new ideas and ways of working and an entrepreneurial spirit may have been neglected in the past
7730669 to get the most out of migration local communities alongside local leaders businesses universities and central government need to recognise the variety of benefits that migrants can bring and plan accordingly
7730670 this pressure initially confined mainly to consumer services such as hospitality and travel has now spread to the professional and business services sector covering areas such as marketing and legal services
7730671 this reflects much tougher trading conditions for business and professional firms after a period when business trends had been holding up in the face of the slowing economy
7730672 i wish i could have my moms camelot i guess not innertubes are too quick but i still like zombies i have that

7730674 several soldiers who deserted after a tour of duty in iraq have stated that cruelty towards iraqi citizens was a factor in their desertions one of them lance corporal ivan brobeck witnessed the abuse of iraqi detainees and the killing of iraqi civilians another sgt ricky clousing had similar experiences his allegations of systematic abuse of iraqi detainees are now being investigated by the military
7730675 during the trial long 25 of boise idaho said he fled when his unit was deployed to iraq because he felt it was an illegal war according to cbc prosecutors on the other hand said he abandoned his duty and his country
7730676 showed a six minute video of long sporting dreadlocks and a beard telling a canadian news reporter i think i was lied to by my president
7730677 i think they want to prosecute him for free speech issues without actually charging him
7730678 was against the law arguing that justified longs fleeing to canada the lone character witness called to speak for long was peter haney with the pikes peak justice and peace commission he had met the soldier three times while long was awaiting trial in the el paso county colo lockup
7730679 ive observed mr long in situations that would be trying to just about anyone he seemed to me to be extremely poised and lucid
7730680 i feel the war on terror is a war on peace
7730681 the morality of what he did should lessen the punishment
7730682 i felt he doesnt deserve a day in prison any jail time is unjust
7730683 about two dozen anti war supporters gathered around the courthouse at fort carson in colorado springs colo yesterday afternoon as a military judge handed down longs sentence
7730684 the applicant submits that if returned to the united states he will be court martialed for desertion and he will be incarcerated in a military prison where like stephen funk camilo mejia and kevin benderman he will suffer persecution and cruel and inhumane treatment
7730685 i believe the evidence here shows that if returned to the us the applicant will suffer the harm he has described
7730686 to support jeremy call or email hon diane finley minister of citizenship and immigration and ask her to intervene in this case phone 613 996 4974 email
7730687 with the economic situation worsening and the property market still suffering we are calling on the government to take urgent action on hips we have long seen hips as not fit for purpose and as the wrong answer to simplifying the house buying process quite simply the government tried to force square pegs into round holes and the slower property market is making this situation worse
7730688 hips are already bringing benefits to consumers by providing important information to help families cut their fuel bills and carbon emissions and have reduced the price of property searches by increasing transparency in the home buying and selling process
7730689 the research is clear if developed countries spent the same amount of money on preventing deforestation and the destruction of peatlands as they do on misguided biofuel subsidies 15 billion us dollars this would halve the total costs of tackling climate change
7730690 this report is timely and welcome it is becoming increasingly clear that unless we find a practical solution to the problems caused by deforestation the battle against climate change is in danger of being lost
7730691 van alle films die ik ooit gemaakt heb is deze film degene die mensen het meest erover aan het praten zet voor elke persoon die earthlings ziet vertellen ze het tegen drie anderen
7730692 we want independence we want our ancestral land back from the infidels
7730693 people here are just expressing their sentiments it is their freedom to express what they believe is rightfully theirs as long as they dont break any law it is fine and police are watching them
7730694 my hope is that the characters in my novels will live real lives beyond the walls of traditional church and allow my fiction to give voice to truth
7730695 id like to use my background as a novelist to help kids get excited about reading
7730696 once i found that talking to children about writing could open doors for them ive been committed to doing that and i will continue to do so kids who can read and write well when they get out of school have a lot better chance of reaching their dreams than kids who still struggle with it
7730697 i continue to spend a certain part of my year speaking to kids and writing books that grab reluctant readers
7730698 from what ive seen there arent a lot of books out there designed for 85 percent of the kids who are not avid readers most books are written for the 15 percent who love to read i have a real concern about that so i will keep writing one novel a year that takes six to seven months and spend the rest of the year writing for reluctant readers and visiting schools
7730699 how do you think i feel sitting beside a dog that has sold more books than i have
7730700 c s lewis is definitely one of the writers i admire most
7730701 he wrote as well as possible knowing that the truth would speak for itself
7730702 theres no christian way to write just as there is no christian way to boil an egg writers whether they are christian or agnostic have to follow good rules of writing and he did and because of that the truth spoke for itself
7730703 if we could prevent these infections in the first place or detect them sooner we might one day be able to prevent some of these premature births
7730704 given such a strong decline on wall street you are going to get declines in our market mr heffernan said
7730705 we will probably finish in the red today maybe something over 1 to 1 5 per cent
7730706 anz have taken steps to clear out people who were in charge of some of the key areas in the last few year mr heffernan said
7730707 maybe that is causing a positive view on anz as they have been cut back substantially in the last month or so
7730708 all that the leader of the opposition has done is undertake the kentucky fried chicken kfc marketing overhaul of queensland politics
7730709 a couple of years ago kentucky fried chicken knew that people were no longer interested in eating fried chicken their tastes were changing and so they sat around the marketing table and said lets change our name from kentucky fried chicken to kfc and maybe no one will notice that what were selling is oily greasy chicken
7730710 the leader of the opposition has gone out there and said well no one really wants to vote for the liberal and national party any more so ive got a great idea were not going to call it the liberal national party were going to call it the lnp and no one will notice that its the same group of people with the same old ideas the same greasy good old boys
7730711 my fellow democrats my fellow americans it is so wonderful to be here and nothing nothing is going to keep me away from this special gathering tonight he told more than 4000 cheering delegates

7730723 tyler i want you to go onto youtube and do a search for cher half breed you will not regret it
7730724 ja iets met er rijden geen treinen naar eindhoven zegt de conducteur net
7730725 wegens een computersto ring in de regio denbosch rijden er geen treinen tussen nijmegen en denbosch deze trein zal stoppen in zaltb ommel en daarna te rug gaan naar utrecht vanwege de computersto ring
7730726 federal law enforcement is working hand in glove with the aurora police department because this matter is currently under investigation there is little we can say right now
7730727 we can say this were absolutely confident there is no credible threat to the candidate the democratic national convention or the people of colorado
7730728 the person they wanted to arrest appeared to have items that could injure another person
7730729 for example dispensaries that merely require patients to complete a form summarily designating the business owner as their primary caregiver and then offering marijuana in exchange for cash donations are likely unlawful
7730730 we think the vast majority of dispensaries in california will be in compliance
7730731 we estimate that about 550 staff across australia and new zealand will lose their jobs
7730732 about a third will be editorial and about two thirds will be other parts of the company not specified
7730733 its one of the most significant job losses in australia this year and its obviously going to have a serious impact on the ongoing quality of the companys papers magazines and websites in australia and new zealand
7730734 we can meet these challenges with barack obama yes we can and finally yes we will barack obama will close the book on the old politics of race and gender and group against group and straight against gay
7730735 i understand that if mining were to go ahead it could be good for employment in the area along with the extra infrastructure that may come with it
7730736 however i want to keep the rural lifestyle but i know that thats getting very difficult to maintain
7730737 very good to deal with but well cross the next bridge when and if we come to it
7730738 everyone knows that theres gold there but no one knows the quantity
7730739 well wait and see what they find but im not worried about it at all
7730740 we already have everything we need in the village and were very happy with it just the way it is now
7730741 we have exhibitors from the sustainable building industry energy reduction equipment supply companies tank suppliers and environmental groups
7730742 its certainly the first of its kind that i have heard of in this area and from my perspective its always better to talk directly to people who are interested in making changes face to face people contemplating going down the green road like to put a lot of planning into it and i see this expo as being able to help with providing that info
7730743 people have tried to punish councils in elections but i really dont think the types of swings you see against a sitting government state or federal is replicated at a local government level
7730744 orange is peculiar compared to other councils because you are a truly cosmopolitan city in a regional area so politics are always changing and evolving i think the big issue now of course is that under cr davis the community perception is that orange is pro development but that is no more the case now than it has been with previous councils
7730745 cr ryan did receive strong backing in 2004 from swimming and sporting voters and i think williamson is in a pretty good position to pick up that support now she is no longer standing
7730746 i can honestly say i dont know where those numbers come from
7730747 the figures are certainly not coming from within our organisation
7730748 i havent heard any exact numbers but i was speaking to a senior officer in orange last week who said they were tripping over each other to get out the door with their redundancies
7730749 i would suspect that that figure is very close to the mark which is very disappointing
7730750 the drought is not over and even if it was over tomorrow the farmers need the dpi post drought
7730751 we were approached by representatives of the festival of sporting cars who were giving out full colour booklets to attract car clubs to bathurst at easter for at least the next five years
7730752 they said bathurst city council wanted to make the festival the biggest in australia and would leave no stone unturned to do it
7730753 mudgee regional promotions was another organisation chasing the clubs and had an exhibit there of local produce to promote its wings wheels and wine show in april
7730754 we felt a little left out and wondering why we have been putting so much money and effort into promoting orange without any back up promotional assistance from orange council or anyone else
7730755 i think orange has given up tourism promotion other than pushing food and wine
7730756 it all seemed a bit like a game something like that
7730757 it should come as no surprise that a large majority of americans perceive senator obama as receiving more favorable media treatment compared to senator mccain obama is a fresh young and charismatic political figure any politician who is routinely compared to john f kennedy and bobby kennedy as obama has been will surely cultivate support among journalists this will change however once the nominating conventions are over and the general election campaign begins the euphoria will subside and we are likely to see more balanced coverage
7730758 when just 6 3 of those surveyed were unsure about the balance of media coverage for the candidates its a good indication it is obvious to americans but maybe not to the national media
7730759 more than two fifths 44 8 told our researchers that they would be very or somewhat likely to support a strong third party candidate if one emerged this has to be unsettling to both candidates
7730760 with respect to the poll concerning support for third parties it is not at all unusual to find a substantial portion of the electorate indicating displeasure with the nominees of the two major parties and a willingness to vote for a third party candidate this is a fairly typical finding
7730761 there is an agreement actually reached reached between the two parties on a fixed date which is the end of 2011 to end any foreign presence on iraqi soil
7730762 yes there is major progress on the issue of the negotiations on the security deal
7730763 hoor je dat nou die meneer weet niet goed hoe hij dat kindje moet aankleden en nu huilt ie
7730764 hey mensen hij is gewoon moe hoor ik red me echt wel

7730770 de trein naar utrecht komt over 5 minuten binnen op spoor weet ik veul

7730775 ill go to another country go to another shore find another city better than this one whatever i try to do is fated to turn out wrong and my heart lies buried as though it were something dead how long can i let my mind moulder in this place wherever i turn wherever i happen to look i see the black ruins of my life here where ive spent so many years wasted them destroyed them totally

7730786 vertel me wat je eraan gaat doen en wanneer ik weer aan het werk kan
7730787 je zegt nu wel dat je niet komt volgend jaar maar je bent er gewoon weer
7730788 je zegt nu wel dat je niet komt maar je bent er gewoon volgend jaar weer
7730789 ow en hij heeft dat weer niet tegen mij gezegd he bouke ik zorg wel dat ie wakker wordt
7730790 bert het is pas 10 minuten over de tijd dat afgesproken is hij komt echt wel
7730791 geniet nu van je sexappeal want als je ouder wordt wil niemand je meer
7730792 je schrijft veel te leuk voor een hyves maar nou eens een echte weblog
7730793 ow dus jij bent meer een doener dan een lezer ja dat heb je wel eens he dus jij hebt niets met kranten nou ik lees graag de nrc nou ben ik pas overgestapt op de volkskrant omdat ik graag in de ochtend een krant wil hebben maar die bevalt me toch niet zo hoor nrc vind ik toch veel prettiger lezen nou is dat proefabonnement over een week weer afgelopen dus dan stap ik waarschijnlijk toch wel weer over op het nrc handelsblad ik vind dat toch een stuk prettiger lezen
7730794 kom ik bak zelf even brood kun je zien hoe ik brood bak
7730795 voor de 3e keer jaaaaaaaa godverdomme luister dan eens naar me en bemoei je niet met mijn werk
7730796 i have no doubt that a newspaper well done is the ultimate browser because you can find in 30 minutes what it would take you three or four hours to find on the internet
7730797 there are worse places to be than cannes in june
7730798 uncharted territory and you make up the rules as you go
7730799 leuk dat de black eyed peas samenwerken met doritos maar het gevolg is dat ze n de band n de zoutjes niet leuk meer vinden
7730800 it has a lot more to do with the background screening and the individual personal chemistry and dynamics thats whats really the driving force
7730801 its about picking someone who you can have complete confidence in when they walk out into that press conference and when they stand there and make their speech or whatever it is that they will comport themselves in such a way that there will be no questions about their capacity to serve not only as vice president but ultimately as a president
7730802 having known every governor since albertis harrison 1962 1966 and having studied the records of the dozen most recent governors i would characterize kaines term to this point as belonging to the bottom quartile
7730803 the political argument for clark is simple he is a great surrogate for democrats with experience in 2004 and 2006 on the campaign trail and a genuine national base of supporters
7730804 you know thats probably the only suit he owns ha ha ha
7730805 i cant remember when somewhere around 70 miles per hour was the average speed of traffic on 95
7730806 there are certainly many drivers out there who have taken some steps to reduce the amount of gas they are burning that is one of the few good sides to very high gas prices that if people drive less were going to save lives
7730807 on the surface it appears clearly an ethics law has not been adhered to
7730808 regardless of what the federal government does this will be an issue taken up by the joint committee on legislative ethics
7730809 until hes charged he continues to be a trusted member of the maryland senate
7730810 im quite confident that before he would allow people to think less of the maryland senate he would take whatever measures are appropriate without me asking him to
7730811 second full tile make a line eyes forward hands to your side please
7730812 whether we supported hillary or not we are one party
7730813 i find it perplexing that they make us feel like outliers or rogues because at the convention we plan to vote for the candidate we were elected to vote for
7730814 if he said clinton was on the shortlist and did not vet her at all what does that say about the veracity of his words my intent was to come to denver with an open mind how all of us would be treated is a measure of how inclusive obamas campaign and presidency would be his campaign is all about post partisan washington but if he cant even do it with his own party how can he do it as president
7730815 there are still some people around the country who are disappointed with obama but most everyone i talk to will come together
7730816 when it comes to supporting the next president in the fall i have no doubt they will do the right thing
7730817 i was a little apprehensive at first but everyone has the same goal defeat the republicans
7730818 i immediately talked to elijah cummings and the governor and said im on board
7730819 im trying to make sure we talk to clinton voters and listen to the issues that matter to them and we want to let them know that the same issues womens issues health care the economy that made them vote for hillary are the same issues barack obama will be strong on
7730820 its important that obama show respect not just for the candidate but for those who voted for the candidate
7730821 thats the measure i hope of the kind of congressman ill be
7730822 the reality is that everyone cant get into the school they want
7730823 i want to level the playing field and i want to do it this year
7730824 these areas are host to some of the worlds most bio diverse coral reefs and habitat and some of the most interesting and compelling geological formations in all of our oceans
7730825 the trip gives us an opportunity to move forward both here in the u s government and also with our counterparts in europe who want to support georgias economic and military reconstruction
7730826 developments lately in georgia have increased the importance of this visit
7730827 to meet its commitments and not recognize these separatist regions
7730828 cheney certainly has had a tougher view on russia than some others in the administration
7730829 would have serious consequences for its relations with the united states as well as the broader international community
7730830 russias reputation has suffered since it took these disproportionate military steps in georgia
7730831 he says it is a shame for him to look into peoples eyes
7730832 he is ashamed that his army has turned into this group of bandits
7730833 we all love georgia and we all feel nervous about this situation
7730834 in this mutual fighting and these mutual victims we feel like we are losing something and of course we feel sad about that
7730835 russia often says they must defend their citizens in georgia
7730836 welk woord zoek ik welk woord past op de stippen

7730840 ga nou maar liedjes zingen anders komt hij niet hoor
7730841 it looks to me that it would be governor minner unless we go into the january 20 scenario
7730842 if the loser is carney its very easy to see governor minner who has endorsed him as her successor appointing him if he would like that office its a little harder to see if the loser is jack markell
7730843 all that really matters is the power of the story
7730844 storytelling is an old art form its like telling jokes some people can tell jokes other cant
7730845 still nostalgic over the turbot at the colombe dor 12 hours later
7730846 drie jaar geleden waren we hier niet twee jaar geleden met twee verleden jaar met vier dit jaar met acht
7730847 verleden jaar waren we op een terras aan het lachen dat we volgend jaar op het podium wilden staan
7730848 he would probably not last long a black man in the position of president they would kill him
7730849 its premature to say that it was a valid threat or that these folks have the ability to carry it out
7730850 to shoot obama from a high vantage point using a rifle sighted at 750 yards
7730851 he has all the markings and things to indicate hes a white supremacist
7730852 is something thats on michelles mind and the minds of many of my friends
7730853 in the run up to these games it wasnt clear whether broad attention was going to be captured and obviously it wasnt clear whether people were going to come away pleased with the outcomes
7730854 as it turned out the general sentiment is that the games were a success canadas athletes performed admirably and the coverage provided by the cbc was well regarded too
7730855 hoe is het mogelijk dat d t de shortlist heeft gehaald dan was ons werk toch minstens even goed

7730894 folk music is by definition irish pop music specifically irish pop music influenced by eastern european dance music
7730895 rave and trance on technical grounds should be classified as classical
7730896 bluegrass is african american actually its origin is french just like rap but it has nothing to do with folk folk is irish pop music concocted in the 50s and 60s which uses instruments that werent invented until the 30s
7730897 wrong the plays of aristophanes prove that the overwhelming majority of athenians were straight and idiogenogamotics were ridiculed as either being effeminate or only doing kologamosis in return for political or financial favours if this was not so then aristophanes would not have mocked the politicians in the front seats as boy fuckers kologamosis with young boys will illegal in ancient athens and those engaging in it were banned from holding elected office or made numerous bum gags or brought naked girls on stage for an all male audience to represent peace or written plays featuring female prostitutes hellenistic romantic fiction such as the aethiopica also disproves your claims that women were only regarded as baby making machines menanders dyskolos also disproves your claims as does book 3 of apollonius argonougtica and euripides hellen kolofilia was nothing more than masturbation just ask yourself why it was only with a man and adolescent boy because it was easier for the giver to think the receiver was a young girl than if it was with a man the same age he might as well have fucked a sheep or a goat so to get back on topic it makes you wonder why rtd made captain jack an omnisexual read complete wanker

7730952 hard to avoid the conclusion that sales have bottomed out
7730953 inventories are very high relative to sales rates and would probably be even more so if all those wishing to sell their home actually had the house on the market instead of pulling it off in the face of weak demand and eroding prices
7730954 there is still a considerable distance to travel before prices sink to levels necessary to balance supply and demand in the housing market
7730955 all the factors that have motivated the price down are still intact

7730982 the slowdown in housing starts has been very painful for the industry but it is the necessary medicine to work down the inventory of unsold homes
7730983 we need for sales to outpace production so we can work down these inventories thats what has to happen before we can get this thing back on track

7730985 whos hiding in your address book introducing the ideal network for successful women
7730986 you wouldnt know if it was his first or his 30th in a low scoring ballgame he set the tone thats what he does he does it from a spot in the order that can give us a lot of energy
7730987 were finding ways to win right now and thats what you want
7730988 i dont try to hit homers i try to just keep the ball in the gap and in the center of the field
7730989 ive been having some good games in the late innings
7730990 i tried to run it in on him but he got a good swing
7730991 it wasnt the best pitch to throw at that time
7730992 he was very good today and put us in a good position to win the ballgame
7730993 we got hits but didnt do much with it we didnt swing the bats well enough to score runs
7730994 we just want to win as many games as we can and finish as well as we can

7731003 if an ipod only event is held on september 9 the long overdue update of mac portables would likely be pushed back at least two weeks if not longer introducing the hotly rumored and redesigned macbook in october would mean missing out on late starting college students in september
7731004 ive heard similar things but its unconfirmed my guess is ipods as we had last september
7731005 the difficulty is with the criteria that is set by immigration for certain job descriptions in new zealand
7731006 for example if you have an assistant herd manager they wont accept a veterinary degree from the philippines which seems absurd
7731007 what theyre saying is because theyve got to have an equivalent from overseas they dont accept a vet degree because it doesnt have on farm new zealand practical experience so therefore they cant come to work on a farm in new zealand
7731008 were getting people in canterbury for example who are advertising who are now getting large numbers of enquiries from in town
7731009 from trades people and senior professional people in town that are now applying and looking for a change in career to go out on farm there are people in their early twenties whose total wage package would be in the range of 60k or bigger
7731010 it would be fair to say that we had been helpful with letting people in whose practical experience may not have been entirely relevant to the jobs that they were doing
7731011 for some of these degrees for example the vet degree the practical experience component of it wouldnt necessarily include working on a dairy farm so they dont have any practical experience working with dairy cows so they dont meet that category
7731012 well maybe yes but our argument would be that if the interpretation was too loose people werent getting the people they wanted for the job
7731013 in the south island in particular theres a gross shortage of workers and theres a whole lot of ramifications we cant shut the farms down because theres animal welfare issues its not like a factory where we can shut one machine down and operate on twenty five per cent capacity
7731014 we are on track to meet our goal of operating the worlds first test flight on a large passenger aircraft using fuel sourced from jatropha in the last quarter of this year

7731060 wat niet weet wat niet deert maar die grote vlek zie je keer op keer
7731061 je moet het kaf van het koren scheiden maar liever eerst die vlek
7731062 wie zijn billen brandt moet op de blaren zitten zorg er dus voor dat je niet morst

7731065 met de fiets een puist oprijden is niet zo moeilijk als deze vlek laten verdwijnen
7731066 dat is hem door de neus geboord maar door vieze vlekken word je in ieder geval niet meer gestoord
7731067 nu zijn de rapen gaar maar met die vlek ben je tenminste in een handomdraai klaar

7731091 ja ik had het al wel eerder gezien toen je voorbijging maar toen zag je mij niet
7731092 ja je hebt je haar eraf h nou dat kon ook niet langer want als een man zulk lang haar heeft dan kun je niet meer zien dat hij een man is en dat is niet goed want een man is een man en geen vrouw en hij moet dus doen en leven zoals een man is en niet als een vrouw en dan die vrouwen in lange broek ik kan het gewoon niet meer uit elkaar houden wat nu een man is en wat een vrouw
7731093 ja nu zal ik je toch zeggen dat ik van de week ben goedgekeurd en tegelijk ben afgekeurd ja ik heb namelijk een heel rare ziekte
7731094 ja ik ben niet zenuwziek hoor ik ben gewoon goedgekeurd voor mijn gezondheid maar afgekeurd voor het werk dat ik graag wil doen maar zij zeggen dat ik dat werk niet kan doen terwijl ik juist dat werk wat ik nu doe helemaal niet kan doen want ik krijg van al die bejaarden s avonds heel dikke voeten ik werk maar twintig uur per week en ik krijg daar niks voor want ik heb een uitkering maar ik heb liever wel betaald en weet je waarom die betaling van twintig uur is meer dan die uitkering zon achtentwintig gulden meer dus zeg ik jullie mogen die uitkering gerust houden en betaal mij nu maar gewoon wat ik moet hebben ja dat heb ik gezegd ik ben tenslotte niet achterlijk
7731095 nou ben ik naar een blo school geweest en mijn verloofde is naar een blo school geweest en h m nemen ze wel en mij niet hij doet dat werk nu al zeven jaar ja z ven jaar
7731096 en mij willen ze niet eens op proef nemen voor twee maanden ik heb nog aangeboden om die twee maanden helemaal zonder betaling op proef te komen maar dat willen ze niet alleen wil ik ze nu wel eens laten zien dat ik er geen genoegen mee neem ze mogen mij niet weigeren omdat ik een vrouw ben want ook een vrouw kan heel best goed werk doen misschien niet alle werk dat mannen doen maar dat van mijn verloofde kan ik ook en misschien nog wel beter maar nu heeft de wethouder tegenwoordig spreekuur dus desnoods ga ik daar heen maar ik heb iets anders bedacht en dat zien ze dan wel weet je wat ik ga doen het is nu vrijdag maar volgende dinsdagmorgen om half acht
7731097 nou dat heeft geen zin want dan is de directeur er niet dus dinsdagmorgen om half acht nee vijf v r half acht zit ik in de stoel naast de deur van zijn kantoor en dan ga ik hem eens vragen of hij mij wil uitleggen waarom ik dat werk niet zou kunnen doen ja hij heeft me niet op proef genomen en hij weet natuurlijk heel goed dat hij een man niet mag voortrekken en dat zal ik hem wel eens even vertellen dus zal ik tegen hem zeggen dat ik niet eerder zijn kantoor uitga hij moet mij maar eens uitleggen waarom hij net doet alsof de wet voor hem niet geldt voor mij geldt die wet ook en dus voor hem net zo goed
7731098 en als de directeur dan nog niet naar mij luistert en mij op proef neemt weet je dan wat ik ga doen
7731099 dan zoek ik het gewoon hogerop en stap ik ijskoud naar de adjunct directeur

7731103 there is such a fear of women coming into power that when they protest they are given more weight
7731104 just the fact of women saying they support their candidate and want to make their voices heard sounds more scary than it would be if it were guys thats just part of backlash but come on when women gather around a water fountain men get scared people oughta just chill

7731106 ask pelosi why she asked hillary to get out of the race
7731107 if it gets rowdy ill step to the side i consider that march a thank you to hillary for having not given up
7731108 why why why did she ask clinton to leave the race and why did she encourage superdelegates not to vote for her that whole speech she just gave was about how women have to strive for power but she used her own power to diminish and destroy clintons
7731109 if obama loses the election dont think it wont be hillary whos blamed

7731116 whites require orderly environments for exercise which provide the necessary calm for them to relax and receive the mental benefits of exercise as well as the physical once theyve made their plan to include regular physical activity in their routine it becomes a cherished part of their life it doesnt slip out easily but when their routine is disrupted by travel moving to another city or other such changes its challenged

7731120 just as i signed up for my complimentary subscription i found myself in my own caregiver panic situation my long time babysitter just told me on monday that she needed to get a full time job which i cant offer her so i went onto care com found a few people in my area to choose from and checked out their references in just a couple of days i pinpointed someone who matched my familys needs exactly interviewed her and fell in love with her im always nervous about hiring a new babysitter unless shes been referred by a close friend but care com made me feel completely comfortable that the sitters on the site were pre approved and qualified it was easy and convenient and im thrilled with the results
7731121 my mil is not judgmental about my approach to mothering or general life decisions and i love that about her
7731122 i dont need your stinkin opinion about every little thing especially not my childrens bowel movements not even the weather and dont tell me what to do dont even make subtle suggestions because what you think is subtle is like an earthquake to me just keep it to yourself and keep on doing that
7731123 the ideal mil will accept her new dil with joy and curiosity just like she accepted the children she brought into the world herself
7731124 calling my mil mom feels infantilizing to me and impedes our adult adult relationship
7731125 how can i be supportive of you how do i add to your life and not detract from it
7731126 my advice for a new mil would be to be honest in your expectations ask her if she would like to learn about any important traditions in your family as her what you could do to help her the most dont be afraid to speak to her directly
7731127 when you dont understand something your daughter in law has said or done ask her about it but do it gently showing no negative overtones
7731128 the turning point in my relationship with my mil was when she emailed me directly to make plans for a visit instead of communicating through her son
7731129 i really do have some redeeming qualities i wish that youd try to get to know me as me instead of in my role as wife appendage to your son
7731130 try to see or understand what it is about her that your son loves so much
7731131 i think my mil criticisms would be much easier to take if i felt like she genuinely cared about me
7731132 my mil is great with the kids she happily watches them one night a week so we can have a date night or i can have some alone time
7731133 when i was a worn out new mom my mil would help with everything diapers baths and hair for my three children
7731134 my kids love a sleep over at grandmas and grandpas my mil is wonderful about babysitting so we can go out
7731135 i love my mil because she has no expectations of how often we should get together she wants us to live our own lives and only get together when its convenient for us
7731136 i told each couple before they got married that i would never insist that they come to my house for any specific holiday and i would not be offended my sons in law thanked me for that because it took a huge load off them
7731137 we are aware of exactly how long it has been since we last talked or visited my mil we do not need reminders
7731138 i expected my mil to be like my mother cheering me on in whatever endeavor i chose not so i have come to understand that my mil shows her love in other ways she hugs a lot and gives great gifts
7731139 i recently realized that a lot of my complaints about my mil were really complaints i had about my own mother my view of her was clouded by issues i had with my own mom
7731140 my enfp daughter in law is close to her own mother she is not looking to me for mothering she goes to her own mother for advice
7731141 i have the best mil she shares her wonderful insights and stays out of the day to day
7731142 my challenge as a mil is to back off and bask in the joys of another generation coming along and living their lives were we really so perfect at their age
7731143 my mil gives me my space but is available to help out when i ask
7731144 when i ask my mil for advice on what to do she says that something to be discussed with my husband my best advice is let your kids and kids in law know you are there for them in every way without really being all over their lives
7731145 what i appreciate about my mil is that she accepts her son is an adult
7731146 i would be much more willing to learn from my mil if she would let me teach her something once in a while
7731147 i have heard that men marry women who resemble their mothers so when i notice something that i dont like about my mil i use her as a mirror to find and work on my own faults
7731148 my mil is an isfp my personality opposite but instead of looking at her as my nemesis which is easy to do with mils i try to reframe our relationship into a mutual learning partnership i teach her to be more assertive and she teaches me to be more patient
7731149 your brother decided to marry her not you so you dont have to like her but you do have to respect her because you love your brother
7731150 to meditate only you must smile smile with face smile with mind and good energy will come to you and clean away dirty energy even smile in your liver practice tonight not to hurry not to try too hard too serious you make you sick you can call the good energy to you with a smile
7731151 im in a hurry to get things done i rush and rush til lifes no fun
7731152 the fewer intentional retreats we take for ourselves the more we will find ourselves unintentionally finding ways to escape
7731153 its more friendly its personal shes very good about giving answers it feels comfortable talking to her
7731154 i knew there had to be answers ways of improving and changing
7731155 if a rich person wouldnt be caught dead there neither should a poor person
7731156 the way the average office practice still works its almost indistinguishable from the early 1900s minus the computer screen
7731157 were practicing horse and buggy medicine in the space age
7731158 the same things that frustrate patients frustrate the doctor the dropped balls the long waits the missed communication the poor communication
7731159 when i want to change something i just do it
7731160 even when im in a hurry im always going to brush my teeth
7731161 but she spent 30 or 45 minutes each with my older sons and that was just the camp physical i have to pay a 100 diagnostic fee just for my mechanic to look at my car never mind repair it with ramona i mean dr seidel shes compassionate and my kids and i feel comfortable she treats you like youre one of her own

7731170 there is a need to address regional and national relationships and make them more transparent emerging presentations and recommendations should then be forwarded to the appropriate decision and policy makers

7731191 she is on her way to the little country of georgia
7731192 its premature to say that it was a valid threat or that these folks have the ability to carry it out

7731194 it could also turn out that these were nothing but a bunch of knuckleheads meth heads
7731195 our pets seem to be eating better than their owners
7731196 i think giving a nice chunk of fish to a pet is important to satisfy the personal hedonistic needs of the owner not the nutritional need of the cat cats will be very happy to eat the offal from a trout
7731197 forage fish could be better used for human consumption directly particularly amongst the poorer nations of the world
7731198 most probably crashed thats why we are concentrating our search within a 20 mile radius

7731273 some of the investors may have gotten a little bit ahead of the deal the fact there are funds in an escrow for a period of time is quite typical
7731274 it did not go over well it seemed something outside our realm
7731275 people were concerned they were dealing with immigration policy while they should really be focused on financing for the convention center
7731276 this is a great program that doesnt cost the city or state any money so shouldnt philadelphia benefit from it in a way that can complete construction of the convention
7731277 les fumiers ils vont tu le multi de cod 4 au secouuuuuuuuurrs faut trouv un moyen de les d tect et de les banniiiiiiiiiiiiirrr viiiit de toute fa on ils feront moins les malin quand on fera des concours en lan ha ha ha

7731282 moviegoers nowadays not only watch movies but also read about the different technical angles used in the film to give it a more authentic look cinema is also evolving as a means of documenting events rather than just being inspired from literature
7731283 earlier people used to find it difficult to believe that a real life incident can be picturised in the same manner but now with the change in audiences tastes the demand for such movies have increased prompting producers to encash on the trend
7731284 both my films paanch which is yet to be released and black friday were inspired from life
7731285 it is a give and take relation and may or may not mutually influence each other it is possible that terrorists have hatched their plan in ahmedabad blasts after watching contract but ultimately it occurred due to security lapse and not cinema
7731286 the film is a fiction and does not talk about any real life incident but yes to some extent it discusses about the life in kashmir and grenade dealing was also shown as part of trade when we were shooting the valley was peaceful and the condition was not as worse as it is today
7731287 proper research is the most vital thing before making a realistic movie the script should be clear in the mind otherwise it will become a sort of khichdi
7731288 our goal was to create audio programming that is as distinctive as rocksugars blend of authentic asian flavors and unique environment
7731289 our music mix immerses rocksugars guests into an authentic southeast asian environment through songs that are subtle and relaxing yet full of energy
7731290 rocksugar is a non traditional exotic and highly exceptional dining environment and dmi was able to deliver music programming that is a perfect reflection of its identity
7731291 through this intoxicating blend of musical styles we feel that customers will be truly immersed in the rocksugar experience
7731292 she knows where are all the bodies have been buried in the past 30 or so years of chicago politics and she knows all the tricks
7731293 if obama had a political and financial godmother it would be valerie
7731294 jarrett has done that for barack and michelle three or four times over
7731295 that and her ties to chicago politicians and her iranian background and you have a potential nightmare
7731296 say what you want about hillary but she didnt have that kind of a triple threat on her team
7731297 introduced in october 1990 the eos 1000 proved to be immensely popular a compact lightweight weighs 500g with battery and features laden body with iconized pictorial symbols on the control dial to set various operational modes easy reference even for photographic beginners

7731300 if it is not handled properly we could have a security issue
7731301 you dont want to give anybody a reason to turn back to al qaeda
7731302 some people from the government encouraged us to fight against al qaeda but it seems that now that al qaeda is finished they dont want us anymore
7731303 sacrificed and fought against al qaeda and now the government wants to catch them and arrest them
7731304 so they the sunni fighters deserve our gratitude and the inclusion into the security forces because we adhere to a policy that there are no arms but the arms of the government
7731305 its a matter of how much majority anwar will get
7731306 thousands of third party applications have been built on facebook since the launch of the facebook platform in early 2007 with the exception of a few most applications fall dramatically short of engaging users on a level that will attract major blue chip brands like we already have
7731307 as we look to build out a global sports media experience we recognize the incredible value of fantasy sports in that effort
7731308 all we collect is going to offset all the maintenance
7731309 once council decides on the fee then we can come up with a plan to implement it
7731310 i would move to send this to the planning commission but i dont have the votes
7731311 the superhot top chef host has the best of heidi klums body and the worst of seals face and somehow makes it all work
7731312 yes i am pasty almost to the point of translucency thank you for your observation
7731313 hey girl why you buyin that let me take you out somewhere nice let me get your number
7731314 i just didnt want to start anything in front of a lady
7731315 once again the gao data has been twisted and misinterpreted by those seeking to attack corporate america
7731316 many news reports claim that the gao study revealed that almost two thirds of companies in the us usually pay no corporate income taxes what the gao report actually said was that for the period between 1998 and 2005 corporations not necessarily the same corporations had no tax liability for one of the eight years in question if two thirds of all corporations were paying no taxes for all eight years we would be reading about a department of justice doj or internal revenue service irs investigation into the matter and not some synopsis of a gao report
7731317 the tax system that allows this wholesale tax avoidance is an embarrassment and unfair to hardworking americans who pay their fair share of taxes
7731318 the gao report doesnt say that businesses arent paying taxes they owe rather it says that some corporations did not have tax liabilities in other words they did not owe taxes you can have many billions of dollars in revenue and still have r amp d labor related and other expenses that are larger than your revenues and therefore no income to tax
7731319 at least i dont slather on the makeup like a trollop you hi mom
7731320 if we reach the point where it might come into effect that means we have to study all the procedures because it will affect the customs union and it will affect even the whole customs work in the uae
7731321 the questions posed to mr bonds by two different prosecutors at his grand jury appearance were imprecise redundant overlapping and frequently compound
7731322 we want to make sure our clients have a place where they can be as safe and dignified as possible
7731323 we knew some folks would ask why we couldnt make it a move permanent so we decided to stay our clients may be homeless but this is their neighborhood their community and their neck of the woods uprooting them would be no more fair than if you did that to any other neighborhood
7731324 how much bs are you going to put up with
7731325 if theyre fenced in and surrounded by protests noise and crowds
7731326 we have to go on standstill just because of those people
7731327 when they put those tarps up we knew what they thought about us its about making the city pretty thats what its all about
7731328 were not trying to hide them nor are we trying to put them on display we have a fundamental belief in the dignity of every human person and we are trying to get people to hear the voices of the poor
7731329 frankly they are hardly ever heard by anyone in our political system
7731330 companies historically havent been proactive in getting older workers to train younger workers to do their jobs
7731331 its really a fairly clean herd but we do have more than just the two that were initially found
7731332 rarely in psychological research do we see such persistently positive reports from a single event in the laboratory
7731333 do you mind if i live here since we cant all get on the same page and i am homeless now really i cant live here hmmm then where shall i live because i have no house
7731334 kami telah mengajukan tuntutan pada pihak yang terlibat dalam produksi dan distribusi film berjudul hari puttar
7731335 warner bros menghargai dan melindungi hak hak properti intelektual namun merupakan peraturan kami untuk tidak membahas detail prosedurnya di depan publik
7731336 karena kasusnya belum disidangkan maka kami tidak dapat berkomentar saat ini walaupun begitu kami telah mengurus izin judul hari puttar pada 2005 dan sayangnya warner malah mengajukan kasus ini saat film kami akan dirilis menurut pendapat saya saya rasa judul kami tidak memiliki kesamaan ataupun hubungan dengan harry potter
7731337 what struck me when i first met barack was that even though he had this funny name and even though hed grown up all the way across the continent in hawaii his family was so much like mine
7731338 he was raised by grandparents who were working class folks just like my parents and by a single mother who struggled to pay the bills just like we did and like my family they scrimped and saved so that he could have opportunities they never had themselves
7731339 never forgotten where he came from and never stopped fighting for folks who work long hours and face long odds and need someone on their side again
7731340 theyll tell them how this time we listened to our hopes instead of our fears how this time we decided to stop doubting and to start dreaming
7731341 how this time in this great country where a girl from the south side of chicago can go to college and law school and the son of a single mother from hawaii can go all the way to the white house that we committed ourselves we committed ourselves to building the world as it should be
7731342 a lot of people think i shouldnt have in fact a lot of people
7731343 also you forgot to mention when i warned the people about the british coming
7731344 we were gonna have a cake but the fire marshal said that many candles
7731345 youve got to find somebody who you know shares your principles your values and your priorities
7731346 it really shouldnt be affected by anything else really it shouldnt be
7731347 the speaker lineup for tonight by the way here at the convention includes some of the partys most prominent and most liberal members including the house speaker nancy pelosi senator ted kennedy and former president jimmy carter
7731348 barack and i were raised with so many of the same values that you work hard for what you want in life that your word is your bond and you do what you say youre going to do that you treat people with dignity and respect even if you dont know them and even if you dont agree with them
7731349 i come here as a wife who loves my husband and believes he will be an extraordinary president
7731350 i come here as a daughter raised on the south side of chicago by a father who was a blue collar city worker and a mother who stayed at home with my brother and me
7731351 you know what struck me when i first met barack was that even though he had this funny name even though hed grown up all the way across the continent in hawaii his family was so much like mine he was raised by grandparents who were working class folks just like my parents and by a single mother who struggled to pay the bills just like we did
7731352 barack stood up that day and he spoke words that have stayed with me ever since
7731353 i stand here today at the cross currents of that history knowing that my piece of the american dream is a blessing hard won by those who came before me
7731354 all of us driven by a simple belief that the world as it is just wont do that we have an obligation to fight for the world as it should be
7731355 18 million cracks in the glass ceiling so that our daughters and sons can dream a little bigger and aim a little higher
7731356 i come here tonight to stand with you and to change america to restore its future and to elect barack obama president of the united states
7731357 this november the torch will be passed again to a new generation of americans
7731358 i pledge to you that i will be there next january
7731359 yourblackworld barack obamas prayer note on the wall in jerusalem
7731360 off the top i felt you were a little flat you got to figure out how youre going to find your note
7731361 breathing has so much to do with the rhythm of the song i think you totally heeded her advice great job
7731362 i would still like to see a little more edge and a little more angst
7731363 it reminded me of perry como sleeping on a couch in a sweater
7731364 for me personally i couldnt tell where you were coming from i still think while your movement was more direct to the audience it still seemed like you were out for a meaningless meander in the backyard
7731365 i thought the singing was good the performance was great
7731366 i thought vocally that was your best performance yet really good song choice
7731367 ive never heard the teletubbies tune sound so good before
7731368 by far best singing youve ever done on this show by a mile
7731369 two things one id like to replace with everything ive said on this show with everything that anne murray has said she is bang on and killing it that however was utterly flavourless
7731370 you become part of the song and i appreciate that
7731371 i think its a dynamic issue for me theres not enough dynamics in the way you sing you gotta be more dynamic in your delivery
7731372 what really appealed to me was the contrast of the dark material of the song and this gentle charm that comes out of you
7731373 for me its edge thats a dark song but you gotta have some more angst push harder
7731374 abundantly apparent is that you have no clue on how to win canadian idol
7731375 i didnt enjoy the beginning as much as i enjoyed the middle and end i think you couldve done a little more with it though
7731376 i like the creative vibe but it seemed to me a bit like a throwaway and to me you arent
7731377 for a moment there i actually felt that you didnt want to be here
7731378 it came off to me a lighter shade of the blues it was a reasonably good performance
7731379 i thought after last week one of the four of you could demonstrate what makes you a canadian idol it seems like everyones got the yips the world can change with one song but not with that one
7731380 i thought playing a blues number well you know weve seen it before there was a moment there where you sounded like jim cuddy and thats a really good thing
7731381 great way to finish off the night youre so consistent youre the one who really laid it down tonight
7731382 yo yo theo you got on your horse of choice and rode straight to victory
7731383 what did you do to get your old lady to put out
7731384 poetry what did you say to her that got her hot and bothered
7731385 heres the poem that got me in her pants last night
7731386 ok if thats all there is to it ill give it a try tonight
7731387 guess my old lady is not so fond of poetry i tried a poem like yours and she decked me but good
7731388 she smacked you over a poem tell me what you said
7731389 black bitch black bitch bug eyed like a frog get down on your knees and ill bone you like a dog
7731390 you should be consuming bullys comics content on the regular
7731391 why isnt a little stuffed bull running the comics industry
7731392 is this person different from the norms of our company culture
7731393 could this person be effective in their job given the norms of our company culture
7731394 a western haiku need not concern itself with the seventeen syllables since western languages cannot adapt themselves to the fluid syllabillic japanese i propose that the western haiku simply say a lot in three short lines in any western language
7731395 no ink left on it guess its time to get rid of it
7731396 so throw it out already let it fly down to the river
7731397 here give it to me ill let it slip through my big hands
7731398 a good wind i want to see it sail on its way down
7731399 i dont spend a lot of time worrying about stuff like that
7731400 we have to remember that whales are descended from a common ancestor of cows so this is not a surprise given what we know about whales
7731401 this is an incredibly neat use of google earth this is a study we would not have dreamed about doing five years ago
7731402 kalau di rumah aku selalu bermain dengannya baik main bola basket sepakbola maupun football itu membuatku selalu riang
7731403 seremoni adalah hal biasa bonus dan ucapan selamat juga sebuah kebanggaan namun justru aku paling kangen dengan masakan mama rasanya itu selalu terbayang begitu aku sadar kalau tugasku di olimpiade sudah selesai apalagi aku bisa membawa emas pastilah mama akan memberiku masakah terhebatnya
7731404 aku memang sangat manja dengan mama apalagi untuk urusan perut rasanya belum sempurna hari itu jika belum menikmati lezatnya masakan mama dan entah kenapa aku begitu kangen dengan semua itu
7731405 ibu suka mengolah ikan mie dan olahan sandwichnya sangat enak sayur berkuah terutama sop daging menjadi andalan mama itu karena papa juga sangat menyukai sop
7731406 gol itu terjadi begitu saja aku benar benar tak mengira bisa menjadi gol
7731407 kami bangga memiliki orang yang mampu memberi jasa pada negeri kami apalagi ini di tingkat dunia dan menjadi bagian dari sejarah as sepanjang masa
7731408 aku memasang dua foto itu kaka dan messi saling berhadapan dan setiap kali aku bangun pagi keduanya memberiku semangat kalau aku bisa seperti mereka
7731409 does your phone have tone 5 does it does it
7731410 why didnt you tell me about this before we could have put this off i would have managed
7731411 thats why i have my son with me hes going to help me clean
7731412 do you get him to do this kind of work often chona
7731413 eeryday he helps us around the house sometimes does groceries too
7731414 count your blessings most kids here would be very rude about telling you where you can put your chores
7731415 i still cant believe you said that ive gotten fat
7731416 but its true ive never seen you with a belly before
7731417 it was a great game we just started t wear them down in the second half
7731418 on our night we can really go forward byu is a program that is consistently in the ncaa tournament and i think its a great challenge for us to continue to play well against well coached teams like this we have a lot of respect for their program
7731419 im in shock right now i was not expecting to do that at all when i took that free kick
7731420 i felt the byu goal in the first half was my fault that just gave me the momentum and i kicked that one with everything i had ive never done anything like that before
7731421 we couldnt have asked for a better field to play on considering the torrential downpour we had here over the last day or two
7731422 david hadsky and his grounds crew did an outstanding job of getting the field ready to play and you would have never known that we had that kind of weather hit the field we appreciate them for all of their hard work today
7731423 this event provides us with an opportunity to enjoy an evening of fun on the water
7731424 adults attending this event help to provide much needed funds to provide programs for girl scouts in the area we appreciate the support we receive from the community
7731425 events such as this are vital to the continued success of our goal to build girls of courage confidence and character
7731426 now more than ever our girls need places to learn new skills to help them discover connect and take action to make the world a better place
7731427 no no no youve never been in a company where theres an engineer with a computer science degree and ten years of experience an architect whos in your face screaming at you with spittle flying on you because you suggested using you know d or haskell or lisp or erlang or take your pick
7731428 erlang makes concurrency easy because it doesnt have shared memory
7731429 bueno a partir de ahora s lo venderemos el autom vil
7731430 how many times must i tell you to leave things in their place
7731431 but i already told you i dont know where the scissors are
7731432 i took the scissors this morning theyre in my room
7731433 it needs to be dealt with because i lost most of the feeling in my right arm and am having pain in my shoulder
7731434 im losing 20 percent of my strength per day if i dont do anything about it the injury will end up rupturing and then the surgery will be more difficult its not easy because surgery never is
7731435 increasingly lining up according to the nature of their regimes
7731436 the next american century how the u s can thrive as other powers rise
7731437 to all akashic fans we want to let you know that we are ending the activities of the band we had 10 fantastic years where we learned a lot with each other musically and personally we recorded two cds and a future dvd besides of playing two european tours in this period we focused all our creativity on akashic we are sure that we gave our best maintaining the truth of each of us in every song and action made by the band so far we thank the fans for all the support we will keep working with music as we always did because thats what we like to do and what we do best keep following our careers and wait for the dvd which will be released soon
7731438 it doesnt matter what our children grow up to become so long as they are happy
7731439 maybe this year they will come out and support me and carry me through to another u s open win
7731440 i think i need the support a little bit this year
7731441 five years almost i was expected to win every tournament i entered except maybe toward the end a little bit on clay
7731442 so maybe now it changes a little bit because obviously theres a shift in the rankings rafa will now feel what i had to feel for a very long time
7731443 so it will be interesting to see how he handles it maybe its nice to go into a grand slam for a change maybe not having no 1 next to me
7731444 i know pretty much every player except for one that would take his bad year
7731445 so i think you have to use a little bit of perspective hes created a bit of a monster for himself
7731446 but i think one big result and its turned right around for him
7731447 maybe ive been playing a little bit of catch up all the way through the season
7731448 i think its just a matter of winning a lot of matches in a row together and i really feel like this is going to happen here at the u s open if i play good

7731450 you dont love me dad and dont see how bad this table is
7731451 she will grow become wiser and understand that she is the cause not the table
7731452 if i find out who did it before the police find out its not going to be a happy case
7731453 the police officers were just way way out of control
7731454 there was nothing that would have permitted them by law a weapon of any sort road rage incidents involving police officers should not take place
7731455 its our goal to be as relevant as possible to as many people as we can
7731456 would you let your mother take the reins of your dating life lark a twentysomething strawberry blond freckle faced texan has had enough of dating geeky weird guys so when her sociable mama suggests she pre screen some guys for lark to date larks just desperate enough to say yes after all with her three low level jobs and the classes shes taking shes not likely to snag the someone anytime soon but with her mamas man getting project she might just have a chance when brant stephens her old classmate who lives down the street tells her she resembles a sick cat she chalks it up to him being the most boring mean and predictable man on earth hes got more degrees than she can remember more annoying personality flaws than she can count and all the gorgeous shallow dates he could ever need so why does he feel led to insult her every chance he gets and whats with all the eccentric flamingos popping up around town sometimes life looks just a little gray until the brilliance of popsicle orange peeks around the corner
7731457 i decide i might be crossing some invisible lust line by studying brants legs like this so i wander off and return with ugly canvas paint masks from a bin at the end of the aisle pretending im a surgeon i put one on and slip the other on brant while he holds out two strips of blue paint chips at arms length then we carry on as before me studying his legs and he studying blues while wearing masks i find it more entertaining to do this while masked and brant doesnt seem to mind and i realize ive just made studying his hairy legs way more medical than lust y yea for me

7731460 we think somethings not quite right with josiah compared to when we were here a couple of months ago he didnt seem to be as interested in us or in his cousin and we had noticed little things before like how he was into wheels was turning lights off and on and was looking strangely at the fence he hit his head on the floor last week and it didnt even hurt him
7731461 but he claps and he has eye contact and hes not like that

7731467 binayak is a very rare doctor a man with a deep understanding of the social and political dimensions of health the governments of the world the world bank and other organisations are now worrying about food security and alternative food policies binayak was decades ahead of them all
7731468 he is a maoist leader and sympathiser and we have enough evidence against him
7731469 praising the egalitarian bonus scheme at john lewis the department store is apparently a nudge criticising lads magazines seems to be a nudge giving unhappily married couples a tax incentive to stay together is a nudge and so is sending health visitors into new mothers homes

7731474 given that our results are backed by numerous experimental studies showing that incense is a powerful producer of and that incense smoke contains carcinogenic substances i believe incense should be used with caution
7731475 that is frequent use in rooms where people live should be minimized or at least sufficient ventilation should be secured in our study we find the increased risk of cancer to be present in individuals reporting frequent use of incense for many years thus repeated exposure for years should probably be avoided
7731476 its not nearly the danger of smoking a pack a day for 20 years but its a danger
7731477 certainly i think bathing yourself in particles is probably not the smartest thing in the world but i think very few people fill up their room with incense
7731478 its a population based study which means that you can make an association but not necessarily a conclusion
7731479 it probably promotes more work in the area of routine household items and things we need to be looking at more prospectively to make a clear cause and effect relationship
7731480 anything that affects air quality negatively is not a good thing
7731481 burning in general and the release of smoke these things are certainly to be avoided at the very least chemical irritants will set off asthma and thats reversible cancer is not reversible
7731482 this is not unlike the type of risk that one experiences from
7731483 this finding highlights the limited impact of warnings and suggests that more effective approaches are needed to protect vulnerable populations from potentially hazardous medications
7731484 instead of getting ready for school shes in the hospital recovering
7731485 they are definitely the toughest opponents weve had in a
7731486 the belgian league has a lot of quality and their champions are used to getting into the group stages we had a tough match against anderlecht a few years ago so im not surprised liege caused us problems
7731487 they caught us a bit cold in the first leg but you have to remember that they had gone something like 30 games unbeaten in their own league and they are a club with european pedigree
7731488 we didnt play well and we know well have to improve at anfield everyone knows how important it is for our season to get into the group stage
7731489 its always a funny time for us to have such a massive game before weve got going in the season some of our results have reflected that

7731506 the group has commenced discussions with the lender groups on possible terms for longer term debt extension and stabilisation of the group
7731507 while the asset sale program will provide the group with liquidity and some level of debt reduction the group considers that asset sales alone will not provide a long term recapitalisation solution
7731508 the group has also received and evaluated a number of proposals for new equity the group in consultation with its lenders has concluded that no proposal received to date provides an acceptable outcome which is in the best interests of all relevant stakeholders
7731509 the group believes that in particular given current difficult capital market conditions an acceptable proposal capable of being implemented by 15 december 2008 is unlikely to be forthcoming
7731510 discussions with the lenders on possible terms are at a preliminary stage and no specific proposal has been formulated the group can give no assurance that any further debt extensions will be achieved beyond the expiry of the current extensions on 30 september 2008

7731550 to find the whole thing like this is really rare
7731551 we have a number of manufacturers committed to return and talk seriously about narrowing the scope of possibilities for a future spec
7731552 i think were right on schedule and if we keep pursuing the plan to narrow the spec by the end of the year we will have a nice smooth development and it will serve everybody
7731553 were really pleased with how much interest there is in the indycar series
7731554 were currently working through what we think collectively would be the best engine architecture for the future whether its a v6 or an inline 4 or we stick with a v8 thats very much dependent on the oems individual car strategies for the future
7731555 one of the things that seems to be solidifying is to come up with an architecture that could be used in other racing applications so were looking to see if we could create a common platform across a number of series to make everything more cost effective for the oems and also give us a very sophisticated and high performance engine which we could have adjustable power between ovals and road courses
7731556 such a plan is technically challenging and interesting to them from a commercial point of view because it also reflects on their road car technology for the future
7731557 thats what were trying to do is find an architecture of engine that would be really relevant to the future in terms of road car applications and technologies
7731558 were trying to find mid ground to make sure we have everybody engaged and we come up with a workable final package that will be competitive and cost effective for everyone
7731559 the good thing about the architectures were looking at will make them inherently lighter than our current engine so that helps us a lot in the overall weight of the new car
7731560 it gives us more flexibility in the installation because the engine will probably be physically smaller there are things were already discussing such as where to put the oil tank to make the balance the same and we still need common engine mountings so if we have multiple engine manufacturers they would fit the same basic chassis

7731579 rasulullah r menyebutkan keharusan berbuat baik kepada ibu sebanyak tiga kali baru pada kali yang keempat untuk sang ayah karena kebanyakan sikap durhaka dilakukan seorang anak justru terhadap ibunya
7731580 dalam hadits ini disebutkan sikap durhaka terhadap ibu karena perbuatan itu lebih mudah dilakukan terhadap seorang ibu sebab
7731581 di sini disebutkan kata durhaka terhadap ibu karena kemuliaannya yang melebihi kemuliaan seorang ayah
7731582 kalau seseorang melakukan perbuatan yang kurang adab dalam pandangan umum yang menyinggung orang tuanya maka ia telah melakukan dosa besar meskipun bila dilakukan terhadap selain orang tua tidaklah dosa
7731583 arti durhaka kepada orang tua yaitu melakukan perbuatan yang menyebabkan orang tua terganggu atau terusik baik dalam bentuk ucapan ataupun amalan
7731584 kebanyakan ulama berpendapat bahwa taat kepada orang tua wajib termasuk dalam hal hal yang masih
7731585 apabila kita sudah menyadari betapa besar hak seorang ibu terhadap anaknya dan betapa besar dosa perbuatan durhaka terhadapnya atau dosa sekadar lalai memperhatikannya
7731586 dan rendahkanlah dirimu terhadap mereka berdua dengan penuh kesayangan dan ucapkanlah

7731614 abortion numbers in australia are estimated at around 90 000 annually this compares with around 250 000 births thus more than a quarter of all pregnancies are terminated at 24 weeks the embryo has individuality and uniqueness and the building blocks for the development of life there is no logical difference between a 24 week embryo and a new born child the only quality that a 24 week embryo lacks by virtue of it being in the womb is the capacity to tug at the emotional heartstrings of the mother it cant plead for its life the indecency of the human condition is rarely more obvious than in relation to our willingness to exterminate humans simply because they cant beg to not be destroyed it is repugnant to suggest that whether a being enjoys the most cardinal right of all to life should depend on the whim of another person

7731625 as i look ahead i am strengthened by family and friendship
7731626 so many of you have been with me in the happiest days and the hardest days together we have known success and seen setbacks victory and defeat
7731627 but we have never lost our belief that we are all called to a better country and a newer world

7731630 two men who have changed my life and the life of this country
7731631 but once or twice in a lifetime they come along just when we need them the most this is one of those moments
7731632 a lot of the investment in online advertising has been from technology focused folks trying to solve problems and impose solutions on a market
7731633 take every precaution to try to avoid innocent civilian casualties

7731635 going to shoot obama from a high vantage point using a rifle sighted at 750 yards
7731636 was directly asked if they had come to denver to kill obama he responded in the affirmative
7731637 editors note one of the items on this list has been removed because it mistakenly repeated a report that barack obama holds dual united states kenyan citizenship this erroneous information was never reported in the rocky mountain news print edition
7731638 if you are doing it on purpose realize that defamation can be a basis for a lawsuit colorado has even sentenced people to jail time for harassment on the internet and some of these rants fall very close to that precedent
7731639 this will turn out to be nothing more than some idiot cranked out worm brained losers who were in the wrong place at the wrong time
7731640 yep we came here to shoot him yep we sure did
7731641 law enforcement sources told cbs4 that one of the suspects

7731644 decided he wanted to be part of the news instead of reporting the news and wanted to mix it up with ward churchill for some reason
7731645 who allegedly put his hands on churchill organizer glenn spagnuolo said
7731646 it seems incredibly irresponsible on both parties sides to be spending my guess 125 000 000 on conventions for two gentlmen to say yeh i accept the nomination when so many hard working american families cannot afford to take their children to the doctor a record of families are being foreclosed on and our school systems are failing its time for all of us politicians included to stop the wasteful lifestyle and start putting our resources where they are needed most
7731647 when i saw the story i figured on seeing these sorts of comments here
7731648 decided he wanted to be part of the news instead of reporting the news and wanted to mix it up with ward churchill for some reason
7731649 i forget that internet discussions these days especially one involving ward churchill are supposed to be about identifying enemies and leveling personal attacks
7731650 i truly believe that peter has incredible economic credentials and its not for peter its for our nation that he should be on the frontbench
7731651 but if he doesnt have an intention that way he should declare it as such so that we dont hold up a false hope that he may come back because it makes a bit of a fool of me and a few others as well
7731652 i have come here tonight to stand with you to change america to restore its future to rise to our best ideals and to elect barack obama president of the united states
7731653 as i look ahead i am strengthened by family and friendship many of you have been with me in the happiest and the hardest days

7731657 have a serious lifelong obligation to form their conscience in accord with human reason and the teaching of the church by studying sacred scripture and the teaching of the church as contained in the catechism of the catholic church
7731658 since the first century the church has affirmed the moral evil of every procured abortion
7731659 as catholics we are not single issue voters yet a candidates position on a single issue that involves an intrinsic evil such as support for legal abortion or the promotion of racism may legitimately lead a voter to disqualify a candidate for receiving support
7731660 secularists are wrong when they ask believers to leave their religion at the door before entering into the public square frederick douglass abraham lincoln william jennings bryan dorothy day martin luther king indeed the majority of great reformers in american history were not only motivated by faith but repeatedly used religious language to argue for their cause to say that men and women should not inject their personal morality into public policy debates is a practical absurdity our law is by definition a codification of morality much of it grounded in the judeo christian tradition
7731661 all their passion their energy and their frustration in regard to society is channelled into hatred
7731662 if the russians have it it needs to be returned immediately
7731663 but theres conflicting reports on it right now wed certainly expect that the russians would return any equipment that is us equipment and return it quickly if in fact they do have it
7731664 theres some also indications that theyve made that assurance if theyve made that assurance they need to honor that commitment as well
7731665 based upon my review and the need for public confidence in new orleans flood protection system i have concluded that an outside opinion is warranted
7731666 we will work closely with these independent reviewers to ensure that all issues are dealt with comprehensively and expeditiously and we are quite confident that when all is said and done the end result will be the same as the previous investigations and audits
7731667 implies that operator error was responsible for the mammoth hydraulic pump failures
7731668 if the pump manufacturer cannot operate the pumping equipment without causing massive and catastrophic failures of the hydraulic pump components then it is not reasonable to expect the user to do a better job
7731669 why has there not been any mention of the potentially adverse effects of mercks cervical cancer vaccination gardasil in relationship to the timing of the vaccination and where a young woman is in her menstrual cycle
7731670 are common during the premenstruum and may follow administration of antibiotics and inoculations confusion may occur as to the real origin of such reactions in double blind clinical trials the placebo drugs are often reported to have side effects such as increased drowsiness headache nausea or increased pain which may be no more than the usual premenstrual symptoms which have not been meticulously observed and reported
7731671 measles cases in the u s are at the highest level in more than a decade with nearly half of those involving children whose parents rejected vaccination health officials reported thursday worried doctors are troubled by the trend fueled by unfounded fears that vaccines may cause autism the number of cases is still small just 131 but thats only for the first seven months of the year there were only 42 cases for all of last year the cdcs review found that a number of cases involved home schooled children not required to get the vaccines others can avoid vaccination by seeking exemptions such as for religious reasons the vaccine is considered highly effective but not perfect 11 of this years cases had at least one dose of the vaccine of this years total 122 were unvaccinated or had unknown vaccination status some were unvaccinated because the children were under age 1 too young to get their first measles shot in 63 of those cases almost all of them 19 or under the patient or their parents refused the shots for philosophical or religious reasons the cdc reported in washington state an outbreak was traced to a church conference including 16 school aged children who were not vaccinated eleven of those kids were home schooled and not subject to vaccination rules in public schools its unclear why the parents rejected the vaccine the illinois outbreak triggered by a teenager who had traveled to italy included 25 home schooled children according to the cdc report
7731672 he was advanced for his age he was talking when he was 11 months old
7731673 it doesnt serve us well when we have government officials trying to create fear and anxiety
7731674 right now were seeing a one size fits all approach to vaccination that doesnt really recognize that children are different that children react differently to vaccinations
7731675 putting up permanent facilities and checkpoints are inconsistent with the agreement
7731676 we are in contact with the various parties to obtain clarification
7731677 eighteen peacekeeping observer posts have been set up on the administrative border of georgia and south ossetia
7731678 these rules send a clear signal that the administration will spend the rest of its days razing what remains of the rules and regulations that have kept wildlife like the bald eagle from going extinct
7731679 this means any time there is a new federal construction project well nepa the national environmental policy act will be waived and therell be no environmental review
7731680 every power cut even if it lasts for just a few minutes delays water production by three hours
7731681 there wasnt a lot of focus from the former regime on the long term consequences of dumping raw sewage onto river banks
7731682 we have people illegally siphoning water from the pipelines using potable water to irrigate their gardens and fill their fish pools
7731683 even water used by car washes this wasted water could be used in areas already suffering from shortages
7731684 the water is dirty but what can we do we dont have any other choice
7731685 people like us who earn three or four dollars a day we spend it all on generators
7731686 as soon as you build new plants and you lay down new networks you will be able to service more people
7731687 now they apparently have enough resources and theyre slowly moving toward using those resources
7731688 but the task is immense even with all the money in the world it would still take time
7731689 76 people all civilians and most of them women and children were martyred 19 women 7 men and the rest children all under 15 years of age
7731690 martyring at least 70 people most of them women and children
7731691 we couldnt and we havent found any identification showing they are taliban
7731692 the people were very angry they told the soldiers we dont need your food we dont need your clothes we want our children we want our relatives can you give it to us you cannot so go away
7731693 we went to the area and found out that the bombardment was very heavy lots of houses have been damaged and more than 90 non combatants including women children and elderly people have died most are women and children they the us military have claimed that taliban were there they must prove it so far it is not clear for us why the coalition conducted the air strikes
7731694 these reports are being investigated and well look for the results of that investigation
7731695 coalition forces take precautions to prevent the loss of civilians unlike the taliban and militants who target civilians and place civilians in harms way
7731696 was aware of allegations that the engagement in shindand district of herat province friday may have resulted in civilian deaths
7731697 the afghan pakistan war is a two country war that cannot be won in afghanistan alone at this point in time us nato isaf afghan forces are simply too weak to deal with a multi faceted insurgency with a de facto sanctuary along the entire afghan pakistan border it seems likely that the afghan pakistan war will play out over a decade or more and be a major problem for the entire term of office for the next presidents of both the us and pakistan
7731698 the us and its allies have no choice other than to try and force pakistans new government to take a far firmer and aggressive stand decisions to take decisive action will be pakistani but the us should make it openly clear that the us cannot wait for pakistan to make such decisions and will have to treat pakistani territory as a combat zone if pakistan does not act
7731699 the capacity of the hospital to effectively isolate cdad patients was limited due to lack of suitable facilities for effective infection control practices such as appropriate bed spacing single rooms and hand wash basins
7731700 a lack of clarity and leadership in several key roles and responsibilities committee structures and lines of reporting
7731701 i have no doubt that initially people were infected because of the conditions there dirty toilets patient areas not having wash hand basins these are fundamental conditions which allow c diff to spread
7731702 we learned all this in the 19th century and its crazy these things are still going on all these deaths in a small hospital you can only explain that as there being something seriously wrong with the place
7731703 if we are successfully going to tackle hospital acquired infections we need a co ordinated approach across the whole hospital community doctors nurses cleaners managers patients and their visitors all taking action on hygiene
7731704 bugs dont stop at gretna a town on the border between scotland and england but the department for health in scotland appears to have been far more laid back than their counterparts in england
7731705 the seriousness of the problem would have been much less and the number of deaths would have been much less
7731706 scotland has one of the most comprehensive sets of policies and procedures to manage hospital acquired infections in europe
7731707 hundreds of heavily armed officers some clad in riot gear or hanging off suvs are saturating denvers streets in unprecedented numbers quickly isolating any hint of trouble that could tarnish the citys reputation under the limelight of the democratic national convention
7731708 the officers on foot horseback bicycles and motorcycles are armed with black batons and pepperball guns that resemble assault rifles and they were quick to move sunday when hundreds of rowdy protesters took to the streets of downtown
7731709 a simple belief that the american people were better than their government in washington a government that has fallen prey to special interests and policies that have left working people behind
7731710 the largest donors frequently have some of the largest business issues pending before state and federal agencies at the time lawmakers ask them to donate
7731711 lockheed martin strongly supports our nations political process and candidates that support in general national defense homeland security high technology and educational initiatives
7731712 the fact that there are nine western warships in the black sea cannot but be cause for concern they include two us warships one each from spain and poland and four from turkey
7731713 us diplomats have voiced their frustration at the terms of the subsequent ceasefire deal brokered by nicolas sarkozy frances president which they consider too vague and too favourable to the kremlin
7731714 american was arming georgia for five years and georgia tripled its military budget
7731715 that would be very dangerous it is a decision by all of nato a decision on what relations it wants with russia in the future
7731716 mother i tried please believe me im doing the best that i can im ashamed of the things ive been put through im ashamed of the person i am
7731717 everybody hates me even the people who love me hate me
7731718 really it was the epilepsy that did it he felt responsibility for the band he felt that if they went to america and he had fits on stage it would hamper their future he felt all these things become bigger and bigger in his mind
7731719 i was surprised at the enthusiastic tone of this article i was waiting for the conclusion that spending billions of dollars to search for water on mars might have been better spent cleaning up or creating water supplies for the billions of people here on earth without a safe and adequate supply
7731720 waiting for the conclusion that spending billions of dollars to search for water on mars might have been better spent cleaning up or creating water supplies for the billions of people here on earth without a safe and adequate supply
7731721 by removing any semblance of a continuous exploration sequence this weeks announcement puts the future mars program on a path toward irrelevance the budget requested is simply inadequate to complete the next steps in this remarkable exploration program
7731722 plans to prosper you and not to harm you plans to give you hope and a future
7731723 its benign have a nice life call me if anyone has too many zits
7731724 the fascist direction this country has taken should be brought to a halt and it can only be done by conscious activism by people living in this country saying we will no longer go along with the things done by the bush administration
7731725 that was a last minute change and it does present a challenge in that it came about at the last minute
7731726 its really just a matter of relying on the partnerships that were already in place using the same resources to put the event together on somewhat short notice for invesco field
7731727 the future of the next few days is unwritten but the level to which the secret service the federal government and the city of denver have already gone to interfere with the free speech rights of protestors is unprecedented
7731728 it will not look like a police state or a war zone but there will certainly be an increased presence that is just a hallmark of the necessary security
7731729 the bottom line here is that polar bears need sea ice
7731730 the sea ice is decaying and the bears are in very serious trouble for any people who are still non believers in global warming and the impacts it is having in the arctic this should answer their doubts once and for all
7731731 to find so many polar bears at sea at one time is extremely worrisome because it could be an indication that as the sea ice on which they live and hunt continues to melt many more bears may be out there facing similar risk
7731732 this turmoil is not going to go away quickly and will require serious efforts to overcome it
7731733 a year ago there was a real sense of uncertainty and confusion people were perplexed by the turmoil that had come on quite suddenly i would say the mood this year is one of greater clarity lets call it a bit more somber
7731734 the financial storm that reached gale force some weeks before our last meeting here in jackson hole has not yet subsided and its effects on the broader economy are becoming apparent
7731735 the fbi correctly diagnosed that mortgage fraud was epidemic but it did not come close to meeting its announced goal
7731736 it used everyday procedures and woefully inadequate resources to deal with an epidemic
7731737 the approach was certain to bring symbolic prosecutions and strategic defeat
7731738 we were dealing with the issue as best we could back then
7731739 persons who suffer from this unexplained skin condition report a range of cutaneous skin symptoms including crawling biting and stinging sensations granules threads fibers or black speck like materials on or beneath the skin and or skin lesions e g rashes or sores in addition to skin manifestations some sufferers also report fatigue mental confusion short term memory loss joint pain and changes in visions
7731740 to learn more about who may be affected with this condition the symptoms they experience and to look for clues about factors that might contribute to the condition
7731741 we are aware that many patients have suffered from this condition and i can tell you that here at cdc we have really been seeing an increasing number of these reports over the past year or so
7731742 all morgellons patients screened to date have tested positive for the presence of agrobacterium whereas this microorganism has not been detected in any of the samples derived from the control healthy individuals
7731743 agrobacterium may be involved in the etiology and or progression
7731744 theres almost always some history of exposure to dirt basically either from gardening or camping or something
7731745 release of these plants may also result in release of the
7731746 very few authors actually test to ensure that the antibiotics succeed
7731747 here is where the possibility of gene escape arises the presence of the disarmed agrobacterium in the tissue would not be a problem if the binary vector had been lost but now its survival and spread are real possibilities
7731748 the opportunistic and systemically moving agrobacterium vector infectious to a wide host range might eventually cause infection and damage to crop plants or natural vegetation
7731749 not presently visited by the traditional vectors of the virus disease
7731750 future research has to show whether agrobacterium mediated transformation contributed to horizontal gene transfer between microorganisms in the rhizosphere
7731751 have a ready route for horizontal gene escape via agrobacterium helped by the ordinary conjugative mechanisms of many other bacteria that cause diseases which are present in the environment
7731752 the dnc only changed the rules to hand the contest to their chosen one obama

7731780 we estimate that about 550 staff across australia and new zealand will lose their jobs
7731781 about a third will be editorial and about two thirds will be other parts of the company not specified
7731782 its one of the most significant job losses in australia this year and its obviously going to have a serious impact on the ongoing quality of the companys papers magazines and websites in australia and new zealand
7731783 weve got our fingers crossed that things will improve but there is the recognition that there is still a long way to go yet
7731784 it looks like it will drag on for some considerable time further yet
7731785 this is just a transitory period of subdued growth and we will get through the other side and the growth will resume to more normal levels
7731786 it is cautious to assume a significant proportion will fail
7731787 such a warning from the environment agency must be taken extremely seriously the failure of just one container could prove catastrophic
7731788 absence of robust arguments which demonstrate that this target is achievable in practice
7731789 that are not expected to be durable over periods of hundreds of years
7731790 it is not clear how package integrity during storage can be assured over the extended timescales now being suggested

7731810 i think when you lose long standing members that have done well thats always a challenge
7731811 whilst he put on a very brave face on the fact that his party dropped him as leader i know it was something that affected him quite significantly
7731812 it was after that that he first approached the government about the possibility of being considered for an appointment if there were any appointments appropriate to his expertise and experience
7731813 indeed both rosemary follett and terry connolly who were both labor members of the assembly were appointed by the previous liberal government to very significant roles as master of the supreme court and as the acts first human rights commissioner
7731814 i think what it highlights is that there is a role for assembly members to make a contribution beyond their political involvement

7731821 this is an open and shut case of competitive infringement anyone who was saw tonights day 1 coverage of the democratic national convention saw just how effective the proceedings were in putting tens of thousands if not millions of viewers in a deep sleep we have to go through quite a bit of screening to be able to do that they did it just by doing what comes naturally to them frankly we dont need the competition
7731822 salans opened its moscow office the same year as the moscow times was first published for the foreign community the existence of an independent english language newspaper was one of very few keys to understanding the business political and cultural life of the country and to follow the radical changes russia was going through over the years the newspaper has continued to develop its reputation as a highly regarded source of information and a forum for different points of views on the affairs of russia and its neighbors
7731823 one would assume we would have to help them rebuild because they are a partner in the war on terror theyve been helpful they are going to ask us i am sure to replace and rebuild
7731824 i think that assistance is probably going to happen its a matter of how much and how fast
7731825 we need to take a look at the strategic picture now and we need nato the european union to discuss that fact that many assumptions we have made may have changed and we need to take a hard look at this new reality
7731826 we cant let a bully do this because if they do it here theyll do it other places and if we dont stop it here well have to stop it in a much more difficult way

7732096 its too early to tell if it will intensify into a hurricane or if oil installations will be in its path
7732097 but the market is reacting to it and edging up some
7732098 lately there has been a very strong correlation between oil futures and the us dollar
7732099 showcasing the new ironkey range at infosec 2008 was always going to be special but nothing could have prepared us for the interest shown by the uk police forces
7732100 it probably was the hardest decathlon ive ever done in my life through all the extremes and weather conditions
7732101 its like when he says he is not going to do more movies and then always ends up doing them i think i am kind of in a similar situation
7732102 i have ideas other than metal gear and i want to go on to make other new games but for political business or technology reasons there is always a time when i have to return

7732110 feel an obligation to the people who sent them here
7732111 the democratic party strongly and unequivocally supports roe v wade and a womans right to choose a safe and legal abortion regardless of ability to pay and we oppose any and all efforts to weaken or undermine that right

7732115 theres a moment that you want to enjoy your bitterness
7732116 im getting a lot of calls and e mails especially from women who are quite upset that she was not vetted for vice president even though senator obama said she was on the short list
7732117 to stay wallowing in all of this is not productive
7732118 old mcdonald has a tractor and on my tractor i have a duck
7732119 show me just what mohammed brought that was new and there you will find things only evil and inhuman such as his command to spread by the sword the faith he preached
7732120 is not pleased by blood and not acting reasonably is contrary to gods nature faith is born of the soul not the body whoever would lead someone to faith needs the ability to speak well and to reason properly without violence and threats to convince a reasonable soul one does not need a strong arm or weapons of any kind or any other means of threatening a person with death
7732121 it would be easily understandable if someone became so annoyed at all these false notions that for the rest of his life he despised and mocked all talk about being but in this way he would be deprived of the truth of existence and would suffer a great loss
7732122 not to act reasonably not to act with logos is contrary to the nature of god

7732134 now you know why i asked her out so many times even though she said no

7732138 there is a lot of talk that the authorities may change the policy in october and bids are coming in heavy at 1 4180 per us dollar from those who think the singapore dollar should weaken further
7732139 who would have thought in 2004 or 2000 that a democrat would be competitive in montana or colorado

7732146 blackwell and his family have been longtime donors to the political campaigns of michelle obamas husband barack
7732147 obama sent a request on state senate letterhead urging illinois officials to provide a 50 000 tourism promotion grant to another blackwell company
7732148 to ensure that its mission and responsibility to the clients and community it serves is not harmed by any professional ownership contractual or other relationship
7732149 cms notified the corporation that it is not in compliance with certain of the medicare conditions of participation for hospitals
7732150 approximately 28 8 and 24 8 of the gross payment revenues of the corporation were derived from medicare and medicaid patients respectively as a result any termination from the medicare and medicaid programs would adversely affect the corporations financial position
7732151 with so much going their way in this election the biggest challenge the democrats face is simple the republicans just play the game of presidential politics so much better they play it with genius courage creativity and utter ruthlessness
7732152 i think i have a much higher i q than you do
7732153 she knows where are all the bodies have been buried in the past 30 or so years of chicago politics and she knows all the tricks
7732154 if obama had a political and financial godmother it would be valerie

7732156 she is preparing her final order we had an excellent discussion today the order will be issued in the next couple of days and shes asked me not to comment any further
7732157 this is high ive been on this board for 25 years this is high and that brings this all into question
7732158 the alleged disabilities and or religious tenets outlined on said applications do not exist
7732159 we found that some of those applications are tainted and thats why they were not accepted by us
7732160 the people who signed it were unsure what they were signing
7732161 this is malicious these people are using the law to harm voters
7732162 in the neighborhood i live in there are a lot of jehovahs witnesses
7732163 it was hard for me to convince them but im a christian too and i have knowledge of the bible
7732164 incapacitated to such an extent that it would be an undue hardship to vote at the polls because of illness mental or physical disability blindness or a serious impairment of mobility
7732165 he is on disability hes got liver problems hes sick hes very very sick
7732166 hes in and out he has problems he comes here he fights with his girlfriend sometimes then he comes here
7732167 a significant proportion of the voting age population is black
7732168 obama is a turnout machine and blacks will be motivated to register and get to the polls
7732169 it would indicate a big win in the electoral college rather than it being a close election in which he needs north carolina to get him over the line
7732170 just give me a sec to catch my breath before i face the next set of rapids
7732171 denial would not only be a hardship for the applicant it would be tantamount to a deprivation of all beneficial use of this property and as i indicated at the very inception of my presentation that this has been deemed a legal buildable lot by the town of narragansett for the entire tenure of ownership and has been taxed as such so for all those reasons i would certainly ask for favorable approval of the relief sought

7732173 if i had to guess im not a fire marshal and i dont check rooms for a living
7732174 brief remarks very funny he does have a way with humor
7732175 mrs mccain sincerely thanked rhode island people in the room for supporting her son
7732176 it was kind of fun to watch i know senator mccain is fond of rhode island and she expressed that
7732177 we had a goal and we met it both candidates pledged to be part
7732178 but barack obama has broken his pledge and is raising gazillions of dollars
7732179 think about it mitt romney ran against john mccain romney did not win governor carcieri supported mitt romney then carcieri hosted tonight and it was very well received i think that is testament to what is happening to the republican party the question mark lies with the hillary camp and the democrats incompatibility this week in denver
7732180 racism lynchings disenfranchisement black codes and racial segregation laws that imposed a rigid system of officially sanctioned racial segregation in virtually all areas of life
7732181 whereas the story of the enslavement and de jure segregation of african americans and the dehumanizing atrocities committed against them should not be purged from or minimized in the telling of american history
7732182 whereas an apology for centuries of brutal dehumanization and injustices cannot erase the past but confession of the wrongs committed can speed racial healing and reconciliation and help americans confront the ghosts of their past
7732183 jesse jackson won south carolina in 84 and 88 jackson ran a good campaign and obama ran a good campaign here
7732184 we know what kind of campaign theyre going to run theyre going to try to make you afraid

7732186 barack hes talking down to black people telling n s how to behave
7732187 if you look at folks of color even women theyre more successful in the democratic party than they are in the white uh excuse me in the republican party
7732188 i can plainly see in your eyes that you want to know how do i take advantage of this incredible opportunity how do i make sure new orleans is not overrun with mexicans
7732189 quite simply rep cohen will have to accept what the rest of the country will have to accept there has been an unofficial congressional white caucus for over 200 years and now its our turn to say who can join the club he does not and cannot meet the membership criteria unless he can change his skin color primarily we are concerned with the needs and concerns of the black population and we will not allow white america to infringe on those objectives
7732190 we will have to go after a millage to develop properties in this area
7732191 hey honey can you guys make a bentons old fashioned
7732192 i make a great old fashioned but i have to admit i dont know what a bentons is and i dont get stumped very often
7732193 and youre just the guys to give it to me
7732194 we had it on the lower east side a few weeks ago at this place called pdt but we couldnt get in tonight
7732195 yeah alphabet city is part of the east village the lower east side is below houston
7732196 when you got encouragement regarding your speaking skills from a teacher you respected
7732197 michael sells himself every time something goes really well for michael moore on a personal fame or back account level things get worst and worst in the country
7732198 this is the most personal and most disturbing film i have made i knew aileen over the course of 12 years and the barbaric nature of her death had a profound effect on me and months of nightmares it was one film i didnt choose to make i came to it as a witness and ended up attending an execution the violence of taking a life remains the same whether it is legally sanctioned or not it introduces murder into our vocabulary of behavior
7732199 is it rude to suggest that when the bush family wakes up in the morning they might be thinking about whats best for the saudis instead of whats best for you or me coz 1 4 billion doesnt just buy a lot of flights out of the country it buys a lot of love
7732200 what in the world is wrong with george he got us out here for nothing whatsoever i really hope they do not re elect that fool honestly
7732201 he bush went to sleep that night on a bed made with fine french linen
7732202 not really true but heres his private office line 202 225 2536
7732203 not knowing what to do with no one telling him what to do and no secret service rushing in to take him to safety mr bush just sat there and continued to read my pet goat with the children
7732204 was he thinking ive been hanging out with the wrong crowd
7732205 like many guinness records it looks silly but it actually requires a lot of concentration technique and fitness and it can be painful too
7732206 thirty eight percent of the country is a type o donor but nine percent will be type o negative so right there you have half of the country that is a type o donor
7732207 there have been miscommunication people still think you can get aids from donating blood and that is just not true all of the stuff that we use in the donation process is single use sterile equipment we use it once and throw it away
7732208 most everyone does not like to get stuck with the needle but the main thing is the cause of what they are doing for we try to make that process as painless as possible
7732209 for the most part if they follow through with good hydration and they eat well its not bad but its a crunch in the summer time we dont have as many donors people are out on vacation schools are out and we need donors
7732210 tobys internal monologue about doing what one needs to has inspired the artist in me now im off to create a bowel movement
7732211 oh crap ian is tobys husband ive only been half paying attention to this storyline and assumed he was a senile uncle or perhaps an old man she sees at the bus stop occasionally and feels sorry for thank god this is mary worth or this union might have actually been consummated
7732212 what the hell is she talking about life is short shes a character in rex morgan every day takes a minimum of three months she got to rexs office early and has been there maybe an hour and thats taken at least a week
7732213 by the way i think grandpa jim is faking it boxcars that mans got the right idea i predict uncle phil and several others will follow his lead and soon be having sudden attacks and flare ups excusing themselves from this ritualistic eye poison
7732214 there isnt really any hd programming for the hispanic audience and we felt it was important to deliver hd content to them
7732215 we were the first to deliver original programming in english for the hispanic audience and we felt it was important to be the first to deliver high def programming
7732216 economic wherewithal to enjoy hd programming in the acculturated community which is about 60 of the hispanic market the household incomes are higher than spanish dominant homes they are reasonably affluent and have a great number of hdtvs the disappointing thing is that this audience is so underserved with hd content
7732217 we were in the desert carrying on the obama message
7732218 i think obama is an authentic 21st century reflection of the potential of americas diversity
7732219 it tells us that america came from the civil rights era to a new era
7732220 if i can win here in utah virginia is not a problem for obama north carolina is not a problem
7732221 we are finding hispanic families in places weve never before found hispanics
7732222 he was a physician in his home country and came here before katrina at an older age too late to go to medical school hes been working in a warehouse doing inventory
7732223 how do i make sure that new orleans is not overrun by mexican workers
7732224 the change that we had in new orleans was tremendous and anytime you have change you have friction
7732225 i think the fact that we are at the table is a sign that the city and other governmental entities are paying more attention to the latino community
7732226 in general the community has appreciated the contributions latinos and other immigrant groups have made post katrina
7732227 this has always been a melting pot this city has always welcomed immigrants from our very beginning 300 years ago
7732228 when the mayor made that statement there were hundreds of illegal aliens here being ill housed ill fed
7732229 his concern was we want to make sure that these people are taken care of
7732230 this year is exceptional because there is so much diversity said pereira a native of honduras who heads the miami based center for immigrant orientation this change is exciting because it will bring a diversity to political power
7732231 if the news is that important it will find me
7732232 you can bring it back and can call it improved just bring it back

7732237 were looking forward to presenting the findings and policy recommendations to the camps of both republican and democratic candidates as well as to key members of congress and other policy makers in september
7732238 a stronger latino community means a stronger nation as a whole its time to take the next step from diagnosis to action
7732239 the state of latinos 2008 defining an agenda for the future
7732240 we are proud of the latino center and pleased they are engaged in this important work with fundacion azteca america in an attempt to address one of the great issues of the day
7732241 estou aqui como uma esposa que ama o marido e acredita que ele ser um l der extraordin rio
7732242 barack e eu crescemos com muitos valores iguais como voc que trabalha duro para o que quer para sua vida
7732243 garantir um futuro melhor para suas filhas e todas as crian as as duas filhas do casal sasha e malia subiram ao palco com a m e ap s o discurso
7732244 o que me deixou pensando da primeira vez que eu conheci barack foi que mesmo com esse nome engra ado e com o fato dele ter crescido no havai sua fam lia era muito parecida com a minha os av s deles eram da classe trabalhadora como meus pais e a m e dele era solteira e lutava para pagar as contas como em nossa fam lia
7732245 barack e eu constru mos nossas vidas guiados por esses valores e passamos eles para a pr xima gera o

7732253 betel i stopped reading when this was at the top of the page
7732254 i dont give a rats ass how you and your ilk choose to denigrate bush say what you want about him
7732255 i just wish youd even emote a modicum of excersized outrage when your party does the exact same thing
7732256 and those are any worse than the watered down versions of obama criticisms how
7732257 and those are racist when directed at george bush how
7732258 programs like education and others should be turned back to the states and local communities with the tax sources to fund them
7732259 restore to states and local governments the power that properly belongs to them
7732260 and those are any worse than the watered down versions of obama criticisms how
7732261 furthermore how in the hell is calling obama an aa candidate based upon his pathetic resume more racist than calling clarence thomas the exact same thing or worse
7732262 betel and null i read enough to get the jist and i dont care
7732263 philadelphia was the scene of the june 21 1964 murder of civil rights workers james chaney andrew goodman and michael schwerner
7732264 programs like education and others should be turned back to the states and local communities with the tax sources to fund them
7732265 restore to states and local governments the power that properly belongs to them
7732266 great now we get a tribute to a guy who killed a woman
7732267 either one has the smarts to pass entry requirements or they dont
7732268 how am i going to write this essay i am an american i didnt grow up as a hispanic nor did my parents i am 2 generations removed from all of this
7732269 as long as you would have the same disdain for someone who was a member of the kkk
7732270 sorry i killed your sons and daughters because i didnt plan for trouble
7732271 and i was stone cold sober when i did it
7732272 i met him in hawaii and even though he was married with kids we fell in love carried on a 9 month affair behind the scenes and married when he was divorced im so happy my grandfather was a bootlegger who left me a vast fortune and that charles keating a man my husband loves mentored and financed him into politics i apologize to carol for being the woman who wrecked his home but thank the reagans for taking her in well even though they were pissed at john for leaving her
7732273 my son was a meandering drunk but got his life together in time to run for governor of texas thank god we were tired of bailing him out of trouble

7732282 interestingly one group that over consumes the mini packs is chronic dieters individuals constantly trying to manage their weight and food intake
7732283 on the one hand consumers perceive the mini packs to be a generous portion of food numerous small food morsels in each pack and multiple mini packs in each box on the other hand consumers perceive the mini packs to be diet food for chronic dieters this perceptual dilemma causes a tendency to overeat due to their emotion laden relationship with food
7732284 wow im not going to have to come work out here every night now
7732285 last week u s and iraqi officials said the two sides had agreed tentatively to a schedule which included a broad pullout of combat forces by the end of 2011 with a residual u s force remaining behind to continue training and advising the iraqi security forces
7732286 i thought it was kinda dumb the first time i saw it
7732287 i didnt even want to try it but a friend told me it had ozzy osbournes bark at the moon in it so i gave it a try
7732288 i was just in for the free trip to boston
7732289 if wed stayed home on vacation i wouldnt be here i never felt it coming on to be honest i thought it was heartburn
7732290 every time i look at my grandchildrens faces i think of everyone on this beach
7732291 these people you dont realize what they really do im only 47 years old i had a long way to go
7732292 we just kept working on him trying to bring him back
7732293 we were not all on the same side as democrats but we are now
7732294 i know this is not coming from barack obama but his supporters are helping us decide who to vote for
7732295 i hate the feeling that you shouldnt wear your hillary gear unless there are two or three of you together
7732296 hopefully we can see something that will allow us to concentrate on one particular area to dig
7732297 its premature to say that it was a valid threat or that these folks have the ability to carry it out
7732298 going to shoot obama from a high vantage point using a rifle sighted at 750 yards
7732299 im just impressed with his nature his seriousness about his job and his ability to reach out to people
7732300 i think gov patrick is entirely focused on massachusetts and getting the job done as governor
7732301 but i think its appropriate that people are interested in him because hes an interesting fellow and a good leader
7732302 hes an up and coming national political figure who does things differently than theyve been done in the past
7732303 i think deval patrick has served as a model nationally
7732304 we want our children and all children in this nation to know that the only limit to the height of your achievements is the reach of your dreams and your willingness to work for them
7732305 that you work hard for what you want in life that your word is your bond and you do what you say youre going to do that you treat people with dignity and respect even if you dont know them and even if you dont agree with them
7732306 barack and i set out to build lives guided by these values and pass them on to the next generation
7732307 a great american story modest means but big dreams and encouragement from loving parents
7732308 i come here as a mom whose girls are the heart of my heart and the center of my world theyre the first thing i think about when i wake up in the morning and the last thing i think about when i go to bed at night
7732309 a father who was a blue collar city worker and a mother who stayed at home with my brother and me
7732310 i was at the intersection at neponset circle on my motorcycle i was coming up to traffic and i saw a bike go up over the neponset bridge i knew something was wrong
7732311 i made my way through the traffic i must have been about two minutes behind him
7732312 i went to come up over the bridge and saw headlights coming toward me as i got closer i realized it was a vehicle that had stopped on the wrong side of the road
7732313 the front end had been smashed in and the airbag had been deployed i saw a woman standing there and i slowed down to see if she was ok i then saw this bike on the road in pieces and saw this guy lying on the ground
7732314 there were about four or five people around him one woman had a blanket on his leg they were waving for help
7732315 i pulled over and ran over to him i told him to keep talking and asked him his name he said his name was mark i looked to the woman who was holding the towel or blanket on his left thigh
7732316 he kept asking me to save his leg that his leg hurt i asked the woman if there was anything under the blanket and she just shook her head
7732317 i went to take my belt off to make a tourniquet and noticed he was wearing a belt so i pulled his belt off and tied it around his left thigh about four or five inches down
7732318 i just kept talking to him to stop him slipping away i must have been holding the tourniquet for about 10 minutes when the ems guys showed up i didnt want to let go until they arrived i gave them a run down on what i had done and then they took control of the situation
7732319 his leg was cut off just above the knee i knew what to do to treat such a traumatic injury was like second nature to me because i have had to do them for soldiers
7732320 im just glad he is ok i remember he kept asking me to save his leg
7732321 the woman from the car i dont think she had any idea of how serious it was
7732322 she was standing right there with a big smile on her face when the police were putting her in the cruiser
7732323 would have died due to the femoral artery being cut
7732324 im just glad hes ok i hope someone would do the same for me
7732325 if it wasnt for him my husband would be dead its a miracle that he arrived when he did i cant ever express my thanks enough to this man
7732326 theres almost a den mother side of janice that were not used to seeing

7732340 piracy is the way to get established and get your name out theres no way to stop it so were using it to our advantage
7732341 its this really gritty tacky sleazy jungle music its just genius
7732342 its making it possible for every kid in brazil to know their songs by the time they turn five
7732343 its actually good for a lot of money you give it away and it will come back thats literally true with information not with property
7732344 this year the multinational record labels will only release about 40 records by brazilian artists while tecnobrega artists will release around 400
7732345 the record industry argues if intellectual property isnt protected there will be no innovation but tecnobrega has shown thats not true
7732346 piracy in brazil is undermining the ability of the music and film industries to invest in the next generation of local talent lower revenues from current sales mean less money to invest in new artists
7732347 before you couldnt get your record played on the radio if you couldnt afford payola now if a song hits big with the aparelhagens the radio has no choice but to play it
7732348 the rub comes when mobile carriers and mobile game publishers start charging consumers for a mobile game
7732349 compared with other mobile categories such as messaging and music the paid download market for mobile games lags far behind
7732350 mobile carriers especially those in the us are blamed for offering games to consumers in closed walled garden environments that stifle choice by repeatedly presenting the same genres and titles
7732351 the us will never become a gigantic mobile game market on par with india and china with their huge populations or japan with its fanatical gaming user base but the us mobile gaming market does exist in the worlds largest interactive advertising economy
7732352 that combined with advanced handsets and an increase in unlimited mobile data plans could cause marketers to look at us mobile gaming in a new light
7732353 me gustan las altas y las chaparritas las flacas las gordas y las chiquititas solteras y viudas y divorciaditas me encantan las chatas de caras bonitas
7732354 the technology is already going beyond the commerce and trade transaction worlds
7732355 consider that our flash based ssd line just came online in early 2007 and oems are already pulling it in
7732356 one of the most respected and prolific international pop stars
7732357 we have entered an era of empowered individuals who can dictate the content they receive and deliver
7732358 georgia will become a member of nato if it wants to and it does want to
7732359 were the us or nato to get involved militarily in a war against russia we would take the position of revolutionary defeat for both imperialist camps and call on the russian and american working class to turn the imperialist war into a civil war against their own bourgeoisie however since in reality the us cannot afford another military front such a situation did not materialize
7732360 let us assume that rebellion breaks out tomorrow in the french colony of algeria under the banner of national independence and that the italian government motivated by its own imperialist interests prepares to send weapons to the rebels what should the attitude of the italian workers be in this case i have purposely taken an example of rebellion against a democratic imperialism with intervention on the side of the rebels from a fascist imperialism should the italian workers prevent the shipping of arms to the algerians let any ultra leftists dare answer this question in the affirmative every revolutionist together with the italian workers and the rebellious algerians would spurn such an answer with indignation even if a general maritime strike broke out in fascist italy at the same time even in this case the strikers should make an exception in favor of those ships carrying aid to the colonial slaves in revolt otherwise they would be no more than wretched trade unionists not proletarian revolutionists
7732361 that russia is clearly extracting huge super profits from its oil interests in what are now the formally independent nations in central asia
7732362 living marxism since the demise of that magazine and the shift of its prominent writers to the ejournal spiked the material basis of imperialism which is capital export has disappeared and re emerged as the kautskyite wrong policies
7732363 lenin thought so in 1917 when the tsar was overthrown even though its imperialism didnt really match up to the definition of imperialism as the export of capital he developed
7732364 thus owing to the formation of capitalist monopolies the merging of bank and industrial capital has also made enormous strides in russia
7732365 does china today meet these criteria as yet it doesnt appear so
7732366 lenin thought so in 1917 when the tsar was overthrown even though its imperialism didnt really match up to the definition of imperialism as the export of capital he developed
7732367 thus owing to the formation of capitalist monopolies the merging of bank and industrial capital has also made enormous strides in russia
7732368 we consider that the cuban revolution made three fundamental contributions to the laws of the revolutionary movement in the current situation in america first peoples forces can win a war against the army second one need not always wait for all conditions favorable to revolution to be present the insurrection itself can create them third in the underdeveloped parts of america the battleground for armed struggle should in the main be the countryside
7732369 many army chiefs in the different regions and their general staffs wanted to converse with me wherever i was and showed considerable interest in issues related to our war of liberation and the experience of the missile crisis in 1962 the meetings which lasted hours would be held in the early morning which was the only time i had available i would agree to these to help allende to familiarize them with the idea that socialism was not an enemy of armed institutions pinochet as a military leader was not an exception allende considered those meetings useful
7732370 there was a huge difference between the por and bolsheviks the bolsheviks demanded of the soviets that they should give no class support to the bourgeois democratic reformist coalition government and that instead they should break with the bourgeoisie and take all power in their own hands the por in contrast gave critical support to the bourgeois government and asked to be given ministerial posts while the bolsheviks attacked the mensheviks and the srs without pity seeking to remove them from leadership positions the por identified itself with the labour bureaucracy for whom they drafted speeches and ministerial plans and sought to transform the bourgeois party and its government the bolshevik strategy was to make a new revolution while that of the por was to reform the mnr and its government in short while bolshevism was leninist the por was lech nist the 1952 revolution how the 4th international and the por betrayed the revolution which in june lucha obrera maintained that the mnr should thank the por for helping it achieve power and for its support its task would now be to put pressure on the mnr to carry out reforms which would benefit the working and middle classes
7732371 never before had a party like the mnr that can count on uniform backing from an armed people and proletariat achieved power and never therefore did anyone have the opportunity of adopting measures with a real revolutionary content the government has closed its eyes or has not wanted to see the magnificent opportunity and has preferred to deceive the proletariat which supported it unconditionally
7732372 demand that the worker ministers elected and controlled by the miners federation and the new workers centre are taken into the paz estenssoro government
7732373 the two wings which now exist within the mnr express the interests of the proletariat and the bourgeoisie
7732374 development support and strengthening of a left wing inside the mnr
7732375 hes one of the few really authentic brave principled lawmakers you always know where he stands hes not fearful and that is so rare these days we need more like him
7732376 i know hes had a tough time with his health lately and my heart goes out to him along with my best wishes and my prayers
7732377 hes been a champion of social causes for all these years a great senator and i wish him all the best
7732378 to celebrate him one of the greatest progressive politicians in history during this historic convention when theres this really extraordinary shift in the country that is the way to kick this convention off
7732379 his whole family has been so important to this country
7732380 and id much rather be judged by someone whos slipped and fallen so were not here to talk about someone who got drunk and got into a car accident because there but for the grace of god and all that
7732381 but hopefully when we finally lay our head on that pillow and exhale and let go of this life we can say ive lived a good life ive been a good person
7732382 and i believe that when ted kennedy does finally exhale he will do it with joy and the knowledge that hes lived a good life and was a very good senator for massachusetts
7732383 its very hard not to think about the olympic games
7732384 very difficult to refocus i mean all my thinking is there in beijing
7732385 in russia if you stop anyone in the street and ask what is a grand slam i dont think many people can tell you but everyone knows the olympic games there is nothing bigger
7732386 people just come to me and say oh im happy for you
7732387 i dont know what is best to be a little bit tired but very comfortable and very positive or to be fresh and not play in the olympic games

7732391 the victory of hamas in gaza and the questions facing israeli and palestinian workers
7732392 it is amazing to see how the imperialists have understood far better than most people on the left what lies at the heart of the present conflict not a mere power struggle between two equally reactionary forces but a decisive battle between imperialism and the palestinian people the bourgeoisie in israel is now hysterical and for a good reason although the victory of hamas in gaza does not solve any of the fundamental problems of the palestinian masses this was clearly a severe blow against imperialism it is clear then that the question at hand is not the leadership of either side but the class forces supporting them
7732393 hamas is a populist reactionary movement whose leadership not long ago had announced its willingness to negotiate with the usa and britain
7732394 that is why we cannot join the hue and cry of the sectarian and petit bourgeois left
7732395 the main problem facing the palestinian masses now is that the de facto break up of the pa into two farcical states will not change the fundamental nightmare situation they are living in hamas does not have any real alternative to offer to capitalist exploitation hardly compensated by hamas islamic charity institutions upon which a growing layer of the population of gaza depends in order to survive even the temporary relief granted by the effect of the victory of hamas upon the powerful rival clans and organisations cannot last for very long
7732396 for these reasons we do not give the fundamentalists any political support hamas is a populist movement it built its support on the one hand on the betrayal of the nationalists and on the other on the betrayal of the left and its sell out to the plo and fatah and we should always keep firmly in mind that hamas does not want to overthrow capitalism they merely wish for banks and monopolies with islamic names if they follow the same path of making deals with the imperialist powers which at a certain stage will be inevitable its leadership will be exposed as just another group of bourgeois politicians no better than fatah especially should they attempt to set up a regime in their image to assert their domination this in the long run is the only possibility in palestine where the ruling class is extremely weak and lacks any popular base
7732397 their argument as we have already said is that since both fatah and hamas are reactionary bourgeois movements there is no reason to differentiate between them we have already demonstrated why the refusal to differentiate between the downtrodden masses that support and fight under the leadership of hamas and the rotten fatah leadership is nonsensical and irresponsible from a class perspective now we shall elaborate on the philosophical postulates underlying it
7732398 those who stand together with the masses in the struggle and support them have the credibility needed to present their criticism of the leadership those who stand aside and refuse to support the masses will never be taken seriously nor should they be this as we have already mentioned is merely the ultimate fate of sectarianism
7732399 i said the stalinophobe cliffites saw the counter revolution as complete in 1929 and the lrp and yourself 1939
7732400 stalinophobe cliffites saw the counter revolution as complete in 1929 and the lrp and yourself 1939
7732401 you churchill take this part of the world and i stalin will give you this part of the world
7732402 from a scratch to gangrene they were tolerated inside the swp for a period while the debate went on but when they refused to defend the su unconditionally they crossed the class line that class line was crossed in 1939 as for hungary cuba china etc etc why isnt it obvious to you that my position in all of these cases flows directly from trotskys position on poland finland ukraine etc i said that none of these revolutions could have expropriated capitalist property and survived without the existence of workers property in the su trotsky did not say that in poland we should abandon marxism to stalinism and petty bourgeois nationalists did he no more in these other countries no he said while we dont have the power to overthrow the bureaucracy yet we defend the bourgeois property expropriated by the bonapartists even though this is a defeat for workers because in relation to that the defence of workers property it is a lesser defeat but at the same time we must prepare for the political revolution and in every case we subordinate this defence to the world revolution because without the socialist revolution in the imperialist countries political revolution in the dwss will hardlly succeed that is why i said that we
7732403 when he knew that there was going to be an aggression by israel against lebanon he automatically went out to defend his country
7732404 he fought for 29 days and was captured four days before the end of the war
7732405 however clumsy i am in expressing my points about the su i assure you again and again that i do not intend to deviate from trotsky before his death as i think that his method and analysis is vindicated right up to the present you on the other hand are deviating claiming that the su was different to what trotsky thought while lhe was alive you need to explain why he was wrong and in the context of the arguments he made at the time against those who raised the same objections as you
7732406 as far back as 1927 trotsky in reply to a disloyal question put to him in the political bureau by stalin stated his views as follows for the socialist fatherland yes for the stalinist regime no that was in 1927 now twenty three years later stalin has left nothing of the socialist fatherland it has been replaced by the enslavement and degradation of the people by the stalinist autocracy this is the state you propose to defend in the war which you are already defending in korea
7732407 enslavement and degradation of the people by the stalinist autocracy
7732408 spanish revolutionary grandizo munis who had led the spanish seccion bolchevique leninista during the revolutionary events in the 1930s under his influence she came to adopt the position that the ussr was a state capitalist society and that the fourth international founded by trotsky no longer held to the revolutionary programme of communism
7732409 its regarded as being the final chapter of the 2006 war
7732410 the israelis certainly lost that war they did not get their prisoners back not until now and theyre getting them back dead so more than 1 000 lebanese civilians and more than 160 israelis most of them soldiers all died for absolutely nothing and thats what these prisoner exchanges prove
7732411 this time yesterday i was in the hands of the enemy but at this moment i am yearning more than before to confront them
7732412 but why reject the su as a workers state only from 1939 if as you say support for a workers state depends on it developing the force of production ahead of capitalism why even support the 1917 revolution this was after all the position of the right and centre of the 2nd international
7732413 it must be the social relations of production that decide if a workers state exists or not as i already pointed out this was trotskys view at the time of his death the social relations of the ussr must be unconditionally defended despite what he termed the fascism of the stalinist regime
7732414 not trotskys opinion that the su would become socialist or capitalist as the result of ww2
7732415 what do you think was exactly the mode of production of the ussr capitalism is a mode of production based on the exploitation of the working class and the central law of this system is the law of value lenin defined a workers state as a capitalist state without the bourgeois the ussr was based on the exploitation of the working class the main law in operation was the law of value if before the social counter revolution when it was a workers state the working class was self exploited for the socialist future under the stalinist counter revolution the working class was exploited by the bureaucratic capitalist class to accumulate national capital if during the time of a workers state the law of value was deformed in favor of the working class the deformations than after were in favor of accumulation of state capital abused by the stalinist bureaucracy i fail to understand why do you think that these relationship of productions were other than capitalists the stalinist industrialization was a night mare for the working class and it included a fascistic regime including slave labor camps was trotsky alive he would decided as he wrote that the working class lost the struggle in the ussr and the capitalist counter revolution won we know it from natalie letter of resignation from the fi in 1953 as result of the leadership tailing counter revolutionary forces
7732416 further more in your argument that we have a similar argument to social democracy you are proving once again that you are confusing state and regime not only this but you are making up an argument foreign to marxism workers states are more progressive than capitalism but not for you the tasks of workers state is to complete the accumulation and centralization of capital that the capitalists in this epoch of decay can not do any more and this is what makes them a reactionary class for you a workers state is an abstract moralist question as i wrote to you already i do not see dialectical materialism in your arguments
7732417 i already spoke of cuba by extension all the other national revolutions that were forced to go further than the petty bougeois leaders intended and expropriate the bourgeoisie did so because of the refusal of imperialism and the national bourgeoisie to form popular front governments with them in the post war bipolar world in every case i dont know about tito these petty bourgeois leaders sought to make peace with imperialism but imperialism refused we have to ask why imperialism refused the answer is yalta and the imperialists fear of the power of workers property in the su when imperialism refused these national revolutions were thrown into the arms of the ussr nowhere do we say that these regimes are healthy workers states rather they were deformed at birth because their reliance on the su meant that the workers in these countries did not control the economy
7732418 the fact that the cliffites and lrp would not have defended workers property in the su and by extension any of the dwss that emerged in the post ww2 period is exactly what trotsky meant when he said that if you cant defend this what can you defend
7732419 yes lenin did say that the su was a bourgeois state without the bourgeoisie but that is not the same thing as saying it was a cmp he also said it was state capitalist but that the workers controlled the state
7732420 the first premise of all human history is of course the existence of living human individuals thus the first fact to be established is the physical organisation of these individuals and their consequent relation to the rest of nature
7732421 men can be distinguished from animals by consciousness by religion or anything else you like
7732422 the way in which men produce their means of subsistence depends first of all on the nature of the actual means of subsistence they find in existence and have to reproduce
7732423 starts from the principle that the political conditions are the decisive cause of the economic situation and that the reverse relationship represents only a reaction of a second order so long as the political grouping is not taken for its own sake as the starting point but is treated merely as a stomach filling agency one must have a portion of reaction stowed away in ones mind however radical a socialist and revolutionary one may seem to be
7732424 on the basis of this new situation the prospect of a us attack on iran receded
7732425 my fellow democrats my fellow americans it is so wonderful to be here
7732426 ich bin hier um meinen respekt f r zwei m nner zum ausdruck zu bringen die mein leben ver ndert haben barack obama and edward m kennedy ihre geschichten sind unterschiedlich aber sie teilen ein bekenntnis zu den zeitlosen amerikanischen idealen
7732427 dari aceh inilah banyak orang tekun berusaha menerjemahkan bahasa bahasa dari arab india parsi sehingga semakin matang menjadi sastra yang tinggi hal itu pertama kali terjadi pada masa hamzah fansyuri
7732428 wow obama is going to cream this guy in november
7732429 one item which is essential to my vacation mentality is the collapsible portable coozies
7732430 when our european reactionaries in their immediately coming flight across asia finally come up against the great wall of china who knows whether they will not find on the gates which lead to the home of ancient reaction and ancient conservatism the inscription chinese republic liberty equality fraternity
7732431 the merchants of shanghai have adopted revolutionary methods they have overwhelming courage to take charge of national affairs
7732432 again the popular front theory was proven wrong but only because by this time the peasants and workers were mobilized to take power and not to hand it back to the bourgeoisie the leading sectors of the chinese bourgeoisie abandoned the revolution since it would not allow them to profit from a comprador relationship with imperialism some other sectors made an alliance with the ccp mao was then forced to expropriate bourgeois property but at the same time refuse to allow the workers and peasant base to administer the dictatorship of the proletariat
7732433 concerning that paragraph you quote it probably needs to be rewritten but it is not claiming that the workers and peasants were mobilized by the maoists to make the socialist revolution they were mobilized by the bureaucracy in the pla against imperialism
7732434 the grim experience of the civil war demonstrated to us the necessity of disarming peasant detachments immediately after the red army occupied provinces which had been cleared of the white guards in these cases the best the most class conscious and disciplined elements were absorbed into the ranks of the red army but a considerable portion of the partisans strived to maintain an independent existence and often came into direct armed conflict with the soviet power such was the case with the anarchist army of makhno entirely kulak in spirit but that was not the sole instance many peasant detachments which fought splendidly enough against the restoration of the landlords became transformed after victory into instruments of counter revolution regardless of their origin in each isolated instance whether caused by conscious provocation of the white guards or by tactlessness of the communists or by an unfavourable combination of circumstances the conflicts between armed peasants and workers were rooted in one and the same social soil the difference between the class position and training of the workers and of the peasants the worker approaches questions from the socialist standpoint the peasants viewpoint is petty bourgeois the worker strives to socialize the property that is taken away from the exploiters the peasant seeks to divide it up the worker desires to put palaces and parks to common use the peasant insofar as he cannot divide them inclines to burning the palaces and cutting down the parks the worker strives to solve problems on a national scale and in accordance with a plan the peasant on the other hand approaches all problems on a local scale and takes a hostile attitude to centralized planning etc
7732435 we will arouse and organize the advanced workers and through the workers we shall arouse the peasants
7732436 my remark that the kremlin with its bureaucratic methods gave an impulse to the socialist revolution in poland is converted by shachtman into an assertion that in my opinion a bureaucratic revolution of the proletariat is presumably possible this is not only incorrect but disloyal my expression was rigidly limited it is not the question of bureaucratic revolution but only a bureaucratic impulse to deny this impulse is to deny reality the popular masses in western ukraine and byelo russia in any event felt this impulse understood its meaning and used it to accomplish a drastic overturn in property relations a revolutionary party which failed to notice this impulse in time and refused to utilize it would be fit for nothing but the ash can
7732437 the stalinist press is filled with communications about a soviet government established in vast provinces of china under the protection of a red army
7732438 despite the scanty information which reaches us from the vast areas of china our marxist understanding of the developing process enables us to reject with certainty the stalinist view of the current events it is false and extremely dangerous for the further development of the revolution
7732439 when the stalinists talk about a soviet government established by the peasants in a substantial part of china the not only reveal their credulity and superficiality they obscure and misrepresent the fundamental problem of the chinese revolution
7732440 prime minister ehud olmert said he was pleased with the measures and with the negotiations with syria he predicted that israels talks with damascus will soon cause syria to come into conflict with hezbollah and iran olmert said that when syria reaches that crossroad it will have to decide which direction to pursue
7732441 senior officials in jerusalem confirmed monday that syria has carried out a number of measures in recent weeks that reflect that it is taking talks with israel seriously the sources refused to say whether they were referring to such measures as lowering the alert levels of the syrian army or stemming the flow of arms to hezbollah in lebanon through its territory but they did say that the effects of the measures were tangible
7732442 lets sit down make peace and end this war status once and for all
7732443 sorry we are not ready to expropriate the bourgeosie yet we do not agree that the bureaucracy do it either because we dont agree that they can defend workers property by their counter revolutionary methods if the bourgeoisie are to be expropriated and workers property defended against imperialisim then we have to wait until we are ready
7732444 sorry this is not how trotsky said it should happen writing in the early 1930s first we have to win over the poor peasants and expose the rich peasants and then make a permanent revolution
7732445 the moment was apt for business so i said let us settle about our affairs in the balkans your armies are in rou mania and bulgaria we have interests missions and agents there dont let us get at cross purposes in small ways so far as britain and russia are concerned how would it do for you to have 90 per cent predominance in roumania for us to have 90 per cent of the say in greece and go 50 50 about yugoslavia while this was being translated i wrote on a half sheet of paper roumania russia 90 the others 10 greece great britain 90 russia 10 yugoslavia 50 50 hungary 50 50 bulgaria russia 75 the others 25 i pushed this across to stalin who had by then heard the translation there was a slight pause then he took his pencil and made a large tick upon it and passed it back to us it was all settled in no more time than it takes to set down after this there was a long silence the pencilled paper lay on the centre of the table at length i said might it not be thought rather cynical if it seemed we had disposed of these issues so fateful to millions of people in such an off hand manner let us burn the paper no you keep it said stalin
7732446 while you keep arguing that the red army was the vanguard of the working class
7732447 did trotsky or the polish leninist bolsheviks claimed like you that the stalinists will transformed the polish capitalist state into a workers state trotsky is dead and can not defend himself against this monstrous slander and the attempt to destroy his revolutionary work against the stalinist counter revolution
7732448 than according to your scheme very peacefully from above without the repressed and exploited working class the stalinist transferred the capitalist state to a workers state this is pure reformist theory that kautsky would recognized as its own
7732449 too bad we cannot bloc with the stalinists to defend workers property because they are objects of intense hatred to western liberals who never fought to win workers property in the first place and so dont care about its defence
7732450 to support them as the rope support the hanged man
7732451 you havent had a meeting with the rank and file of the militant group or with the rank and file of the rsl
7732452 this is a scandal here is our guest comrade from the united states and he is being treated shamefully
7732453 even if comrade trotsky himself had come here we would have acted no differently
7732454 the militant group in the past six months had suffered from an unfortunate split led by lee which resulted in the creation of another group without any principled grounds for the split the workers international news
7732455 we carried on a strong crusade against irresponsible splits and made it clear that the international conference would do away with the possibility of a multiplicity of groups and recognise only one section in each country
7732456 the lee group consists of about thirty mostly youngsters who have been deeply poisoned with personal antagonism to the leadership of the militant group
7732457 shachtman during his visit in england also had a session with this group
7732458 that they are being led on a path of unprincipled clique politics which can only land them in the mire it is possible to maintain and develop a revolutionary political grouping of serious importance only on the basis of great principles it is possible for a national group to maintain a constant revolutionary course only if it is firmly connected in one organisation with co thinkers throughout the world and maintains a constant political and theoretical collaboration with them the fourth international alone is such an organisation all purely national groupings all those who reject international organisation control and discipline are in their essence reactionary
7732459 long live the eighth army because that is our army one of our comrades has spoken to a number of people who have had letters from the eighth army soldiers showing their complete dissatisfaction we know of incidents in the army navy and other forces that have never been reported and it is impossible for us to report it is our eighth army that is being hammered and tested and being organised for the purpose of changing the face of the world this applies equally to all the forces
7732460 what is really in store is not unbounded prosperity but a short lived boom in the wake of the boom must come another crisis and depression which will make the 1929 32 conditions look prosperous by comparison
7732461 we will continue until we have sufficient proof to the contrary to consider as absurd the theories of a degenerated workers state being installed in a country where there has been previously been a proletarian revolution
7732462 yugoslav communists let us unite our efforts for a new leninist international
7732463 the grim experience of the civil war demonstrated to us the necessity of disarming peasant detachments immediately after the red army occupied provinces which had been cleared of the white guards in these cases the best the most class conscious and disciplined elements were absorbed into the ranks of the red army but a considerable portion of the partisans strived to maintain an independent existence and often came into direct armed conflict with the soviet power such was the case with the anarchist army of makhno entirely kulak in spirit but that was not the sole instance many peasant detachments which fought splendidly enough against the restoration of the landlords became transformed after victory into instruments of counter revolution regardless of their origin in each isolated instance whether caused by conscious provocation of the white guards or by tactlessness of the communists or by an unfavourable combination of circumstances the conflicts between armed peasants and workers were rooted in one and the same social soil the difference between the class position and training of the workers and of the peasants the worker approaches questions from the socialist standpoint the peasants viewpoint is petty bourgeois the worker strives to socialize the property that is taken away from the exploiters the peasant seeks to divide it up the worker desires to put palaces and parks to common use the peasant insofar as he cannot divide them inclines to burning the palaces and cutting down the parks the worker strives to solve problems on a national scale and in accordance with a plan the peasant on the other hand approaches all problems on a local scale and takes a hostile attitude to centralized planning etc
7732464 we will arouse and organize the advanced workers and through the workers we shall arouse the peasants
7732465 despite the scanty information which reaches us from the vast areas of china our marxist understanding of the developing process enables us to reject with certainty the stalinist view of the current events it is false and extremely dangerous for the further development of the revolution
7732466 when the stalinists talk about a soviet government established by the peasants in a substantial part of china the not only reveal their credulity and superficiality they obscure and misrepresent the fundamental problem of the chinese revolution
7732467 the point where all progressive manifestations of the remains of the october conquest are more and more neutralized by the disastrous effects of the stalinist dictatorship
7732468 at first he leaned towards an analysis of russia and eastern europe as state capitalist
7732469 the relation of forces on the international chess board is now evolving to the disadvantage of imperialism an epoch of transition between capitalism and socialism an epoch which has already begun and is quite advanced this transformation will probably take an entire period of several centuries and will in the meantime be filled with forms and regimes transitional between capitalism and socialism and necessarily deviating from pure forms and norms the objective process is in the final analysis the sole determining factor overriding all obstacles of a subjective order
7732470 the communist parties retain the possibility in certain circumstances of roughly outlining a revolutionary orientation
7732471 in order to integrate ourselves into the real mass movement to work and to remain in the masses trade unions for example ruses and capitulations are not only acceptable but necessary
7732472 the activity of our members in the sp will be governed by the following directives a not to come forward as trotskyists with our full program b not to push forward programmatic and principled questions
7732473 did trotsky or the polish leninist bolsheviks claimed like you that the stalinists will transformed the polish capitalist state into a workers state trotsky is dead and can not defend himself against this monstrous slander and the attempt to destroy his revolutionary work against the stalinist counter revolution
7732474 i dont say they did therefore i do not slander trotsky but the method trotsky used in defence of poland was that it was an extension of the ussr we can use that method to characterise the post war dwss
7732475 did trotsky or the polish leninist bolsheviks claimed like you that the stalinists will transformed the polish capitalist state into a workers state trotsky is dead and can not defend himself against this monstrous slander and the attempt to destroy his revolutionary work against the stalinist counter revolution
7732476 i dont say they did therefore i do not slander trotsky but the method trotsky used in defence of poland was that it was an extension of the ussr we can use that method to characterise the post war dwss
7732477 in the polish ukraine and white russia where class exploitation was intensified by national oppression the peasants began to take over the land themselves to drive off the land lords who were already half in flight
7732478 in the villages very frequently at the very approach of the soviet troops i
7732479 according to the unanimous testimony of all observers the appearance of the soviet army and the soviet bureaucracy provides not only in the territory occupied by them but beyond its confines an impulse to social turmoil and social transformations
7732480 the waves engendered by this impulse will not only hit germany powerfully in a comparatively short period of time but also to one degree or another roll on to other states
7732481 however they may have attempted in the kremlin to avoid anything which might smack of the great revolution the very fact of the entry of soviet troops into the territories of eastern poland with its long outlived semi feudal agrarian relations had to provoke a stormy agrarian movement with the approach of soviet troops the peasants began to seize landlords estates and to form peasant committees
7732482 the agrarian revolution in soviet poland has had the force of a spontaneous movement as soon as the report spread that the red army had crossed the river zbrucz the peasants began to share out amongst themselves the landlords acres land was given first to small holders and in this way about thirty per cent of agricultural land was expropriated
7732483 my remark that the kremlin with its bureaucratic methods gave an impulse to the socialist revolution in poland is converted by shachtman into an assertion that in my opinion a
7732484 when one of my enemies sets before me small daily portions of poison and the second on the other hand is about to shoot straight at me then i will first knock the revolver out of the hand of my second enemy for this gives me an opportunity to get rid of my first enemy
7732485 in order to defeat the korniloviad we must first defeat the kerenskiad
7732486 even at the present time we are not duty bound to support the kerensky government that would be unprincipled
7732487 we shall fight we are fighting against kornilov but we do not support kerensky we are uncovering his weaknesses the distinction is rather delicate but highly important and must not be forgotten
7732488 even now we must not support kerensky government this is unprincipled we may be asked arent we going to fight against kornilov of course we must but this is not the same thing there is a dividing line here which is being stepped over by some bolsheviks who fall into compromise and allowed themselves to be carried away be the course of events
7732489 when finally the civil war began in may 1922 the cpi resumed some public activities including lectures and outdoor meetings it also provided the leadership of the unemployed movement
7732490 which explained the difference between fascism and the islamic movement it was published in our international site without one criticism
7732491 khomeini adopted radical themes at times he sounded more radical than the marxists but while adopting radical themes he remained staunchly committed to the preservation of middle class property this form of middle class radicalism made him akin to latin american populists especially the peronists
7732492 by populism i mean a movement of the propertied middle class that mobilises the lower classes especially the urban poor with radical rhetoric directed against imperialism foreign capitalism and the political establishment populist movements promise to drastically raise the standard of living and make the country fully independent of outside powers even more important in attacking the status quo with radical rhetoric they intentionally stop short of threatening the petty bourgeoisie and the whole principle of private property populist movements thus inevitably emphasise the importance not of economic social revolution but of cultural national and political reconstruction
7732493 the thousands upon thousands of noskes welses and hilferdings prefer in the last analysis fascism to communism but for that they must once and for all tear themselves loose from the workers today this is not yet the case today the social democracy as a whole with all its internal antagonisms is forced into sharp conflict with the fascists it is our task to take advantage of this conflict and not to unite the antagonists against us
7732494 the front must now be directed against fascism and this common front of direct struggle against fascism embracing the entire proletariat must be utilized in the struggle against the social democracy directed as a flank attack but no less effective for all that
7732495 no common platform with the social democracy or with the leaders of the german trade unions no common publications banners placards march separately but strike together agree only how to strike whom to strike and when to strike such an agreement can be concluded even with the devil himself with his grandmother and even with noske and grezesinsky on one condition not to bind ones hands
7732496 we are proposing nothing different complete independence of the communist organization and press complete freedom of communist criticism the same for the social democracy and the trade unions only contemptible opportunists can allow the freedom of the communist party to be limited for example as in the entrance into the kuomintang we are not of their number
7732497 our position on the war in china is the same the only salvation of the workers and peasants of china is to struggle independently against the two armies against the chinese army in the same manner as against the japanese army
7732498 i do not want to participate in the strike because the leaders are agents of capital
7732499 want to serve chiang kai shek in action and the proletariat in words
7732500 most of the eastern peoples are in a worse position than the most backward country in europe russia but in our struggle against feudal survivals and capitalism we succeeded in uniting the peasants and workers of russia and it was because the peasants and workers united against capitalism and feudalism that our victory was so easy here contact with the peoples of the east is particularly important because the majority of the eastern peoples are typical representatives of the working people not workers who have passed through the school of capitalist factories but typical representatives of the working and exploited peasant masses who are victims of medieval oppression the russian revolution showed how the proletarians after defeating capitalism and uniting with the vast diffuse mass of working peasants rose up victoriously against medieval oppression our soviet republic must now muster all the awakening peoples of the east and together with them wage a struggle against international imperialism
7732501 you demand that we reply comrade yossi we will always reply to serious political discussion but we will never reply to provocations
7732502 we are not worried about discussing political differences of any kind
7732503 if the centrists according to a general rule do not raise themselves to imposing crimes it is only because they forever remain in the byways of politics they are so to speak petty pick pockets of history for this reason they consider themselves called upon to regenerate the workers movement with a new morality
7732504 a section which is building a mass revolutionary force under the most difficult conditions and conducting a struggle against both imperialism and fundamentalism
7732505 this is not the first time that benazir bhutto has struck a deal with a military dictator
7732506 the situation within the ppp is at a low ebb the little internal political life left has shrunk most activists and leaders have been indoctrinated and programmed with the perception of attaining personal gain financial benefits and other perks and privileges by the party coming to power and it matters little at what cost and with what shameful compromise hence there is not much activity in the ranks of the party at the present time but with nawaz sharif deported by force of the state a smooth homecoming of benazir facilitated by the same state apparatus would not build up any political fortune for the party benazir would be further discredited in such a scenario
7732507 it is true that ppp has been the traditional party of the toiling masses of pakistan since the 1968 69 revolution
7732508 its very simple these are the people who are protecting our safety and guarding our freedom and anything we can do for them is just a very small token compared to what they do for us
7732509 certainly we can never repay the men and women in the armed forces for all their hard work and sacrifice we do all we can but you can never do enough
7732510 when i got back it was not only as if i had never left but they just showered me with attention and appreciation
7732511 you get a great perspective being in the military not only because you know whats important in life but you are constantly in touch with a culture that values integrity commitment duty and things like that
7732512 and the other thing is you are constantly dealing with all types of people in the military and that helps you deal with your clients as a civilian lawyer
7732513 weve had good experiences with those people they typically have very strong leadership skills are willing and able to accept responsibility and have a proven track record of performance in the military
7732514 anything we do is only a small gesture compared to what the men and women in the armed forces do
7732515 one of the nations leading activist in promoting energy sustainability
7732516 an expert in the utilization of the land use concept
7732517 so maybe the most interesting conversations on the future of the democratic party at least the progressive wing thereof are taking place at the
7732518 the shifting faith vote what it means for this election
7732519 thats no different than when brad pitt and angelina are filming a movie and it takes that amount of time when they get back together to have kids it will be the same when we get back on the field together were going to produce
7732520 the governing ldp has overwhelming power but the traditional structure of a monopolistic relationship with industry appears to be at an end
7732521 mal nacido pero no vamos a seguir gastando p lvora en gallinazos vamos a decirle a este excelent simo asesino presidente de los bolivianos que usted es el responsable ese el verdadero criminal que nos confronta
7732522 morales quiere llevar a comunizar nuestro pa s ese es el que no respeta mujeres no respeta a la prensa no respeta a discapacitados no respeta la capital de la rep blica
7732523 i was just intrigued by the idea of the voyeurism
7732524 theyre gonna go wow i gotta try this it just seems too weird
7732525 going to shoot obama from a high vantage point using a rifle sighted at 750 yards
7732526 was directly asked if they had come to denver to kill obama he responded in the affirmative
7732527 id rather do anything than eat your steak and kidney pie again tonight
7732528 i truly believe that peter has incredible economic credentials and its not for peter but its for our nation that he should be on the front bench
7732529 but if he doesnt have an intention that way he should declare it as such
7732530 run as fast as you can in any one style of your choice
7732531 there is now a wealth of evidence that climate change has had and will have further impact on a variety of allergenic plants
7732532 longer pollen seasons greater exposure and increased for late summer weeds such as ragweed
7732533 but well be looking as we always do to use the turnover figures and redeployment wherever we can to minimise the head count impact
7732534 were targeting good efficiencies but were arent doing that by quoting numbers of head count
7732535 for many years our focus has been on homes when it comes to air pollution school attendance may result in a large dose of inhaled traffic pollutants that until now have been completely overlooked
7732536 existing schools should be retrofitted with air filtration systems that will reduce students exposure to traffic pollutants
7732537 as far as being halfnaked i have always been the ugly ducking growing up
7732538 i know exactly how they feel and what theyre going through
7732539 i tried climbing onto the counter and my hand hit the pan and knocked it onto my head spilling hot crisco oil
7732540 my whole face was swollen and they thought i was going to lose my eyesight it was painful getting bandages changed
7732541 i let it affect me growing up i got teased a lot being a young child with scars especially a boy everyone points and asks questions it grows on you and becomes part of you for the longest time i felt different now i feel it in a different light
7732542 i had a bottle of water in my pocket a vip sat right near the stage i handed her the water and let her pour it on me
7732543 its pushing me outside my comfort zone i almost didnt do it
7732544 we run on patients who get burned and they get sent to the childrens hospital

7732562 aku dan para anbiya sebelumku ibarat satu bangunan yang dibina oleh seorang laki laki lalu ia membinanya dengan baik dan dipercantikkannya kecuali pada tempat sekeping batu bata pada suatu sudut maka orang ramai datang mengelilinginya dan kagum melihat dan berkata mengapa tidak diletakkan seketul batu bata di tempat yang kosong itu maka akulah batu bata itu dan akulah penyudah segala nabi
7732563 salah satu contoh di kota bandung saja produksi sampah bisa mencapai sekitar 6 915 m3 perharinya dengan jumlah penduduk 3 juta orang
7732564 jika gerakan ini terus dilakukan dan makin berkembang tentu bisa mengurangi persoalan sampah di perkotaan
7732565 contoh saja komposisi sampah di bandung 65 persennya terdiri dari sampah organik kita bisa mengusahakan pengolahan sampah organik ini menjadi kompos jadi paling tidak kita sudah me reduce produksi sampah rt ke tpa lebih dari setengahnya bukan
7732566 bila menyediakan lahan untuk membuat kompos sendiri saja sulit sebenarnya masih bisa diusahakan dengan membuat kompos secara komunal atau kompos kebun
7732567 dengan menggunakan kompos sebagai pupuk tanaman bisa tumbuh lebih kuat tanaman buah pun akan berbuah lebih manis

7732571 by then ill probably be rich so i wont need the money
7732572 mom ill make you a deal it might take me a really long time to get that rich if you will do me the favor of giving me those few decades to make my fortune before you pass on then you wont have to give me back the money

7732577 many approaches have been proposed to develop visible light photocatalysts including doping titanium dioxide with metal ions or metal atom clusters incorporating nitrogen and carbon into titanium dioxide and employing other metal oxides or polymetallates as catalyst materials
7732578 research has been mainly concentrated on semiconductor oxides sulfides have also been studied but they are not suitable catalysts because of their poor chemical stability however searching for catalysts that can work under visible light should not be limited to semiconductor materials with band gap structure but can be extended to other materials such as gold nanoparticles
7732579 if the heated gold nanoparticles could activate the organic molecules on them to induce oxidation of the organic compounds then oxidation on gold catalysts can be driven by visible light at ambient temperature
7732580 our findings open up a new direction in photocatalysis as the proposed reaction mechanism is distinctly different from that catalyzed by semiconductor photocatalysts
7732581 based on our results we propose a tentative reaction mechanism for the light driven catalytic oxidation the irradiation of incident light with a wavelength in the range of the spr band may result in two consequences the first is that light absorption by the gold nanoparticles could heat these nanoparticles up quickly the second consequence is that the interaction between the oscillating local electromagnetic fields and polar molecules also assists in activating the molecules the activated polar organic molecules react with oxygen in close proximity
7732582 a long term threat and a short term threat to our national security
7732583 for sen bidens iraq hearings to be anything more than a political sham used to invoke a modern day gulf of tonkin resolution equivalent for iraq his committee will need to ask hard questions and demand hard facts concerning the real nature of the weapons threat posed by iraq
7732584 everyone in the world thought he had them the weapons inspectors said he had them
7732585 preordained a conclusion that seeks to remove saddam hussein from power regardless of the facts and using these hearings to provide political cover for a massive military attack on iraq
7732586 as long as saddams at the helm there is no reasonable prospect you or any other inspector is ever going to be able to guarantee that we have rooted out root and branch the entirety of saddams program relative to weapons of mass destruction
7732587 the only way were going to get rid of saddam hussein is were going to end up having to start it alone
7732588 its going to require guys like you in uniform to be back on foot in the desert taking saddam down
7732589 one thing is clear these weapons must be dislodged from saddam or saddam must be dislodged from power
7732590 if we wait for the danger from saddam to become clear it could be too late
7732591 he did not snub the u n or our allies he did not dismiss a new inspection regime he did not ignore the congress at each pivotal moment he has chosen a course of moderation and deliberation
7732592 i do not believe this is a rush to war i believe it is a march to peace and security i believe that failure to overwhelmingly support this resolution is likely to enhance the prospects that war will occur
7732593 we must be clear with the american people that we are committing to iraq for the long haul not just the day after but the decade after

7732599 we are outraged at the abuse of our trust and misuse of our union dues by andy stern and anna burgers appointee
7732600 our leaders should be accountable to healthcare workers in california not to union officials in washington d c
7732601 for a union to be the voice of its members members must have a voice in our union
7732602 there should be no more forced reorganization of our local unions until an independent investigation is complete and control of local 6434 is returned to its members appointing yet another washington insider accountable only to stern and burger is more of the same

7732623 was directly asked if they had come to denver to kill obama he responded in the affirmative

7732628 if you are following me tell me who you are
7732629 its premature to say that it was a valid threat or that these folks have the ability to carry it out
7732630 were absolutely confident there is no credible threat to the candidate the democratic national convention or the people of colorado
7732631 it could also turn out that these were nothing but a bunch of knuckleheads meth heads
7732632 i think about how one day theyll have families of their own and one day they and your sons and daughters will tell their own children about what we did together in this election theyll tell them how this time we listened to our hopes instead of our fears how this time we decided to stop doubting and to start dreaming
7732633 now you know why i asked her out so many times even though she said no you want a persistent president
7732634 barack doesnt care where youre from or what your background is or what party if any you belong to thats not how he sees the world
7732635 he knows that thread that connects us our belief in americas promise our commitment to our childrens future is strong enough to hold us together as one nation even when we disagree
7732636 scrimped and saved so that he could have opportunities they never had themselves
7732637 i dont need a tool kit in the dorms im not building the room myself

7732654 samantha manson she likes to be call sam everyone knows her but shes part of human also danny gave her magic
7732655 call me crazy but i think theres a way to be inhuman again i mean i can invent anything i can put my mind to
7732656 wow i guessed youve forgot to mention youre technologies girl too can you do anything to your mind
7732657 oh yeah i invented a way to see invisible danny and sam are the first ones to use it also came in handy a few times for them whenever i see invisible
7732658 i thought that was true i first saw you as a baby i noticed you were alone before you were talking to danny before you did you were talking to yourself and crawled around till you bumped into him
7732659 really well i did remember how i first met thamantha it was an amazing moment and it was my first friend too not a lot of people notice that well since you guys have to get to sleep and im going to work on inventing that idea
7732660 i guess so if it doesnt work then we are still thankful for you trying
7732661 we knew you could do it betty we had our faith for you
7732662 thank you for believing in me it makes me more powerful than usual every thing is changing so fast oh um jazz is the one of dannys sister and she knew all along since she was four years old
7732663 come in samson and theres someone i like you to meet
7732664 yep thats us for sure betty has been telling us so much about you
7732665 well wed wait a minute how come you dont look like a ghost anymore
7732666 actually i invented to turn them back to being inhumans again i called it the switcher im not sure what the side effects are but its been going great
7732667 actually for some strange reason i still like a ghost right now
7732668 im starting to agree what hes saying i just saying but it could be possible that were like danny maybe were actually half ghost and half inhuman
7732669 mm good point try using any of the ghost powers to see
7732670 were half a ghost and inhuman danny is going to be surprise today about everything
7732671 how about keeping it a secret till its the right time for him to know about this
7732672 okay well anyway how are we going to explain to everyone that dannys parents are now alive
7732673 thats simple ill be telling them what ive invent to get them back to being inhuman again
7732674 oh right well everyone does know youre really smart anyway and youre good with technologies
7732675 thank you samson why dont you take them to the breakfast room and ill go get danny
7732676 good morning are you ready to meet three families today
7732677 yeah i cant wait to know the whole family before school starts
7732678 glad to hear that are you ready to have breakfast now
7732679 who else oh my look at you youve grown up so much since you were a little baby
7732680 yes i did i invented a switcher to change them back to inhumans again thats all to it
7732681 thank you betty for everything youve done for i was planning to find them but i didnt know or dont remember what they look like samson is very lucky to have a girl like you im lucky to have everyone especially my parents and sam
7732682 uh betty where did you get those powers i thought you have magic powers but now this
7732683 yeah but i wanted to see how it feels but also to see if it comes in handy to deal with george
7732684 well you see i invented switcher and your parents felt something strange i thought it was a side effect that theyre going to be changing back to ghost again but turns out theyre half ghost and half inhuman like you danny after they left my room i had an idea and i wanted to try it out so i use the switcher on me twice and see if i have ghost powers when george showed up all i could think of was getting rid of him out of the house and i wasnt planning on using the ghost powers all of a suddenly
7732685 yeah i wanted to use the ghost powers for emergency to deal with george if im ever busy i hated it when george interrupted my life with everything and now he cant get away with it
7732686 betty youre not alone for dealing with george im sure everything will work out just fine and youve got my parents and me
7732687 thanks dont tell anyone right now i just want to wait for the right moment like what just happened
7732688 oh look at the time we better have breakfast before our family comes here
7732689 just one question how many people are there in our family
7732690 oh thats a lot of people in our families i guess youve managed to figure out the plan for the summer
7732691 hello aunt bloom and princess katie its great to see you again
7732692 you too meeting cousin betty and everyone are going to be fun
7732693 princess betty you have changed so much since you were a little baby
7732694 yes i am and i think you know who she is
7732695 yep thats me i was on earth but i know who i am
7732696 i didnt know that well this is prince danny sam rosalinda samson dani with an
7732697 youre youre prince danny i thought ill never see you in person
7732698 nope in fact i lived with jazzs family but its our family i have no idea what happened
7732699 im jazz danny and i had our family time before we met betty but i know what happened
7732700 its time to go back in time to save danny before george does
7732701 george is actually after danny more than you right now if he gets rid of danny right now danny will not exist earth would have been destroyed already especially inearth
7732702 you told me its your instinct telling you when its time
7732703 i know its hard to face the truth but its time to let go betty maybe its not meant for all of us to be on earth
7732704 father what you are talking about it isnt making any sense
7732705 that earth was destroyed by the disasteriod and everyone was killed except for us
7732706 i know but i wished george didnt held onto me and i would have saved earth as a hero
7732707 youre already a hero on inearth and natalie is going through this with you she lost her families on earth but luckily she has us
7732708 i understand father im going back to my room and pray to be thankful
7732709 well dont forget today youll be making a speech about disasteriod everyone feels the same with you
7732710 its alright danny i am here to keep you safe i promise you that
7732711 i will ill do whatever it takes i promise you that would you like to talk about it sometimes it helps to get it out of you
7732712 that evil man had a knife and killed my parents
7732713 now we have to get you into a family to live with
7732714 dont leave me i want you to keep me safe
7732715 but i have a life to get back into i promise this family will protect you no matter what and you will become everyones hero
7732716 much bigger like saving earth as a whole planet at once dont worry it wont happen till you fall in love
7732717 hi my name is princess betty i know its hard to believe that im a princess but i do know you believe in magic
7732718 i need your help to have danny in your family hes two years old he lost his parents she whispers but he doesnt wants to talk about it because they were killed normal talks he has the power of magic from twelve years from now i will return but i wont remember because i havent done this i know your name is jazz fenton
7732719 i guess he could be in our family ive always wanted a little brother and spend time with too but what should i do later in the future when i do see you
7732720 when danny tells you about magic youll remember me and you didnt want to tell us what happened till the summer time arrives once were in a living room when danny wants to find out soon and thats the time i believe george is our enemy hes trying to get rid of danny so he wouldnt become a hero george doesnt know right now but he will return after danny becomes a hero to the world
7732721 you can do anything with it use your imagination for fun danny will show you but i must get back to my original time oh jazz before i forget if you hear someone asking about what happen to danny thats what you must do to let me know no pressure or anything but without danny earth would be destroyed
7732722 i knew i could count on you youre a bright girl jazz youd do anything you could put your mind to
7732723 how would you like it if you have a power of magic
7732724 all done danny will teach you but keep this a secret and good luck getting danny adopts into your family ill see you later princess
7732725 did she call me a princess if so is it for real
7732726 now we need a fake adoption paper because we need to trick my i mean our parents into adopting you
7732727 magic i am a prince too and i learned them from my dad
7732728 its a great idea how do you do it with magic
7732729 i did it now we need to give it to them and then youre in the family
7732730 i know this sound strange but i want to have a brother and he needs a family his name is danny he can talk like three years old kid and hes fun to hang out can he be my little brother
7732731 if we do adopt him where is he going to sleep for the night
7732732 annoying i know but its worth it i know it will be being an only child is so quiet and not a lot of fun ill look after him like a hero
7732733 alright well sign the adoption form and hell be one of us as a fenton

7732741 and then it just keep on getting brighter and brighter and brighter and brighter and brighter and then i come to
7732742 when i come to my wife or somebody called the ambulance on me and they made me go to the hospital
7732743 i mean i dont go to church but maybe i need to go on and go

7732909 sen biden is the wrong choice but democrats should support the ticket of senators obama and biden in the general elections
7732910 i was so disappointed i was still hoping that the choice would be sen clinton but since joe biden is the best next to hillary i still have my full support to them and i would like to appeal to filipino american voters to please support barack obama and joe biden because he obama is the change that we want and he is opening doors not only for you and me but for everybody you dont want another four years of bush mccain regime do you
7732911 obama is the vision of the future while bidens wisdom and experience make them the winning team the experience complimenting the optimism of the future is really unbeatable and besides biden is a very pro people pro simple people and has served the senate for 30 years and a man with that experience means big for the working class people and the middle class people and because mr biden has seen the ups and downs in the government this will help mr obama work within that framework
7732912 today i come back to springfield to tell you that i found that man a man with a distinguished record a man with fundamental decency and that man is joe biden
7732913 biden for decades has brought change to washington but washington has not changed him he directs a foreign policy with his heart and values rooted in middle class stared down dictators and spoke up for the american cops and firefighters he is uniquely suited to be my partner as we work to put our country back on track now i could say he is one of the finest public servants of our time
7732914 joe still rides the train back to washington every night out of the heartbreak of that unspeakable accident he did more than become a senator he raised a family
7732915 that is the character of the man who is going to be the vice president of the united states of america he came back stronger than before he has become more resilient by overcoming adversities for his work in the senate he raised his family with a strong commitment to work and with a catholic faith and with a belief that americans can make it if they try

7732920 he is at home in a foreign scene like iraq and corridor of congress and the center of international crisis he beat odds a scrappy kid from scranton and a dedicated family man who knows everyday the conductor of the amtrak train to wilmington thats the kind of fighter whom i want to be by my side for years to come

7732938 until carter ruck and partners and englands stifling libel laws got to work the few american journalists not caught up in obama mania were turning to the archives of the british press to answer an intriguing question who is nadhmi auchi
7732939 a libel claimant does not have to prove that the words are false or to prove that he has in fact suffered any loss damage is presumed
7732940 as far as he can remember he has had no direct contact with mr obama
7732941 mr rezkos lawyer said his client had longstanding indebtedness to mr auchis general mediterranean holding gmh by june 2007 he owed it 27 9 million under a loan forgiveness agreement described in court m auchi lent mr rezko 3 5 million in april 2005 and 11 million in september 2005 as well as 3 5 million transferred in april 2007 that agreement provided for the outstanding loans to be forgiven in return for a stake in the 62 acre riverside park development
7732942 mr auchi first met mr rezko after the 2003 iraq war and they have a business relationship
7732943 mr auchi was convicted of corruption given a suspended sentence and fined 1 4 million in france in 2003 for his part in the elf affair described as the biggest political and corporate scandal in post war europe he in a statement from his media lawyers claims he is appealing against the sentence
7732944 a 2004 pentagon report obtained by the washington times identified auchi as a global arms dealer and iraqi billionaire who behind the facade of legitimate business served as saddam husseins principle sic international financial manipulator and bag man
7732945 the report to the pentagon inspector general stated that significant and credible evidence has been developed that nadhmi auchi has engaged in unlawful activities working closely with iraqi intelligence operatives to bribe foreign governments and individuals prior to operation iraqi freedom to turn opinion against the american led mission to remove saddam hussein
7732946 have written to ask us to remove the names of the articles concerned
7732947 another publisher is now shortly to be sued over false material it is publishing on the internet having failed to heed a warning letter a fulsome apology injunction and substantial damages will be sought against it
7732948 the libel lawyer peter carter ruck who died on friday had a chilling effect on the media he was a chancer out for the maximum fee and he did for freedom of speech what the boston strangler did for door to door salesmen he established the idea that libel law was complicated and merited very high fees in the process he became very rich i like to bill the clients as the tears are flowing he told me
7732949 the name nadhmi auchi was just another name for saddams intelligence service or so we thought said nibras kazimi a former iraqi dissident who is now a visiting scholar at the hudson institute in washington d c
7732950 mr auchi is a business partner of syrian born businessman antoin tony rezko who has supported mr obama financially since his first run for the illinois state senate in 1996
7732951 in 1996 according to european news accounts belgiums ambassador to luxembourg charged that banque continentale du luxembourg a bank that nadhmi auchi and paribas jointly controlled until 1994 had handled personal accounts for former dictator of iraq saddam hussein
7732952 auchi has been able to collect british politicians the way other people collect stamps
7732953 on the 20th anniversary of his business in 1999 mr auchi received a greeting card signed by 130 politicians including tony blair william hague and charles kennedy who were then leaders of their respective parties

7733003 going to shoot obama from a high vantage point using a rifle sighted at 750 yards
7733004 was directly asked if they had come to denver to kill obama he responded in the affirmative
7733005 our big concern coming in was the size of their offensive line versus our defensive front four those guys all did an outstanding job
7733006 we kept those guys as fresh as we could everybody we put in there did a great job that allowed our linebackers to clean things up
7733007 our defense actually played well we gave up five turnovers and much of the time the game was in our territory and we only gave up 20 points
7733008 i was disappointed that we had 3 4 balls in our hands for interceptions and dropped them
7733009 how about the game jordan rode had two field goals our kickoffs extra points punting and helping us have some solid special teams it was all big
7733010 when evan came out after that second fumble i wasnt going to chew on him he was who we had
7733011 when we got the ball back i told him to go back in and we were giving it to him you have to have confidence
7733012 the weather kept the times down some but the course was fast with the lack of rain
7733013 we did about what i expected for the first meet of the year for some of the schools this was their second meet
7733014 i was a little disappointed in the boys finishing 11th of the 12 schools that had enough for team scores i thought we would run better as a team i dont know how much the weather bothered us some take it better than others
7733015 we had four girls in the top 20 as i have told people before i think we will be better than expected
7733016 for the boys seth wisener ran great finishing second overall and the team finishing 5th overall at the meet
7733017 what this meet does is give you an idea of what you need to work on and what you can build on
7733018 we wanted to be competitive with spencerville because we knew they were good when you look at our times we ran better this year
7733019 well see them several other times and that creates a nice rivalry im sure theyll run just a little bit harder against us the next time
7733020 we lost our top two runners and three of our top five for the boys so i didnt really know how well theyd run in the first two meets were doing far better than expected
7733021 a number have already brought their times down significantly its a long season every saturday is a preparation for the tournament our goal every year is to get at least one of the teams to regionals at least
7733022 one of the things i found we need to improve is our pack running between the first and fifth runners id like to see us get within 30 seconds there
7733023 were calling this a celebration and ive been asked if we should really be celebrating something so awful it isnt a celebrating the flood itself were celebrating what happened afterward what happened as a community and the progress we made
7733024 our church had minimal damage we were blessed to have what little damage we had
7733025 these people who just showed up in our lives are definitely a cause for celebration
7733026 ive been studying this payday issue and you wouldnt believe what our politicians have been up to
7733027 the payday loan industry has become little more than legal loan sharks that work by a model that cannot survive unless people get into a debt trap and come back to them for loans over and over again they get repeat borrowers and as a result the typical two week loan ends up with an interest rate of 391 percent apr when you have interest rates that high it hurts many more people than just the borrowers it puts a strain on everybody
7733028 i think this was a real common sense solution to a terrible problem in ohio people will still be able to borrow money there are lots of things that government regulates because theyre dangerous it regulates what we do with our cars roads and prescription drugs and payday lending is another example
7733029 i voted against it because i think in some instances its a product people want to have available i dont see a lot of difference between these loans and what happens with credit cards where people get a 5 000 line of credit and pretty soon theyre maxed out and at 19 percent can never pay it back lets be clear this is a bad option but it may at times be folks only option if they need to make a child support payment or they have a medical bill or some doctor says you have to have 150 up front before hell see you there are different cases where this is appropriate and most people pay it back on payday
7733030 its misleading to say its at a 391 percent interest rate its similar to going to an atm at a bank other than your own to take out 100 and they charge you 2 well thats one days worth of interest and you can say thats extremely high but its really just a question of what somebody is willing to pay for a service thats why its confusing to say its 391 percent and thats only one example thats why they had to take that out of the ballot language
7733031 the people who want to keep this in business make a lot of money and dont want it to sound so bad this is a really bad financial product its a bad thing for people to do but its a lot worse to pay 4 for a 12 ounce drink at the movie theater when you can buy it for 35 wholesale for example the state rips people off more with the lottery than payday lenders do with these loans
7733032 anybody can claim to have a deal that will knock your socks off its up to voters to educate themselves people often think because they see something on television it must be true well not really
7733033 it doesnt go down as a win but we made progress from game 1 and thats what were looking at were not so much worried about wins and losses right now as improvement
7733034 weve got some new faces and combinations girls trying different spots than theyve played before it takes time to get comfortable
7733035 we didnt want to have a letdown after coming back the other night against wapak i think we came out well
7733036 at the same time we didnt want to come out too fast and burn ourselves out especially today i was missing two girls and didnt want to go deeper into the bench i think the girls did a good job today of letting me know they needed a break
7733037 again our concern right now is getting the girls to make better passes especially short ones and communicate consistently our preparation is more for down the road
7733038 weve slowed things down for the girls and its working well so far
7733039 when they get going too fast thats when we make mistakes usually it takes us 3 4 of the year to really be able to speed it back up

7733045 si fue obligada a ponerse el chaleco o si lo hizo voluntariamente es lo que estamos investigando
7733046 el hecho de que la ni a se haya entregado quiere decir que los iraqu es siguen rechazando a al qaeda y sus pr cticas

7733060 we spent an enormous amount of money and time and a full time unit of people looking under every stone it wasnt like we did not know anything about her

7733064 wow if this were adapted to film i can totally see mr x in this part miss y in that
7733065 hmm well yeah i think a reboot is a good idea at this point while there are elements of returns that i thought worked quite well the film utterly failed in my opinion to demonstrate why superman is frankly the best of the best and theres the tiny little problem i have with making any kind of superman movie that you cant bring an 8 year old to see let alone a 10 year old batman sure pg 13 all the way but superman especially as a film needs to be something that both kids and adults can enjoy in many ways it goes to the core of the character his universality so i dont think a reboot is a bad idea as long as we dont end up with a take on the material that has kal getting his power from a special suit or that turns doomsday into his long lost brother
7733066 oh hell yeah will it happen i cant imagine it but damn id be there in a micro second no question
7733067 i hope if they are rebooting superman they hand the reins to richard donner it would be the salvation of the series dick has such a passion for the series the fan base would finally get what they have been waiting for someone with the passion to light up the screen
7733068 i think its a good idea though the idea of making superman
7733069 who said show me a good loser and ill show you a loser i try to live by that
7733070 im cool with pressure moving up to this car now its more pressure but i can handle it i think its cool when tony left and they brought my name up it was really exciting for me especially as an 18 year old kid its cool even to have your name brought up but then for it all to happen and if we all work good then its going to be really exciting

7733081 thats one of those deals where i couldnt get by him and i couldnt get by him and i just had to ask myself would he do that to me and he has before so thats the way it goes its just racing i have a lot of respect for the guy and he was real fast but we cant give up points when theyre right there for us to take im just really proud of my guys that was exciting they keep talking about rivalries we might have one now
7733082 it was all going fine there till the end just a tough break for us and this m amp ms toyota team steve addington crew chief and the guys built us a fabulous race car just unfortunate the way things came down at the end hell carl edwards always come back and say hes sorry its just his normal fashion thats fine ive grown to know that now
7733083 we had a good car but we didnt have a car that could run with the 18 kyle busch or 99 carl edwards it seemed like on the long runs we were as good as the 99 edwards but the 18 busch seemed to be the class of the field it was a solid day and we did what we had to it was a good day for us this is what we needed
7733084 it was a really great night for our pennzoil platinum chevrolet the car was really loose at the beginning and then we got it dialed in as the race went on it was a great run just would like to thank all my guys its a big night for the big picture
7733085 great top five definitely a great rebound from the last couple weeks real proud of the dupont chevrolet team they fought hard we just couldnt get the car freed up enough there at the end and brought it home fifth so we will take that
7733086 it was a good run for the alltel dodge we got up to second place at one point in the race got a little bit loose and fell back and held our own we ran in sixth position for about 350 laps which is not a bad thing its hard to get around the lapped cars on the restarts and make gains on the guys running in front of you because the cars are so similar here
7733087 that was a great night for the jack daniels chevrolet we got caught up in someone elses mess and all the guys did an awesome job fixing the car so we could keep racing it was a total team effort tonight our pit stops were awesome and the car was great we came out of bristol with a top 10 and were back inside the top 12 it was a really really good night
7733088 we had a good car it is frustrating we ran in the top 10 we started 23rd worked our way up there methodically it was a really good car the car took off really good on sticker tires and that was it it wouldnt go once we ran like 30 laps on our tires i couldnt go anywhere we have to go to work on that we have to figure out how to make our car last a little bit longer it is what it is
7733089 a typical performance out there tonight for us we got one really strong run out of the chassis but then fought a tight condition the final 200 laps of the race we have to be able to adjust on these things to get the front end to turn better until we can do that about a top 15 car is all weve got
7733090 i like my spotter he is a good guy but man thats ridiculous we just took a bunch of cars out for no reason i was just running along heard clear clear clear and went up and there was someone still there i am pretty upset about it there were a lot of people that got involved in that which shouldnt have been involved at all because it shouldnt have happened

7733096 there is an agreement actually reached reached between the two parties on a fixed date which is the end of 2011 to end any foreign presence on iraqi soil
7733097 go through a number of levers in the iraqi political system before we actually have an agreement from the iraqi side
7733098 until we have a deal we dont have a deal
7733099 it was one of those frustrating weeks for us but were trying to keep a positive outlook on it any time you lead a race like we did at billings you feel like you should have won it but on the other side you dont often flip in a feature and still come out with a top 10 finish
7733100 i know ive won races being in second when the leader comes to traffic and thats just what happened tuesday night
7733101 saturday was certainly more frustrating because we had another chance at victory and came home second again the track started taking rubber but we were able to get it wide enough and still pass we tried everything we could but just didnt end up first like we hoped now well turn our focus on returning to skagit and do everything we can to get win number 13 for tony stewart racing and all the people involved with our team from armor all chevy and parkerstore
7733102 we had high hopes heading into the week and just couldnt build on the momentum we had from our third place run at minot last sunday night on tuesday in billings we qualified seventh but didnt get one of those top two spots in the heat and we were back to starting in the middle of the pack
7733103 the weekend in canada was pretty much the same we didnt get qualified very well either night so we were in the same situation weve been in most of the year starting the features in rows six and seven everyone is working really hard to get this bass pro shops chevy running up front and well do our best this week to be ready for a couple of nights in skagit
7733104 several soldiers who deserted after a tour of duty in iraq have stated that cruelty towards iraqi citizens was a factor in their desertions one of them lance corporal ivan brobeck witnessed the abuse of iraqi detainees and the killing of iraqi civilians another sgt ricky clousing had similar experiences his allegations of systematic abuse of iraqi detainees are now being investigated by the military

7733121 hussein al zubaidi a provincial council member and nazar al khafaji the diyala university dean were arrested during the raid the official said
7733122 taha dria a shiite lawmaker from diyala who was not in the government compound during the raid said the armed forces were from iraqs emergency response unit an american trained unit similar to u s special forces
7733123 they were wearing khaki their weapons were american the humvees they used looked american they didnt have any ranks on their shoulders they didnt talk
7733124 these special forces work with the americans they are not associated with the ministry of defense they have goals and they didnt inform anyone else
7733125 that all us troops will leave by the end of 2011
7733126 i know there are always reports out there in the press and im not sure i saw exactly what prime minister maliki said but clearly from our perspective weve been working with the iraqi government for a long time on this agreement were discussing goals as you know youve heard us speak about different kinds of timelines or aspirational goals that may be acceptable i dont have anything to announce on that an agreement has not been signed and so from our perspective there is no agreement until theres an agreement signed there are discussions that continue in baghdad wed like to let them continue and to continue to show progress what were focused on is getting a good agreement not getting an agreement by a particular date so well continue those discussions
7733127 out of the more than 151 000 families who had fled their houses in baghdad just 7 112 had returned to them by mid july according to the iraqi ministry of migration
7733128 the reasons for the hesitation are complex based on dangers both real and imagined in most cases iraqis say they feel safe with their neighbors but are not sure about other residents some are afraid of the new guards on their blocks in rarer cases they cannot face neighbors who they suspect helped in killings

7733159 complaints are coming in that drugged parrots in south yardley have against their will been tattooed by a bandana ed man known as pirate bob
7733160 bob gave us all drink and when we woke up bob had tatooed our bibs we think he took advantage of us for self promotion and some of us are having our anuses checked too because we think date rape drugs were used on us
7733161 i have been itching badly at my rear end and i vaguely recall bob screaming orgasmically
7733162 he told us he was seeking to create worldwide parroty but now we have bobs bibs and aching anuses

7733167 but being out of touch with mainstream america is nothing new to jon as evidenced by the crash and burn ratings of this years oscars telecast
7733168 that false sense of urgency they create the sense that everything is breaking news the 24 hour networks are now driving the narratives and everyone else is playing catch up

7733170 his movies are so humanistic in a genre that frequently passes by that element
7733171 all of his movies became kind of funny and bright even mistakes like atlantis the lost continent which is sort of an italian movie that isnt an italian movie and is really a pretty silly picture there is a geniality to his movies he stamped his personality on them whether he directed them or not
7733172 there is wistfulness about it thats really absent from most science fiction films
7733173 its a moving film on a level that most movies of that type didnt even try to reach
7733174 the development and novel methods and techniques in the production of short subjects known as puppetoons
7733175 six years later he made his first foray into live action filmmaking with
7733176 he was very european you enjoyed him for that reason consequently some of his stories got a very european twist which as i look back on it was a different way of storytelling
7733177 he was the gentlest nicest man outside of directing and when he was directing he was the same way
7733178 when he would shoot he would come up with this smirk on his face and say i think it would be cute if you would do he was very playful
7733179 i believe we ran around the cameras and george was saying wait a minute stop but we couldnt stop we were laughing so hard tony would always do some sort of escapade that would take george back a bit
7733180 he wanted me to do a tv series based on the 7 faces of dr
7733181 i was flattered but he couldnt get it off the ground

7733187 when you dont play as well as you know you can but you are still getting results then that is a sign of a good team
7733188 we have a big game on wednesday night and we have to respond with a top class performance because was we did today saturday was just not good enough
7733189 they are definitely the toughest opponents weve had in a champions league qualifier i know people expect us to get through but its not as if were playing a mickey mouse team
7733190 the belgian league has a lot of quality and their champions are used to getting into the group stages we had a tough match against anderlecht a few years ago so im not surprised liege caused us problems
7733191 they caught us a bit cold in the first leg but you have to remember that they had gone something like 30 games unbeaten in their own league and they are a club with european pedigree
7733192 we didnt play well and we know well have to improve at anfield everyone knows how important it is for our season to get into the group stage
7733193 its always a funny time for us to have such a massive game before weve got going in the season some of our results have reflected that
7733194 we lost at home to ak graz in the year we won the competition and had a narrow win in the last minute against maccabi haifa two years ago so anyone thinking well win comfortably knows thats very dangerous
7733195 i believe im at the top of my game right now and like any player i want to win things i dont want to look back on my career and think i only won the carling league cup dajohnner
7733196 yes i got a in problem the dollar is going to shit gas is going up what the am i going to do for dinner my dog need to be walked i lost my in work phone yeah homie i got in problems
7733197 i have come here tonight to stand with you to change america to restore its future to rise to our best ideals and to elect barack obama president of the united states
7733198 nothing is going to keep me away from this special gathering tonight theres a new wave of change all around us and if we set our compass true we will reach our destination not merely victory for our party but renewal for our nation

7733201 our province is controlled by government directors and other managers who all come from gauteng and as far away as the eastern cape which results in our residents being nothing but puppets for foreigners that is why all the big 2010 contracts and even small security contracts are given to gauteng companies
7733202 but mabuza is rooted in mpumalanga and he will help ensure that government is run by people from mpumalanga for mpumalanga
7733203 the reason mabuza won the election is because he is accessible to ordinary people within the party his roots are here and that means he is accountable here
7733204 all lobby groups are now disbanded and no one should be sanctioned or charged for having participated in our internal democratic process in any way
7733205 there are wrong perceptions that some among us are hell bent on purging other leaders by doing all sorts of things that can only be attributed to monsters
7733206 colorado and the west are both a big focus of this campaign
7733207 that investment and the energy that we see on the ground in new mexico will absolutely translate in november
7733208 in a place like montana there simply werent the resources to keep a partys headquarters open during the entire year in non election years and so it was very difficult
7733209 it kept people on the ground recruiting new candidates maintaining voter files and making sure we have county committees that are working and organised
7733210 things are especially tough on people in my community who are hiv positive because they must eat a nutritional meal each time they have to take their antiretrovirals arvs most of the time there just isnt enough for them to eat and they become very ill our government needs a wake up call because we cannot continue to live like this
7733211 food security is not about the physical availability or scarcity of food at the national and household level but also the qualitative degree and temporality of access in relation to nourishment social resilience and vulnerability
7733212 these are extremely poor both as a cause and effect of food insecurity
7733213 i have a fairly big yard and my house is not that big so i am left with quite a lot of space to grow food to feed my family i have spinach potatoes cabbages and pumpkin growing in my own backyard
7733214 i couldnt afford to take a bus to town every weekend to buy food the transport was getting expensive the food was getting expensive i could see starvation getting closer for my grandchildren so i decided to spend my money buying seeds to plant the food myself now i not only feed my own family but other people in my community who go hungry because they cannot afford the high priced food
7733215 this poverty is contributing to more people getting sick people are weak and falling ill easily therefore not being able to work at a time when they need all the money they can get to feed their families if the government wants to solve the problems of crime unemployment hiv aids and tb it must look at solving the food crisis
7733216 he did bad things and he doesnt want us to end up like him
7733217 i took the mess that i was and turned it into a message
7733218 we got some mayweathers and some alis and some sugar ray leonards and we have a couple of mike tysons too
7733219 no matter where you start we are all the same
7733220 he says turn your tv off larry i get flashbacks to prison that is when i have to remind myself its randy it is not a prison guard it is not a judge he taught me how to be responsible
7733221 every time i jump ahead of myself i get my nose chopped off by ruth clanagan she is like my mother
7733222 he is no joke he is going to be the one i will sic him on randy sometime
7733223 follow me around i dont care im serious if anybody wants to put a tail on me go ahead
7733224 i cant type i cant file i cant even answer the phone
7733225 for all the sound and fury what we saw was a handful of prosecutions
7733226 there never was a grand onslaught people may have envisioned
7733227 its not so much the number of obscenity cases they bring but the qualitative nature of what theyre trying to do by bringing them
7733228 the prosecution is trying to set boundaries as to the acceptable realm of adult material
7733229 weve got tons of stuff they technically could arrest us for
7733230 and when that raid happened i put on our web site i made a big speech i welcome the lapd to come on down i said come and get me i said because we wont go down without a fight we will fight this regardless of the cost we will fight it
7733231 i just cant see them coming after us wasting millions of dollars taxpayer money to come for a videotape thats ridiculous
7733232 every day that were not in trial is another day our client is not convicted
7733233 i think the more likely answer is the sides havent pushed it forward
7733234 it cant disappear altogether as long as its a pending case its on someones radar
7733235 im sure there are political considerations but i wont speculate on that
7733236 lets make it a goal to outlast the bush administration and here we are we consider that a victory
7733237 its not the type of case thats sufficiently political to be affected by a change in administration
7733238 and as a practical matter very few pending prosecutions are
7733239 pursuing the adult entertainment industry has been a priority of this administration
7733240 whoever the next president is we would hope he will spend his resources on other important issues
7733241 we are like a family here i couldnt believe it when i heard the news
7733242 he took a personal interest in every county project he touched and that showed itself in the quality of the results
7733243 he loved his hometown and he dedicated his life to serving the people here
7733244 he was the kind of person who would be the first on the scene to help anybody in need
7733245 out of friendship and to lower the level of personal acrimony that has come about because of this drink tax
7733246 i see no conflict of interest here at all mr ellenbogen has a right to legal counsel of his own choosing and i believe my role as mr ellenbogens attorney would stand up in court
7733247 i am a working guy i dont have money to start throwing away on lawsuits that i dont think i should be involved in
7733248 there are people on this council that want to harm this government mr ellenbogen has been working with the republicans against county council and mr onoratos administration
7733249 shall the county enact an ordinance to increase real estate taxes in order to repeal the alcoholic drink tax
7733250 i want to preserve the right if necessary to challenge the referendum question that originated from county council
7733251 the reality is john edwards didnt have a bright political future anyway
7733252 hed lost two elections he didnt have the confidence of the american voters and he was eclipsed by barack obama as a darling of the left
7733253 if your political brand hinges on morality its very difficult for you to tell such blatant lies to the nation
7733254 clinton came to symbolize of lot of things that were the 60s counter culture
7733255 for clinton there was already a narrative about someone who was the violator of social norms
7733256 hed have to really rewrite that story and thats a tough thing to do
7733257 political campaigns and political lives are often about being able to tell a convincing story
7733258 and its one of the things that would be particularly difficult for edwards right now
7733259 she has given him the very tangible qualities that she herself enjoys in the public eye
7733260 defendant meisner then purported to find a manila envelope located between the leg of the plaintiffs desk and the wall
7733261 this case is about control or shall i say lack of control
7733262 my breath went it was a feeling akin to losing your child momentarily like the wind got kicked out of you
7733263 it was a little ziploc and a lot of money and i thought what am i going to do because i didnt see the ids at first
7733264 then i saw the drivers license and thought about how bad he must be feeling
7733265 when i was holding the stuff i thought i cant wait to tell them ive got it the joy of being able to do that was so much better than anything you could buy what could you spend 1 000 on that would make you feel that good
7733266 it was a joy at this end too it helped give me a little bit of faith back it builds on itself too its only been a week but i have been looking at people a little differently
7733267 one photographer said it was going to be on the front page of the paper
7733268 our knees buckled when we saw our daughter on the front page beside our senator joe biden
7733269 i didnt think it was going to be this big
7733270 my teachers all said theyre so proud of me everybody saw the story
7733271 a couple of kids said they might have kept the money
7733272 we cant say one way or the other even though its not a specific student
7733273 its an internal committee review were not going to be able to comment
7733274 theres something very peculiar about conducting an inquiry with a secret outcome
7733275 for the process to be believable it needs to be open and legitimate
7733276 its just a matter of the students privacy and respecting their privacy
7733277 if i start telling you other things it might give clues to who it is
7733278 if we dont pay now well pay later with increased crime
7733279 shes young and has some issues the officer said she acknowledged the baby was hers he said
7733280 if you wait around for 18 months and say ill be back later for your evidence its not going to be there
7733281 we executed a search warrant based on probable cause that evidence was being destroyed in the house democratic legislative research office you need probable cause for a search warrant
7733282 this is a delicate investigation you dont just go in and grab evidence without probable cause
7733283 mr morganelli doesnt know what has been obtained and what hasnt been obtained he doesnt know what hes talking about
7733284 these are elected officials and elected officials contribute to candidates of their party that doesnt mean theyre best friends or they go out to eat together every night
7733285 theres a lot of evidence bonuses went to a lot of senate republican staffers who were not even working in harrisburg during the time they were awarded i dont know how you reward someone for work when they were not even working in harrisburg they were on leave working on campaigns
7733286 you wont talk about the policy then take away the tasers until you can
7733287 we always seem to come together when something bad happens
7733288 were not talking about my dog here a pit bull or something
7733289 youve gotta see this is the most callous inhumane thing you could do to somebody to deal with his only son
7733290 were not talking about my dog here a pit bull or something he did nothing aggressive
7733291 they werent beating him up or nothing but the situation could have been handled differently
7733292 they were hitting him with the taser and he wasnt fighting he was just trying to get back up he didnt understand the situation were they in the wrong i dont know
7733293 ms zinda brought him in thats why she was released

7733303 russias adventure in georgia has been described as a warlet a contained firing spree that wound up and down within a week but to europes energy markets it was the equivalent of wide scale carpet bombing
7733304 before the georgian crisis europe seemed to be doing all the right things with little georgia at the centre of a sensible energy diversification plan a column of russian tanks wrecked that strategy in an instant a new energy war is about to begin
7733305 this story shows these two people who are so disconnected in this new modern world that were living in
7733306 you get to see these two people who actually connect through the internet you get to see them drop their walls
7733307 i was tired of waiting around for someone to put me in a film
7733308 they were like scoot who it was a constant uphill battle i realized these people arent going to hire me until i become a name
7733309 i decided to start finding films that im perfect for and that ill go out and get the money for
7733310 ill find a director find a writer and pretty much create my own career
7733311 i love being a part of tweaking a scene or coming up with a location or having an idea for the cast or figuring out how to remedy a situation i get to be a part of the entire creative process on lower budget films and as a producer
7733312 i would love to explore what it would be like after the apocalypse in america
7733313 you look at a lot of the directors that are directing these huge films all of these guys came from the world of making films for no money i think thats where the studios find these great directors they find a really great independent film understand this person has a great ability for storytelling and plug him right into the system
7733314 if the rate of expansion of the big bang had been smaller by even one part in a hundred thousand million million the universe would have re collapsed before it ever reached its present state
7733315 it is increasingly clear that president bush does not have a strategy for victory in iraq rather he hopes to prevent defeat and pass the problem along to his successor
7733316 the idea as in bosnia is to maintain a united iraq by decentralizing it giving each ethno religious group kurd sunni arab and shiite arab room to run its own affairs while leaving the central government in charge of common interests
7733317 fourth the president must direct the military to design a plan for withdrawing and redeploying our troops from iraq by 2008
7733318 this choice of biden is disappointing because he is the creator of the idea of dividing iraq
7733319 we rejected his proposal when he announced it and we still reject it dividing the communities and land in such a way would only lead to new fighting between people over resources and borders iraq cannot survive unless it is unified and dividing it would keep the problems alive for a long time
7733320 such a person if he would assume the vice presidency post would not serve to improve iraq usa relations

7733390 one thing thats new as you go through the campaign you know normally in rts games how they start you off with a couple of units and then its like okay two missions later were going to give you tanks one of the things were looking at doing with starcraft iis campaign is putting the choice more in the players hands so maybe you like dealing more with infantry you can purchase those upgrades and make your marines and other infantry stronger or else youll save up the credits you get from the missions to get tanks sooner than you normally could
7733391 it was never created to merely provoke controversy for controversys sake
7733392 the entire issue begs comparisons to danny ledonnes super colombine massacre rpg an unsettling and involved title that tasks players on the most basic level with acting out the 1999 littleton colorado school shooting in the role of killers eric harris and dylan klebold ledonne told the washington post that his intention with the title was never to glorify the tragedy but to confront their actions and the consequences those actions had like stanleys invaders ledonne and his title stopped short of providing a direct interpretation neither artist has been especially specific about what it means or in instructing players on how they should interpret their work or what message should be taken away
7733393 the mistake that i made however was in trying to push us too far too fast i still think the vision for gleemax is awesome creating a place on the web where hobby gamers or lifestyle gamers or thinking gamers or whatever you want to call us can gather to talk about games play games and find people to play games with but ive come to realize that the vision was too ambitious weve made progress down about ten different paths over the past eighteen months but we havent been able to reach the end of any of them yet
7733394 people love legos we just want to tap into that culture
7733395 we wanted to collaborate with them inspire them to do something new to celebrate
7733396 sometimes it works to follow and let the passion of your consumers dictate whats going to happen next
7733397 i felt a wave of hot air sweeping all over me and a terrible smell of burning
7733398 i immediately unfastened the safety belt and fell to the floor the air was cooler there and we could breathe
7733399 we take solace in the fact that its very rare
7733400 we have an unwavering commitment to keeping your food safe with standards well beyond regulatory requirements but this week our best efforts failed and we are deeply sorry
7733401 right now we are bringing back all the patrols all around iqaluit and were starting tomorrow tuesday to finish our sovereignty patrol all around here
7733402 to practise our collective ability to respond to a crisis that could happen in the future
7733403 as traffic and activity increases in the north one of the invaders most likely are infectious pathogens infectious diseases that come on board with the passengers cargo animals or otherwise
7733404 i wanted to hear what the military and the police were doing with this whole assertion of sovereignty and how they were going about it
7733405 i also wanted to go to see how much inuit representation there would be and what kind of questions that were going to be posed at this meeting unfortunately i was on the only inuit there
7733406 the three warnings about serious adverse events associated with use of atypical antipsychotic agents in elderly people with dementia had a limited effect on the prescription rates of these agents
7733407 we also found that the overall rates of use of these drugs actually increased between the first warning in 2002 and the end of our follow up in 2007
7733408 this finding highlights the limited impact of warnings and suggests that more effective approaches are needed to protect vulnerable populations from potentially hazardous medications
7733409 health care warnings should provide accurate explicit and complete information about the risks and efficacy of the identified treatment in addition to providing the same information on alternative treatments
7733410 it establishes credibility for us as a school and as a community school
7733411 it says that community schools can be effective in educating kids and that this is not about money or the lack there of but about intensity toward education
7733412 the growth calculations are more reflective of what is actually happening in our schools
7733413 it is a total effort between our teachers our community our parents and students all those things combined help us to do really well on the report cards
7733414 our teachers are willing to look at new and innovative ways of doing things
7733415 and you also have three things that go together very well in this community we have great kids great teachers and great parents
7733416 im going to let my voice be heard in the political process
7733417 i think a lot of people dont vote because they maybe dont pay attention and it is a lot of work
7733418 i went to listen to doug smith im in his district
7733419 and i went to other forums and listened to them speak and listened to what other people were asking them
7733420 im hoping for 30 percent turnout but i dont think its going to be even that
7733421 so a little more than 13 000 voters and traditionally half of the voters who cast a vote have done so before election day so if we double what we have so far thats only 26 000 or so
7733422 when you look at the races on this ballot we go from our congressional representative down to our school board members you have your judicial offices our constitutional offices and these are races that affect every registered voter at the local level
7733423 you know what they say let your voice be heard
7733424 move it you want to be up to the speed the other cars are going
7733425 all the years ive been here weve stayed on top and its a different feel were going to see how this team responds
7733426 weve been trying to get that point across for a long time
7733427 if there was a guy who had a lot of cfl experience that could get you a short term boost you might consider that but i dont believe there will be any of those kinds of guys become available
7733428 as bad as we played against calgary the ball is on the six yard line with a chance to tie the game without a late offside call against geroy simon theres a fine line between just average and good right now were not over that line
7733429 the regular price merchandisers are selling what they have at great prices
7733430 there is a lot more embellishment because daytime dresses can get a little plain there are also a lot of prints and solids this wont be minimalist
7733431 uh dude is it cool if jesse mccartney covers one of your songs
7733432 i wouldnt comment on what the premier should or shouldnt do thats not my role and thats not the boards role
7733433 im not going to comment on it at this stage im going to wait until im fully briefed on all the issues including that one
7733434 is almost a third lower than the rate that president reagan signed into law in 1986
7733435 ive never worked with a campaign that was more interested in what the research shows
7733436 often involve setting up a government program to address a market failure but then trying to harness the power of the market within that program
7733437 the market is the best mechanism ever invented for efficiently allocating resources to maximize production and i also think that there is a connection between the freedom of the marketplace and freedom more generally but there are certain things the market doesnt automatically do
7733438 the biggest bite out of most families annual tax bill
7733439 power always thinks it has a great soul and vast views beyond the comprehension
7733440 due to kill off one of its own but seeing sanchezs brother get killed for what ultimately is revealed to be no reason was just as stirring and effective

7733443 you normally have some weeks off to prepare for the last part of the season
7733444 this year i didnt have a lot of time to prepare after wimbledon for the hardcourt season
7733445 in two weeks two times 12 hours of jet lag after wimbledon i only had six or seven days to recover and before that i played queens monte carlo barcelona hamburg roland garros plus wimbledon also
7733446 i have to be very happy i must be very happy for how i did this year
7733447 if i lose in the next round hopefully not im happy about how i played this year
7733448 i just want to try to continue playing like this in this tournament
7733449 it was very exciting one week ago to win the gold medal but at the same time i knew i had to play here in one week
7733450 thats not a problem i won roland garros and in one week i have to be 100 per cent ready for wimbledon im ready for these things
7733451 given the announced issue yield for the treasury bond offered bidders will indicate the spread in basis points at which they would be prepared to sell the relevant semi government bond in exchange for purchasing an equal face value amount of the treasury bond
7733452 now we have completely taken over nbt and i want more people to join them
7733453 they cannot claim their right to rally under the constitution because armed protesters intruded into a state office
7733454 he has developed a stress hot spot in his foot and we think it is on the back of his knee injury
7733455 that is the unfortunate path we wont see matthew pavlich this friday night but having said that we have played really well in the two games we have not had him
7733456 my last conversation with him he was going to consider maybe something with the afl or maybe the two new franchises
7733457 at that stage melbourne was not in the picture but they have obviously been able to attract cameron back to his old stomping ground
7733458 he was also pretty close with jim stynes kelly odonnell and those sorts of guys they have got a big job ahead of them
7733459 our strong operating performance over the year has enabled us to deliver a solid profit against a backdrop of record high fuel prices
7733460 our strategy is not to retreat in the face of volatile oil prices softening global economies and increased competition rather we intend to strengthen our position and continue adapting our business
7733461 we believe we will emerge from this economic cycle in an even stronger competitive position
7733462 they are definitely the toughest opponents weve had in a champions league qualifier i know people expect us to get through but its not as if were playing a mickey mouse team
7733463 the belgian league has a lot of quality and their champions are used to getting into the group stages we had a tough match against anderlecht a few years ago so im not surprised liege caused us problems
7733464 they caught us a bit cold in the first leg but you have to remember that they had gone something like 30 games unbeaten in their own league and they are a club with european pedigree
7733465 we didnt play well and we know well have to improve at anfield everyone knows how important it is for our season to get into the group stage
7733466 its always a funny time for us to have such a massive game before weve got going in the season some of our results have reflected that
7733467 we lost at home to ak graz in the year we won the competition and had a narrow win in the last minute against maccabi haifa two years ago so anyone thinking well win comfortably knows thats very dangerous
7733468 i believe im at the top of my game right now and like any player i want to win things i dont want to look back on my career and think i only won the carling league cup
7733469 i want to push on and win more and thats one of the reasons why i came to liverpool another reason is the fact that ive always been a fan and if i could win something with this team it would be a dream come true
7733470 the military will not stage a coup detat the public must not panic and must carry on their daily lives the army will not get involved in politics
7733471 now we have completely taken over nbt and i want more people to join them
7733472 today is judgement day i am ready if they want to arrest me if we have to go to police headquarters this time we will not simply stay outside we will get inside there
7733473 pad have seized nbt to cut off the government communication now up to 3 000 people have occupied nbt and they plan to do their own broadcast
7733474 they cannot claim their right to rally under the constitution because armed protesters intruded into a state office
7733475 as of now the prime minister has not made any change therefore i still think that the cabinet meeting will go ahead
7733476 wait for the prime minister so far there is no special instruction
7733477 his name and what he achieved its so far out of any players reach in his time or any player who has played since its almost like he played a different game to what were playing
7733478 he would have been the stand out player whatever generation he played in
7733479 they talk about someone being the don bradman of aussie rules they equate other superstars in other sports to being somewhere near him which is pretty remarkable
7733480 is there anyone whos ever played any sport whos been able to achieve that level of greatness
7733481 what would the olympic equivalent be throwing the javelin 25 metres further than the next guy it would be a fairly dramatic increase on current records if you compared it to an olympic sport
7733482 the first thing that struck you was his stature he was quite a short little guy and very quietly spoken
7733483 but everyone in that room was in awe and everyone was sitting on the edge of their seat taking in everything he would say
7733484 i can remember just hearing his old interviews recorded before i was alive and hearing him play and as a public speaker
7733485 he was a great pusher and a great lover of cricket
7733486 when you win in three sets it is a good results
7733487 i had some difficult moments in the match so that is going to help me be prepared for the pressure moments later on
7733488 i tried to keep my level up i tried to hurry him
7733489 he was hitting his forehand really hard and making me do a bit of running
7733490 it was a decent test and i came through it pretty well
7733491 in the first set i felt like i was playing against a wall
7733492 in the second set i told myself to just play your game and dont give up
7733493 it is tough to play opponent who doesnt have anything to lose
7733494 i didnt know she was 16 until they made the announcement before the match i did as much as i needed to win the match
7733495 oh hey ill bring down some stuff you still need for your dorm oh no its cool i want to come down
7733496 i wouldnt be caught dead with a glowstick silly people in the dance tent kissing people you dont know

7733504 the bourgeoisie wherever it has got the upper hand has put an end to all feudal patriarchal idyllic relations
7733505 it has pitilessly torn asunder the motley fuedal ties that bound man to his natural superiors
7733506 and has left remaining no other nexus between man and man than naked self interest than callous cash payment it has drowned the most heavenly ecstasies of religious fervour of chivalrous enthusiasm of philistine sentimentalism in the icy water of egotistical calculation
7733507 it has resolved personal worth into exchange value and in place of the numberless indefeasible chartered freedoms has set up that single unconscionable freedom free trade
7733508 in one word for exploitation veiled by religious and political illusions it has substituted naked shameless direct brutal exploration
7733509 constant revolutionizing of production everlasting uncertainty and agitation distinguish the bourgeois epoch from all earlier ones
7733510 the need of a constantly expanding market for its products chases the bourgeoisie over the whole surface of the globe
7733511 industries no longer work up indigenous raw material but raw material drawn from the remotest zones industries whose products are consumed not only at home but in every quarter of the globe
7733512 in place of the old wants satisfied by the productions of the country we find new wants requiring for their satisfaction the products of distant lands and climes
7733513 in place of the old local and national seclusion and self sufficiency we have intercourse in every direction universal interdependence of nations and as in material so also in intellectual production the intellectual creations of individual nations become common property national one sidedness and narrow mindedness become more and more impossible and from the numerous national and local literatures there arises a world literature

7733521 there are some who are of the view that the plight of the muslims and sinhalese within a tamil dominated state is no concern of the tamil liberation struggle and some who would go even to the extent of claiming that non tamil minorities within the tamil territories who cannot accept the diktat of the tamil nationalist leadership should be encouraged to leave
7733522 come on man i was just joking here ill buy you another drink i just cant stand to see a man cry

7733541 its a continuing problem it never gets any better it only gets worse
7733542 were having severe problems especially with the branch lines the major class 1 railroads are not willing to work with the branch lines
7733543 they say that you can put it on rails but theres a capacity of how many trains you can run down the gorge to portland
7733544 were within two trains of that capacity we need both the barges and the rail
7733545 when youre putting wheat on the ground theres going to be a loss
7733546 they dont ever like to put it on the ground but when wheat is 7 8 or 10 a bushel they sure dont like to put it on the ground
7733547 were way way behind in our infrastructure investment both in the private sector and publicly
7733548 and we need to move a lot on that or we will see other countries supplant us as they get greater investment in their infrastructure
7733549 two or three dollars a ton is the difference between getting a contract or not

7733559 we did every possible tv show we did it all there were ups and downs like in everything but ralph was my friend and a great singer and i have the greatest admiration for him
7733560 ralph was very humorous he was a very funny cat actually
7733561 there was a lot of humor in sandler amp young i mostly played the straight man and he played a bit of a buffoon type and me being european was supposed to be the more suave of the pair and ralph was more the typical brash american
7733562 was considered more a bass baritone where im more a baritone cantabile
7733563 thats why i mostly harmonized with him which created that sandler amp young sound
7733564 it was just a close harmonic effect by the two baritone voices which was unique you cant predict something like that when two voices click like that its unusual and its rare

7733573 i cant imagine how hard it is for danielles family and if i could take that night back i would in a heartbeat
7733574 danielle told dona please dont let me die my sister was denied all she asked for instead she had to die all night long
7733575 that is my daughter this is what i give kisses to i dont get hugs from this this is a cold wooden box
7733576 she acted with a shocking lack of judgment over a lengthy period of time as i said in the other hearing ms huertas acted as an immature self absorbed teenager
7733577 and barack and i were raised with so many of the same values that you work hard for what you want in life that your word is your bond and you do what you say youre going to do that you treat people with dignity and respect even if you dont know them and even if you dont agree with them and barack and i set out to build lives guided by these values and pass them on to the next generation because we want our children and all children in this nation to know that the only limit to the height of your achievements is the reach of your dreams and your willingness to work for them
7733578 all of us driven by a simple belief that the world as it is just wont do that we have an obligation to fight for the world as it should be that is the thread that connects our hearts that is the thread that runs through my journey and baracks journey and so many other improbable journeys that have brought us here tonight where the current of history meets this new tide of hope
7733579 that is why i love this country and in my own life in my own small way ive tried to give back to this country that has given me so much thats why i left a job at a law firm for a career in public service working to empower young people to volunteer in their communities because i believe that each of us no matter what our age or background or walk of life each of us has something to contribute to the life of this nation
7733580 and in the end after all thats happened these past 19 months the barack obama i know today is the same man i fell in love with 19 years ago hes the same man who drove me and our new baby daughter home from the hospital ten years ago this summer inching along at a snails pace peering anxiously at us in the rearview mirror feeling the whole weight of her future in his hands determined to give her everything hed struggled so hard for himself determined to give her what he never had the affirming embrace of a fathers love
7733581 so tonight in honor of my fathers memory and my daughters future out of gratitude to those whose triumphs we mark this week and those whose everyday sacrifices have brought us to this moment let us devote ourselves to finishing their work let us work together to fulfill their hopes and let us stand together to elect barack obama president of the united states of america
7733582 to change america to restore its future to rise to our best ideals
7733583 he talked about the world as it is and the world as it should be and he said that all too often we accept the distance between the two and settle for the world as it is even when it doesnt reflect our values and aspirations but he reminded us that we know what our world should look like we know what fairness and justice and opportunity look like and he urged us to believe in ourselves to find the strength within ourselves to strive for the world as it should be

7733610 ellos me pidieron que rescindi ramos el contrato de mi programa el 2 en la naci n cr tico del gobierno porque ten an miedo de que no le renovaran la licencia de ser atacadas las instalaciones o se generara violencia contra el canal
7733611 yo entend sus razones me manifestaron que estaban intimidados que estaban con miedo y que ellos priorizaban el empleo de 200 trabajadores ellos son due os de su propio miedo

7733616 we have come to the end of 16 days which we will cherish forever
7733617 new stars were born and stars from previous games continued to amaze us
7733618 we shared their joys and their tears and marvelled at their abilities and will long remember their achievements here
7733619 such repressive measures will not work we will emerge stronger and more vibrant
7733620 no student should be afraid to take the cat common admission test for fear of fees our effort would be to make iims as egalitarian as possible
7733621 after the hike one of the iims is charging about rs 3 lakh for a post graduate programme which is now helping the institute function smoothly
7733622 the iims enjoy a fairly good amount of autonomy i do not see any problem with that anyway power cannot be given it has to be earned
7733623 arent lovers or family packages very common in todays market
7733624 get one free minute for each minute of on net calls
7733625 uniform fee rates for on net and off net calls
7733626 we have made very clear to the un envoy that the mission should not discuss the upcoming 2010 elections as the nld does not recognise the military backed constitution
7733627 the un envoy was wasting his time on matters that he was not supposed to deal with
7733628 any type of penetration including sodomy or manipulation of childs body for penetration
7733629 we will upgrade the cyber security of our computer lab
7733630 though we have been conducting workshops on cyber crimes for our faculty we will now take more steps towards cyber security since computers are available to students as well
7733631 in the light of what has happened we are definitely reworking our internet security we are studying the details and also talking to our in house it professionals
7733632 we definitely need more internal security and are going to talk to our computer experts about increasing it

7733635 ap can change your life through college level ap courses you enter a universe of knowledge that might otherwise remain unexplored in high school through ap exams you have the opportunity to earn credit or advanced standing at most of the nations colleges and universities
7733636 high school ap courses do not predict college success in science
7733637 it appears that the educational benefits of an ap science course as opposed to a regular high school honors course are smaller than students and teachers have been led to believe
7733638 please continue doing what youre doing i like paying high prices for oil and cant wait until we force all americans to stop using gas powered cars and switch to electric or natural gas powered vehicles
7733639 is so much easier to talk about than to do
7733640 mccain equals more of the same old same old of bush
7733641 barack is more of the same old same old of you and your democrat ilk
7733642 pertemuan pertama berlangsung di jakarta desember 2007 dan yang kedua di canberra april lalu rencananya presentasi tentang economic modeling pemodelan ekonomi nya dilakukan agustus ini tapi australia sebelumnya mengindikasikan pentingnya pertemuan singapura
7733643 dalam hal ini australia sudah mengusulkan agar semua pihak menyelesaikan komitmen aanzfta
7733644 kami benar benar melihat peran bagi tercapainya perjanjian perjanjian bilateral dan regional tetapi semua itu harus konsisten dengan tujuan tujuan multilateral kami australia
7733645 i havent worried about that because i cant control that
7733646 i feel like ive done a lot for this team over the last five years ive had some unfortunate things happen to me and some bad games but for the most part i feel like ive been a pretty good contributor to this organization in winning a lot of games
7733647 i was a little surprised but ive had some time to digest it
7733648 i was in this battle i felt this was a great option to come back and start it didnt happen the seasons right around the corner and im not anticipating anything happening but i have to be ready because that moment could be the biggest moment of my career and i have to take off and be ready to go
7733649 ill never fully get over getting beaten out and i dont think anybody would expect me to
7733650 my motivation is to be a great player in this league and a starter again
7733651 discs are shock absorbers between vertebral bodies and a 360 degree part of the anatomy dont think of it as when a piece of paper tears think of an orange if an orange is injured or marked on one side it doesnt mean you cant injure it on the other side too one might be on the front the other on the back this is what the bears were referring to
7733652 the mckinsey global survey of business executives business and society
7733653 barbara during one of her interactions with rakesh roshan told him that she loves singing she has a good voice and even wants to cut an album in the future since her track revolves around a girl who cant communicate in the same language as hrithik the film will have her sing a few lines in spanish
7733654 if for example sik sr released with say less number of prints i dont think they would gross the same amount
7733655 on a totally different note tdk looked to get to 530m up until last weekend but this weekend it took
7733656 when i referred chinks in jays methodology it was regarding arriving at nett number
7733657 did everything he was a carpenter a multipurpose utility player he was a very popular employee forever upbeat he was very giving
7733658 over the history of the church this is an issue of controversy
7733659 since the first century the church has affirmed the moral evil of every procured abortion this teaching has not changed and remains unchangeable
7733660 speaker of the house nancy pelosi is a gifted public servant of strong convictions and many professional skills regrettably knowledge of catholic history and teaching does not seem to be one of them
7733661 is always gravely evil and so are the evasions employed to justify it
7733662 we are here for one purpose to give the party momentum going into the general election so that come november barack obama will become the president of the united states
7733663 now in a first for me im supporting a republican john mccain i respect his maverick and independent streak and now hes the one with the experience and judgment
7733664 im here to tell you my name is hillary clinton and i do not support this message
7733665 absolutely convinced that both hillary clinton and bill clinton understand the stakes sen clinton has pledged wholehearted support to my campaign as has president clinton
7733666 if he wants to win the election he needs to get the vast majority of hillary supporters her strongest support is where hes weakest white working class men and women
7733667 they have to make those voters comfortable with barack obama have to make them think hes part of the american dream
7733668 there are people who are not going to vote for him because hes black
7733669 and weve got to hope that we can educate people to put aside their racism and to put their own interests no 1
7733670 the work begins anew the hope rises again and the dream lives on
7733671 that you work hard for what you want in life that your word is your bond and you do what you say youre going to do that you treat people with dignity and respect even if you dont know them and even if you dont agree with them
7733672 there is no doubt in anyones mind that this is barack obamas convention
7733673 feel an obligation to the people who sent them here
7733674 the democratic party strongly and unequivocally supports roe v wade and a womans right to choose a safe and legal abortion regardless of ability to pay and we oppose any and all efforts to weaken or undermine that right
7733675 really cant explain the price of gas or what has happened to the middle class
7733676 do we really want four more years of the same old tune
7733677 we are ready to compete in all 50 states in november
7733678 theres a moment that you want to enjoy your bitterness
7733679 im getting a lot of calls and e mails especially from women who are quite upset that she was not vetted for vice president even though senator obama said she was on the short list
7733680 to stay wallowing in all of this is not productive
7733681 we will continue to hang in there are other investors who have put 40 50 m its not a big thing

7733683 wat denk je ik ben ziek en moet naar buiten
7733684 what is the best use of my time right now
7733685 as a former resident of ladbroke grove i have watched the notting hill carnival go from strength to strength each year to become an internationally acclaimed event nothing beats the sounds of the steel pans the aroma of delicious caribbean food and the dazzling colours of the costume parade
7733686 the number of arrests is up on last year but that is predominantly because of proactive policing
7733687 to reach the very top of any sport requires years of hard work focus and complete dedication all traits which rebecca has in abundance
7733688 i would say some people thought we were going to die that is how frightening it was the woman sitting in the seats in front of us was whimpering
7733689 so they must have flipped a switch here to make that enemy run across the screen then shut it off to make it disappear again
7733690 shut up bigger brain bald man who talk cool killing now
7733691 wouldnt the release of violent offenders require the authority of some legal office above and beyond a wardens decisions
7733692 you got what you wanted tiger how does it taste
7733693 its incumbent upon you to bring forward some examples of where this works
7733694 what youre talking about is going to be a huge undertaking
7733695 either we are serious about energy savings or were not
7733696 bring us some names of contractors some communities that have done this its misleading to the public to frame this as being the only way were serious about saving energy
7733697 john knott former town attorney told us we would still have an obligation to go to referendum for any performance contract agreement that is above 350 000
7733698 the idea of having savings pay down the debt on a performance contract has enormous potential but its still viewed as debt on the books
7733699 if we wait until the need arises it will be too late now is the time
7733700 ayer trat de dormir pero no pude estuve mirando la ceremonia de clausura de los juegos en pek n fue impresionante todav a estoy disfrutando mi medalla de oro ol mpica
7733701 a light has come on but i dont know what it means
7733702 it was going from one side to the other until it fell i remember people on the ground smoke explosions and then i lost consciousness
7733703 i was saved by the paramedics its thanks to them im alive i feel like ive been born again
7733704 the fault fixed by spanairs maintenance technicians could not have had an influence on the crash
7733705 the failure of one motor does not cause an accident im not so sure the engine failed
7733706 everything we did with the aircraft was by the rules
7733707 what about a demo of sorts a game like this wont ever see my purchase if i cant even try it out
7733708 will bring a new level of energy and excitement to the show
7733709 they always tried for a fourth judge because it followed the format of the original show pop idol
7733710 we havent had much luck with that working but were going to give it another try
7733711 thats going to be weird if its a split decision
7733712 im sure simon will get to make the final judgment but that takes the fun out of all the hard work i do to push those kids through
7733713 i just think any intelligent human being has to remain if you can objective
7733714 i like the idea that everyones free to think what it is they think as long as it doesnt hurt anyone else
7733715 weve never fought in our lives and we get along better than any other couple i know
7733716 making clothes together in our studio makes us feel complete
7733717 an obama advisor invited diddy to the convention but he was unable to attend because he was supposed to be in l a on vacation with his family
7733718 he didnt do the democrats any favors with that vote or die campaign it became more about getting the shirts out than people registered he didnt seem totally aware of the big picture that there was a presidency involved
7733719 that ad took on a life of its own no one wants to actually hurt the campaign and i mean really its not hard for celebrities to steal the spotlight at times
7733720 she has not rented a house to stay in while shes there
7733721 but new york took it a bit further than he was comfortable with
7733722 roger federer was supposed to do our magazine but he pulled out after the nadal cover athletes arent used to getting the celebrity treatment when it comes to their bodies it can be a bit of a gamble if you dont have control over the images
7733723 im just gonna speak to simon the way i speak to everybody
7733724 im just gonna have my opinion be honest and i dont foresee any problems im really excited about this and up for the challenge
7733725 its really flattering too you know to think that idol even thought about me
7733726 i mean when i got the call i thought they were calling the wrong person so im the and im hoping everyones gonna go easy on me and that i bring a lot to the table
7733727 we are turning the heat up on idol this year and are thrilled to welcome kara to the judges table
7733728 she is a smart sassy lady and one of americas most successful songwriters we know she will bring a new level of energy and excitement to the show
7733729 weve seen from our international series that having a fourth judge creates a dynamic that benefits both the contestants and the viewers
7733730 id say i believe in what i believe in and im willing to fight for it and im pretty feisty
7733731 editorial the case for re naming qchat as direct connect 3g
7733732 the concrete went through the windshield and landed between driver and front seat passenger
7733733 there were firefighters inside the vehicle tending to the patients inside talking with them
7733734 i was surprised and the crew was surprised at how calm they were
7733735 either he didnt put his hydraulic lift down after his last drop or it somehow went up while he was driving
7733736 i saw a car with a huge piece of metal sticking out of it
7733737 the mom and dad were checking in with the kids
7733738 you wouldnt have wanted to show up on the scene without a medical background
7733739 it was an incident that took place virtually right next to the fair
7733740 his gut reaction was to go there and see it for himself see if could help in any way
7733741 with the amount of cement that was ripped away from the pedestrian bridge its a wonder everyone in the suv wasnt killed
7733742 he just offered whatever help he could anything we needed from the state
7733743 i dont think in a case like that they need the governors presence to do that quickly
7733744 im sure it doesnt hurt but thats something dot is going to do quickly anyway
7733745 share restrictions and asset pricing evidence from the hedge fund industry
7733746 paramedics said she was the mother and wanted to turn it over to the fire department
7733747 what i can tell you right now is the law is working in l a county
7733748 the number of surrenders has gone up and the number of abandonments has gone down
7733749 these mothers are in dire situations the law exists to give such mothers an option
7733750 were not discussing why she would do something like this
7733751 we have a lot of families that really believe in education and support education those are assets that are tough to duplicate
7733752 there was slow progress in recent times but with the advent of the massive cuts and increase in class size the result is these test scores
7733753 the american lung association is going to add it as a risk factor
7733754 its not nearly the danger of smoking a pack a day for 20 years but its a danger
7733755 it must be made clear however that an investor to a fund that captures underdeveloped country discounts in the generation of greenhouse gas emissions must be cognizant of important issues such as the risks involved in the creation of new credits the lengthy and tedious administrative processes to establishing a carbon credit worthy project the verification and validation of real emission reductions as well as the more obvious macro components affecting the supply and demand and ultimately the prices of credits
7733756 we will be the number one in 2008 in china theres no doubt about that
7733757 we figure if we do those little things it pays huge dividends in the long run
7733758 this is going to be one beautiful book i had to do a page so i could get a copy of this book
7733759 the democratic party strongly and unequivocally supports roe v wade and a womans right to choose a safe and legal abortion regardless of ability to pay and we oppose any and all efforts to weaken or undermine that right
7733760 ik ben hillary clinton en ik sta niet achter deze boodschap
7733761 ik ben die persoon en ik sta achter deze boodschap
7733762 vergis u niet we zijn verenigd voor de verandering natuurlijk aangezien we democraten zijn kan dat tijd vergen
7733763 we zijn geen partij van jaknikkers we zijn verscheiden en meerstemmig
7733764 to lead a nation you must first lead a line dance
7733765 i wonder what emmy is a blob i hope or something more detailed and related to fine art maybe
7733766 you mean herself a dog she wouldnt have to dress up for that one
7733767 we have yet another new student hopefully it will be our last
7733768 now children brian didnt bring any costume for our halloween parade which i might remind you is at 10 30 this morning
7733769 did you see that brian he was a hunk until his hair turned purple gosh
7733770 cassie thinks the music at the dentists office rocks figures its richard marx
7733771 this new boy in our class is a babe almost better than kirk cameron
7733772 are you crazy what does he look like tell all
7733773 chad allen only better baby blue eyes and gorgeous wavy blond hair only tiffanie colored his hair purple grody
7733774 this dorky girl in my class if she laughs she gets the hiccups
7733775 weird now get out because i want to hear endless summer nights
7733776 kelly i feel sick i think i should go home
7733777 maggie im so sorry i know you really liked him but i like him too and he likes me so im gonna do what i want and go with him you might not like it but im doing whats right for me im sorry if it makes you angry with me but if i had my way wed still be friends by the way theyre taking rags to riches off the air
7733778 where she develops and mentors fellow hit writers producers and artists
7733779 i wanted to squish you squeeze your head off and dangle you from my rear view mirror
7733780 the information is serious if many media outlets still see russia as the aggressor in the south ossetian direction the plan for seizing sukhumi is so clear that we shall be able to prove that georgia was the aggressor in the second direction as well
7733781 i am just giving warning that we will not allow georgia to conduct reconnaissance work with impunity we reserve the right to respond appropriately
7733782 its premature to say that it was a valid threat or that these folks have the ability to carry it out
7733783 were absolutely confident there is no credible threat to the candidate the democratic national convention or the people of colorado
7733784 it could also turn out that these were nothing but a bunch of knuckleheads meth heads
7733785 we agreed to make joint efforts to ensure the six party talks process enters a new phase
7733786 north korean defectors wont be forcibly sent back to the north against their will
7733787 there was no warning we werent coming at them they were coming at us
7733788 we must remain nonviolent we must have the high moral ground
7733789 theres a powerful police presence here the chill of 1968 is in the air of denver
7733790 we are now controlling most of the key government offices to prevent them from coming to work
7733791 today we declare a long long holiday for the government
7733792 the gergen proposal would treat some distributions to partners as payments for services the gergen approach would be easy to avoid using debt rather than limited partnership interests would make any such rules entirely inapplicable because there would be no partnership if a partnership must be used the transaction could be documented as the fleischer schmolka structure that is if the profits interest were documented as a loan from the limited partners to the general partner and a contribution of the loaned money the general partner would unquestionably be receiving a return on contributed capital the two percent management fee would be their compensation for services thus the significant complexity that the gergen approach would introduce would be for naught or at least very little the levin approach is similar to the gergen approach but rather than adopting a straight up allocation rule it would merely require a reasonable allocation between labor and capital similar avoidance mechanisms such as the use of debt would be similarly easy to use moreover simply rearranging the labels on the current partnership structure would get around the levin bill for example if the various returns paid to private equity sponsors are combined into a single return the sponsors could allocate two thirds of their returns as service income without changing their tax results at all auditors would have little basis to challenge such an allocation more complex restructurings such as loans from the limited partners to the sponsor who would then contribute the capital to the partnership would make a challenge to the allocations even more difficult the result would be less efficient and transparent capital structures an increase in tax controversies and little or no additional revenue more subtle rules that attempt to distinguish more accurately would be complex and yet remain inaccurate this was the very problem faced by congress when enacting section 707 a 2 a twenty three years after passage of this rule the treasury has yet to issue regulations because there is no easy way to make the distinction between labor income and capital income the levin bill simply glosses over this central problem hiding its complexities behind a rule that allocations must be reasonable the fleischer schmolka approach suffers from similar problems the underlying rationale is that uneven sharing of returns to capital represents implicit loans that should be recognized this is a more accurate measure of the return to services than the gergen approach but would likely be impossible to implement it would be necessary to identify when one partner has implicitly loaned funds to another partner and then impute an appropriate cost of capital if allocations are not straight up it would be impossible to identify implicit loans at a deeper level the capital accounts system required by the 704 b regulations does not incorporate time value concepts except to a limited extent in the substantiality test without time value concepts incorporated into capital accounts there can be all kinds of internal loans among the partners attempting to revise the capital accounts rules to incorporate time value concepts however is a daunting prospect and would likely make the partnership tax rules entirely unworkable to illustrate a typical private equity partnership uses a hurdle rate the limited partners get the first 8 or 9 percent of the return once that return is achieved the general partners get an allocation so that the overall return is split 80 20 this could be restated as a nonrecourse loan with a fixed return of eight percent and a contingent return of 80 percent of all profits above 10 percent with a fixed return of eight percent it would easily exceed any requirement of paying minimal interest as required by the fleischer schmolka approach indeed if we view the limited partnership interests as financial instruments issued to sophisticated third party investors there is no question that they are compensated for the use of capital tax rules that treat this return as inadequate would be ignoring the economic realities
7733793 porque ser defensor de los derechos humanos no es sin nimo de terrorista
7733794 la entrega hubiese funcionado habr amos tenido una nueva pel cula del personaje para esta navidad o para la del 2009 pero ahora los planes son reintroducir a superman trataremos de ir a lo m s oscuro hasta el punto en que el personaje lo permita

7733797 what about a demo of sorts a game like this wont ever see my purchase if i cant even try it out
7733798 ordinal scales for reporting authors contributions to manuscripts were more sensitive than tick boxes for assessing the appropriateness of authorship
7733799 well i cant test this fully without my actual control panel
7733800 i dont know how this features gonna work without my full control panel
7733801 the implementation of this new manufacturing process was done intelligently with both quality and cost in mind
7733802 id like to congratulate and thank the team for their dedication while bringing these important new products to market to help satisfy the changing needs of our dodge and chrysler customers
7733803 the members of uaw local 1183 continue to prove that they have the expertise the experience the training and the professionalism to successfully accomplish the most demanding and complex work
7733804 this demonstration of excellence is something the men and women of uaw 1183 and uaw 1212 should be proud of
7733805 we are proud of the highly skilled and dedicated employees at chryslers newark plant
7733806 the employees at newark assembly continue to work hard to ensure the success of this new product line and we are looking forward to these new hybrid vehicles being available to the public
7733807 it happens annually just like the mutya ng davao the difference is the mutya ng davao is catered during
7733808 they never gave us any formal notification we are kind of out of luck
7733809 new anti malarial agents are urgently needed to stop this unacceptable loss of life
7733810 the stock was bad last year and now it has been cut in half this year
7733811 im hoping for a rebound maybe to get me back some of these losses is last weeks one day rally a sign that it hit bottom
7733812 for every dollar they lose in print ad revenue newspapers online operations industrywide are recapturing maybe 14 cents
7733813 cutting costs in the face of declining revenues is a survival mechanism not a buy signal
7733814 its going to be something people are going to want to see
7733815 the presentations impressed upon me how much witchcraft and how little science has gone into the study of cryoprotectant agents cpas this might be understandable in light of the fact that most cryobiologists are in fact biologists i suspect that a great deal could be accomplished by a thorough study of the physics of the chemistry of cpas
7733816 it is not surprising that all the agents which are effective in shock carry a negative charge this applies both to heparin which possesses a very strong negative charge and to hypertonic glucose solution the same may be said about a substance now in wide use dextran which has small negatively charged molecules and also about the glucocorticoids 21 17 and 11 which also have a negative charge
7733817 we report that estrogen and estrogen derivatives within the hydroxyl group in the c3 position on the a ring of the steroid molecule can also act as powerful neuroprotectants in an estrogen receptor independent short term manner because of to their antioxidative capacity
7733818 minocyclines direct radical scavenging property is consistent with its chemical structure which includes a multiply substituted phenol ring similar to alpha tocopherol vitamin e
7733819 it is notable however that nad and minocycline share a carboxamide and aromatic ring structure
7733820 questa sera sono io con te michele lhanno messo al proiettore mi chiamo mariella
7733821 voi giovani siete incredibili fate le manifestazioni contro la guerra e poi vi vestite come i militari
7733822 nessuno lo pu sapere con precisione ma i fogli di giornale che sono nel suo stesso strato di rifiuti sono datati marzo 1988
7733823 venti anni sepolto sotto i rifiuti cosa diremo adesso alla gente
7733824 non il primo ritrovamento di angeli che avviene il vaticano per non vuole che si sappia questo il terzo gli altri due corpi li tengono custoditi in una cripta hanno fatto gli esami al carbonio quattordici i loro corpi hanno oltre diecimila anni ne hanno trovato uno in palestina laltro in germania questo il terzo

7733827 the rules of this convention preclude my acceptance tonight but 32 years ago another young candidate who wanted to get this country moving again came to this convention to say a simple thank you and so like john f kennedy i just want to say thank you and to let you know that tomorrow night youre going to see the real comeback kid
7733828 vandalized to the tune of tens of thousands of dollars
7733829 the interior area vandalized such as the classroom windows reinforced with mesh was going to be reused in the upgraded building the incident most certainly did not communicate a very positive image to the contractors in view of the bid opening two weeks from now
7733830 most contractors after viewing the vandalism will most likely go with a higher bid to compensate for any future potential damage that may occur
7733831 to date that window has not been boarded as requested by the police department
7733832 were sending a bad message if you want to steal or vandalize go ahead and do it
7733833 despite the board majority opinion i think this is an act of vandalism
7733834 we must prosecute to the fullest extent of the law anyone who trespasses on our property to commit vandalism or to steal any materials whether it be in dumpsters recycling containers or the storage of materials
7733835 if stealing become prevalent this will drastically increase if not cancel the builders risk policy due to numerous incidents
7733836 mereka digagalkan keberangkatannya ke kuala lumpur malaysia karena seluruhnya menggunakan dokumen bebas fiskal palsu jika mereka sampai ke malaysia malah akan semakin sengsara
7733837 kami semua diajak secara perorangan dari lombok dengan biaya maksimal rp 4 juta karena relatif murah itu kami tertarik tidak tahunya malah jadi seperti ini
7733838 citi peka menghargai upaya dan kerja keras para pengusaha mikro kami terus berupaya menumbuhkan rasa percaya diri mereka untuk terus berkembang meskipun mereka harus menghadapai berbagai tantangan
7733839 saya sedang membaca laporan tiba tiba kepala terasa pening dan benda di sekitar bergoyang tadinya saya pikir kepala saya memang pening ternyata teman teman lain berteriak ada gempa
7733840 going to shoot obama from a high vantage point using a rifle sighted at 750 yards
7733841 he loved fishing but he was a peoples person with a lot of friends and family and all the good people loved to be surrounded by him
7733842 he used to look after all of us and we all have a lot of support and friends and family because of him
7733843 the thing he might be able to tell us is things like were the two men standing on the boat waving before it happened or had the boat broken down or were they not watching and didnt see the wave
7733844 theres so many different variables and factors he might be able to help us with
7733845 each of us also comes here tonight by way of our own improbable journey i come here as a wife who loves my husband and believes he will be an extraordinary president
7733846 i come here as a mom whose girls are the heart of my heart and the centre of my world theyre the first thing i think about when i wake up in the morning and the last thing i think about when i go to bed at night their future and all our childrens future is my stake in this election
7733847 confident but not cocky a team player who improves the game of those around him and he will not back down
7733848 barack and i were raised with so many of the same values that you work hard for what you want in life that your word is your bond and you do what you say youre going to do that you treat people with dignity and respect even if you dont know them and even if you dont agree with them
7733849 and barack and i set out to build lives guided by these values and pass them on to the next generation because we want our children and all children in this nation to know that the only limit to the height of your achievements is the reach of your dreams and your willingness to work for them
7733850 the same man she fell in love with 19 years ago
7733851 they just want to go home its a nightmare being on the run with a little baby
7733852 where are they going to get that money out of your pocket
7733853 this is just a small part in alleviating some of the problems in the park
7733854 most people straightened the creek themselves its great for you but your neighbor gets blasted out
7733855 dengan demikian tercipta kesadaran dan penerapan atas tanggung jawab sosial perusahaan
7733856 saya belum bisa memutuskan apakah dia bakal jadi isteri saya atau tidak enggak enak saja kalau sudah diajak ajak tahu tahu kami putus
7733857 jangakan ke acara keluarga pasangan diajak ke acara teman temannya saja saya ogah haha habis saya malas harus berbasa basi lebih baik disuruh mengantar dia ke mana saja daripada harus menemani ke acara keluarga besarnya
7733858 suatu kali saya diajak pacar ke acara keluarga besarnya saya seperti orang asing di sana karena tak bisa ngobrol sama mereka saya hanya senyam senyum karena tak mengerti apa yang mereka obrolkan kalau tahu begitu lebih baik nunggu di tempat makan dan saya jemput setelah acara kelar
7733859 terkadang perempuan tidak melihat situasi sudah tahu lelah masih juga diajak ke acara keluarganya kalau ditolak mereka senewen menuduh kami macam macam padahal alasannya cuma satu capek
7733860 saya pernah hampir menikahi sepupu pasangan kejadiannya memang sudah tiga tahun dan pasangan pun tahu tapi tetap saja saya tak enak hati kalau bertemu lagi apalagi sampai bertemu orangtuanya makanya saya tak pernah mau diajak kumpul bersama keluarganya karena dia pasti ada di sana
7733861 kita memerlukan upaya upaya serius untuk mempertahankan kelangsungan produksi pangan mengingat laju pertumbuhan penduduk semakin tinggi berkisar 1 3 persen per tahunnya
7733862 pelaku pasar aktif membeli dollar as karena mata uang asing itu di pasar global menguat terhadap mata uang asia mengakibatkan rupiah turun tajam
7733863 kami optimis mata uang lokal itu akan terus terpuruk hingga mencapai level rp 9 200 per dollar as
7733864 namun bi untuk sementara itu hanya memantau saja karena pergerakan rupiah dinilai masih stabil berada di bawah angka rp 9 200 per dollar as
7733865 i like paying 5 a glass for an import that tastes identical to budweiser
7733866 i know that in this community people want to be connected and want to be involved
7733867 our downfall is that we havent done a good job in communicating for a long time we took the low hanging fruit and went to the same people were trying to broaden that base
7733868 financially you might not be able to donate money but you can make a difference if you volunteer your time
7733869 mille j rgi te otsustate et haige on terveks saanud

7733872 seru juga kali ya berciuman sambil nunggu cucian di tempat laundry seperti yang dilakukan ross dan rachel dalam friends
7733873 ih seru gimana itu mah bukan budaya kita kayak enggak ada tempat lain aja
7733874 tapi bahwa hasrat itu bisa muncul kapan saja sekali lagi itu bagian dari insting manusia yang wajar dan alamiah sekali
7733875 kalau menurut saya hasrat seksual adalah hak tiap individu harusnya bukan dilarang dengan undang undang justru batasan moral yang harus lebih diefektifkan
7733876 di tengah budaya masyarakat yang makin permisif public display of affection atau mengumbar kemesraan di tempat umum sepertinya semakin longgar
7733877 orang orang dengan kepribadian ekstrovert atau terbuka akan lebih mudah menerima dan melakukannya
7733878 lo memang kenapa kalau saya melakukannya toh saya tidak mengganggu orang lain
7733879 ini yang membuat masyarakat jadi ambigu di satu pihak mereka bisa menerima hal ini sebagai sebuah pemahaman tapi untuk diri sendiri masih cenderung konservatif
7733880 kalau setuju ya silakan jalan tapi kalau tidak ya jangan lakukan yang penting tidak mengganggu orang lain
7733881 jangan sampai satu pihak merasa puas tapi pihak lain malah tertekan ini juga tidak sehat untuk kelangsungan kehidupan seksual keduanya
7733882 kalau di sini sih orang biasanya masih malu dilihatin seperti itu
7733883 well just have to wait and see what happens with that
7733884 we played some excellent football its a difficult place to come last year we drew here the year before we lost so its a bonus
7733885 we tried to get a system where the players were comfortable in their positions we used the players in the right way
7733886 long term what we have to do is go ahead and make a decision
7733887 if these are public entities then they have to get out of the profit making business and if they are private entities then we dont bail them out
7733888 then probably the financial system would receive such a body blow that it could be disastrous obama said
7733889 you probably couldnt get a mortgage out there because a lot of people package these mortgages that get bought up in the secondary market
7733890 no sympathy for the chief executive officers of the companies and said they
7733891 the first round is always difficult hopefully i will play better in the next round
7733892 i didnt play well here last year but in 2006 i played fine hopefully i will play better this year
7733893 i was trying to stay focussed as well as i could
7733894 its a matter of how fresh i can stay for this tournament i want to get some rest and make sure i dont practise as much as i did in beijing i need to save some energy for this tournament
7733895 i ask forgiveness from aek supporters but you cant say no to such a proposal
7733896 it has been a tough day i had to make a very difficult decision something very positive has come up late in my career and i cannot turn it down
7733897 when i went to beijing i left him for two weeks and it was heart breaking not so much my husband but my son
7733898 its obviously not easy to be a family when you have two working parents and one travelling
7733899 well have to see how i feel if theres any motivation how it affects everybody thats involved with us and take it from there
7733900 each time i play a grand slam i always think that it could be my last time playing here
7733901 ive obviously learned that i have no idea what the future kind of holds and what will happen
7733902 im a conservative and i make no bones about it
7733903 let there be no mistake about it we are united
7733904 i imagine nothing would keep him away from a democratic convention
7733905 tonight will be an opportunity for the american people to be introduced to senator obama once again to learn about his values from people who know him best
7733906 the story of barack obama is firmly rooted in the american tradition
7733907 i am asking you to those of you who supported me i will be forever grateful to work as hard for barack obama as you worked for me during the primary
7733908 hillary wants us to support obama the same way we supported her and thats what we are gonna do
7733909 senator and president clinton fully support the obama biden ticket and look forward to addressing the convention and the nation on the urgency of victory this fall
7733910 anyone saying anything else doesnt know what theyre talking about period
7733911 we hope it will strengthen relations between country and city weve already met some lovely people from glen waverley although we are small in number we can be stimulated by a strong vibrant city congregation
7733912 blind knowledge is working at useless ground and crazy faith is living the dream of its liturgy a new god is a word or the mere sound dont seek and dont trust for all is mystery
7733913 i had somebody with an indian accent call me one year to ask when passover was so he would know when to look for the coca cola made with sugar
7733914 these are people who love coca cola as it used to be
7733915 sugar lends a different flavor its not as sweet and its much fizzier and foamier
7733916 they can notice a significant bump in sales because of their kosher for passover status
7733917 if they were not kosher for passover they would experience a drop in sales for an eight day period
7733918 almost 70 percent of american jews participate in at least one seder
7733919 trentanni fa la parabola di giovanni paolo i mostrato piuttosto che dato
7733920 ecco la sfida che il papa lancia ai partecipanti al meeting
7733921 my job as president would be to try to make sure that we are tightening the screws diplomatically on iran that weve mobilized the world community to go after irans program in a serious way to get sanctions in place so that iran starts making a difficult calculation
7733922 weve got to do that before israel feels like its back is to the wall
7733923 i am inside the camp kalma now there is still shooting
7733924 the idps internally displaced people are resisting we are expecting casualties
7733925 they the government of sudan want to demolish kalma camp they want to force people to leave
7733926 the whole purpose here is to mentor support and launch healthy companies into the economy on their own
7733927 i just have the world of respect for what burns is doing

7733931 hows it feel to be named after dog food chow
7733932 you can call me cheap but this is my gottdamn money
7733933 well it sounds weird but i guess i can try it if you really want
7733934 its premature to say that it was a valid threat or that these folks have the ability to carry it out
7733935 were absolutely confident there is no credible threat to the candidate the democratic national convention or the people of colorado
7733936 it could also turn out that these were nothing but a bunch of knuckleheads meth heads
7733937 este lunes el betis har oficial el fichaje del jugador ya que todo est atado s lo falta que pase la revisi n m dica el jugador jugar cedido y el betis tendr una opci n de compra

7733939 i want to welcome him first the entire family has come the women in our households seldom stir out but tonight they are all here the village was all keyed up preparing for this unforgettable day
7733940 i cannot explain how happy i am to see so many people turning up to receive me this reception is motivational enough for me to work with renewed vigour to win gold next time

7733943 david s extensive experience in it and business management puts him in a strong position to lead vmware s business and support customer requirements across greater china said carl eschenbach executive vice president of worldwide field operations vmware
7733944 vmware offers the industry s broadest portfolio of virtualization solutions vmware is in a unique position to help organizations in greater china fast track their adoption of virtualization to support their growth
7733945 as we elect a republican house and senate and as we elect republican leadership in the executive branch we see very little changes on that issue were electing someone who agrees with us on abortion being sort of a tragedy in our country and yet cant get anything done the executive branch doesnt have that much power it has some power but it doesnt have much power
7733946 i come here as a wife who loves my husband and believes he will be an extraordinary president
7733947 all of us are driven by a simple belief that the world as it is just wont do that we have an obligation to fight for the world as it should be
7733948 that is the thread that connects our hearts that is the thread that runs through my journey and baracks journey and so many other improbable journeys that have brought us here tonight where the current of history meets this new tide of hope and you see that is why i love this country
7733949 if there is anything i am lacking in ive got to tell you it is taste in music and art and other great things in life
7733950 ive got to say that a lot of my taste in music stopped about the time i impacted a surface to air missile with my own airplane and never caught up again
7733951 is that the puertorican culture bullshiet i paid 3 dollars for a m amp m
7733952 talentou di barriow its the puertorican low budget scarface version with no artistic significance i prefer the carmen luvanas version lady scarface
7733953 what the hell i accept it i watch the barrio but where in the movie was the talento
7733954 multiply the movie 8mile x get rich or die trying x scarface plus a pile of crap put some sugar and portorican bullshit and you will get

7733961 gamesa has a western european approach to dealing with people that embraces the concept of corporate social responsibility
7733962 while job outsourcing corporate bankruptcies layoffs and unfair negotiations are rampant this years labor day list employers and their employees unions tell another story they are proving that tumultuous labor relations are a thing of the past not the future
7733963 these companies buck the trend and showcase the strength that comes when workers and management create long lasting productive partnerships economic success does not have to come at the expense of workers rights
7733964 we dont have a we they mentality that often accompanies a union we have a relationship thats cooperative
7733965 you only need one outfit for the first day to look snazzy
7733966 i definitely am not succumbing to the pressures that i may have succumbed to in the past
7733967 they recognize theres better value and their parents let them buy there
7733968 every place that offered that i made her try on a pair
7733969 you see people with very expensive name brand clothing and they dont have furniture in their houses
7733970 i dont feel that i need to keep up with anybody
7733971 she wants a bag she has a bag theyre like 30
7733972 the kids are going to be dressed theyre going to be wearing clothes theyre going to be fitting and theyre going to be looking good
7733973 parents make sure kids are in the right frame of mind for starting school
7733974 my overall sense is that so far things are looking good right now we are all cautiously optimistic because we continue to see it running counter to the national trend
7733975 the increase in the unemployment rate isnt the result of people losing jobs but of new people entering the labor force and looking for work
7733976 i think it represents some confidence in the economy because typically in a slowdown that number is going the other way
7733977 since many other jobs in the service sector depend on manufacturing businesses and jobs
7733978 these decreases may have a ripple effect throughout the rest of the economy in future months
7733979 i hope they are using this format to prepare well thought out and well researched answers to the questions that are out there

7733984 the inclusion of the controversial work showed that there was no censorship in the uk but promised to withdraw it immediately
7733985 out of friendship and to lower the level of personal acrimony that has come about because of this drink tax
7733986 i see no conflict of interest here at all mr ellenbogen has a right to legal counsel of his own choosing and i believe my role as mr ellenbogens attorney would stand up in court
7733987 i am a working guy i dont have money to start throwing away on lawsuits that i dont think i should be involved in
7733988 there are people on this council that want to harm this government mr ellenbogen has been working with the republicans against county council and mr onoratos administration
7733989 shall the county enact an ordinance to increase real estate taxes in order to repeal the alcoholic drink tax
7733990 i want to preserve the right if necessary to challenge the referendum question that originated from county council

7733994 it just came with his nature he was always for helping people do better
7733995 so many of the times i called him to seek his advice had to do with personnel issues he was so good with that his counsel was always to be kind to people and treat them the way you wanted to be treated
7733996 the wind is so strong were literally just watching houses go up in flames
7733997 then you realize you dont have any pictures any more you realize im cold and i have no clothes i have nothing left
7733998 its devastating apparently i just lost everything but what ive got on here
7733999 the house next to me just blew up these houses were blowing up like they were full of gas
7734000 if the media outlets are covering this just because hes black thats the wrong reason
7734001 any time theres a presidential campaign it should be important to african americans and not just because one of the candidates is black
7734002 our mission is to celebrate african american culture and to chronicle african american achievement
7734003 when the year started this was not in our budget but when he became the presumptive nominee it just seemed like this was a sure thing for us
7734004 i really take offense to the charge that black journalists cant be objective there is the celebratory nature of the moment thats true
7734005 but were going to call the candidates on their agendas we cant give either of them a free pass we do have to keep in mind our demographic which is the 18 to 34 year old viewer and be responsive to that but that will not taint the integrity of the journalism that goes into it
7734006 the black press will provide a perspective and viewpoint you wont get from other press
7734007 there hasnt been the type of investment in collecting news about the state of black america that would balance and complement the news that comes from more mainstream outlets and given the role the rnc has played in the problems of this country i would think those networks would want to be there
7734008 she hasnt talked to anyone she just looks like your sweet little grandma and no one knows where she is
7734009 i was looking at the manifest and i dont think applesauce is ready for the gun we can swap out applesauce and invisible boy but then it will be her first time driving so are you sure are you damn sure that you want her on the gun
7734010 i respect your decision i dont want to do this but im fresh out of options i guess were done
7734011 you know you got the gun on vic six for the next convoy roger
7734012 no dont do your best im not going to write your husband and tell him you did your best just watch your lane and dont fuck it up your squad leader must really believe in you
7734013 and i need you to help me out with a power point put your gear up and meet me back in the orderly room
7734014 change of plans youre headquarters you support the line units dont forget that we have too many bodies and not enough trucks and i need you back here
7734015 no yeah youre an eleven bravo but like i said iraq is full of useless jobs you have one of them
7734016 i have no job i have no purpose i watch movies and jerk off all day
7734017 plenty of war to go around sarnt but an e6 platoon sergeant will look good on your ncoer and anyway every one of those trucks has mres and cls bags and coolers of ice because we got them you have a job making sure we all do our jobs hey cheer up it cant rain every day
7734018 i didnt want that to happen i didnt want to watch another season ever again
7734019 going to shoot obama from a high vantage point using a rifle sighted at 750 yards
7734020 im happy with how things are going right now im hoping to turn my season around as much as i can theres still time left to do some good things weve got five weeks
7734021 everybody goes through slumps but ive never gone through one this long its been 4 months and its just been a real grind but the team has stuck with me and im thankful for that
7734022 maybe we are going to look better tuesday wednesday and thursday but right now were playing hide the message
7734023 if this party has a message its done a hell of a job hiding it tonight i promise you that
7734024 its been difficult balancing football and schoolwork i really struggled my freshman year i was still living at home and i had a lot of friends in the area but i got through it penn state does a great job of instituting mandatory study hall it is 2 1 2 hours a day ever since my freshman year i got into a routine of going to the football building every day to meet with the tutors ive followed the same routine for as long as i can remember now that im going to be starting this year its definitely going to be more difficult ive always tried to go 50 50 with football and the books but now it may be like 75 25 in order to spend more time in the film room preparing for a game or a particular matchup well maybe it wont quite be to that extreme it just may require me to stay up later or to give up some of the other extracurricular activities i enjoy in order to get my schoolwork done sleep might be at a premium this fall

7734232 the panel is of the opinion that you allowed your views in respect of physician assisted suicide to influence your treatment of patient a you made a serious misjudgment and embarked upon a potentially criminal act
7734233 they indicated that they were considering terminating my contract and since then ive been told that they are looking at it quite seriously
7734234 obviously i dont want that to happen im 62 now and dont think i could cope with starting up a new practice i understand there will be another meeting next week but have been told not to expect good news
7734235 the world is a great mirror it reflects back to you what you are if you are loving if you are friendly if you are helpful the world will prove loving and friendly and helpful to you the world is what you are
7734236 happiness always looks small while you hold it in your hands but you let it go and you learn at once how big and precious it is
7734237 i was very shocked to find out the number of deficiencies across the board
7734238 almost all the criminals we see started out as children who needed help early in life
7734239 i would rather see these kids in a graduation cap and gown than an orange jumpsuit
7734240 i just came to support my boyfriend he plays good and i like being with my family were having fun here
7734241 this has turned out better than we could have ever expected
7734242 we thought wed start small this year and see if there was interest in the soccer playing community to do something like this its turned into a communitywide event
7734243 we built this field to help develop our juniors program and to be an asset to the community and this is exactly the type of activity we were envisioning when we built this field
7734244 they play a fun style they create openings by getting the ball through the midfield the honduran team is very creative both teams are very well organized in the back so neither gives up many goals
7734245 this program brought together a lot of folks from different cultures that had never participated in a city sponsored event were looking forward to next year
7734246 i dont know how close we are to a resolution
7734247 a number of issues have been raised and were working to address them
7734248 there are still a lot of families that have experienced a lot of damage some of which is not covered by insurance we have a state disaster relief fund that is in desperate need of donations from folks that are willing to give
7734249 we want to do everything we can to help the families and individuals who suffered as a result of the tornado
7734250 were very aware that communities have spent considerable dollars in the recovery phase after the tornado and the floods and were very aware that many of them have budgets that are strained which is why were going to expedite the reimbursement process
7734251 our initial determination is that were in overall agreement with the facts outlined in the original petition
7734252 the original lawsuit accuses the governor of actions he did not take it accuses the governor of actions that even if true would not be a violation of the law and it accuses the governor of actions that did not occur
7734253 we stand ready to make all of these arguments for yet another dismissal
7734254 it was a good package but we should have passed it years ago
7734255 i was fought every step of the way by the management of those organizations they opposed the bill they criticized the bill they sent proxies onto capitol hill to lobby against it
7734256 john sununu has walked in lockstep with george bush on a failed economic agenda that has driven the economy into the ground and driven down housing values across new hampshire
7734257 and when john sununu had a chance to stand up for new hampshire families earlier this year and support significant steps to ease the housing crisis he instead chose bushs disastrous policies again three times
7734258 barack obama has promised to try and raise capital gains taxes he thinks he can do it without affecting the middle class
7734259 thats all i could do was try to comfort her
7734260 i think its a positive for the women and children in the community that need the shelter
7734261 im here to get college credit so that hopefully i can get enrolled into harvard princeton or yale
7734262 im here because i want to see the childrens faces light up when they come in and see how we remodeled it
7734263 and when kids of different races get to talk to each other what happens they become your buddies
7734264 this is a case where everyone was so enamored and felt so much sympathy for the holocaust survivor it just overwhelmed everyone in the case including the jury
7734265 now to find out that the book was not true that is fraud on the court
7734266 this credibility issue is something jane is digging up now
7734267 thats not what the trial was about it was about the fact that she cheated us
7734268 she said the reason she was so attached to dogs is because she had been so attached to wolves
7734269 this story is mine it is not actually reality but my reality my way of surviving
7734270 from the outset she breached her contract but nobody knew it until much later
7734271 i think she went along thinking she had a blockbuster and she didnt want to hear anything about it not possibly being true
7734272 she always maintained that this was truth as she recalled it and i trusted that that was the case
7734273 if you read a lot of holocaust literature all survivor stories are miraculous
7734274 we always talked about when an opportunity came up would i be interested
7734275 so theres been a cultivation process there i plan on coaching for a while
7734276 the advantages at being at an institution for a long period of time theres so many the most people dont realize
7734277 my strength in coaching has always been the relationship with my players
7734278 im a relationship builder i miss the full time seeing the kids during the day being with them for all the practices seeing them in the off season following them after graduation all the things you do in a correct way to run a program ive missed
7734279 but i look at them instead of stumbling blocks as stepping stones im doing something i love to do and thats priceless
7734280 everybody ive met has been impressive in a small way i think i have a chance to make a difference for the school in its academic mission and its athletic mission
7734281 i take great pride in representing daniel webster but my team will take great pride in representing daniel webster
7734282 my first priority is to the players and to developing that relationship i cant wait until they get on campus
7734283 ive been put in a lot of different positions to coach and i think one of my strengths is i feel i can make more from less
7734284 when president robert myers brought me here he wanted a change in atmosphere in our department
7734285 what can we do to better the programs totally this is just a followup from that
7734286 its not dave faucher being a savior to daniel webster its dave faucher being appreciative to daniel webster thats really the theme
7734287 it speaks well for our institutions consciousness in preventing an otherwise needless waste
7734288 whenever theres a bunch of people here at one time it gets crazy you have people bumping into you so if youre balancing stuff youre going to end up dropping something or breaking something
7734289 so if a college is looking to go green they need to start looking in the dining facility
7734290 its going faster in some places than others because you have different cultures and different ways that universities do things
7734291 it was one of those games where you just have to tip your cap to trias he did a good job
7734292 u s recession and recovery u v or w shaped
7734293 theres been debate about whether its v shaped or u shaped
7734294 trying to make a desperate situation look sort of technical its not that much of a fuss the big boys can take care of it dont you worry
7734295 except the big boys here their trousers are getting a little short im afraid
7734296 this could extend itself well into 2009 with repercussions that could keep the country stagnant for two or three years
7734297 were not expecting this to be a hockey stick in the true sense of a hockey stick of a year at all
7734298 were closer to the end than we are to the beginning
7734299 the great recession game of 08 what inning are we in
7734300 the future of the hive does not depend on full employment for all the worker bees
7734301 in fact an accident can put many bees out of action without compromising the hive as a whole
7734302 there is something more than just the reduction in driving that has to be brought in as an explanation for the huge drop in fatalities
7734303 it could be that the safety benefits of driving slower are proportionately greater than the fuel economy benefits
7734304 its really very interesting that with all these efforts that have gone into building safer highways safer cars better enforcement this really dramatic change were seeing is due to economics to the price of gasoline
7734305 this is really the first time since the 1970s that people are thinking about driving and about what is the cost of an individual trip
7734306 where would i want to play wherever they ask me
7734307 it doesnt matter to me i enjoy doing everything and i think that they see that too
7734308 i love playing football and anytime i get a chance to get out and make any kind of play on either side of the ball its fun i love what i do
7734309 i guess im just trying to literally learn every day and hopefully make some plays whenever i get a chance
7734310 we used ray last year on the practice squad to run routes for the defense as an offensive receiver and he really did a good job
7734311 i think he can play both receiver and defensive back at a competent level
7734312 he is a tough kid he runs hard he catches the ball well and he showed up in the kicking game his versatility is his number one strength at this point but when he does play he has been productive in defense special teams and offense he is a unique guy
7734313 i dont think you can worry about all the stuff you cant control
7734314 i jogged over to the defensive side and had to do a u turn and go back to the offense
7734315 i realized i didnt have the blue jersey on i had the white one on
7734316 its not going to be short and swift but its begun nonetheless
7734317 running fence sonoma and marin counties california 1972 76 a documentation exhibition
7734318 as the new home for the artwork and documents for the running fence the smithsonian american art museum is now the institution of record for this pivotal project
7734319 this acquisition measurably strengthens the museums commitment to major artists who have made an indelible mark on american art and culture
7734320 christo and jeanne claude remembering the running fence sonoma and marin counties california 1972 76 a documentation exhibition
7734321 im past my expiration date and still able to do it

7734326 id like to see much harsher laws on abuse and neglect id like to help
7734327 knowingly sold 10 pills containing clonazepam in exchange for money
7734328 just pass on the good deed to someone else in trouble
7734329 you thought no was a hard word you thought he wasnt worth one simple fucking no well youll learn
7734330 lida abduls video works bring to light the poignant stoicism of how the people of afghanistan are dealing with a long history of violence
7734331 as an encyclopedic museum with a robust contemporary program the ima is uniquely able to show how artists across time have examined the current events of their lives through their work
7734332 why cant a ruin itself be transformed into a meditation on something other a non referential work of art a visual or sculptural poem that one hopes will open up new spaces for rethinking about society about ethics and identity itself
7734333 abduls video works offer counter representations to the images of kabul and afghanistan that permeate news media throughout the united states and europe
7734334 ruin and devastation are pictured but abdul adds to the scene an utterly human aspect reflecting upon the physical displacement and psychological trauma experienced by those who live there
7734335 love he lord your god with all your heart soul mind deuteronomy 6 5 matthew chapters 5 6 7 will say all what i am trying to say

7734397 no no i never noticed that in fact what the hell are you talking about
7734398 is it latin what the hell are you talking to me in
7734399 you know if i hadnt seen you steal that banana from that brain damaged monkey that one time id be positive that you were at the absolute bottom of the food chain
7734400 dont remind me by the way how is the woman who currently has the misfortune of being the chick that fucks brandon
7734401 because its going to sound like im just shoving it in your face
7734402 shes the most amazing thing that ive ever seen felt or imagined i love her dude like nothing ive ever known
7734403 okay the thing about her that makes her so awesome actually i should start at the beginning
7734404 geez bran arent you supposed to be shitfaced drunk when you make these calls
7734405 i used to sit around and think about how i was in love with you and i used to wish it had worked out you know this was way before i got engaged so i always blamed it on being lonely plus we had pretty fantastic sex
7734406 ah so you are drunk you sounded so sober there for a second happy birthday bran

7734424 it is not possible for any agreement to conclude unless it is on the basis of full sovereignty and the national interest and that no foreign soldiers remain in iraqi soil after a defined time ceiling
7734425 so iraqi officials will resort to using the dates mentioned in the agreement to sell it to the public even though they might be intended to be used in a guidance way
7734426 if you ask the prime minister what happens if the situation on the ground changes before 2011 then he would obviously say that the dates might need to be changed

7734564 the work begins anew the hope rises again and the dream lives on
7734565 this is one of those great moments in political history
7734566 you know there is nothing quite like the kennedy name to light up any democratic gathering it was a moment that these delegates will never forget
7734567 that you work hard for what you want in life that your word is your bond and you do what you say youre going to do that you treat people with dignity and respect even if you dont know them and even if you dont agree with them
7734568 there is no doubt in anyones mind that this is barack obamas convention
7734569 feel an obligation to the people who sent them here
7734570 if the obama can come out of denver with even a little more enthusiasm from clinton supporters it will be a victory
7734571 the democratic party strongly and unequivocally supports roe v wade and a womans right to choose a safe and legal abortion regardless of ability to pay and we oppose any and all efforts to weaken or undermine that right

7734575 theres a moment that you want to enjoy your bitterness
7734576 im getting a lot of calls and e mails especially from women who are quite upset that she was not vetted for vice president even though senator obama said she was on the short list
7734577 to stay wallowing in all of this is not productive
7734578 so we can talk about this forever or we can talk about how were going to take our message to the american people to women all across america to see the distinctions
7734579 ten eerste ben ik niet bij die vergadering geweest en is mij dit naderhand niet verteld en ten tweede vind ik campagne een te stevig woord
7734580 zowel van praag als ik hebben op onze eigen wijze onze speerpunten onder de aandacht proberen te brengen
7734581 natuurlijk is het niet leuk dat ik er weer vier tot zes weken uitlig maar dat is toch heel weinig als je dat vergelijkt met de revalidatie van 9 5 maand die ik achter de rug heb
7734582 itll be a success in my mind if all everyone is talking about after thursday night is how great the speech was
7734583 i still have my blue page jacket with all of the pins and buttons on it
7734584 my wife tried to throw it out but i hid in the back of the closet
7734585 sometime theyll be talking about a politician and i honestly have no idea who they are
7734586 all of the politicos in the room look at me like im crazy but you know i know production and thats all that matters
7734587 i think about how one day theyll have families of their own and one day they and your sons and daughters will tell their own children about what we did together in this election theyll tell them how this time we listened to our hopes instead of our fears how this time we decided to stop doubting and to start dreaming
7734588 now you know why i asked her out so many times even though she said no you want a persistent president
7734589 barack doesnt care where youre from or what your background is or what party if any you belong to thats not how he sees the world
7734590 he knows that thread that connects us our belief in americas promise our commitment to our childrens future is strong enough to hold us together as one nation even when we disagree
7734591 scrimped and saved so that he could have opportunities they never had themselves

7734613 were kind of trying to build that momentum back up and get bigger bands that more kent state students want to see
7734614 in october 2007 we ran an energy campaign competition and reduced our energy usage by 12 percent for that month

7734616 it will take several years because of the cost and overall we want to reduce the amount of our fleet
7734617 the way that technology is going and changing we will be able to change most of our fleet
7734618 our goal is to not only have the students make efforts here to recycle and reduce energy but to continue this behavior at home
7734619 we saw an increase in recycling across our halls what we found was students were ready to jump on board and the support was awesome our goal is to have this support continue and to watch both of these programs grow over the years to come

7734684 walt disneys legends of imagineering and the genesis of the disney theme park
7734685 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
7734686 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
7734687 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
7734688 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
7734689 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
7734690 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
7734691 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
7734692 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
7734693 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
7734694 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
7734695 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
7734696 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
7734697 ik zou zelfs durven zeggen dat het nog iets meer is afhankelijk van de definitie die je hanteert
7734698 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
7734699 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
7734700 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
7734701 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
7734702 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
7734703 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
7734704 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
7734705 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
7734706 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
7734707 het blijft misschien wel ons kind maar dit vergeven we haar nooit
7734708 we kunnen het gewoon niet geloven die twee dutskes wie kan ze nu zoiets aandoen elke keer als je zulke dingen op het nieuws ziet hoop je dat je zoiets nooit moet meemaken ik hoop dat we dit te boven komen
7734709 vreselijk gehuild heb ik toen ik van dat drama in brussel hoorde daar had een mama vijf kindjes vermoord nu zitten we er zelf midden in onwezenlijk is dit
7734710 ze was altijd heel afwezig vertelde niet veel we wisten dat ze vaak in de problemen zat dat zag je gewoon aan haar gezicht maar iets vertellen dat deed ze nooit ze nam veel medicijnen antidepressiva denk ik allemaal dingen die ze van hem haar echtgenoot marcel red kreeg van in het begin heb ik geweten dat hij voor problemen zou zorgen als dokter heb ik geen kwaad woord over hem maar naar zijn gezin zag hij niet om
7734711 maar het is pas echt fout gelopen toen junior geboren werd twee huilende en ruzi nde kinderen daar kon hij niet tegen een paar maanden geleden is hij thuis weggegaan hij wilde gewoon geen contact meer gaf ook geen geld meer en dat kon chantal niet verkroppen ze heeft dit gedaan om hem te raken daar ben ik zeker van daarom ook dat ze de andere kinderen eerst met een smoes heeft weggestuurd ik vrees dat ze alles gepland had het is niet schoon om te zeggen maar eigenlijk had ze veel meer moeten hebben dan een gebroken heup
7734712 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
7734713 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
7734714 the military will not stage a coup detat the public must not panic and must carry on their daily lives the army will not get involved in politics
7734715 now we have completely taken over nbt and i want more people to join them
7734716 today is judgement day i am ready if they want to arrest me if we have to go to police headquarters this time we will not simply stay outside we will get inside there
7734717 pad have seized nbt to cut off the government communication now up to 3 000 people have occupied nbt and they plan to do their own broadcast
7734718 they cannot claim their right to rally under the constitution because armed protesters intruded into a state office
7734719 as of now the prime minister has not made any change therefore i still think that the cabinet meeting will go ahead
7734720 wait for the prime minister so far there is no special instruction
7734721 this november the torch will be passed again to a new generation of americans
7734722 the work begins anew the hope rises again and the dream lives on
7734723 it is so wonderful to be here and nothing is going to keep me away from this special gathering tonight
7734724 we need to look seriously at how to modernize our regulatory structure
7734725 what we have learned from the past two years is that the old form of regulation is broken
7734726 the exact form of the reform is something that we are learning about
7734727 soal iman soal pribadi lah nggak usah menjadi urusan publik
7734728 zondagavond rond 23u zagen we dat er plots een brancard uit het huis kwam buitengereden
7734729 hoewel er precies niemand op lag stond er wel heel wat medisch personeel rond pas toen we gisteren het nieuws over de gestorven baby vernamen besefte ik dat het waarschijnlijk het kindje was dat toen naar buiten was gebracht
7734730 we rekenen er op dat het even lang duurt om hetzelfde bij de wandelaars te bereiken
7734731 het aanbod is heel groot de voorzieningen zijn er al lang wat wij probeerden te doen is een toptien van wandelgebieden samen te stellen die over de hele provincie verspreid liggen
7734732 we hebben het enige nationale park van belgi de grensoverschrijdende routes in voeren en de stadswandelingen in oud rekem allemaal toppers in hun genre
7734733 bedoeling is dat we de toeristen met het warme limburggevoel laten kennismaken en dat is zoveel meer dan gewoon een overnachting na een stevige wandeling via hun gastheer of vrouw komen ze ook meer te weten over de gastronomie en de wellnessfaciliteiten in de regio met dit totaalpakket hopen we dat de wandelaars blijven terugkomen
7734734 een knappe kop maar ook een milde opa die altijd naar het goede in de mens keek een man met humor ook
7734735 hij wil namelijk bij de trappistinnen in lozen bocholt worden begraven dat was geen probleem zeiden ze in rome zo lang hij maar niet te veel zou lonken ik weet natuurlijk niet of ze dat echt hebben gezegd of dat paul er dat van gemaakt heeft
7734736 schruers had trouwens zo zijn redenen om in bocholt begraven te worden
7734737 de dag dat hij bisschop werd 31 mei 1970 is net de dag waarop de trappistinnen vanuit brecht naar limburg verhuisden ze hebben eerst in kiewit gewoond aan de kinderboerderij daarna zijn ze verhuisd naar lozen
7734738 aan de priorij is een kerkhof daar zal hij worden begraven van de dood had hij trouwens geen schrik hij ging daar heel vertrouwd mee om het is in gods handen zei hij
7734739 als je iemand ontmoet moet op dat moment al je liefde naar die persoon gaan zei hij altijd
7734740 hij sprak zelfs over de vierkante meter waar hij stond van daaruit wilde hij degene die tegenover hem stond liefhebben
7734741 vroeger fietste hij maar de laatste jaren ging hij vaak te voet de stad in s morgens om halfnegen deed hij de mis in de basiliek en daarna wandelde hij wat rond hij werd dan door heel veel mensen aangesproken ik ben van job veranderd ik ben nu straathoekwerker zei hij
7734742 na vergaderingen kwam hij terug met schetsen van mensen gelijkend ja zijn vader was kunstzinnig en zelf tekende hij dus ook graag
7734743 ik weet ook niet precies waar die liefde voor afrika vandaan komt
7734744 maar hij had wel een zeer goede band met ons zusterbisdom nyundo in rwanda in zuid amerika had hij ook goede contacten over de hele wereld eigenlijk hij is echt een man van de wereldkerk
7734745 in rwanda kennen ze hem heel goed priesters vragen daar ook altijd naar hem ik ben er priesters tegengekomen die een kaartje hadden met een gebed op van paul gekregen dat hadden ze in de genocide elke dag gebeden en dat gaf hen ook de kracht om voort te gaan hij was een man die luisterde alvorens hij sprak zeiden ze daar
7734746 ik kom heel wat arme mensen en die hadden schruers echt graag zij nodigden hem uit op de koffie en hij hen
7734747 een tijdje geleden hebben we hem onverwachts met een aantal studenten opgezocht in het rusthuis
7734748 als we voor de sociaal gehandicapten het vlaams fonds inschakelen komt de traditionele doelgroep van het fonds in gevaar
7734749 het vlaams fonds dient dus alleen voor de echte gehandicapten wie dat dan ook mogen zijn hij vergeet dat de sociale gehandicapten meestal n mentaal n lichamelijk gehandicapt zijn n een verslavingsproblematiek hebben juist daarom vallen ze uit de boot ze komen op wachtlijsten terecht en worden niet geholpen ook omdat het niet de gemakkelijkste mensen zijn natuurlijk
7734750 voor iemand als sprinter usain bolt zal elke organisator willen betalen
7734751 maar of ze in het buitenland ook voor de belgische winnares van het hoogspringen bij de vrouwen veel extra willen ophoesten is nog maar de vraag vraag maar eens in belgi wie de gouden medaille hinkstapspringen heeft gewonnen dat weet niemand terwijl die persoon in zijn eigen land een held is
7734752 zaterdagavond rond 23u hoorde ik het portier van een auto dichtslaan
7734753 toen kwam de politie ook langs later hoorde ik dat zij of hij een personenwagen stuk had geslagen meer kan ik niet zeggen want eigenlijk leefden ze wel wat terugtrokken we hadden nauwelijks tot geen contact met hen
7734754 zijn haar was ignace cromb al kwijt nu heeft hij ook zijn pluimen verloren
7734755 niet alleen vanwege die overeenkomst ook omdat ik de meisjes niet in de steek wil laten als ik dat zou doen dan ben ik zoals hij hij laat iedereen in de steek
7734756 dan zal ik daar heel goed over nadenken trouwens wie zegt dat miss belgian beauty volgende jaar nog bestaat daar twijfel ik aan als ik op die manier zou handelen komt er geen mens meer in mijn zaak
7734757 mensen lachen ons uit omdat we hier nog aan meedoen
7734758 ik word er op mijn werk over aangesproken dat zijn geen prettige gesprekken
7734759 je verstaat dat ik nog niet weet of ik al of niet stop ik kan me dat gewoon niet veroorloven
7734760 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
7734761 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
7734762 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
7734763 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
7734764 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
7734765 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
7734766 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
7734767 who are open to doing something on the production side
7734768 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
7734769 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
7734770 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
7734771 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
7734772 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
7734773 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
7734774 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
7734775 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
7734776 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
7734777 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
7734778 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
7734779 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
7734780 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
7734781 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
7734782 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
7734783 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
7734784 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
7734785 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
7734786 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
7734787 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
7734788 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
7734789 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
7734790 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
7734791 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
7734792 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
7734793 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
7734794 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
7734795 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
7734796 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
7734797 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
7734798 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
7734799 avansul economiei mondiale va fi probabil n 2009 cel mai redus de dup 2003 cre terea economiei din fiecare regiune din lume se va reduce anul viitor
7734800 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
7734801 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
7734802 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
7734803 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
7734804 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
7734805 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
7734806 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
7734807 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
7734808 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
7734809 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
7734810 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
7734811 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
7734812 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
7734813 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
7734814 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
7734815 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
7734816 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
7734817 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
7734818 mike im going with a friend to see the batman movie tomorrow night
7734819 mike i cannot believe how nice the people in chicago are
7734820 honey people ask me why in the world you go out with me i respond that i have no idea
7734821 honey what am i going to do after december 20
7734822 by then you will be singing your song and you will be fine
7734823 were not a public utility were a newspaper and we cover things based on what is newsworthy people who have half a percent or less following among the public are much less newsworthy than people with 40 and 50 percent
7734824 the nader campaign is based on a simple premise there is no difference between the two major parties
7734825 this is true if you stand far enough away from the two parties in the same way new york and tokyo would look similar if you were standing on the moon
7734826 a self indulgent exercise that that will distract voters from the clear cut choice represented by the major party candidates
7734827 the public deserves to see the major party candidates compete on an uncluttered playing field
7734828 protectionism would destroy our prosperity and make the worlds poor even more miserable it is a strange platform for the ralph nader who says he speaks for the weak and the neglected
7734829 many of those who are thinking about voting for mr nader probably imagine that he is still the moderate humane activist of the 1960s
7734830 any presidential candidate whose running mate is winona laduke an ojibway indian activist from a minnesota reservation must be considered both marginal and self indulgent
7734831 like an enormous zit on prom night when least expected or desired nader and his green party followers have reappeared on the political scene
7734832 one of the saddest sights in politics is a fading public figure who refuses to concede that his or her time has passed
7734833 the latest egotist to ignore reality is ralph nader the aging consumer advocate whose crusades stalled and popularity sagged long ago nader is in the great tradition of political diehards who stubbornly hope against hope that they can keep the reporters and speaking fees coming despite all the derisive laughter
7734834 the two party system works fine if not perfectly why cant we leave it at that
7734835 after all the rumours we have finally and quite literally unwrapped australias first surface table now we just have to figure out what to do with it
7734836 we actually had our first app with our own content up and running within 20 minutes staff cant stop walking up to the table and playing with the demos that were included
7734837 we are very excited that australia is one of the first countries outside the us to receive a microsoft surface for internal evaluation and exploration
7734838 for obama supporters this is like finding out from your neighbor instead of your sister that shes engaged not how you want or expect the news to be delivered
7734839 we have seen some text campaigns in the many hundreds of thousands of opt in mobile users over the past couple years all in the consumer products services realm
7734840 this is the first massive effort in the political world
7734841 its a pretty big challenge because were under a strict time constraint to get all those messages out
7734842 it surprises us that mattel chose to direct facebook to take down scrabulous without waiting for the indian courts decision
7734843 mattels action speaks volumes about their business practices and respect for the judiciary

7734849 in the process of expanding in europe germany is one of several possible future markets
7734850 we receive inquiries from all over the world there is enormous interest in current
7734851 according to our observations germany is a market that could soon be ripe for current
7734852 tv and the web amount to the same thing to us
7734853 unlike most broadcasters we do not only use television to attract people to the internet on the contrary people go to current com swap thoughts concerns and videos and then we bring the best of it to the tv screen
7734854 he does not feel that obama has given him the respect due to him as a former president
7734855 he should have called clinton and asked him for advice about foreign policy or suggested a joint appearance
7734856 if maine mike of 108 effects but moved to david wordpress
7734857 hai orang orang yang beriman bertaqwalah kepada allah dan tinggalkan sisa riba yang belum dipungut jika kamu orang orang yang beriman oleh karena itu jika kamu tidak mengerjakan meninggalkan sisa riba maka ketahuilah allah dan rasul nya akan memerangi kalian
7734858 he also became well known through personal videos that were leaked showing him fornicating with animals this controversy has remained will hidden by simmons ability to buy people off with large sums of money
7734859 if obamas relationship with ayers however tangential exposes obama as a radical himself or at least as a man with terrible judgment he shares that radicalism or terrible judgment with a comically respectable list of chicagoans and others including republicans and conservatives who have embraced ayers and dohrn as good company good citizens even experts on childrens issues
7734860 ik kom hier als een echtgenote die houdt van haar man en gelooft dat hij een buitengewone president zal zijn
7734861 barack en ik zijn opgevoed met veel gemeenschappelijke waarden dat je hard werkt voor wat je in het leven wilt dat je mensen met waardigheid en respect behandelt

7734870 if hes up to it in the 11th hour and can get the green light from doctors he might be able to pull it off
7734871 weve looked at several ways to play anticipated growth in wind energy weve also considered titanium makers for that industrys ties to the production of lightweight modern aircraft
7734872 while the two trends might not appear to have much in common at first glance hxl offers a way to play both the aircraft and wind markets
7734873 the connection is the lightweight composite materials hexcel makes that are used by producers in both sectors hexcel develops and manufactures advanced structural materials
7734874 it is the largest u s producer of carbon fiber the worlds largest weaver of reinforcement fabrics and the number one producer of composite materials
7734875 its product was initially developed for the aerospace industry but is now used in a wide range of applications from golf clubs to satellite arrays and from the rotor blades of wind turbines to life saving monocoques for formula 1 race cars
7734876 its been a rollercoaster ride for hexcels stock in the past 12 months the shares hit their one year peak of 27 19 in december 2007 by january 22nd they had plummeted to 17 the shares rebounded through may only to fade again year to date hxl is off about 15
7734877 second quarter profits came in shy of wall streets expectations as a result of costs associated with the start up of four overseas manufacturing plants and a weak u s dollar the reason hexcel has been investing in plants in europe is to be closer to customers such as airbus
7734878 hexcel just won a big order from airbus that was the biggest in the companys history
7734879 hexcel is in a great position to profit from the growing investment in wind energy platforms and the demand for lighter weight more fuel efficient airplanes the skyrocketing price of crude during q2 did much to disrupt the plans of cash strapped airlines to acquire the new planes
7734880 boeings delays getting the dreamliner in the air have also been well documented those are short term problems however long term it is inevitable that air carriers will want these newer planes in their fleets
7734881 wind energy is obviously a hot topic too oilman boone pickens is pushing wind farms as an alternative to oil fired power plants al gores alliance for climate protection meanwhile has promoted them as an anecdote to greenhouse gas emissions
7734882 when two guys like gore and pickens coming from opposite ends of the political spectrum can come to the same view theres some karma happening
7734883 a strong dollar should help hexcels cost structure in its overseas plants and could well lead to an earnings surprise in the second half of the year if the trend continues this is a stock to keep on our radar
7734884 the stakes of this election will be made very clear
7734885 i learned this shes stronger and tougher that he bill clinton is when she takes a point youre gonna have to be sure youre well informed because she will not compromise shes very bright shes strong and when she gets her dander up she aint going to roll over
7734886 im convinced he has a sexual addiction he needs to get help for his sake he has already damaged his presidency beyond repair
7734887 when truman boarded a train january 1953 at union station without a penny in federal largesse except a microscopic army pension the president knew he would have to sell some property and would even have to dip into his own pocket to buy stamps to answer the 72 000 pieces of mail he received in just the first two weeks after he left the white house
7734888 he assured me the press stories concerning the kickbacks he got in exchange for state contracts were not true he lied to me
7734889 boy is she bitter about the press if george w loses shes gonna pop off the bush press bashing didnt abate even after their boy became president
7734890 i dont know what powell is going to do but if he were to jump into the political arena as a republican he could get the nomination as vice president if not the presidential nomination and he could beat clinton easily
7734891 john mccain would be stronger against gore gore will be a dull unspiring loser candidate for the democrats mccain looks stronger he is stronger mccain because of his military service and vietnam prisoner of war hero status you know he had a hehluva military record
7734892 bush has that air reserve texas national guard record of course gores war record in vietnam aint much either
7734893 moreover since bill is not and has not been for years gainfully employed he will be scrounging around for cash everywhere but that wouldnt be exactly new would it

7734910 to all the candidates tell me your position on gun control as myself and other americans really want to know if our babies are safe
7734911 this is my baby purchased under the 1994 gun ban
7734912 i believe we ought to move it out let the individual communities decide their gun laws and how guns ought to be treated
7734913 it has had a devastating impact on elections because the nra has targeted and spent millions of dollars distorting individual members views and al gores views
7734914 the key is going to be also attacking poverty bringing people together dealing with those kids in the ghettos that are heavy users of gun violence and they are victims of gun violence to make sure that this country attacks the core problems of poverty having child care bringing parents together
7734915 are you going to be able to keep his baby safe

7734920 i dont know that he is mentally qualified to own that gun
7734921 there used to be an organization for people who believed in a truly limited government limited taxes limited spending limited interference in individual lives and limited intervention in foreign affairs that organization was known as the republican party but the only one of those beliefs that still motivates the g o p establishment is limited taxes
7734922 im going to hang around and walk through the convention hall and shake as many hands as seem to be friendly
7734923 they say i got them into politics not the young ones of course
7734924 they invite us we wave everybody cheers we sit down
7734925 i think hes more ready for it clearly by far than i was
7734926 we believe that coal use will increase under any foreseeable scenario because it is cheap and abundant
7734927 should and will take actions to reduce the emissions of co2 and other greenhouse gas emissions
7734928 coal will continue to play a large and indispensable role in a greenhouse gas constrained world
7734929 the systems that generate elections and earthquakes are complex systems
7734930 they are not predictable by simple equations but after coarse graining averaging they become predictable
7734931 we didnt look at it as reagan versus carter or republicans versus democrats or liberals versus conservatives rather we looked at elections as stability versus upheavals
7734932 i have to put everything on the table i dont think its a good alternative but if they can prove that it is and they want to pay royalties to the taxpayer let us use those royalties to invest in renewable energy resources then we have something to talk about
7734933 oh were going to have elections were going to have them by october theyre going to be inclusive theyre going to be transparent theyre going to be fair and this or that
7734934 were not staying around for ever for you to get around to this you have to do it now overdue
7734935 help me out here madame speaker when does life begin
7734936 the point is is that it shouldnt have an impact on the womans right to choose roe v wade talks about very clear definitions of when the child first trimester certain considerations second trimester not so third trimester theres very clear distinctions
7734937 and if that in fact is a a a a good alternative then that is something that we should do
7734938 an issue that deserves open and honest debate featuring the true facts always loved that adjective noun pairing what is an untrue fact from all sides and not just propaganda from one
7734939 deserves open and honest debate featuring the true facts from all sides and not just the propaganda from one
7734940 capitalism is the greatest system ever created for alleviating general human misery and yet it breeds ingratitude because we constantly hear how cruel capitalism is while this collectivism or that is more loving because unlike capitalism collectivism is about the group not the individual
7734941 if were an arrogant nation theyll resent us if were a humble nation but strong theyll welcome us
7734942 stands alone right now in the world in terms of power
7734943 shook his fist in wrath as he walked the platform a white foam gathered upon his lips giving him a look of ferocity
7734944 does mr lincoln wish to push these things to the point of personal difficulties here douglas demanded backing around and shaking his clenched fist within a few inches of lincolns face
7734945 made him look like humpty dumpty in a toupee while lincolns height was largely in his legs and gave audiences the impression of a scarecrow come to life
7734946 this government was made by our fathers on the white basis
7734947 by white men for the benefit of white men and their posterity forever
7734948 when lincoln rose to take the oath and discovered that he had no place to rest his top hat douglas obligingly stepped forward and held it for him
7734949 a sad heart with a grief that i have never before experienced
7734950 family is shaping the content of the entire day and thats not been done before
7734951 he let me know the world was large and that i should get to know as much of it as possible
7734952 they want to contrast the story of obama who has been through struggles that many americans are now facing with mccain who seems increasingly out of touch
7734953 filled with black rage against white people and hatred of the united states
7734954 the challenge is to avoid anything that smacks of angry black woman and get her back into the kitchen the question is whether she is willing to go along with that
7734955 she is bright and she is gifted but she also has a healthily ordinary attitude towards her family that american voters will respond to
7734956 make people aware of the kind of sacrifice barack made to give a voice to people who had all but given up hope
7734957 i like what he says and theres something about him i trust im going to take a chance on him
7734958 the survey suggests that this the economy is an umbrella issue covering many other concerns including those relative to health care
7734959 if i were designing a system from scratch i would probably go ahead with a single payer system
7734960 given that a lot of people work for insurance companies a lot of people work for hmos youve got a whole system of institutions that have been set up
7734961 we wish george bush could serve us another 8 years in the same stellar manner he served us the last but alas our great constitution which he has worked so hard to uphold will not allow that we realize now that he has the rest of the world pretty much straightened out that he could complete his domestic agenda if he had the time
7734962 i believe that every american has the right to affordable health care i believe that the millions of americans who cant take their children to a doctor when they get sick have that right we now face an opportunity and an obligation to turn the page on the failed politics of yesterdays health care debates its time to bring together businesses the medical community and members of both parties around a comprehensive solution to this crisis and its time to let the drug and insurance industries know that while theyll get a seat at the table they dont get to buy every chair
7734963 and nothing illustrates obamas failure so far to put some meat on his campaign than his inability to nail mccain on this issue and to speak specifically and powerfully about his own excellent plan which he announced early in the campaign
7734964 except in three cases that of their wives their daughters and their girlfriends
7734965 nancy unwilling to stand up for womens pro choice beliefs
7734966 for decades he has brought change to washington but washington hasnt changed him
7734967 ladies and gentlemen your kitchen table is like mine you sit there at night after you put the kids to bed and you talk you talk about what you need you talk about how much you are worried about being able to pay the bills well ladies and gentlemen thats not a worry john mccain has to worry about hell have to figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
7734968 i know that joe will campaign well for senator obama and so i think hes going to be very formidable
7734969 ive always respected joe biden but i disagreed with him from the time he voted against the first gulf war to his position where he said you had to break iraq up into three different countries we really have different approaches to many national security issues
7734970 mccain competing in blue states obama is competing in red states they are rewriting history every single day
7734971 we dont want to go back to tomorrow we want to go forward
7734972 the torch will be passed again to a new generation of americans
7734973 is there any way in which you are not irish
7734974 by all means continue destroying my possessions i daresay i have too many
7734975 i will only truly have left this school when none here are loyal to me help will always be given at hogwarts to those who ask for it
7734976 i would assume that you were going to offer me refreshment but the evidence so far suggests that that would be optimistic to the point of foolishness
7734977 i cant buy you a big diamond ring no house on a hill full of lifes finer things but ill tell you right now theres a whole lot that i just cant do oh but baby dont think i cant love you
7734978 it comes from some pretty deep places and it looks at my life how ive evolved and the way the ocean can take you places beyond location there are a bunch of fun songs on the record for sure but nothing quite as immediate as the live tracks so in some ways its the very best of what we do in the studio and what we do in peoples hometowns
7734979 we had been in the air for almost an hour when we heard a loud pop
7734980 the flight attendant came back and told us to remain calm thats when we saw the two pilots with the oxygen masks on hearing them breathe like darth vader made it a little harder to stay calm
7734981 our ultimate goal then and now is to help women look their best because when you look great you feel great weve learned that were not just selling better booties by boosting self esteem were really helping people in their day to day lives this has become our driving and continuing motivation
7734982 this tax was opposed by a broad spectrum of citizens and stakeholders as unnecessary and placing an unfair financial burden on seattles working families
7734983 the wind is so strong were literally just watching houses go up in flames
7734984 then you realize you dont have any pictures any more you realize im cold and i have no clothes i have nothing left
7734985 its devastating apparently i just lost everything but what ive got on here
7734986 the house next to me just blew up these houses were blowing up like they were full of gas
7734987 just in time for the olympics and hey even michael phelps is a lil wayne fan comes the
7734988 protect us from committing acts you wont forgive help us remove this desire and replace it with love
7734989 there is a profound battle for the soul of islam
7734990 i was really concerned to make a film that would set the record straight about islam i took islams most unlikely storytellers
7734991 i find that gay cinema has been in decline ever since the great films of the 80s like the times of harvey milk
7734992 after that the majority of gay cinema was focused on trash i have been troubled by the inordinate focus on the sexual lives of gay men
7734993 a nashville based free market think tank and watchdog organization
7734994 its easy i think of a man and i take away reason and accountability
7734995 his peccadillo defined as a slight offense in no way detracts from his ability to further his primary goal which is to eliminate poverty
7734996 the surprise for me is that he had only one affair
7734997 hopefully weve got him through the period where he needs a day or so hopefully hes at the point in the season where his second wind kicks in
7734998 hopefully weve got him through the period where he needs a day or so hopefully hes at the point in the season where his second wind kicks in
7734999 gore took what was a likely slam dunk and helped make it into a squeaker that went the other way
7735000 a group or a member of such a group or class enjoying intellectual social or economic status the best or most skilled members of a group
7735001 the belief that certain persons or members of certain classes or groups deserve favored treatment by virtue of their perceived superiority the sense of entitlement enjoyed by such a group
7735002 pointy headed intellectuals who cant even ride a bike straight
7735003 im from a military family ive moved around a lot actually the place i lived longest was in hanoi
7735004 a political gaffe it is said occurs when a politician inadvertently tells the truth
7735005 fortunately we have players including kiwi who are capable of picking up that kind of slack
7735006 as always well continue to research all of our options
7735007 there hasnt been any discussion that i have been involved in there
7735008 we are going to explore every option that is available and the last time i talked with michael he had accepted his new television challenge and was very happy about that
7735009 the move was always to get the best most quality people on the field
7735010 and mathias accepted every job we have offered and every task we have presented to him he was more than ready to do whatever we wanted him to do that was in the best interest of the team
7735011 i was told all along if something were to happen this is a position i could find myself in
7735012 i am ready to step in there and hopefully there wont be a letdown at all
7735013 i am confident that i can get the job done and this is something i have been preparing for my entire life basically
7735014 it is what i have been doing for 10 years so take that compared to two years playing linebacker it is a big difference and i am ready for the switch back
7735015 it is something that he all of us really wanted
7735016 but obviously we didnt want these circumstances for him to get back in the defensive line meeting room
7735017 it is a good thing for him it is a good thing for this team he is definitely a d lineman at heart and hopefully he can come back in and not miss a beat
7735018 listen feeling sorry for yourself in this league never flies
7735019 the dallas offensive line or the washington offensive line isnt going to feel sorry for us like we always say we are moving forward
7735020 fortunately we have players including kiwi who are capable of picking up that kind of slack
7735021 as always well continue to research all of our options
7735022 there hasnt been any discussion that i have been involved in there
7735023 we are going to explore every option that is available and the last time i talked with michael he had accepted his new television challenge and was very happy about that
7735024 the move was always to get the best most quality people on the field
7735025 and mathias accepted every job we have offered and every task we have presented to him he was more than ready to do whatever we wanted him to do that was in the best interest of the team
7735026 i was told all along if something were to happen this is a position i could find myself in
7735027 i am ready to step in there and hopefully there wont be a letdown at all
7735028 i am confident that i can get the job done and this is something i have been preparing for my entire life basically
7735029 it is what i have been doing for 10 years so take that compared to two years playing linebacker it is a big difference and i am ready for the switch back
7735030 it is something that he all of us really wanted
7735031 but obviously we didnt want these circumstances for him to get back in the defensive line meeting room
7735032 with where we are being in a pennant race you probably just have to go with your best youve got to go with your best its just where we are there are times id like to give david wright carlos beltran blah blah blah days off but hey this is a pennant race youve got to grind it out
7735033 well watch him perform and see what level the team is playing at and see where we are
7735034 hopefully he gives us 295 a great on base percentage and plays a good second base and picks us up a little bit
7735035 with where we are being in a pennant race you probably just have to go with your best youve got to go with your best its just where we are there are times id like to give david wright carlos beltran blah blah blah days off but hey this is a pennant race youve got to grind it out
7735036 well watch him perform and see what level the team is playing at and see where we are
7735037 hopefully he gives us 295 a great on base percentage and plays a good second base and picks us up a little bit
7735038 i think i helped him a little bit to play to this level sure hes a good player and he played well today but i didnt play with normal intensity
7735039 probably the toughest thing is mentally because for the last month i was concentrating all the days i did that for a lot of months
7735040 i dont want to say another time that im tired i am a little bit tired yes but it is the u s open so i have to try my best here and im going to try my best for sure
7735041 i dont think hes vulnerable here because hes won a lot of hard courts he can win for sure
7735042 hes such a fit player i think he can handle it
7735043 i think i helped him a little bit to play to this level sure hes a good player and he played well today but i didnt play with normal intensity
7735044 probably the toughest thing is mentally because for the last month i was concentrating all the days i did that for a lot of months
7735045 i dont want to say another time that im tired i am a little bit tired yes but it is the u s open so i have to try my best here and im going to try my best for sure
7735046 i dont think hes vulnerable here because hes won a lot of hard courts he can win for sure
7735047 hes such a fit player i think he can handle it
7735048 the bottom line is we just cannot risk his long term health in the midst of this pennant race
7735049 its easy for us to tell him keep on going out there and pitch as a general manager its just too much of a risk to me to risk his career in the midst of this pennant race
7735050 which means guys are going to have to step up and i do believe we have guys who have done it all year long and i think its going to happen again
7735051 i feel like i could go out and pitch but not 100 percent
7735052 and you want to have proven guys going down the stretch
7735053 its frustrating because i want to be here i want to help the team
7735054 its nothing really that serious its just the pain back there is not going away we have to take care of it and hopefully after a couple of weeks rest itll be ok
7735055 the worst case is that this is the end of the season and ill be good as new for spring training
7735056 the bottom line is we just cannot risk his long term health in the midst of this pennant race
7735057 its easy for us to tell him keep on going out there and pitch as a general manager its just too much of a risk to me to risk his career in the midst of this pennant race
7735058 which means guys are going to have to step up and i do believe we have guys who have done it all year long and i think its going to happen again
7735059 i feel like i could go out and pitch but not 100 percent
7735060 and you want to have proven guys going down the stretch
7735061 its frustrating because i want to be here i want to help the team
7735062 its nothing really that serious its just the pain back there is not going away we have to take care of it and hopefully after a couple of weeks rest itll be ok
7735063 the worst case is that this is the end of the season and ill be good as new for spring training
7735064 ive made the selection and thats all youre going to get
7735065 getting away with murder how politics is destroying the criminal justice system
7735066 making the case for yourself a diet book for smart women
7735067 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
7735068 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
7735069 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
7735070 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
7735071 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
7735072 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
7735073 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
7735074 the former u s vice president is just desperate for attention because he has no friends
7735075 barack obama has a good lead with women and an even greater potential to increase that lead
7735076 where he has shown the most room to grow is among these senior women
7735077 is not living up to his full potential with white older unmarried women
7735078 this is an issue that really demonstrates youre in touch with womens lives
7735079 opens us up to lawsuits for all kinds of problems
7735080 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
7735081 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
7735082 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
7735083 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
7735084 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
7735085 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
7735086 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
7735087 efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change
7735088 the mere fact that diane nash was born and raised on the southside of chicago but ended up in nashville tn at fisk as one of the movements most dynamic young leaders is astounding while just a few miles away in carthage tn was al gores home and later gore moved to nashville to work as a journalist while ms nash was on the front lines of the civil rights movement in this country mr gore was in vietnam although they started in tennessee with separate missions what they did through out their lives changed the nation and impacted the world i look forward to hearing their testimonies
7735089 we feel that if we pay these fines we would be contributing to and supporting the injustice and immoral practices that have been performed in the arrest and conviction of the defendants
7735090 do you feel it is wrong to discriminate against a person solely on the basis of their race or color
7735091 i invented the whole thing and ive never seen a dime from it
7735092 if a musician records a song does he not get royalties for every purchase if an author writes a book does he not see royalties too if a barely eighteen year old girl stars in a porno does she not receive money im just asking for what i rightfully deserve
7735093 its not as if someone can just cut gore a huge check
7735094 hes going to have to track down each individual that ever bought sold or profited off the internet in the last three decades the amount of time and money to do this could potentially be even more than the money gore could possibly collect
7735095 i cant honestly expect to collect from every little guy grandmas selling quilts online and the like but i certainly will be targeting the big guys like google microsoft and smooth operator
7735096 even though the president is the president this is going to be john mccains convention and you want it to be about john mccain and what his presidency would be
7735097 the two of them would embrace and make brief remarks and bush would escort reagan off to air force one and salute the president as he departed new orleans and the convention and then george bush would get in his motorcade after saluting ronald reagan and go downtown to be the nominee of the republican party
7735098 balance benefiting from voters desires to continue the clinton approach while allowing gore to take the torch and emerge from the large clinton shadow
7735099 i dont think there are a lot of people who want to see him at the convention
7735100 should stay home from the republican convention and everybody would be better off
7735101 the presidents approval rating among republicans base voters who are needed for a successful mccain campaign is relatively high
7735102 the assumption would be that there will be some kind of physical handoff
7735103 i think there is a sense that they would appear together he is the sitting president hes still popular among hard core republicans mccain has some issues with hard core republicans some people will say this was a bad way to play it but i think its one of those things where you have to run through it and do it and embrace it
7735104 hes on target all the time how can you punish a kid for being too good
7735105 i feel like its all my fault nobody could play
7735106 all human wisdom is summed up in two words wait and hope
7735107 patience is waiting not passively waiting that is laziness but to keep going when the going is hard and slow that is patience
7735108 learn the art of patience apply discipline to your thoughts when they become anxious over the outcome of a goal impatience breeds anxiety fear discouragement and failure patience creates confidence decisiveness and a rational outlook which eventually leads to success
7735109 the individual is capable of both great compassion and great indifference he has it within his means to nourish the former and outgrow the latter
7735110 i like to walk around nude on my deck coincidentally i realized there where holes in my fence amp mexicos on the other side
7735111 so what it boils down to is the county will have to pay this 80 000 bill
7735112 its a question of whether we want to spend money to validate the petitions
7735113 when you have a group called knox accountability they need to be accountable
7735114 i take no offense at the question of do we need don bosch and his law firm
7735115 learning money management now gives teens a foundation so when they start earning an income for real they dont go out and make a lot of bad mistakes early
7735116 save some of what you make be charitable with some of what you make and enjoy the rest
7735117 its not healthy to go blow everything you have and go spend more through credit
7735118 the other side is its probably not healthy to hoard money and not enjoy it
7735119 thats just a crazy way to spend 250 million compared with all the other needs you have in health care let alone education or anything else
7735120 its not only unfair its going to cause serious harm to families and individuals
7735121 why is the state of tennessee carrying the water for the managed care organizations when these are national companies have lots of reserves make lots of money and make a profit on health care
7735122 the remnants of tropical storm fay moved across the florida panhandle to mississippi last night monday
7735123 the center of the depression is now centered over meridian miss this means east tennessee will have some much needed rainfall
7735124 the slow movement of the system will result in some areas receiving a few inches of rain which raises the flood potential
7735125 we need the rain but this might be too much of a good thing
7735126 conservative blogger michelle malkin threatened and harassed by 9 11 truther alex jones
7735127 so it sounds like we will have off shore drilling
7735128 pakistans president pervez musharraf the dictator who reinvented himself as a u s ally against terrorism resigned to avoid facing impeachment charges for illegally seizing power and mishandling the economy
7735129 judge denies mans bid for new trial says deputies didnt intimidate jurors
7735130 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
7735131 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
7735132 if your are going to go with gore why not go with hillary who really earned her place there by campaigning for the presidency and winning 18 million supporters i guess it is too much to ask for a woman to be seriously considered even when she is qualified
7735133 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
7735134 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
7735135 theres a short list for show and then theres the actual short list
7735136 the ultimate fascination with veepstakes is as much about who is on the list as much as who might actually be chosen
7735137 that was a classic example of people benefiting from being on the list
7735138 before if you followed the nfl it was enough just to know the player
7735139 now more fans tend to know who the strength coach is for the baltimore ravens
7735140 al gore and dick cheney have redefined the vice presidency probably forever
7735141 that elevated the notion of do no harm to the golden rule of vice presidential selection
7735142 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
7735143 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
7735144 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
7735145 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
7735146 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
7735147 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
7735148 why dont we pass 1 3 trillion of that back to the people who pay the bills
7735149 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
7735150 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
7735151 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
7735152 free us from our addiction to oil free us from 4 00 gas save us from this climate crisis give us truly clean energy use the wind use the sun there is a solution there is no time to waste
7735153 we the american people are no longer asking were demanding
7735154 free us from our addiction to oil free us from 4 00 gas save us from this climate crisis give us truly clean energy use the wind use the sun there is a solution there is no time to waste
7735155 we the american people are no longer asking were demanding
7735156 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
7735157 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
7735158 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
7735159 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
7735160 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
7735161 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
7735162 sponsored by troops in iraq and afghanistan go k amp k
7735163 barack obama has chosen paris hilton as his vice presidential running mate
7735164 welcome to obama mobile you will now be one of the 1st notified when the vp candidate is selected
7735165 barack will announce his vp candidate choice through txt msg between now amp the conv tell everyone
7735166 dear supporter today our campaign joins in a historic partnership with al gore together we will move america forward yes we can
7735167 there is incredible enthusiasm for senator obamas vice presidential announcement and unfortunately some people have used that enthusiasm and sent out hoaxes
7735168 we can assure supporters these texts are not coming from the campaign and their data is secure
7735169 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
7735170 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
7735171 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
7735172 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
7735173 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
7735174 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
7735175 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
7735176 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
7735177 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
7735178 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
7735179 nothing nothing is going to keep me away from this special gathering
7735180 their stories are very different but they share a commitment to the timeless american ideals of justice and fairness service and sacrifice faith and family
7735181 leaders like them come along rarely but once or twice in a lifetime they come along just when we need them the most
7735182 id heard it from a pretty good source last night but everyone was thrilled to hear about it at our breakfast this is the kind of moment that sen kennedy lives for
7735183 id heard something over the weekend but his health is such an issue it wasnt clear if hed be able to come
7735184 im a cancer survivor and i know how draining this kind of thing can be
7735185 is truly humbled by the outpouring of support and wouldnt miss it for anything in the world
7735186 not only will everybody in our delegation be on their feet when he comes out everybody will be standing on their seat
7735187 this is important for the convention because of all that hes meant to our party over the years
7735188 it pushes the focus back on the challenge ahead and on obama and the race it gives people something positive to talk about
7735189 this may be ted kennedys final gift to the party
7735190 this says that he feels this is the democrats year and the party is not as unified as hed like it to be his appearance takes the headlines away from the clinton faction
7735191 happens to be somebody who i love to death hes just a good man and obviously hes going through a difficult time but im glad that we can use this convention to remind people of the contributions hes made to this country
7735192 the greatest legacy kennedy would want would be an obama victory in november
7735193 for all those whose cares have been our concern the work goes on the cause endures the hope still lives and the dream shall never die
7735194 you could see it as the word spread around town today from person to person
7735195 just charges the atmosphere here the emotion is enormous its just what you want to start off the convention
7735196 akin to a more advanced version of the companys nike ipod sport kit the companion system would utilize a new software application for macs and windows pcs that would serve to interview the user via a series of dialogs
7735197 it is qik and well be talking about it later
7735198 will be able to choose from verizons existing rate plans
7735199 every area you go to youre going to hear revenues are tight
7735200 so we want to make sure that whatever dollars you have lets make sure theyre funneled to where the need is
7735201 the question is are we moving away from a unified statewide standard that is high stakes to something that might allow for a little more disparity
7735202 at each site we have an unbelievable historic place a bunch of themes to explore
7735203 i think in practical terms getting the artifacts out there is the right move
7735204 how did we get all of robert e lees stuff from his son
7735205 how did we get all of stonewall jacksons stuff from his widow
7735206 i think it is critical for the telling of the history of the united states that the valuable moc collection is preserved
7735207 certain groups are unable to draw a distinction between a museum for the confederacy as opposed to a museum of the confederacy
7735208 we want people to stay here and not go to turkey creek wal mart took some of our customers away we hope to get some of them back and more
7735209 it will have fast consumption foods like doughnuts coffee candy and other small items
7735210 theyve been talking about expanding it for a long time
7735211 our staff spends hours researching and selecting potential locations for our new stores
7735212 along with careful evaluation of the needs of kroger customers in the surrounding area strategic planning and the design of the facility both play an important role whenever we open a new store
7735213 kroger competes with several grocery retailers in eastern tennessee and this concept provides shoppers with a convenient location quality and variety of products and lower prices to create a unique shopping experience
7735214 what the bookstore provides is far more convenience and the profits generated by the ut bookstore go to the university
7735215 each and every teacher went out of their way to explain why their customized textbook was needed
7735216 if you buy a pair of 5 jeans you cant sell it to someone who would wear a size 14
7735217 most of the students go through the bookstore to get their texts
7735218 both the science and the regulations are complex but at this point we do not believe the university has violated the act nor do we believe that a university professor has violated the act
7735219 unfortunately the july 2006 statement issued to the news sentinel following the seizure of dr roths computer was made by a ut spokesperson without knowledge of the details of the federal investigation
7735220 dr roth decided to operate under his own rules its not a should have known he did know
7735221 dr roth never thought and doesnt think today that part of the work performed by foreign nationals constituted technical data subject to the law
7735222 he has not stopped expressing his displeasure and his conviction this research was never subject to the arms export law
7735223 i do know that folks on the search committee who i trust are impressed with the candidates so im optimistic
7735224 were looking forward to having lunch with them and the public forums where they will speak
7735225 you want someone who is ready to move to the next level
7735226 mereka lebih sering disebut masyarakat sebagai orang gila stigma yang begitu melekat pada pasien gangguan psikosis adalah mereka berbahaya padahal pasien gangguan psikosis yang mempunyai kecenderungan berperilaku kekerasan hanya sebagian kecil yaitu tidak lebih dari 1 persen itu pun biasanya terjadi pada kondisi akut
7735227 bila dalam perawatan pasien kebanyakan tenang dan dapat mengendalikan diri selain itu kekerasan yang dilakukan pasien merupakan suatu tanda dan gejala dari manifestasi penyakitnya
7735228 artinya bahwa gangguan jiwa tidak hanya melibatkan satu faktor saja tetapi ketiga faktor yaitu biologi genetik psikologi dan sosial
7735229 pasien schizofrenia ini biasanya sering mengalami tanda tanda yang jelas di antaranya seperti mengalami halusinasi curiga melihat suatu benda benda yang tidak ada yang tidak dilihat orang lain
7735230 all the suspect cases have been diagnosed with listeriosis but it is only via laboratory testing the genetic fingerprinting that we can determine if they are directly linked
7735231 wir sehen zwar erste anzeichen f r einen wandel das ist aber noch nicht genug
7735232 das w re so als w rde ein rauchverbot zuerst nur f r nichtraucher gelten
7735233 no quarter shall be given in the continuing battle against terror
7735234 is trying to be a good partner only for the united states and often ends up in situations for which it later finds it difficult to justify itself to its people
7735235 russia sees this and cannot encourage such an approach but is ready to constructively resolve current problems
7735236 our politicians should not be drawn into sharp statements they need to bear in mind that russia and britain are linked by important ties
7735237 when youre the parent and youre watching you just get all choked up you just are overwhelmed with emotion
7735238 it was such a proud moment to sing the national anthem
7735239 blew my mind to see my brother up there the anthem playing was just too much for me kind of amazing experience
7735240 hearing the national anthem on foreign grounds is really special it was more special when bryan received his gold medal it was really a tear jerker for me it was wonderful
7735241 our grandson has been in the pool since he was a little kid and now he wants to be like michael phelps he doesnt understand his own dads greatness of what happened
7735242 hes saying hes still going to do it for four more years
7735243 it could be good for the nation if other corporate companies could emulate what standard bank has done to work with undp on an issue that is of national and global concern
7735244 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
7735245 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
7735246 shes brilliant and she tells all the stories about big brother so kind
7735247 his family is very diverse he has family from every race and religion everyone
7735248 she is so poised and so wonderful in how she addresses everyone same with maya down to earth
7735249 this one it think is a little special this tie from hawaii with barrack obama as youre walking around barracks state kinda nice
7735250 an obama advisor invited diddy to the convention but he was unable to attend because he was supposed to be in l a on vacation with his family
7735251 he didnt do the democrats any favors with that vote or die campaign it became more about getting the shirts out than people registered he didnt seem totally aware of the big picture that there was a presidency involved
7735252 that ad took on a life of its own no one wants to actually hurt the campaign and i mean really its not hard for celebrities to steal the spotlight at times
7735253 she has not rented a house to stay in while shes there
7735254 but new york took it a bit further than he was comfortable with
7735255 roger federer was supposed to do our magazine but he pulled out after the nadal cover athletes arent used to getting the celebrity treatment when it comes to their bodies it can be a bit of a gamble if you dont have control over the images
7735256 its a wonderful opportunity for these elderly people with no place else to go and its sponsored by the health care system the sisters health care system and the sisters of st francis its inter generational so it enriches the lives of both the young and the elderly
7735257 so many of them volunteer and during the course of the week theyre assigned to come down and work with the seniors we have some who are working with the pre schoolers also weve had some go into geriatric study because of the experience here
7735258 it gives you tools for life it gives you experience makes you independent and responsible and it helps others you know
7735259 the philosophy is to take care of the elderly where in many cases they would just be home watching tv so with this we give them a social environment
7735260 i think its a great way for the elderly to interact with other people and to have fun
7735261 i volunteer at the beverly manor in kalihi and this is one of the things that they do for the elderly plan activities and do games and sometimes we cook them food it just seems like a really good opportunity to help the elderly generation
7735262 never vote for a junior senator running for president regardless of who he she might be
7735263 start of a new day in america under obama start to loose freedom start to loose liberty keep growing government bigger and bigger start of socialism in the american government
7735264 as a lifelong democrat who will be voting for mccain this fall

7735271 platsen s g ut som att vara tagen ur en kinesisk saga
7735272 ibland blir inte allt som man har t nkt sig
7735273 they get gradually stronger and stronger and weve been faced with these problems for a number of years
7735274 the pharmaceutical industry is working hard in finding new and better antibiotics that are as good and now they need to be better than vancomycin
7735275 there are not that many cities that have faced this yet
7735276 we have a good microbiology department that can do the testing thats now needed to look for this strain in a special way
7735277 we have to be careful and cautious and use the rules that were learning about in order to try to contain this to avoid its spread
7735278 we had a grant to get some alcohol based hand sanitizers
7735279 we basically make everyone use that before they come in for their meals and also to just ensure that we dont spread it
7735280 so if you dont need antibiotics dont take them dont bother your doctor too much about getting an antibiotic every time you have a possible illness or a cough or a cold or things like that
7735281 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
7735282 i think the guy will do a great job of managing our team and the team has responded really well to him and thats where we are going
7735283 weve worked extremely hard over the last two weeks and im proud to be a miami dolphin
7735284 i mean he doesnt know any of us from the man on the moon right now but he comes into the huddle and says give me your eyes
7735285 we didnt break the huddle good one time and he was like nah nah nah next time weve got to stand and break the huddle just stuff a veteran with great leadership would do its pretty exciting
7735286 he brings management skills to the table he can manage a game really well hes a little bit calmer in there hes seen more situations
7735287 the guy has seen some of these critical situations that are going to come up
7735288 its going to be a whole lot faster when we play the jets the first game of the season
7735289 i can understand why they evacuated the school i dont want my daughter in a school with a gas leak
7735290 what i dont understand is why they couldnt go home instead of standing in the rain
7735291 a little communication would have gone toward allaying those fears
7735292 thats the first moves we decided to do to kind of change things and go in a different direction
7735293 the main thing right now is trying to get as many of the young guys up to the majors to play and get them experience and evaluate them to know what weve got and what we need to do to build on that
7735294 like i was telling jerry weve got some arms here
7735295 they need some work weve seen that quite a bit through the system weve got some decent position players coming along at the lower level
7735296 weve got a lot of guys up there already weve got louisville in the playoffs so were going to do our best not to disturb that club until the playoffs are over
7735297 there are a lot of similarities in this franchise and st louis
7735298 i told bob castellini that when he was buying them the reds we werent drawing in st louis the club hadnt won in a long time the farm system here is better than what we had there
7735299 we had a pretty good draft and weve sign most of them
7735300 were getting more involved in latin america weve signed two 16 year olds probably the top position players in latin america
7735301 it wont be overnight but i think it will be sooner than later
7735302 the free agent market isnt very deep a lot will depend on trades and whatever else we can develop through our system itll take a couple of years although wed like to do it sooner
7735303 in 1984 i was very unpopular with the democratic party
7735304 i had committed the unforgivable sin of losing in 1988 there was a little more warmth and this year ive been more or less reconstituted as a positive figure
7735305 i have participated in the last three conventions when we did not have an incumbent president to re elect
7735306 but will now follow the custom established during the past 40 years by other democratic presidents including harry truman who only attended the first convention after he left office
7735307 anyone who believes he is responsible for what bill clinton did in secret at night with a young intern is absolutely stupid and ridiculous carter told georgias delegates
7735308 he cant stand up as frankly as i did and explain it to you but somehow in the american peoples minds he has to convince them of that absolute truth
7735309 the video will be played as the flight arrives into india and should catch the eyeball of all the passengers we will also explore the possibility of expanding its reach and showing it on the airlines global network
7735310 land rover already has a dealership in mumbai for the past 8 10 years it is expanding the footprint in the country within the next one year you could possibly see its presence growing
7735311 thats why i want him on the ballot hell drain 1 percent of obamas vote it will be a close election and that will make a difference
7735312 a lot of foolish people will vote for ralph nader this was a strategic signature
7735313 the only way the major candidates are going to address these issues is if they are at risk of losing votes
7735314 oh thats random hes an elderly idiot dont mind him
7735315 are there any clashes or feuds between different groups in nepal i need to worry about or will you get along fine
7735316 what about a demo of sorts a game like this wont ever see my purchase if i cant even try it out
7735317 you cant go for a walk without momma or daddy
7735318 you dont know how happy what you just did makes us
7735319 its not like sunshine and broadway musicals are coming out of your ass
7735320 a study by hsbcs currency team in asia has concluded that chinas central bank is in effect forcing commercial banks to build up large dollar reserves using them as arms length proxies in a renewed campaign of exchange rate intervention
7735321 its scale or how to fund it hasnt been decided yet
7735322 its a hope shared by prime minister fukuda finance minister ibuki and me that new issuance of government bonds would be avoided to fund the economic package
7735323 we received credible information that drug cartels in mexico have given permission to hit targets on the u s side of the border
7735324 cbp is on heightened alert ever since we became aware of the threats in mexico
7735325 i am on a public sidewalk and can take photos of public buildings
7735326 no but you have to answer some questions for us
7735327 i wish to have an attorney present before i answer any questions
7735328 take your b s lawyer tactics and get the f out of here if we catch you around here again we are going to take you into custody
7735329 papa hurting papa fall down grandpa hurting grandpa fall down etc
7735330 i want to welcome him first the entire family has come the women in our households seldom stir out but tonight they are all here the village was all keyed up preparing for this unforgettable day
7735331 i cannot explain how happy i am to see so many people turning up to receive me this reception is motivational enough for me to work with renewed vigour to win gold next time
7735332 students continue to display exemplary behaviour when it comes to managing their finances and our research clearly debunks the myth that there is a growing debt crisis among this segment
7735333 a leading position of scale in a fast growing segment of the nutrition market
7735334 it is a close strategic fit with our core areas of expertise in whey and sports nutrition and brings us up the value chain into consumer markets
7735335 optimum also fits very well with the groups stated growth strategy and ambition to continue to internationalise our business
7735336 the company has strong brands and a broad distribution network in an attractive market segment
7735337 we have a long standing relationship with optimum and its leadership team
7735338 there should be scope for synergies with the acquisition as glanbia is a major manufacturer of whey protein in particular which is a main ingredient in these products
7735339 if you cant have fun with the people that you do ministry with youre not doing ministry in the right place
7735340 my fellow democrats my fellow americans it is so wonderful to be here tonight
7735341 nothing nothing is going to keep me away from this special gathering tonight
7735342 i have come here tonight to stand with you to change america to restore its future to rise to its best ideals and to elect barack obama president of the united states
7735343 this november the torch will be passed again to a new generation of americans
7735344 there isnt going to be a dry eye here we are all so used to him being strong
7735345 the demand that were seeing has far exceeded even our wildest expectations
7735346 i hope you realise that and not of the minority for whose displeasure you anxiously care the most
7735347 if you want to please everybody you can please nobody
7735348 we joined the coalition with full sincerity for the restoration of democracy unfortunately all the promises were not honored
7735349 the surgery performed for the first time in the middle east was done on 60 year old amer al jabry who has suffered coronary artery disease for four years and involving multiple blood vessels
7735350 i hope you realise that and not of the minority for whose displeasure you anxiously care the most
7735351 if you want to please everybody you can please nobody
7735352 given the announced issue yield for the treasury bond offered bidders will indicate the spread in basis points at which they would be prepared to sell the relevant semi government bond in exchange for purchasing an equal face value amount of the treasury bond
7735353 his name and what he achieved its so far out of any players reach in his time or any player who has played since its almost like he played a different game to what were playing
7735354 he would have been the stand out player whatever generation he played in
7735355 they talk about someone being the don bradman of aussie rules they equate other superstars in other sports to being somewhere near him which is pretty remarkable
7735356 is there anyone whos ever played any sport whos been able to achieve that level of greatness
7735357 what would the olympic equivalent be throwing the javelin 25 metres further than the next guy it would be a fairly dramatic increase on current records if you compared it to an olympic sport
7735358 the first thing that struck you was his stature he was quite a short little guy and very quietly spoken
7735359 but everyone in that room was in awe and everyone was sitting on the edge of their seat taking in everything he would say
7735360 i can remember just hearing his old interviews recorded before i was alive and hearing him play and as a public speaker
7735361 our strong operating performance over the year has enabled us to deliver a solid profit against a backdrop of record high fuel prices
7735362 our strategy is not to retreat in the face of volatile oil prices softening global economies and increased competition rather we intend to strengthen our position and continue adapting our business
7735363 we believe we will emerge from this economic cycle in an even stronger competitive position
7735364 now we have completely taken over nbt and i want more people to join them
7735365 they cannot claim their right to rally under the constitution because armed protesters intruded into a state office
7735366 they are definitely the toughest opponents weve had in a champions league qualifier i know people expect us to get through but its not as if were playing a mickey mouse team
7735367 the belgian league has a lot of quality and their champions are used to getting into the group stages we had a tough match against anderlecht a few years ago so im not surprised liege caused us problems
7735368 they caught us a bit cold in the first leg but you have to remember that they had gone something like 30 games unbeaten in their own league and they are a club with european pedigree
7735369 we didnt play well and we know well have to improve at anfield everyone knows how important it is for our season to get into the group stage
7735370 its always a funny time for us to have such a massive game before weve got going in the season some of our results have reflected that
7735371 we lost at home to ak graz in the year we won the competition and had a narrow win in the last minute against maccabi haifa two years ago so anyone thinking well win comfortably knows thats very dangerous
7735372 i believe im at the top of my game right now and like any player i want to win things i dont want to look back on my career and think i only won the carling league cup
7735373 i want to push on and win more and thats one of the reasons why i came to liverpool another reason is the fact that ive always been a fan and if i could win something with this team it would be a dream come true
7735374 the military will not stage a coup detat the public must not panic and must carry on their daily lives the army will not get involved in politics
7735375 now we have completely taken over nbt and i want more people to join them
7735376 today is judgement day i am ready if they want to arrest me if we have to go to police headquarters this time we will not simply stay outside we will get inside there
7735377 pad have seized nbt to cut off the government communication now up to 3 000 people have occupied nbt and they plan to do their own broadcast
7735378 they cannot claim their right to rally under the constitution because armed protesters intruded into a state office
7735379 as of now the prime minister has not made any change therefore i still think that the cabinet meeting will go ahead
7735380 wait for the prime minister so far there is no special instruction
7735381 going to shoot obama from a high vantage point using a rifle sighted at 750 yards
7735382 was directly asked if they had come to denver to kill obama he responded in the affirmative
7735383 he has developed a stress hot spot in his foot and we think it is on the back of his knee injury
7735384 that is the unfortunate path we wont see matthew pavlich this friday night but having said that we have played really well in the two games we have not had him
7735385 my last conversation with him he was going to consider maybe something with the afl or maybe the two new franchises
7735386 at that stage melbourne was not in the picture but they have obviously been able to attract cameron back to his old stomping ground
7735387 when you win in three sets it is a good results
7735388 i had some difficult moments in the match so that is going to help me be prepared for the pressure moments later on
7735389 i tried to keep my level up i tried to hurry him
7735390 he was hitting his forehand really hard and making me do a bit of running
7735391 it was a decent test and i came through it pretty well
7735392 in the first set i felt like i was playing against a wall
7735393 in the second set i told myself to just play your game and dont give up
7735394 it is tough to play opponent who doesnt have anything to lose
7735395 i didnt know she was 16 until they made the announcement before the match i did as much as i needed to win the match
7735396 as a mother i was crying and praying to god to help me
7735397 im cooking ashleys favorite cupcakes and ice cream and of course pizza she loves pizza
7735398 it was a moment that will be with me all my life
7735399 im really thankful what everyone did for me and my family
7735400 thank you thank you for me especially this is a miracle
7735401 just give me a fish i only want to eat for today anyway christ

7735403 um how do you put this hook thingie on the rod
7735404 but i could work out what they meant from the pictures
7735405 because still i mean all my thinking is there in beijing
7735406 now has come the time for us to attack them and they will no longer attack us from now on it is we who will march onto them bukhari

7735416 religious and theological degrees and other degrees from religiously affiliated institutions are some of the most commonly issued fraudulent substandard and illegal credentials
7735417 here is the answer to your request since 1993 dr rodney has both d min and d theology with school of bible theology seminary amp university headquartered in san jacinto www traccom org
7735418 some unsophisticated would be experts may truly believe it is possible for them to obtain a legitimate degree without attending classes or performing any study activity simply by using credit from lifelong career experience it isnt
7735419 i would be horrified to speak out against any servant of god at all
7735420 many of you already know that the lord spoke to me in july regarding todd bentley
7735421 i would be horrified to speak out against any servant of god at all
7735422 i fervently began praying and seeking the guidance of the lord on what to do
7735423 i dont need your prayers there is nothing wrong with me
7735424 i would be horrified to speak out against any servant of god at all

7735428 this sounds groundbreaking if it works it will influence the whole industry

7735442 there is an agreement actually reached reached between the two parties on a fixed date which is the end of 2011 to end any foreign presence on iraqi soil
7735443 yes there is major progress on the issue of the negotiations on the security deal
7735444 they the comments probably wont be very significant i dont know how many heard but he apologized and it wont have any impact i dont think they will look at that anymore
7735445 the only national organization in america representing indian american republicans
7735446 in delaware the largest growth in population is indian americans moving from india you cannot go to a 7 eleven or a dunkin donuts unless you have a slight indian accent im not joking
7735447 senator biden will be surprised to hear that i am a cardiothoracic surgeon leading a national association of indian americans who are physicians attorneys and small business owners
7735448 its amazing to know we dont all work at dunkin donuts or the local 7 eleven
7735449 the contributions to america by indian americans in the fields of medicine education science and business have been well documented
7735450 were not asking senator biden to apologize for his embarrassing stereotypical comments however we do appreciate knowing what he really thinks of his indian american constituents in delaware
7735451 senator biden will be really shocked that there will be another indian american in congress
7735452 i will be sure to stop by his office when i get there i would not be bringing coffee
7735453 the point senator biden was making is that there has been a vibrant indian american community in delaware for decades it has primarily been made up of engineers scientists and physicians but more recently middle class families are moving into delaware and purchasing family run small businesses
7735454 on the whole its very unlikely this issue will work against him
7735455 i think it is unlikely that it will blow up and become something larger because the democrats are protected against those kinds of problems
7735456 in a sense the racial issues are tied up with african americans and the democrats have a candidate who is part african american so i think the ticket will be beyond any questions about those issues
7735457 theres less than 1 percent of the population in iowa that is african american
7735458 there is probably less than 4 or 5 percent that are minorities what is in washington so look it goes back to what you start off with what youre dealing with
7735459 the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy
7735460 education taxes dont have to be paid for the first five years after annexation so theres a gap there
7735461 right now the citizens in mobile county pay 8 mills more than the people outside the city for education funding
7735462 it would make sure every citizen in mobile county would pay the same millage for education funding which we think is the fair way to do it and its the most stable funding source
7735463 it does make sense to have everyone pay the same mill everybody in the county pay the same sales tax regardless where you live
7735464 we are trying to survive and barely getting ends met by the taxes we have now

7735471 fernando is a wonderful driver who would be a fantastic asset to any of the top teams including this one the job ross brawn and i have is to build a world championship winning team
7735472 i failed to win at mclaren and this year there is no possibility of victory but that is only two years hopefully next year i will be a title contender again i have plenty of time and my ambition is to win more world championships
7735473 fernando alonso is set to team up with jenson button at honda next season to create the most powerful pairing in f1 he is thought to have agreed a one year deal for around 9 5million and will be allowed to leave renault if they are not competing in the top three

7735480 we as a nation and in business have become so short term focused that we have lost our balance
7735481 there are so many people talking about innovation as a sound bite
7735482 we really need to care about innovation it doesnt just happen
7735483 things look great you see web 2 0 companies ipods but a lot of that is incremental we are not doing enough to plant the seeds

7735487 the air force has increased the sheer volume of pilots put through the training pipeline and shipped them off to war with the bare minimum training required
7735488 have come directly from basic training as their first exposure to the professional workforce
7735489 we dont have good numbers but we know it is happening people are abandoning their fields of agave and flipping over to other crops
7735490 you practically had to guard your field with an army
7735491 a lot of people got rich and suddenly everybody was planting agave
7735492 you tend an agave for six years and then the price drops on you or you get hit with a freeze or something its a lot of investment to lose
7735493 when the price of agave is low people get demoralized and abandon their crops
7735494 but im not going to become a corn farmer yet these little ones still have a future
7735495 global cues are very weak and our opening would be subdued but i see buying coming in at lower levels
7735496 they want to see if there is any interest there
7735497 i was told all along that if something were to happen that this is a position i could find myself in
7735498 i am ready to step in there and hopefully there wont be a letdown at all
7735499 we are going to go forward with the players that we have
7735500 and we are always looking for and searching for people who can help our team and nothing is going to change with regard to that
7735501 i would have done whatever to try to get him back initially but now how could you not want him back
7735502 wouldnt that be something he comes back and we start a trend
7735503 as i know it he is probably on a beach somewhere sipping on some pina coladas so i doubt football is the first thing on his mind today
7735504 he has not been bouncing back and forth like favre
7735505 he has been pretty happy we saw him up here and he said he missed it but he was content he has decided to go on to the next phase of his life so i dont look too strongly into that him playing again
7735506 it is something that he all of us really wanted but obviously we didnt want these circumstances for him to get back
7735507 it is a good thing for him it is a good thing for this team he is definitely a d lineman at heart and hopefully he can just come back in and not miss a beat
7735508 one of the reasons for it was the debris that accumulated on the fence itself
7735509 while the bush administration may claim its taking environmental impacts of the border wall into consideration building wire mesh fences across washes prone to debris laden floods is fundamentally flawed
7735510 it doesnt take an expert hydrologist to anticipate the potential for these walls to become like dams
7735511 we are still required to follow every environmental rule regulation and policy
7735512 the monument had suggested that they take into consideration everything that can happen with a weather event
7735513 we had a concern that this was going to happen
7735514 i felt a wave of hot air sweeping all over me and a terrible smell of burning
7735515 i immediately unfastened the safety belt and fell to the floor the air was cooler there and we could breathe
7735516 unfortunately to date our demands have not been addressed rather more civilians including women and children are losing their lives as a result of air raids
7735517 the incident is under investigation we dont have a timetable on when it will be completed
7735518 coalition forces make every effort to prevent the injury or loss of innocent lives
7735519 expressed his condolences to the people affected in the airstrike
7735520 all efforts of the afghan government to avoid civilian casualties have not yielded any positive results and our innocent countrymen are still killed in anti terrorism operations
7735521 alleged violations of the laws of war by the milf in its recent attacks particularly in lanao del norte should be dealt with accordingly under its own processes
7735522 we support calls for an interfaith fact finding and mercy mission in conflict areas to show our solidarity and pastoral concern for the displaced
7735523 the peace negotiations cease to be authentic when it is used to extend the administrations term of office or if it exploits the current situation to push us closer to emergency rule as women religious we say no to these maneuverings and selfish designs
7735524 from our eyes of faith they are gods anawim belonging to the same family as the poor among christians and lumads in mindanao
7735525 anguish women and children who will be most vulnerable and traumatized in situations of all out offensives not to mention its lasting adverse effects on the environment
7735526 we grieve for the many lives lost in the still ongoing armed conflict in many of our mission areas we are currently accompanying thousands of internally displaced people as they struggle to secure themselves and their families in cramped classrooms public facilities and shared homes of relatives
7735527 we express concern that if the current all out war offensives of the government which comprises of air strikes indiscriminate shelling and militarization of communities will continue without let up we will be faced with a humanitarian crisis of massive proportions

7735530 jika melihat kisah drupadi sangat relevan dengan persoalan masa kini
7735531 drupadi memiliki peran yang besar dalam kisah mahabharata dia mempertanyakan banyak hal tetapi di kemudian hari dia menjadi barang taruhan dia menggugat dengan caranya sendiri dan terus mencari keadilan hingga akhir cerita
7735532 film drupadi dibuat sebagai suatu produk yang serius tetapi kami ingin penonton bisa menikmatinya dan merasa ada kaitan dengan persoalan yang dihadapinya
7735533 tantangan untuk menyatukan suatu cerita yang memiliki sentuhan tradisi dan memberikan elemen kontemporer
7735534 karena sosok drupadi adalah simbol dari perjuangan perempuan yang menolak dijadikan komoditas dan selalu bertindak untuk memanusiakan dirinya
7735535 if you were setting up a studio from scratch it would have a mixture of san and nas storage options
7735536 bringing on a nas storage solution was designed to optimise a studios thoroughput and make storage more profitable than putting all data on a san
7735537 pronas offer solutions across a range of solutions that are more cost effective while bluearc offers the high performance solution
7735538 previously we didnt offer any nas hardware so our customers were using normal ethernet networks for storage which was an inefficient way of doing things

7735540 many people know about the most common symptoms like tremor and slow movement but parkinsons can affect all sorts of everyday things most of us take for granted even singing laughing and emotions
7735541 for my dad losing the ability to continue his usual active lifestyle was distressing he loved his teaching job and was heartbroken when ask to resign after showing early signs a shaking hand at the chalkboard
7735542 having on board a kiwi icon like jordan whos known for his passion and zest and who has a real interest in and caring for people affected by parkinsons is amazing for us
7735543 he was able to grab hold of it and then we manoeuvred him back towards the ramp
7735544 he is a very with a capital v lucky man
7735545 only a few paragraphs about pacific peoples and relied on out of date data that gave a misleading impression of the situation
7735546 no evidence was provided to support the statement that they pacific people were an underclass or a drain on the economy they suffered disproportionately from the economic and social policies of the 80s and 90s
7735547 although they do continue to experience social and economic disadvantage their situation is generally improving and their economic social and cultural contribution is significant
7735548 massey university is firmly committed to the principles of academic freedom but equally firmly committed to the highest standards of research professionalism and ethical behaviour
7735549 the university did not release dr clydesdales material to the media and never endorsed the content of it it understands and regrets the hurt caused in some communities as a result of what was reported but also notes the commissioners finding that many reports were inaccurate

7735553 im going to return full fledged im looking forward to it im excited
7735554 i wasnt there last year im hoping the fans didnt forget me
7735555 its amazing fans are making all kinds of sounds then one guy stands up and everybody gets quiet and he starts moving his arms forming letters and a whole stadium spells out the teams name as one
7735556 people think i was giving up i didnt want to come it wasnt that believe me
7735557 whatever the record was it didnt matter i was biting at the bit every sunday it was killing me that i couldnt be there
7735558 i thought i might try to come back for the last couple of games
7735559 of course between me and the other firemen playing ball all those years the bodys getting worn down but the heart is still ticking and ive still got that passion ive still got that burning desire
7735560 when a touchdown is scored thats obvious so many other times you have to pick and choose you dont want to tick people off during the game
7735561 and the defensive chants are the hardest to come by youve got to get people up from sitting on their butts its a homefield edge the players feed off that
7735562 watching brett favre that close he just zips the ball
7735563 other guys throw a pass that wont be that tight a spiral it happens but it seems like every single pass with him its a tight spiral if you wanted to teach a kid how to throw a ball that would be the guy to show him and take the gray hair away and that guy is awesome shape tremendous shape
7735564 but you know whats more refreshing than anything with favre im just amazed at his humbleness a guy with all those accolades at that level for so long a time to be as humble and grounded as he is we went from a guy like chad pennington who just represented the organization so well to another guy whos on the same level even a better more accomplished guy

7735604 i have come here tonight to stand with you to change america to restore its future and to rise to our best ideals and to elect barack obama president of the united states
7735605 barack obama and edward m kennedy their stories are very different but they share a commitment to the timeless american ideals of justice and fairness service and sacrifice faith and family
7735606 leaders like them come along rarely but once or twice in a lifetime they come along just when we need them the most
7735607 i come here as a wife who loves my husband and believes he will be an extraordinary president

7735610 let there be no mistake about it we are united

7735612 when you win in three sets it is a good results
7735613 i had some difficult moments in the match so that is going to help me be prepared for the pressure moments later on
7735614 i was trying to stay focussed as well as i could
7735615 its a matter of how fresh i can stay for this tournament
7735616 i want to get some rest and make sure i dont practise as much as i did in beijing i need to save some energy for this tournament
7735617 i tried to keep my level up i tried to hurry him
7735618 he was hitting his forehand really hard and making me do a bit of running
7735619 it was a decent test and i came through it pretty well
7735620 there have been some great performances from a lot of players this year but we dont have anything like justine who was able to win every single tournament
7735621 the people are extremely enthusiastic about voting we are entering parliament with a clear agenda
7735622 this is the most sickening election they attack me saying i am pro jewish which is an act of desperation
7735623 we fear fraud we are not happy with the ballot list
7735624 its not anwar versus the other candidate its anwar versus the entire government machinery
7735625 i will vote for anwar he represents the voice of the people god willing he will win
7735626 i have no more faith in umno because theres corruption and abuse of power
7735627 our grandparents parents are all friends of anwars parents and grandparents so we know all these allegations against him are untrue
7735628 i think it is quite favourable for arif ahah based on the feedback from our polling agents

7735642 it is just astounding to me to see this build and build over time and the fact that someone can be both the liberal icon and the greatest legislator the party has produced in all of our lifetime
7735643 it is just extraordinary and his embrace of obama even though it didnt immediate affect the course of the campaign is a way of saying hes one of us and were together

7735715 ook de door de overheid verplicht gestelde groene standaardsteigerdoeken doen het stadsbeeld geweld aan zie vijzelgracht en worden niet zo liefdevol strak en netjes gehouden als de steigerdoeken met reclame deze zijn echter in sommige uitvoeringen erg dominant tegelijk zijn de reclamesteigerdoeken een welkome stimulans voor behoud en herstel van de binnenstad de voorgestelde bezuiniging op aanschrijving van onderhoud in de begroting van dit jaar is dankzij de opbrengst van reclame op steigerdoeken ongedaan gemaakt deze tijdelijke inbreuk op het stadsgezicht draagt op deze manier dubbel bij aan het behoud van onze binnenstad het stimuleert onderhoud van de gevel terwijl de gelden die aan het stadsdeel ten goede komen ook weer worden ingezet voor behoud en herstel de tijdelijke ontsiering van de steigerdoeken telt voor ons minder zwaar dan de permanente ontsiering van vervallende monumenten wij pleiten daarom voor het blijvend toestaan van reclame op steigerdoeken maar wel met een soberder basisontwerp er zou bijvoorbeeld een maximum aan het oppervlak voor de reclame moeten gelden of de reclame zou omrand moeten worden door een kleur die met de stad harmonieert een verdere uitwerking van de randvoorwaarden van de reclamesteigerdoeken inhoudelijk en esthetisch heeft zijn plaats in de aanstaande evaluatie van de proef met deze doeken

7735720 al de linkse partijen willen het onderwijs verbeteren maar wat willen ze dan verbeteren tweemaal per jaar een verplicht schoolreisje naar het partijbureau van groenlinks linkse propaganda als verplichte literatuur als dat zo is gaan we rituele schoolboekverbrandingen op het binnenhof houden het onderwijs moet gevrijwaard zijn van eenzijdige en verkeerde informatie

7735733 the position of potential buyers and current valuation levels have been negatively impacted by global economic and credit market conditions and specific issues affecting the ability of some industry buyers to participate

7735737 de cda fractie vindt dat vertrouwen goed is maar controle nog beter aan alle instellingen waaraan de gemeente hilversum subsidie geeft vragen we ieder jaar een financieel verslag maar de fracties hoeven zelfs niet te vertellen wat ze met de subsidie hebben gedaan dat moet anders want ook wij moeten open en eerlijk verantwoording afleggen
7735738 onder het motto vertrouwen is goed controle is beter is vlak voor het reces nog even een wet door de eerste kamer aangenomen die de algemene inlichtingen en veiligheidsdienst meer bevoegdheden geeft
7735739 de toegenomen focus op control en risicobeheersing ten gevolge van de corporate governance golf beperkt misschien de kans op ongelukken en onaangename verrassingen maar het motiveert niet en tast ondernemerschap aan sturen op vertrouwen door medewerkers meer beslissingsruimte te geven en op zoek te gaan naar succeservaringen motiveert wel en verhoogt de productiviteit meer control e dus des te meer vertrouwen

7735781 the barack obama i know today is the same man i fell in love with 19 years ago
7735782 hes the same man who drove me and our new baby daughter home from the hospital 10 years ago this summer inching along at a snails pace peering anxiously at us in the rearview mirror feeling the whole weight of her future in his hands determined to give her everything hed struggled so hard for himself determined to give her what he never had the affirming embrace of a fathers love
7735783 what struck me when i first met barack was that even though he had this funny name even though hed grown up all the way across the continent in hawaii his family was so much like mine
7735784 that you work hard for what you want in life that your word is your bond and you do what you say youre going to do that you treat people with dignity and respect even if you dont know them and even if you dont agree with them
7735785 who put those 18 million cracks in the glass ceiling so that our daughters and sons can dream a little bigger and aim a little higher
7735786 hes confident but not cocky hell take the shot if hes open hes a team player who improves the people around him and he wont back down from any challenge
7735787 i wont let him drive the car because everythings ringing i say pull over its too dangerous or we go the wrong places
7735788 i called his office and they had to hunt him down
7735789 when i finally got him he said he was at the dentists office i realized only later that he was being a doting husband looking after jill during a root canal
7735790 joe said to everybody hey i have something that id like to announce
7735791 and he said barack called me and asked me to be vice president
7735792 thank goodness for loyal customers or we wouldnt be where we are

7735795 there is a chance that there will be some enforcement of those that are cutting through there
7735796 we do keep an eye on that usually when we open up a situation like this
7735797 i think any traffic we get a this point is a good thing
7735798 im not going to necessarily say that they shouldnt cut through but i dont want people to get ticketed because then they may not come back

7735823 in sydney high oil and mortgage vulnerability is distributed across much of the citys western suburbs including hebersham green valley cabramatta and canterbury in the mid and outer west
7735824 the number of areas in which oil and mortgage vulnerability increased over the 2001 to 2006 period far outweighed those in which oil and mortgage vulnerability declined
7735825 41 per cent saw their oil and mortgage vulnerability worsen between 2001 2006
7735826 the full impacts of the dramatically higher 2008 fuel prices will probably not be seen until the early years of the next decade in this context the problem of household socio economic vulnerability and exposure to the impacts of higher fuel prices and mortgage interest rates remains highly relevant
7735827 the problems of suburban infrastructure deficits especially in public transport reflect the consistent failure of state governments to expand infrastructure to keep pace with the rate and scale of land development
7735828 these problems have been exacerbated by the planning of suburban areas around automobile travel

7735853 there are going to be questions going into the offseason personally for me im going to go out there and play hard every day as if we were in first place its important that the guys bear down and focus if we dont win we dont win but we need to bear down

7735855 he was already at 68 pitches no sense sending him back out
7735856 he was missing his spots against a team like that you cant do that

7735863 i think he wants to fight those big mega fights because thats the kind of fight we want to be involved with right now i think its a combination of seeing what the potential opponent is and also seeing what the ufc wants to do at the end of the day this is a business and they need to sell fights they need to sell a lot of pay per views and they need to sell tickets so we want to be involved with those types of fights were not looking past patrick cote but i think well take one step at a time and see what happens but yeah if a chuck liddell fight came up wed take it whoever the ufc wants to put in front of us he wants to fight the best and whoever that may be at the time thats who he wants to fight if the right fight was to come up for the new years fight maybe we would take it right now its really hard to say were pretty much just focused with anderson on the oct 25 fight
7735864 the way things are going right now i dont think well need 30 carries we should blow teams out
7735865 last year i shared the ball with steve i kind of liked that also

7735895 call me crazy but isnt it possible just possible that obamas lead is being inhibited by the fact that he is you know black
7735896 what makes obamas task of scoring white votes at kerry gore levels so formidable is to put it bluntly racial prejudice
7735897 if obama loses our children will grow up thinking of equal opportunity as a myth
7735898 to the rest of the world a rejection of the promise he represents wouldnt just be an odd choice by the united states it would be taken for what it would be sign and symptom of a nations historical decline

7735923 we try to meet their needs but the challenges we face every year are the same when there is flooding we cannot get out to the field so we kind of have to wait for the government to come in and do what it has to do to make the roads accessible again and things like that

7735955 cbp is on heightened alert ever since we became aware of the threats in mexico

7736012 conversations with random liberal strangers in new york city often descent into anger bitterness and crazy theories that cannot be argued with
7736013 to seek to be punished because one likes it is pathological a perversion of the normal response which is to shun or endure ones punishment as one might other pains burdens deprivations and discomforts only among the raskolnikovs of the world is ones deserved punishment welcomed as a penance to try to punish another without first establishing control over the would be punishee is doomed to failure but the power to punish as distinct from merely inflicting harm on others cannot be adventitious it must be authoritative and institutionalized under the prevailing political regime
7736014 being consumed by hate is damaging to your sense of humor
7736015 how weird it seems to us non rich people for someone not to know off the top of his head how many houses he owns
7736016 if female profs are more caring then whats wrong with students expressing their appreciation for that
7736017 recently i conducted an orientation session for new graduate students in chemistry and i gave them a survey to determine their familiarity with some common databases and research tasks i thought you might be interested in seeing the results i do not present them as scientific it was a small sample and i didnt have time to painstakingly construct the questions to spare you a page long e mail
7736018 are you familiar with the following databases for finding chemistry information
7736019 you can never say we proved we can play with them
7736020 i dont want that to be our confidence level because i dont think you gain confidence just from playing them close
7736021 and were not there yet i want to make sure that we dont walk into that stadium with a false sense of security or false confidence just because we played them close a year ago
7736022 the fear of getting your brains beat in is an unbelievable motivator
7736023 a ton of the players will take more belief with them
7736024 part of the team kind of went into the game unsure of about what was to happen
7736025 a certain percentage of the team went in like were going to take this game to them
7736026 and if i dont play ill be ready for kansas city
7736027 yeah i sure do ive been playing a lot of football so whether you play or dont play in the preseason id be ready no matter what its up to coach i was hoping i could play last week
7736028 i was wishing i could play last week and it didnt happen and itll be the same thing this week im hoping im out there and if im not im not im trying to get better as fast as i can in the ways i know how its been making improvement theres no doubt about it
7736029 i wont comment on anything else until i introduce our running mate to the world
7736030 i want somebody whos independent somebody who can push against my preconceived notions and challenge me so we have got a robust debate in the white house
7736031 there has been no harsher critic of barack obamas lack of experience than joe biden
7736032 ambiance of distinction embraces residents and their guests upon arrival and rewards them with soaring architecture and a bountiful treasure of luxury amenities that ensure personal comfort
7736033 the reality is they have some investment properties and stuff
7736034 its not as if he lives in 10 houses thats just not the case the reality is they have four that actually could be considered houses they could use
7736035 he doesnt sell meat or wool he has about 15 acres of land in oak creek near sedona with a large vacation home and about six smaller guest houses ranch evokes images of cowboys and horses and cattle roundups it makes mccain and president george bush seem like virile independent men of the land
7736036 does a guy who made more than 4m last year just got back from a vacation on a private beach in hawaii and bought his own million dollar mansion with the help of a convicted felon really want to get into a debate about houses
7736037 is a guy who lived in one house for five and half years in prison in vietnam
7736038 we decided we had to restructure and invite the community to the table
7736039 we are trying to do this differently and be very forthcoming
7736040 there will be friction if they continue to see the village as the place for them to expand
7736041 if i wasnt employed by them id feel like nyu is a huge monster eating up the best neighborhood but here i am
7736042 these are interesting buildings as artifacts not just because theyre peis
7736043 i started the orange bowl and i was like 252 that day
7736044 louisville of course had a nice heavy line i knew some of those guys because i visited up there they were kind of picking on me after the game
7736045 last year i went anywhere from 265 to low 270s right now ive got some really good weight on im running good i feel as fast as ive felt
7736046 thats what you worry about with high motor guys a lot of times theyre not able to put on weight
7736047 so its kind of nice to see john get bulked up a little bit
7736048 he played really well last year but he was exceptional in the bowl game against connecticut
7736049 he was seemingly unblockable there for a period of time and was in their backfield the whole second half
7736050 they just naturally slid in and out which is good for some things but it aint good for football so these surgeries have helped me and theyve made everything tighter
7736051 i like to feel tighter i can get more power and i feel more stable and when people hit me now my arm is not popping out so its good
7736052 everything has been doing well in terms of weight room strength im pretty close to where i was beforehand
7736053 ive heard a lot of people say you play just so hard
7736054 ill turn around to people and say youve got to
7736055 i dont know whether its my hair sticks out when they see me put on my helmet on the sidelines but the good thing is i think the whole team has a motor
7736056 in high school if youre that much better of a physical player that much bigger faster or stronger its not a mental game
7736057 its just youre bigger and youre better and you can tear them apart
7736058 my dad always told me that football is like 90 to 95 percent mental when i was little i was like whatever football is all about running into somebody full speed then when i got here i said he was right
7736059 i started thinking he said it was 90 to 95 percent its more like 99 percent it really is

7736068 hes on target all the time how can you punish a kid for being too good
7736069 i feel like its all my fault nobody could play
7736070 i think its discouraging when youre telling a 9 year old youre too good at something
7736071 the whole objective in life is to find something youre good at and stick with it id rather he spend all his time on the baseball field than idolizing someone standing on the street corner
7736072 its very hard not to think about the olympic games
7736073 very difficult to refocus i mean all my thinking is there in beijing
7736074 in russia if you stop anyone in the street and ask what is a grand slam i dont think many people can tell you but everyone knows the olympic games there is nothing bigger
7736075 people just come to me and say oh im happy for you
7736076 i dont know what is best to be a little bit tired but very comfortable and very positive or to be fresh and not play in the olympic games
7736077 i think this right here will be contagious and it will rub off on a lot of people
7736078 i think guys will see how much fun we had and be like man i want to be a part of that
7736079 but the good news is this unsolicited five or six of these guys have already said they want to be part of what we do going forward but we have plenty of time to sort through it they need some time off they really do
7736080 this has been an incredible experience from the day we had our first meeting so i think were all just going to get together one day and see whats next
7736081 we as a nation and in business have become so short term focused that we have lost our balance
7736082 there are so many people talking about innovation as a sound bite
7736083 we really need to care about innovation it doesnt just happen
7736084 things look great you see web 2 0 companies ipods but a lot of that is incremental we are not doing enough to plant the seeds
7736085 when i was in the basement studying data packets with vint cerf we didnt know where it would go
7736086 i thought we might be having an issue but it turned out ok i just made him stand up so hed know he was still in class
7736087 would i rather have jerome touchstone and justin woazeah at corner for this one with their experience
7736088 sure but we dont and really i like what we have
7736089 i was watching him do one on one drills and he was doing everything athletically you need to do for a corner
7736090 as camp has gone on hes emerged as the best guy there
7736091 hes stepped up to the plate hes got an awareness hes got an understanding
7736092 hes got great reaction to the ball hes a tough kid he tackles well and hes real athletic
7736093 ive got long arms so if they get a step on me i can still reach out and tip a pass i dont think receivers will overpower me or jump over me
7736094 touch played the position differently than dominique is going to play it for his size he has corner athleticism he has the hips and ability to break on the ball hes a smooth fluid athlete he tackles well at that size
7736095 i could have stayed at home or close to home but i felt this was the best place for me
7736096 its the best way to possibly win a national championship its the best way to get my name out there
7736097 he had a real strong possibility of making our football team
7736098 my heart goes out to him because i know thats tough but if he works like that hell be back next year
7736099 its really amazing as you look across the league at how many receivers are down right now its given opportunities for a lot of other guys the whole steve being out the first couple of games and with our numbers being depleted its a good thing our running backs are running as well as they are right now guys like myself d j hackett dwayne jarrett travis taylor were going to have to step up and make some plays
7736100 all of offseason training hes really been working hard i just thought that hes done a phenomenal job man we would really use a guy like that hes done just about everything the coaches have asked him to do and probably gone a little bit beyond that its just unfortunate to see a young guy like that get hurt
7736101 as with any position well do whatever we feels best to improve our team weve got some guys that have done that before well take a look at them and well always be looking at the wire
7736102 ya pas la angustia ya me desahogu ahora tengo que esperar la operaci n y preparar la cabeza para la recuperaci n
7736103 algo sab a que hab a pasado y empec a sentir inseguridad y miedo pero no cre a que la lesi n ser a tan grave

7736106 when a person has left you as many times as cecilia left me you could see it coming from miles away the first thought of going makes a sound as clear as somebody saying your name
7736107 there have been a lot of questions asked about what we are doing one i get a lot is about the points on clints team are we changing them what are we doing the points will stay with that team
7736108 we are going to get along just fine i am a big team player that is how i like to race i have seen a lot of success with it in what i have done with other teams
7736109 its a good match for everybody from the outside looking in it feels like it is going to be a good fit
7736110 last week was the low of lows i guess could you say for our team
7736111 theres not one specific place i could point fingers i just thought as a team we werent getting the job done
7736112 the driver is a big part of that team so i felt there were a lot of things i could have done different throughout the summer but for the most part mechanical failures ailed us if we can put a halt to those we are going to win races as often as kyle busch
7736113 a big night for the big picture were peaking at the right time and well be ready to go hopefully by the time we get in that chase
7736114 a great top five definitely a great rebound from the last couple of weeks
7736115 i saw those guys racing pretty hard up front those are the guys to beat right now so its understandable theyre the guys going for the championship in a way because theyre going to get those bonus points for wins and were kind of all second or third best right now
7736116 we got caught up in someone elses mess and gil martin his crew chief and all the guys did an awesome job fixing the car so we could keep racing we came out of bristol with a top 10 and were back inside the top 12 it was a really really good night
7736117 last year we didnt know if we were going to be any good
7736118 we didnt know if we were going to be terrible it was more of a nervous type thing we were almost scared until we played that first game we had no expectations
7736119 this year we have something to build on we know where we stand we know what the coaches expect from us we know what to expect from each other so its exciting
7736120 its very difficult to project especially in the first ballgame how the other team is going to play
7736121 if they do come out with something totally new a new look a new pressure we can get on the sidelines and instantly draw it up on the board and guys will go yeah ok now i understand what calls we need to make to care of that
7736122 a year ago it might not have been as easy to fix some of the mistakes
7736123 the guys are a lot more loose in the way that theyre playing
7736124 theyre just able to play rather than think about what theyre doing that way you can actually have a lot more fun you can do a lot more on the field
7736125 the coaches are actually able to put more plays in and have a little more excitement in how were playing whether its pounding the ball down the field or being able to blitz a lot more and things we werent able to do last year
7736126 ive talked to our team throughout all of training camp that every week its really kind of about us
7736127 you get caught up an awful lot about who the opponents are and when they are and all those kinds of things but weve got to play well weve got to play well and get better every single week

7736144 the fujifilm f50fds hike in resolution yields sharp images with lots of detail but it does come at a cost unlike previous models in the line noise permeates images shot at iso 400 and gets significantly worse as the iso is pushed to 800 and beyond
7736145 photo quality is really a mixed bag on the positive side the f50fd took well exposed photos with pleasing vivid color purple fringing was well controlled the camera definitely has issues with blurring around the edges of the frame
7736146 we feel this is a nice ultra compact that will please any user whether for home use or in an office
7736147 regular autofocus feels fast in most lighting but face detection feels sluggish at times it can take nearly a second to find a face particularly at indirect angles but that it can usually grab a near profile at all is in itself quite an evolution in face detection focus technologies
7736148 the f50fd lens shows some softness at the edges in both wide angle and telephoto but not so much as to be readily apparent at normal image sizes
7736149 we want to love the f50fd but we cant give it our full recommendation yes its packed with lots of features at a great price but its noise and dynamic range performance are terrible and its colors arent anything to brag about either the resolution may be fantastic but the processing time is so annoying that its hard to enjoy much about this camera
7736150 the good this camera has aperture and shutter priority exposure controls sensor shift image stabilization a nice slim design and face detection that outperforms the versions offered by most of the competition
7736151 the fujifilm f50fd also has very good responsiveness it turns on instantaneously and takes photos at a rate thats quite fast in general the f50fd will be a good companion for you on a daily basis its image quality is disappointing in its detail sensitivity and sharpness details are blurred and noise is visible starting at iso 400

7736156 we are turning the heat up on idol this year and are thrilled to welcome kara to the judges table
7736157 she is a smart sassy lady and one of americas most successful songwriters we know she will bring a new level of energy and excitement to the show
7736158 we had originally intended for american idol to have four judges
7736159 weve seen from our international series that having a fourth judge creates a dynamic that benefits both the contestants and the viewers

7736175 two months ago i wrote that unhappy hillary voters would come home to support barack obama by election day those that remained fixed against obama i further argued wouldnt be numerous enough or live in the right battleground states to play much of a role i still believe this but im getting wobbly in the two and a half months since barack obama won the nomination hes been trying to convince hillarys supporters but his standing with them has gotten only worse roughly 30 percent of clinton voters say they wont vote for him and this is not a one poll anomaly

7736196 1 in light of the cancellation swallows a sob was the season series finale enemy at the gate re written to tie up some loose ends and give us a closure or was it written in anticipation of the possible end and therefore will remain as originally written 2 are carson lorne and zelenka expected to make an appearance in the sga film

7736203 okay gotta point out some inconsistencies which you the other producers mgm and sci fi are spouting you all keep saying that you just found out about sga being canceled and it wasnt canceled to make room for stargate voyager this says different it is from an article by syfyportal

7736210 with the restraining order in hand sen biden s vawa removes the father from his home at any hour of the day or night separates him from his children requires him to stay away from his wife and immediately orders him to begin paying child support to his wife based only on her self reported fear vawa explicitly denies the father his constitutionally guaranteed due process protections children explicitly are denied the love and companionship of fit fathers in short the feminist objective of destroying family life is achieved and the only real beneficiaries are the lawyers while sen biden s contribution to the war on fathers and families is clear much remains to be learned about sen obama and his attitudes towards fathers and families

7736215 as a turbine blade goes around it creates lift like an airplanes wings and there is a small zone of dropping pressure maybe a meter or so in diameter on the tips of the blades
7736216 bats fly through this area and their lungs expand and the fine capillaries around the edges of the lungs burst
7736217 an atmospheric drop in pressure at wind turbine blades is an undetectable and potentially unforeseeable hazard for bats thus partially explaining the large number of bat fatalities at these specific structures
7736218 given that bats are more susceptible to barotraumas than birds and that bat fatalities at wind turbines far outnumber bird fatalities at most sites wildlife fatalities at wind turbines are now a bat issue not a bird issue

7736329 yeah well you wouldnt have been so impressed had you seen the same lesson 6th period
7736330 if you wait around for 18 months and say ill be back later for your evidence its not going to be there
7736331 we executed a search warrant based on probable cause that evidence was being destroyed in the house democratic legislative research office you need probable cause for a search warrant
7736332 this is a delicate investigation you dont just go in and grab evidence without probable cause
7736333 mr morganelli doesnt know what has been obtained and what hasnt been obtained he doesnt know what hes talking about
7736334 these are elected officials and elected officials contribute to candidates of their party that doesnt mean theyre best friends or they go out to eat together every night
7736335 theres a lot of evidence bonuses went to a lot of senate republican staffers who were not even working in harrisburg during the time they were awarded i dont know how you reward someone for work when they were not even working in harrisburg they were on leave working on campaigns
7736336 we cant say one way or the other even though its not a specific student
7736337 its an internal committee review were not going to be able to comment
7736338 theres something very peculiar about conducting an inquiry with a secret outcome
7736339 for the process to be believable it needs to be open and legitimate

7736345 youve gotta see this is the most callous inhumane thing you could do to somebody to deal with his only son
7736346 were not talking about my dog here a pit bull or something he did nothing aggressive
7736347 they werent beating him up or nothing but the situation could have been handled differently
7736348 they were hitting him with the taser and he wasnt fighting he was just trying to get back up he didnt understand the situation were they in the wrong i dont know
7736349 for all the sound and fury what we saw was a handful of prosecutions
7736350 there never was a grand onslaught people may have envisioned
7736351 its not so much the number of obscenity cases they bring but the qualitative nature of what theyre trying to do by bringing them
7736352 the prosecution is trying to set boundaries as to the acceptable realm of adult material
7736353 weve got tons of stuff they technically could arrest us for
7736354 and when that raid happened i put on our web site i made a big speech i welcome the lapd to come on down i said come and get me i said because we wont go down without a fight we will fight this regardless of the cost we will fight it
7736355 i just cant see them coming after us wasting millions of dollars taxpayer money to come for a videotape thats ridiculous
7736356 every day that were not in trial is another day our client is not convicted
7736357 i think the more likely answer is the sides havent pushed it forward
7736358 it cant disappear altogether as long as its a pending case its on someones radar
7736359 im sure there are political considerations but i wont speculate on that
7736360 lets make it a goal to outlast the bush administration and here we are we consider that a victory
7736361 its not the type of case thats sufficiently political to be affected by a change in administration
7736362 and as a practical matter very few pending prosecutions are
7736363 pursuing the adult entertainment industry has been a priority of this administration
7736364 whoever the next president is we would hope he will spend his resources on other important issues
7736365 caroline was part of the deal for teds surprise backing of obama an immediate family member said
7736366 you wont talk about the policy then take away the tasers until you can
7736367 we always seem to come together when something bad happens
7736368 my breath went it was a feeling akin to losing your child momentarily like the wind got kicked out of you
7736369 it was a little ziploc and a lot of money and i thought what am i going to do because i didnt see the ids at first
7736370 then i saw the drivers license and thought about how bad he must be feeling
7736371 when i was holding the stuff i thought i cant wait to tell them ive got it the joy of being able to do that was so much better than anything you could buy what could you spend 1 000 on that would make you feel that good
7736372 it was a joy at this end too it helped give me a little bit of faith back it builds on itself too its only been a week but i have been looking at people a little differently
7736373 one photographer said it was going to be on the front page of the paper
7736374 our knees buckled when we saw our daughter on the front page beside our senator joe biden
7736375 i didnt think it was going to be this big
7736376 my teachers all said theyre so proud of me everybody saw the story
7736377 a couple of kids said they might have kept the money
7736378 imagine the san diego comic con but on a website all year round

7736386 forty two gallons of gas which is a savings of one hundred sixty nine dollars and it costs me approximately fifty eight cents a day to charge this thing
7736387 the city ordinance specifically prohibits those vehicles that are defined as low speed vehicles in state law under title thirty nine low speed vehicle is any four wheel vehicle able to obtain a speed upon a paved level surface of more than twenty but not more than twenty five in the distance of one mile
7736388 i am sure anyone that uses logic is not going to use a vehicle like this on a thuroughfare or a street such as divide or washington or anyplace like that
7736389 i dont know where anyone can complain about this car being a problem as far as driving down the street i mean 99 percent of the streets in this city are 25 or 35 miles per hour or less
7736390 this clearly shocked me when i got it cause it almost puts me out of business
7736391 i just think the issue is the price of fuel now days you can get 80 150 miles per gallon equivilant on electric why would the city ban these
7736392 as a long time north dakota employer and the market leader in neighborhood electric vehicles global electric motorcars is disappointed by the bismarck city commissions recent passage of the ordinance prohibiting low speed vehicles on bismarck city streets no 5673
7736393 at a time when gas prices are painfully high and there is a great demand for eco friendly driving and when cities around the country are passing legislation encouraging lsvs on their streets we at gem trust that the bismarck commissioners will reconsider their position
7736394 well i can just keep on watering water is always a factor my windmill could never keep up and whenever i would go down to check on it i could never depend on it that is the biggest factor right there is going to be a piece of mind
7736395 you want water we are willing to provide water for you and give you some money to put it in but we want something in return generally what we get in return in the grazing system we are looking at the resource out there and we want to benefit the resource and by doing that putting water out there we will have more uniform grazing on that pasture we will get a grazing system on other pastures
7736396 we provide techinical assistance year round to anybody who wishes to have it so we will go out and work with an individual like jack and we actually work up ideas we are like another set of eyes and ears on his land so we look for opportunities to help jack with his production
7736397 i know the system works i have seen the progress and i have also heard to like in my other pasture where we do the cell grazing i see like a 50 pound weight gain on the calves alone
7736398 ah this is obviously some strange usage of the word safe that i wasnt previously aware of
7736399 in three words i can sum up everything ive learned about life it goes on

7736413 the current leaders fit the image of the type of people the middle class wants to see in charge
7736414 those who perceive themselves to belong to the middle class and who are government bureaucrats are more likely to support the incumbent authorities
7736415 i dont know if china is any different but our r
7736416 its imperative that retailers track the entire customer sales pipeline with a special focus on consideration
7736417 you need to understand the customers requirements or what they are evaluating in the decision to consider a given retailer for a particular category in most cases what gets you into the game will be different from what matters in a purchase decision
7736418 rather than just establishing loyalty to branded products retailers want voices of their own
7736419 they are seeking to establish their own brands and they are doing so by tailoring their customer experiences differentiating them from their competitors and creating better ongoing relationships with shoppers
7736420 guess what our teacher said we had to do today
7736421 but im going to this weekend in my own time
7736422 i suppose im going to have to be the adult supervision again
7736423 theres gonna be millions of adults there you can stay at home and ogle that satellite tv station that needs a special password to access burnt crust or whatever its called
7736424 you always use the same password or six digit pin number splatt
7736425 buppy cornflower plays mister splatt on rat trek you smile so hard when hes on screen that your gums recede its so obvious
7736426 like the chancel window in the church of saint belchers
7736427 but that window isnt very transparent at all the glass is stained
7736428 im going to spend saturday down at the ancient hamsters rest home
7736429 you are going to work in green mucus you wont last five minutes its full of miseries creeps and cantankerous old bastards
7736430 thats why the teacher suggested it he said itd be like a home from home he said i was over qualified he was going to suggest the mental institution but they were over subscribed with hamsters too scared of the rest home
7736431 u s recession and recovery u v or w shaped
7736432 theres been debate about whether its v shaped or u shaped
7736433 trying to make a desperate situation look sort of technical its not that much of a fuss the big boys can take care of it dont you worry
7736434 except the big boys here their trousers are getting a little short im afraid
7736435 this could extend itself well into 2009 with repercussions that could keep the country stagnant for two or three years
7736436 were not expecting this to be a hockey stick in the true sense of a hockey stick of a year at all
7736437 were closer to the end than we are to the beginning

7736439 the future of the hive does not depend on full employment for all the worker bees
7736440 in fact an accident can put many bees out of action without compromising the hive as a whole
7736441 it is not possible for any agreement to conclude unless it is on the basis of full sovereignty and the national interest and that no foreign soldiers remain in iraqi soil after a defined time ceiling
7736442 these discussions continue as we have not yet finalized an agreement
7736443 were optimistic that iraq and the u s can reach a mutual agreement on flexible goals for u s troops to continue to return on success based on conditions on the ground and allow iraqi forces to provide security for a sovereign iraq
7736444 unless these articles are changed it will be hard for this agreement to pass
7736445 its really not an issue whether they get a permit
7736446 it is an issue of what are going to be the conditions of the permit
7736447 this case is about thomas wright collecting campaign contributions and not reporting them
7736448 its not anything hidden or secret about it its pretty straightforward
7736449 i think theyre proving things that they dont like but i dont think theyre proving a crime
7736450 youre certainly supposed to fix your campaign reports right but it doesnt mean its obstruction of justice
7736451 the barbecue centers high sanitation record indicates the restaurant has consistently practiced good food handling techniques and procedures
7736452 weve got to get people in here and let them know were the same business thats been here for 50 years
7736453 we are not convinced that the government needs to take any action over the near term
7736454 really the safest thing you can do is make all your food at home from scratch period
7736455 sometimes we buy the product anyway and sometimes we dont
7736456 what does this really mean can i count on it as a consumer to really have any meaning
7736457 advisory labeling may not be protecting the health of allergic consumers
7736458 not suitable for consumption by persons with an allergy to x
7736459 i think this goes to the credit of the courts prosecutors and the investigators were working to keep families safe in the area
7736460 i asked him what type of sentence should i give someone who had placed rat poison on his barbecue and was selling it i consider crack cocaine poison
7736461 by selling drugs in our community he re offended thats the main reason he had to get a stiff sentence
7736462 what that did was it removed that urgency that we felt that we absolutely felt we had to get this hearing done if he was going to get moved
7736463 if he got moved he was going to lose his treatment opportunities
7736464 apparently the forensic unit didnt get a lot of consideration
7736465 there were some things that just werent very well thought through
7736466 its not just about the speaker but he mugabe has lost control of parliament which makes it very difficult to govern
7736467 the air force has increased the sheer volume of pilots put through the training pipeline and shipped them off to war with the bare minimum training required
7736468 within minutes of the injury matt was in serious trouble
7736469 it is likely he had a lethal injury from the outset
7736470 if you figure that the average player takes hundreds of hits every season during practice and during games you can see that the odds of something tragic like this happening are extreme
7736471 that of course is little comfort to matts family his teammates and coaches and everyone involved
7736472 fifty seven seemed to be everywhere today as the students expressed their care and thoughts for matt and his family
7736473 you dont have to get hit in the head to get a head injury it creates a concussive effect where the brain is bouncing around the skull
7736474 that likely served to further cut off the blood supply to the brain which contributed to a loss of basic brain functions and breathing
7736475 one of the reasons why there is support for the childress institute is helping to handle cases like this
7736476 the work begins anew the hope rises again and the dream lives on
7736477 that you work hard for what you want in life that your word is your bond and you do what you say youre going to do that you treat people with dignity and respect even if you dont know them and even if you dont agree with them
7736478 there are people who are not going to vote for him because hes black
7736479 and weve got to hope that we can educate people to put aside their racism and to put their own interests no 1
7736480 there is no doubt in anyones mind that this is barack obamas convention
7736481 feel an obligation to the people who sent them here
7736482 the democratic party strongly and unequivocally supports roe v wade and a womans right to choose a safe and legal abortion regardless of ability to pay and we oppose any and all efforts to weaken or undermine that right
7736483 really cant explain the price of gas or what has happened to the middle class
7736484 do we really want four more years of the same old tune
7736485 we are ready to compete in all 50 states in november
7736486 theres a moment that you want to enjoy your bitterness
7736487 to try to suppress the celebration that we all want to have about her achievements is what would tear this party apart
7736488 im getting a lot of calls and e mails especially from women who are quite upset that she was not vetted for vice president even though senator obama said she was on the short list
7736489 to stay wallowing in all of this is not productive
7736490 id never say that but alaska has the talent theyve got the engineers theyve got the corrosion focus and weve now got the risk assessment process we need to prioritize
7736491 to look at congress and look at the american people and say that we made a huge mistake and were sorry thats hard thats very hard
7736492 ich bin berzeugt dass barack ein au ergew hnlicher pr sident sein wird
7736493 von der grundschule bis zum college eine weltklasse erziehung erh lt
7736494 dass man hart f r seine ziele im leben arbeiten
7736495 wir wollen dass unsere kinder und alle kinder dieser nation wissen dass eure chancen im leben nur begrenzt werden durch die reichweite eurer tr ume und die bereitschaft euch daf r ins zeug zu legen

7736497 die demokraten werden diese versammlung in denver geeint organisiert und st rker denn je verlassen um amerika mit barack obama als pr sident und joe biden als vizepr sident in eine neue richtung zu bringen
7736498 i think about how one day theyll have families of their own and one day they and your sons and daughters will tell their own children about what we did together in this election theyll tell them how this time we listened to our hopes instead of our fears how this time we decided to stop doubting and to start dreaming
7736499 now you know why i asked her out so many times even though she said no you want a persistent president
7736500 barack doesnt care where youre from or what your background is or what party if any you belong to thats not how he sees the world
7736501 he knows that thread that connects us our belief in americas promise our commitment to our childrens future is strong enough to hold us together as one nation even when we disagree
7736502 scrimped and saved so that he could have opportunities they never had themselves

7736601 i would have done whatever to try to get him back initially but now how could you not want him back
7736602 wouldnt that be something he comes back and we start a trend
7736603 as i know it he is probably on a beach somewhere sipping on some pina coladas so i doubt football is the first thing on his mind today
7736604 he has not been bouncing back and forth like favre
7736605 he has been pretty happy we saw him up here and he said he missed it but he was content he has decided to go on to the next phase of his life so i dont look too strongly into that him playing again
7736606 it is something that he all of us really wanted but obviously we didnt want these circumstances for him to get back
7736607 it is a good thing for him it is a good thing for this team he is definitely a d lineman at heart and hopefully he can just come back in and not miss a beat
7736608 he is another one of those infectious personalities so his personality and his mind state are always going to be at the utmost highest so i am not worried about him on that point
7736609 im used to seeing these great big guys so when you sign them im getting my moneys worth

7736618 theyre a matter for the international community through the mechanisms at the united nations

7736620 will bring a new level of energy and excitement to the show
7736621 they always tried for a fourth judge because it followed the format of the original show pop idol
7736622 we havent had much luck with that working but were going to give it another try
7736623 thats going to be weird if its a split decision
7736624 im sure simon will get to make the final judgment but that takes the fun out of all the hard work i do to push those kids through

7736634 we had more broadcast coverage to more people in more places than ever
7736635 both you and i agree herein that in the sacrament is the very true and natural body and blood of christ even that which was born of the virgin mary which ascended into heaven which sits on the right hand of god the father which shall come from thence to judge the quick and the dead only we differ in modo in the way and manner of being we confess all one thing to be in the sacrament and dissent in the manner of being there i being by gods word fully thereunto persuaded confess christs natural body to be in the sacrament indeed by spirit and grace because that whosoever receiveth worthily that bread and wine receiveth effectually christs body and drinketh his blood that is he is made effectually partaker of his passion and you make a grosser kind of being enclosing a natural a lively and a moving body under the shape or form of bread and wine now this difference considered to the question thus i answer that in the sacrament of the altar is the natural body and blood of christ vere et realiter indeed and really if you take these words indeed and really for spiritually by grace and efficacy for so every worthy receiver receiveth the very true body of christ but if you mean really and indeed so that thereby you would include a lively and moveable body under the forms of bread and wine then in that sense is not christs body in the sacrament really and indeed
7736636 always my protestation reserved i answer thus that in the sacrament is a certain change in that the bread which was before common bread is now made a lively presentation of christs body and not only a figure but effectuously representeth his body that even as the mortal body was nourished by that visible bread so is the internal soul fed with the heavenly food of christs body which the eyes of faith see as the bodily eyes see only bread such a sacramental mutation i grant to be in the bread and wine which truly is no small change but such a change as no mortal man can make but only that omnipotency of christs word
7736637 think not because i disallow that presence which the first proposition maintaineth as a presence which i take to be forged phantastical and beside the authority of gods word perniciously brought into the church by the romanists that i therefore go about to take away the true presence of christs body in his supper rightly and duly ministered which is grounded upon the word of god and made more plain by the commentaries of the faithful fathers
7736638 i say and confess with the evangelist luke and with the apostle paul that the bread on the which thanks are given is the body of christ in the remembrance of him and his death to be set forth perpetually of the faithful until his coming
7736639 i say and confess the bread which we break to be the communion and partaking of christs body with the ancient and the faithful fathers
7736640 i say and believe that there is not only a signification of christs body set forth by the sacrament but also that therewith is given to the godly and faithful the grace of christs body that is the food of life and immortality and this i hold with cyprian
7736641 i say also with saint augustine that we eat life and we drink life with emissene that we feel the lord to be present in grace with athanasius that we receive celestial food which cometh from above the property of natural communion with hilary the nature of flesh and benediction which giveth life in bread and wine with cyril and with the same cyril the virtue of the very flesh of christ life and grace of his body the property of the only begotten that is to say life as he himself in plain words expounded it
7736642 i confess also with basil that we receive the mystical advent and coming of christ grace and the virtue of his very nature the sacrament of his very flesh with ambrose the body by grace with epiphanius spiritual flesh but not that which was crucified with jerome grace flowing into a sacrifice and the grace of the spirit with chrysosthom grace and invisible verity grace and society of the members of christs body with augustine

7736647 the us dollar weakened significantly against other major currencies in 2007 and according to some economists is expected to depreciate further in 2008
7736648 as a consequence other currencies particularly the euro are poised to weaken the us dollars dominance as the currency of choice for international remittances and payments

7736703 the special and careful enumeration of powers which follow the clause nugatory and improper such a view of the constitution would have the effect of giving to congress a general power of legislation instead of the defined and limited one hitherto understood to belong to them

7736772 because of the media and the fans theres more energy or electricity in the ballpark but you cant bring in a pitcher an inning earlier they dont give you two wins when you beat the yankees so you cant do it differently
7736773 if we put on a run here theres no question we can make it
7736774 theres no question with the number of games we have left its possible
7736775 im just glad at this juncture its at yankee stadium
7736776 im looking forward to it thats what you play baseball for is that type of atmosphere those type of games
7736777 i guess i felt more of that during the all star game because it was an all star game and you had time to maybe think about things
7736778 when were playing the team were just trying to beat them thats really what i care about i dont get too caught up in the other stuff
7736779 if you want more job killing trade agreements go work your heart out for john mccain

7736782 whether i play or dont play id be ready no matter what
7736783 its up to coach i was hoping i could play last week coach bill belichick made a decision not to have me play well see what the plan is for this week im not sure im hoping im always out there if i dont play ill be ready for kansas city
7736784 im doing very good im feeling very good i was wishing i could play last week it didnt happen itll be the same thing this week im hoping im out there if im not im not
7736785 im trying to get better as fast as i can and in the ways i know how its been making improvements theres no doubt about it

7736790 under the hardness of her facade a womans heart is still beating
7736791 when people ask me if i went to film school i tell them no i studied films
7736792 when people ask me if i went to film school i tell them no i studied films
7736793 im big a fan of the competition its not a distraction at all i think any game of football at this level you should look forward to and want to play in
7736794 the carling cup is a big competition for us and we go into all games wanting to win it
7736795 its a lovely habit to keep winning games winning five a sides winning head tennis competitions whatever you do want to win theres no time for losers in football
7736796 i think if you are here for 10 minutes you feel the buzz around the place and the buzz that our supporters created on saturday at blackburn was incredible
7736797 our lads were lifted as we were driving up to the ground and all you saw was amber and black we didnt see any blue and white shirts
7736798 the noise that those 6 000 fans made was absolutely incredible so that should give you a buzz to want to play for them and play for the shirt
7736799 ive got a buzz about going to swansea never mind the league which we can put to one side
7736800 we will make some changes but whoever goes in there should be trying to prove that they want to be in the squad for saturday
7736801 there are some key players who played a big part in the promotion last season who are not even getting in the 18 at the moment and these boys want to play
7736802 so if they get the chance to play its up to them to show that they should be in the squad
7736803 it will give the manager food for thought for who is going to be in the squad for saturday
7736804 in their english style stadium it will be a battle but we are determined we want to go through
7736805 we were tidy and played with balance but theres lots to work on
7736806 it was a useful international experience van gaal is a maestro and we learned some things such as the fact that opponents like these never throw the ball away
7736807 now our thoughts are on the slavia game and finding continuity
7736808 its something everyone tells me all about but you need to be there to really live it and feel it
7736809 its a special special game for the rangers supporters and i will do everything i can to give them a victory
7736810 we just need to perform well in longer periods of the game not just in 25 minute spells
7736811 to go from where we came from with the injuries and being 1 0 down it was a terrific effort
7736812 i thought there was a spell in the second half where we had the opposition rattled for 15 minutes and really at that point we should have put them to the sword
7736813 it would be nice if we can make a few injury recoveries but it is a great place to go
7736814 what a fantastic occasion it is for us to go to middlesbrough it is the first time in the clubs history and the boys will relish that
7736815 there might only be 8 000 or 10 000 there but it is a fantastic opportunity to be playing there against premier league opposition were flying up there and were going to enjoy it
7736816 fabrice has had a terrific impact he is a good player and i think he can get better and better
7736817 but what he has got to do is what he didnt do for us on saturday and we have spoken about it already he has got to add goals to his game and he has got to add a little bit of forward momentum to his game
7736818 he is exceptional at what he has been bought for but if he wants to get better he has got to add to that and i am sure he will do
7736819 he is a great lad and he is going to be a top top player
7736820 it is a big priority we have played two league games and we have taken three points
7736821 we have got a massive game at home against west brom on the saturday after and then fulham the saturday after that away from home
7736822 but the priority now becomes beating northampton at home we want to do as well as we possibly can in that cup
7736823 i want to pick the strongest team i can to get through in that competition
7736824 we have got a good result against villa you could tell the fans enjoyed themselves but now we must look forward to the next game
7736825 obviously when you get result in the premier league it gees everyone up were off and running now the confidence and the belief are there and i dont think we should be afraid of anyone
7736826 its still very early and we are not getting carried away and as soon as the game is over we look forward to the next match and that is cheltenham
7736827 every footballer wants to win games weve just beaten a top team and one that will finish in the top 10 in aston villa with some outstanding talents
7736828 but we acquitted ourselves in the right manner showed respect and it has done us the world of good and to show no fear but there is a long way to go
7736829 well mix and match it weve got a lot of players who are short of time on the pitch and this is an opportunity to put that right
7736830 it wont be easy i watched cheltenham at their place twice last season and its a tight ground and a good atmosphere they will be out to claim our scalp and whoever we put out will have to be up for it
7736831 he is a different player so he will establish himself in a different way
7736832 jonas has got it in him to be thought of every bit as much as david ginola but in a different way definitely
7736833 he has got so many assets he is not just one thing or two things he has got loads more
7736834 i said a few weeks ago i think the fans are really going to take to him
7736835 but i think the biggest thing they will like about his performance at old trafford wasnt the long runs and the fact that he went past people and kept the ball well it will just be the fact that it meant so much for him to play football and be in a team that wasnt going to be beaten
7736836 if i rest players i will have to call some of you guys in and looking at you i think that would be a big mistake
7736837 this be broken y0 its more to the point of addressing this part of what i originally said which many folks have skipped over
7736838 i think a lot of modern game design is actually unethical especially massively multiplayer games like world of warcraft because they are predicated on player exploitation
7736839 override that by plugging into their pleasure centres and giving them scheduled rewards and we convince them to pay us money and waste their lives in front of our game in this exploitative fashion
7736840 oh crap they stopped paying me go talk nice about the stuff these guys are doing
7736841 oh crap they dont wanna do this any more go find someone else who is
7736842 the secretary general congratulates the government and people of china on their unprecedented effort and success in hosting the historic olympic games in beijing
7736843 china can be proud of hosting a spectacular olympiad which brought together athletes and people from all over the world in celebration of games spirit cooperation and goodwill
7736844 my first big break was when i was five because i had learnt to read and write i am sure prisons and asylums are full of people who cannot read or write
7736845 it took me more than 70 years to realise that its that simple and its that profound i left school at 13 and had no formal education beyond that when i realised i wanted to become an actor and not a football soccer player i went out and got myself an education i read and i went to the theatre
7736846 it has been scientifically proved that seismic surveys do not cause damage to any monuments it is a very safe procedure
7736847 we have realised the urgency of infrastructure it is the key driver of the economy
7736848 i think we have another nuclear agreement in the queue ahead of that russian deal that were really focused on right now and thats the india civil nuclear agreement and thats generating a lot of work and time and energy on our part to get that done
7736849 we were able to work that through the iaea and now working with the nsg and trying to get that through nsg and eventually for presentation to our congress
7736850 the fact the capuchins predominantly selected the prosocial option must mean seeing another monkey receive food is satisfying or rewarding for them
7736851 we think it is self rewarding in the sense that the animals get something positive out of doing this
7736852 the only way to explain why you would feel good about doing something for somebody else is if you have some sort of stake in their welfare and thats really what the empathy mechanism is all about
7736853 our studies in mice showed that we could selectively kill the defective autoimmune cells that were destroying insulin producing islets
7736854 these results show that the same selective destruction can occur in human cells and connect what we saw in our animal studies with the protocol we are pursuing in our phase i clinical trial
7736855 what will happen to those families who gave their land with the expectation that their children will be offered employment
7736856 the protests in jammu and kashmir and other states has not had any negative impact on the tourist inflow to the amarnath cave shrine with over 5 29 lakh pilgrims visiting it this year which is more than double compared to last year
7736857 the bjp rss and separatist organisations are unnecessarily fomenting trouble in the state by trying to divide its people on communal lines by creating a row over transfer of the land to the shri amarnathji shrine board sasb
7736858 this is a big change in blubber and if it continues it could make it more difficult for the whales to survive it indicates there have been some big changes in their ecosystem
7736859 i dont think you could measure this by other non lethal means
7736860 that the court cannot give its opinion in a matter which is already pending before the supreme court
7736861 since the matter is pending before the supreme court we cannot give any opinion in the matter
7736862 the ordinance attempted to make a mockery of an order of the high court and the supreme court which stated that the regularisation was only a one time measure
7736863 although i have won bronze this time i am confident of winning a gold medal in the forthcoming asian and commonwealth games in addition to the london olympics
7736864 our principle focus right now has been on the india civil nuclear deal having worked through the iaea now working through the nsg and still trying to get into a position to make the appropriate presidential determinations in early september so thats our focus right now on the civil nuclear side
7736865 were going to continue to review what we will do about the various elements of the relationship with russia as you know weve been very focused on what to do for georgia weve been making certain that theres a clear message that there arent going to be any new lines in europe
7736866 such actions severely threaten the safety and security of civilians who have a right to protection under international humanitarian law
7736867 yet although many children have been released informally there has been no progress in securing their formal discharge
7736868 entering a hopeful phase for peace and prosperity however the promise of peace has not come to fruition for these children whose lives have been adversely affected by the conflict

7736871 estamos aqu por invitaci n de la municipalidad de chicama para verificar que esto se lleve de la manera m s transparente y es lo que venimos observando los resultados de esta consulta ser n tomados en cuenta por el concejo provincial de ascope para que en la ordenanza de adecuaci n se plasme lo que realmente desea el pueblo de chicl n
7736872 se supone que el alcalde del centro poblado de chicl n representa la voluntad del pueblo de chicl n entonces cu l es el miedo cu l es el temor de presentarse ante esta consulta que tiene todas las garant as del caso
7736873 mal hace el alcalde de chicl n modesto tandayp n auto excluy ndose como representante del pueblo est obligado a dialogar a buscar alternativas de soluci n para los problemas de los vecinos de chicl n espero que por el bien de los chiclinenses la actitud de modesto tandayp n sea m s constructiva
7736874 the dollar wants to pull oil lower and the storm wants to pull it higher its a bit of a tug of war right now
7736875 it just came with his nature he was always for helping people do better
7736876 so many of the times i called him to seek his advice had to do with personnel issues he was so good with that his counsel was always to be kind to people and treat them the way you wanted to be treated
7736877 ive been coming here since 1978 and the ball at the u s open has always been very light the fastest ball on the tour by a mile
7736878 this year the ball is different its very heavy it hits the racket and it gives a thumping sound i havent heard here
7736879 these balls really favor the guy who loves 17 ball rallies
7736880 today the double negative is often considered the mark of an uneducated speaker but it used to be quite common in english even in literature

7736905 yes its impressive yes its historic and yes its ridiculous
7736906 ive already decided what the play of the game will be in this one the final out
7736907 this is the first time that the police have asked us to give information about our vehicles
7736908 no vehicles apart from the ones owned by residents will be allowed near the pandal if seen either the residents or we will tow the vehicles away from the festival area
7736909 we have only five to six bicycles in the society since it is difficult to distinguish bicycles we will keep ours at home and will see to it that there are no strange bicycles in this area
7736910 going to shoot obama from a high vantage point using a rifle sighted at 750 yards
7736911 was directly asked if they had come to denver to kill obama he responded in the affirmative
7736912 clearly we found there are federal implications otherwise we would not have notified them
7736913 gartrell and adolph had planned to kill barack obama at his acceptance speech on thursday
7736914 its premature to say that it was a valid threat or that these folks have the ability to carry it out
7736915 i think keith olbermann has gone too far i think chris matthews has gone to far
7736916 man that was a great episode you know what would be great webcomics dedicated solely to stories about gamers living in their cartoony fantasy world that would be hella cool
7736917 lookit these newbs like its hard to do a webcomic about warcraft maybe i should show them what a webcomic would look like in the hands of a true master

7736925 or gods kingdom is like a jewel merchant on the hunt for excellent pearls finding one that is flawless he immediately sells everything and buys it
7736926 isnt he smart isnt she precious isnt your home lovely
7736927 hopefully what were talking about is something that will not happen
7736928 if it does we wouldnt just say come back next year what we would do is work with them on where they fell short provide them the resources they need the tutoring and when we feel like they need to be evaluated again we would evaluate
7736929 the bottom line is we dont have a job if we dont entertain
7736930 in my mind thats as big a part of the job as shooting under par
7736931 we are enjoying being good friends we have spent two years together you dont lose that
7736932 now that we are friends it is not something i have to worry about
7736933 for me michael phelps is a huge inspiration and someone i really look up to
7736934 to win a silver medal is certainly more than i ever dreamed of as a kid and im very proud of what i did over there
7736935 but missing out on gold yeah that will definitely be inspiring me now motivating me just knowing that i have those big swims those big achievements still within me
7736936 we are enjoying being good friends we have spent two years together you don amp squo t lose that
7736937 weve told police its you how do you feel about that
7736938 ein weiterer grund ist auch dass der goldpreis seit rund eineinhalb jahren st ndig am steigen ist
7736939 in 2004 we set up this incident management system to get staff to report adverse incidents so that quality and safety could improve in our hospitals its not working
7736940 what is working is that were getting staff to report in the past we didnt get these reports
7736941 every incident that leads to an avoidable death is a matter of great concern
7736942 having a system of reporting these incidents means that the staff have got the confidence to come forward to report them by having a permanent body that goes into the hospitals to do random audits and start improving quality and safety
7736943 what it is is to get in there and fix these issues in the past it just hasnt happened
7736944 the real concern in relation to these figures is that they werent included in the clinical excellence commissions latest report
7736945 the clinical excellence commission is meant to be looking at this whole area and it raises real concerns about the state governments commitment to that exercise if figures like this for an area health service arent contained within the report
7736946 we have a lot of families that really believe in education and support education those are assets that are tough to duplicate
7736947 there was slow progress in recent times but with the advent of the massive cuts and increase in class size the result is these test scores
7736948 we figure if we do those little things it pays huge dividends in the long run

7736951 if there is no peace then it is because weve forgotten that we belong to each other
7736952 its too early to tell if it will intensify into a hurricane or if oil installations will be in its path
7736953 but the market is reacting to it and edging up some
7736954 lately there has been a very strong correlation between oil futures and the us dollar
7736955 if there is no peace then it is because weve forgotten that we belong to each other
7736956 under the hardness of her facade a womans heart is still beating
7736957 if you think about the marketplace its a long way from where we were in 1989 1991 in the savings and loan crisis if we compare it to overall historical activity in phoenix this is still not a bad housing market
7736958 if youre a seller this is not the time to sell if you have to sell then be realistic about the price of your property and your property will sell
7736959 the key thing that we need to understand is that this housing market is not going to change dramatically in the near term and be much different than it is now
7736960 going to shoot obama from a high vantage point using a rifle sighted at 750 yards
7736961 as if in deep contemplation perfectly fitting of an emperor who was more of a philosopher than a soldier
7736962 every day i talk with a couple ceos just encouraging them to sell assets recognize losses raise capital
7736963 i cant think of a time in history when a ceo of a financial institution has gotten in trouble or lost his job because they had too much capital
7736964 and the testament to our system is capital is available
7736965 firms that can weather it may realize that with the distressed sales prices out there today they probably would be much better off holding the securities

7737074 in tribal camps the chief has the men set up at least two to three large bonfires the entire camp with us the bonfires for warmth and to keep animals away
7737075 this fire is too small and there is only one fire pit this fire was not meant for warmth or to keep animals away with the size of it it could probably on hold one or two pots at a time also it will produce very little smoke making the camp less noticeable
7737076 someone was smoking a rich tobacco tribes refuse to use it for it gives away their position to the plain bison
7737077 what if it is was a trader they dont need large fires and they travel in large groups too
7737078 an elemental flattened the roughen ground for his tent and the one beside it

7737080 that is what i thought dont question my intentions again
7737081 the gods damn alliance was here 50 miles deeper than the last attack
7737082 it could be a challenge they have been acting up a lot lately
7737083 i understand your concern tanner was right they are 50 miles deeper than i have ever accounted this could be a mess especially because they have a trained elemental
7737084 they came and went through the fallens gorge it looks like its a slaving legion they were probably looking for nomads as far as i can tell they havent run into anyone yet but we need to take care of this problem quickly
7737085 it seems too perfect too easy for us to just stampede through the gorge and attack them this slaving legion seemed too reckless i think it is a trap the alliance has been too quiet lately not having any raids or slaving legions come near the plains
7737086 but the camp is too small for a raiding camp and there is no signs of heavy s council would have to be mad to order a raid without at least 100 horsemen
7737087 commander christian is right inform the men that we will be heading south through the gorge within the hour the foot solders will follow in formation follow them from the sides or the rear dismissed
7737088 i know you are worried talliana but you can see that i am right
7737089 yes you are but i still have this nagging feeling that something isnt right
7737090 i have never gone against my instinct it has saved this legion and my life a hundred times why should i act differently today
7737091 your men would follow you to hell and back nothing wrong is going to happen it is just a slaving legion
7737092 i know i know now go deliver my message i need to get ready

7737103 the vaticans decision to move cardinal newmans body from its resting place is an act of grave robbery and religious desecration it violates newmans repeated wish to be buried for eternity with his life long partner ambrose st john
7737104 they have been together for more than 100 years and the vatican wants to disturb that peace to cover up the fact that cardinal newman loved a man its shameful dishonourable betrayal of newman by the gay hating catholic church
7737105 i dont think anyone disputes that cardinal newman deeply loved ambrose st john he did say after st john died that the grief is comparable to a husband losing a wife or wife losing a husband but he did not mean that the relationship with ambrose st john was a marriage like a gay relationship it is simply wrong to read back from todays categories into the victorian periods when these very intense passionate but totally celibate relationships in oxford and among the anglocatholic community were very common
7737106 i wish with all my heart to be buried in father ambrose st johns grave and i give this as my last my imperative will
7737107 much of the progress toward rebuilding the gulf coast has come at the hands of gulf coast residents in spite of significant hurdles placed in front of them by the federal government
7737108 have been virtually mute on the campaign trail about the real story and tragedy of katrina the naked face of poverty katrina exposed to the world three years ago
7737109 if the history of the katrina recovery were written today it would be a tragedy far too little progress has been made despite the remarkable effort and ingenuity of the people of the region who are fighting to restore their homes and their lives
7737110 much of the progress has come at the hands of gulf coast residents in spite of significant hurdles placed in front of them by the federal government the next administration must act quickly to remove those hurdles so gulf coast residents can truly and finally recover from the storms
7737111 a new administration will face the challenge of correcting the mistakes of its predecessor and a critical opportunity to rebuild the gulf coast better and stronger
7737112 the time is now to renew our promise and commit to a full gulf coast recovery
7737113 i believe we are at a tipping point he said because the scarcity of water poses a threat to the food supply just when the agricultural sector is stepping up production in response to riots over food prices growing hunger and rising malnutrition
7737114 more than enough food is produced to feed a healthy global population distribution and access to food is a problem many are hungry while at the same time many overeat
7737115 we are providing food to take care of not only our necessary consumption but also our wasteful habits
7737116 as much as half of the water used to grow food globally may be lost or wasted
7737117 curbing these losses and improving water productivity provides win win opportunities for farmers business ecosystems and the global hungry
7737118 an effective water saving strategy requires that minimizing food wastage is firmly placed on the political agenda
7737119 thats like leaving the tap running and pouring 40 trillion liters of water into the garbage can enough water to meet the household needs of 500 million people
7737120 unless we change our practices water will be a key constraint to food production in the future
7737121 people toss the food they buy and all the resources used to grow ship and produce the food along with it
7737122 improving water productivity and reducing the quantity of food that is wasted can enable us to provide a better diet for the poor and enough food for growing populations
7737123 reaching the target we propose a 50 percent reduction of losses and wastage in the production and consumption chain is a necessary and achievable goal
7737124 saving water from field to fork curbing losses and wastage in the food chain
7737125 the improved understanding of trade and water management issues on local regional and global scales are of the highest relevance for the successful and sustainable use of water resources
7737126 a lot of drug dealers and users used to come up here too
7737127 what we found out was that most people said they wanted jobs
7737128 because of the amount of awareness were growing the amount of buy in from individuals to the concept of sustainable agriculture
7737129 a lot of the vandalism issues we had over the first two years kind of disappeared
7737130 alemany farm is important not only because of the amount of food we grow
7737131 because of the amount of awareness were growing the amount of buy in from individuals to the concept of sustainable agriculture
7737132 people finally seem ready and willing to try something different
7737133 getting people who are involved to feel like they have more control over the basic needs of their lives
7737134 other community gardens operate under a plot system theres a waiting list and you go on your own time
7737135 but here its all collectively done this has always been everyones space
7737136 you know that saying you can solve all the worlds problems in a garden well its mostly true
7737137 the vaticans decision to move cardinal newmans body from its resting place is an act of grave robbery and religious desecration it violates newmans repeated wish to be buried for eternity with his life long partner ambrose st john

7737140 i wish with all my heart to be buried in father ambrose st johns grave and i give this as my last my imperative will
7737141 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
7737142 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
7737143 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
7737144 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
7737145 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
7737146 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
7737147 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
7737148 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
7737149 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
7737150 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
7737151 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
7737152 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
7737153 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
7737154 she hit so deep that it was hard to change direction on the ball and move her around
7737155 it was a learning experience playing on arthur ashe against a good player i just want to keep getting better in terms of tennis and my fitness
7737156 i think i help him a little bit to play to that level
7737157 sure hes good player he played well today but i didnt play with normal intensity i play a little bit less intensity than the last few months
7737158 its kind of weird that theyre switching week to week with playing no tournaments
7737159 its a little bit unfortunate you would almost rather have a clear cut no 1 or a really fantastic race like on the mens side where the players are winning the big ones to become no 1
7737160 i think it causes confusion just based on the weekly changes
7737161 barack and i were raised with so many of the same values that you work hard for what you want in life that your word is your bond and you do what you say youre going to do that you treat people with dignity and respect even if you dont know them and even if you dont agree with them
7737162 i come here as a wife who loves my husband and believes he will be an extraordinary president
7737163 i come here as a daughter raised on the south side of chicago by a father who was a blue collar city worker and a mother who stayed at home with my brother and me
7737164 you know what struck me when i first met barack was that even though he had this funny name even though hed grown up all the way across the continent in hawaii his family was so much like mine he was raised by grandparents who were working class folks just like my parents and by a single mother who struggled to pay the bills just like we did
7737165 barack stood up that day and he spoke words that have stayed with me ever since
7737166 i stand here today at the cross currents of that history knowing that my piece of the american dream is a blessing hard won by those who came before me
7737167 all of us driven by a simple belief that the world as it is just wont do that we have an obligation to fight for the world as it should be
7737168 18 million cracks in the glass ceiling so that our daughters and sons can dream a little bigger and aim a little higher
7737169 i come here tonight to stand with you and to change america to restore its future and to elect barack obama president of the united states
7737170 this november the torch will be passed again to a new generation of americans
7737171 i pledge to you that i will be there next january
7737172 god id give my left nut with a squirt of ketchup
7737173 the first thing that will help you make positive memories is there has to be positive choices on your part
7737174 people who attempt great things and fail are infinitely better off than those who attempt nothing and succeed
7737175 dream big and dont be afraid to go for it
7737176 when difficult situations come your way you wont have to wonder what youll do if your values are solid
7737177 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
7737178 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
7737179 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
7737180 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
7737181 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
7737182 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
7737183 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
7737184 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
7737185 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
7737186 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
7737187 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
7737188 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
7737189 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
7737190 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
7737191 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
7737192 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
7737193 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
7737194 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
7737195 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
7737196 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
7737197 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
7737198 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
7737199 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
7737200 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
7737201 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
7737202 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
7737203 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
7737204 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
7737205 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
7737206 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
7737207 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
7737208 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
7737209 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
7737210 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
7737211 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
7737212 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
7737213 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
7737214 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
7737215 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
7737216 this is a planning took where all things are going
7737217 as you approach texas 60 between 12th street and adams look both ways
7737218 if you see the newly installed beacons on the backside of the school assemblies flashing the school speed limit is 20 mph
7737219 we will have extra patrol out on the streets next week mainly to remind the public that school is starting and we need to look out for the safety of the children
7737220 we can usually cook what people want when they make requests
7737221 and our menu is constantly getting additional items sometimes we have a fish fry and sometimes we have other dishes that people request
7737222 we take call in orders all the time so that working people can stop by and pick up their food to go
7737223 the best thing about our store is our family of employees
7737224 no one works for someone we all just work together
7737225 and it goes without saying that we love our customers too
7737226 after he beat her and threatened her with a gun he walked to his car aimed his gun into the air and fired it once as an exclamation point
7737227 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
7737228 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
7737229 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
7737230 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
7737231 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
7737232 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
7737233 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
7737234 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
7737235 everything was going good until he started messing around on me
7737236 im sorry for shooting duke but he hurt me very bad love hurts and you dont play games with people s feelings
7737237 was going to shoot him in the leg but he wouldnt come around to my side of the car
7737238 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
7737239 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
7737240 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
7737241 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
7737242 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
7737243 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
7737244 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
7737245 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
7737246 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
7737247 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
7737248 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
7737249 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
7737250 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest

7737252 hello mrs volk just a followup to let you know that the mayor and i are working together and have instructed the city attorney to prepare an ordinance or a resolution to take care of the 1 year vs 3 year problem all the research i have found says that to require our city residents to get the vaccination for their pets every year is unnecessary i will let you know when it will be ready for introduction and would hope that you would like to attend our meetings and testify about the situation let me know if there is anything else i can do at this time about this situation thanks for all your info you provided and your concern

7737255 vaccines used in state and local rabies control programs should have at least a 3 year duration of immunity
7737256 there is no benefit from annual rabies vaccination and most one year rabies products are similar or identical to the 3 year products with regard to duration of immunity and effectiveness
7737257 classified veterinary vaccine adjuvants as class iii iv carcinogens with class iv being the highest risk
7737258 in both dogs and cats the development of necrotizing panniculitis at sites of rabies vaccine administration was first observed by hendrick amp dunagan 1992
7737259 come to my store over here i give you good deal
7737260 rabies in dogs is rare in 1992 the first dog in 22 years was diagnosed with rabies

7737263 uncle seamus i like you so much because youre a kid like me
7737264 if the vaccines are good for life why did the avma recommend every three years
7737265 he replied that is all that vets and owners were willing to move to it was too scary to go to one or two and no more for life

7737276 i jesus have sent mine angel to testify and bring for a son and shalt call his name jesus then unto you these things in the churches i am the root said mary unto the angel how shall this be seeing i know and the offspring of david
7737277 for now i know that thou fearest god seeing thou hast not withheld thy son thine only son from me
7737278 and god came unto balaam and said what men are these with thee
7737279 god led thee these forty years in the wilderness to know what what in thine heart
7737280 the lord your god proveth you to know whether ye love the lord your god
7737281 god left him to try him that he might know all that was in his heart
7737282 they have set up kings but not by me they have made princes and i knew it not
7737283 and it repented the lord that he had made man on the earth and it grieved him at his heart
7737284 and the lord repented of the evil which he thought to do unto his people
7737285 i god will repent of the evil that i thought to do and repent himself for his servants unto them
7737286 that i god may repent me of the evil which i set up saul to be king
7737287 the lord will repent him of the evil that he hath made saul king over israel
7737288 the lord repented him of the evil which he had said to the angel that destroyed the people it is pronounced against them
7737289 for i god repent me of the evil that i have done 1 chr
7737290 god repented of the evil that he had said that he would do unto them
7737291 and the lord was with judah and he drave out the inhabitants of the jer
7737292 ah lord god there is mountain but could not drive out the nothing too hard for thee
7737293 behold i am the lord the had chariots of iron
7737294 and he could there do no mighty too hard for the lord
7737295 go outside and stand on the mountain before the lord elijah and the the lord will be passing by
7737296 do i really have to go around the circle acting like a dog to exteriorize my feelings
7737297 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
7737298 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
7737299 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
7737300 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
7737301 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
7737302 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
7737303 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7737304 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
7737305 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7737306 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7737307 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
7737308 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
7737309 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
7737310 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
7737311 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
7737312 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7737313 i was stationed in thailand for three years 1972 75
7737314 i was in military intelligence and was stationed in northern thailand for 2
7737315 i was on duty late one night patrolling the deep water port at sattahip and received a radio call to return to headquarters at sameson
7737316 we arrived at a buddhist temple in the middle of the night and there was a large funeral pyre burning which was surrounded by chanting monks
7737317 the truck drivers then began handing us bodybags we were to remove the bodies and body parts from the bags place them on the pyre and stack the bags off to the side its then i noticed all the bags contained babies and small children when i inquired as to who they were i was told they were the victims of the c5a crash during operation babylift they had been held for autopsies the truck driver then informed me hed taken another load of bodies to a catholic cemetery in pataya for burial a day or two prior

7737322 nos guste o no chile que se enorgullece de su integraci n al mundo globalizado es y ser un pa s con cada vez mayores niveles de multiplicidad cultural y tnica en este marco los medios y en particular la tv juegan un rol central al ser los grandes constructores de estereotipos que son asumidos como verdades colectivas es necesario por lo tanto diversificar y complejizar el discurso medi tico sobre los extranjeros residentes los peruanos son v ctimas de la intolerancia y los abusos pero tambi n son protagonistas activos de nuestro devenir social contribuyendo a crear empleo y dinamizando la econom a ense ndonos a hablar como corresponde el espa ol mejorando cualitativamente la oferta gastron mica de santiago y en definitiva contribuyendo a que superemos nuestro enraizado provincianismo

7737324 seg n datos del ltimo censo del 2002 entre 1992 y 2002 llegaron al pa s un promedio de 19 mil inmigrantes anuales
7737325 estamos enfocados en c mo los migrantes est n desarrollando la ciudad y enfatizando las partes positivas que creemos que se est n observando porque si no se hace algo en este sentido en poco rato vamos a tener un problema de xenofobia fuerte

7737331 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
7737332 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
7737333 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
7737334 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
7737335 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
7737336 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
7737337 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
7737338 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
7737339 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
7737340 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
7737341 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
7737342 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
7737343 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
7737344 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
7737345 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7737346 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7737347 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
7737348 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
7737349 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
7737350 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
7737351 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
7737352 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
7737353 many others have been injured and we expect casualties to rise in the coming hours
7737354 there was smoke bodies and blood those who were left alive were in great suffering i saw a man clutching his leg and crying in pain and asking for help i saw people running away from the scene
7737355 that was my lemon i had to make lemonade out of
7737356 this wont be easy either but we could try and set up a hearing on the topic to send the message to the iraqi government or to pressure the us government to demand progress on the immediate equipping of the iraqi army etc along the lines of our solution
7737357 we could try to get a feature article published in a major newspaper such as the
7737358 allowed the iraqi government to virtually stop the preparation of the iraqi army to take over the fight in other words the iraqis let americans do the fighting rather than standing up their army for the job
7737359 i think they are all scumbags and the reason there is so much confusion is that everyone feels that somehow somewhere weldon is doing what the administration wants him to do
7737360 we had supplied identical guns to someone working on the film goldeneye so it seemed a reasonable order
7737361 he said some of the other prop hire companies were interested in getting some
7737362 he was acting in a way that made the hair on the back of your neck stand up
7737363 the mi 17 can be a plain vanilla transport helicopter
7737364 the united states invaded our country and all we got were these crappy tanks
7737365 will not act as a ceiling on the actual price of performance
7737366 the cost plus a percentage of cost system of contracting shall not be used see
7737367 a cost plus percentage of cost type arrangement would encourage the contractor to experience as much cost as possible to receive a greater amount of fee
7737368 as of this date seven tanks still have not started and therefore the checks could not yet be made
7737369 overall i believe that the tanks are in good condition considering that they were laid up for ten to twenty years electrical problems on 24 volt systems are certainly expected due to moisture and corrosion hydraulic seals dry out and rubber dry rots at this point we think we can still meet the contract deadlines
7737370 t he running test could not be performed on three tanks due to transmission problems these units are still being troubleshot
7737371 the number of tanks needing new engine head gaskets is now two i believe the most costly repairs will likely be to the sighting systems on one of the tanks the torsion bar is bad and there is a photo of a mechanic being able to turn the wheel with a pike indicating that there is no weight on the wheel
7737372 if we do not get decisions regarding repairs which are above and beyond those envisioned when the contract was signed we will have great difficulty in meeting the contract deadline
7737373 finally some information i reported in the activity report of june 24 was inaccurate i had indicated that with the spare parts just received we could get more than 50 fire control systems working with minimal costs it now seems that the donated parts did not contain the items needed to allow for the repair of these fire control systems
7737374 we are working out parameters for resuming bilateral cooperation in this field with our afghan colleagues and we expect afghanistans defense minister to visit moscow

7737377 knowing her nose better than anyone else i was in a unique position to take care of the problem
7737378 ive got the experience to be effective in washington d c ive got the proven track record for what i stood up for in juneau and ive been talking about the issue thats most on the minds of alaskans
7737379 those who supported me and those who supported barack obama but we are on the same journey now
7737380 instead they are an obvious attempt to smear the senators character
7737381 the utter illogic of the governments position reveals what is really going on
7737382 the government wishes to smuggle in suggestions of bribery and corruption that it has not charged and cannot prove the indictment alleges no quid pro quo for any gifts sen stevens allegedly received but the government now asks permission to introduce evidence of official actions in order to invite the jury baselessly to infer just such a quid pro quo
7737383 the negative consequences flowing from such disclosure particularly during a time frame when the defendant had been engaged in performing official acts for veco and bill allen
7737384 would have subjected himself to public scrutiny and criticism regarding his ongoing relationship with veco and bill allen and the fact that he was laboring under a conflict of interest
7737385 most importantly disclosure of the things of value and the negative repercussions flowing from that disclosure would have threatened the defendants future stream of things of value from veco bill allen and others
7737386 cannot credibly claim that he cannot understand the charges or prepare his defense
7737387 where the indictment charges that stevens received things of value at the girdwood residence the indictment specifically notes that the renovation work included jacking up and resting the house on stilts building a new first floor with two bedrooms and a bathroom renovating the existing residence and adding a garage with workshop and a second story wraparound deck
7737388 each and every detail of how the case will be proved
7737389 the prosecutors who were involved in the grand jury proceedings are not aware of any evidence introduced to the grand jury that reflects an act taken by stevens such as bills or statements on the floor of the senate that would be considered protected legislative activity
7737390 it involves enforcement of an unambiguous rule contained in the criminal law do not lie when required by law to provide honest disclosure of assets
7737391 is a misguided attempt to impugn sen stevens and his family before the jury
7737392 if they know you have legal advice they will be more careful
7737393 fits into the category of stock we have advised avoiding
7737394 enthusiasm is tough to come by in the smallcap biotech space
7737395 we believe that investors will be rewarded for their patience once the proper value of tru 015 and the pipeline are reflected in trubions stock price
7737396 it takes a whole bunch of expertise of different sorts
7737397 the banks dont want to have to put together 600 contracts with different merchants thats clearly something that needs to be outsourced and with the banking and airline industries in turmoil canceling programs that cost them money these programs properly executed can be profit centers
7737398 the game is not only about winning not only about being triumphant and winning gold its about the struggle of every athlete every day to achieve his or she own limits and to having this i will not give up and i will come back
7737399 to have ups to have downs to go through everything and be able to
7737400 it is really not a political event its about being an athlete and bringing the most you can to table whether you are strongest or fastest thats what we believe going into it
7737401 the games is not only about winning not only about being triumphant and winning gold
7737402 it is about the struggle of every athlete every day to achieve his or her own limits

7737464 but well be looking as we always do to use the turnover figures and redeployment wherever we can to minimise the head count impact
7737465 were targeting good efficiencies but were arent doing that by quoting numbers of head count
7737466 a wide range of initiatives will result in a head count reduction of approximately 550 employees in australia and new zealand or approximately five per cent of the companys full time workforce
7737467 media companies fit for the modern media world need to be lean and agile
7737468 this far reaching program will position us well for the next stage of our growth and development
7737469 over the course of the 2006 and 2007 financial years we achieved 52 million in ongoing real cost reductions
7737470 cost synergies associated with the merger of fairfax media and rural press and the acquisition of southern cross radio produced a further 53 million in savings
7737471 all of these synergies will be realised by the end of this financial year
7737472 weve largely absorbed the increased cost of funds in the current market and thereby minimised the passing on of those costs to our borrowers
7737473 in guiding amec through the change from industry lobby group to contemporary member services organisation justin has ensured amec played a vital role in delivering significant and positive advocacy outcomes for the industry
7737474 amecs role is not only important to the industry but increasingly to the country it must ensure political parties and the public understand the continued fall in exploration levels has significant implications and that the fall is directly attributable to policy impediments at state and federal level
7737475 it must then work constructively and collaboratively with government to implement the changes needed for australia to regain its reputation and by doing so increase investment in exploration in australia
7737476 that is not an easy task but amec is integral to facilitating those changes
7737477 because its been on the ground you dont know where its been its dirty and probably has germs

7737484 do we get to read a leo lionni story today
7737485 the word twat was used in context it was meant to be a nasty word on purpose because this is a nasty character
7737486 however jacqueline doesnt want to offend her readers or her readers parents so when the book comes to be reprinted the word will be replaced with twit
7737487 everyone was polite and seemed interested but no one offered to raise money to build her
7737488 i spent 5 1 2 years in a prison cell without i didnt have a house i didnt have a kitchen table i didnt have a table i didnt have a chair
7737489 i spent those 5 1 2 years not because i wanted to get a house when i got out
7737490 im proud of my record of service to this country and it has nothing to do with houses what it has to do with is putting americans in houses and keeping them in their homes and thats what i know how to do

7737502 ik doe mijn best ik geef het door maar ik kan u niets beloven
7737503 now you know why i asked her out so many times even though she said no
7737504 its premature to say that it was a valid threat or that these folks have the ability to carry it out
7737505 were absolutely confident there is no credible threat to the candidate the democratic national convention or the people of colorado
7737506 it could also turn out that these were nothing but a bunch of knuckleheads meth heads
7737507 vi ao longo de toda a minha vida sem excetuar um s os homens de ombros estreitos praticarem atos est pidos e numerosos embrutecerem seus semelhantes enfiarem o ouro dos outros em seus bolsos e perverterem as almas por todos os meios assim chamam eles o motivo de suas a es gl ria vendo tais espet culos eu quis rir como os outros mas isso estranha imita o era me imposs vel peguei um canivete e com a l mina de gume afiado rasguei minhas carnes no lugar onde se re nem os l bios por um momento acreditei ter alcan ado meu objetivo examinei no espelho essa boca ferida por minha pr pria vontade havia sido um erro o sangue jorrando abundante das duas feridas n o me permitia distinguir se aquilo era realmente um riso como o dos outros por m depois de alguns momentos de compara o eu vi perfeitamente que meu riso n o se assemelhava ao riso dos humanos ou seja que eu n o ria
7737508 when i came here i came because of the pension
7737509 i worked for less because i was looking toward the future
7737510 when i came on it was under funded and its still under funded
7737511 because it requires deep cuts to basic core services it will depend on how much the public will allow
7737512 you cant invest your way out of this i dont think you cant cut our way out either
7737513 well have to look at a combination of tax increases increased investments and maybe increased cuts
7737514 we have to convince voters we dont want to be back talking about this again
7737515 goed zoeken hoor meneer het is niet op mijn lichaam verstopt giegel
7737516 kemudian apabila engkau telah selesai dari satu satu pekerjaan maka bersungguh sungguhlah engkau berusaha meneruskan pekerjaan yang berikutnya
7737517 the move to smaller cars is going to be a permanent shift
7737518 we are aggressively transforming our product line to have more fuel efficient small and medium sized cars and utilities were doing that worldwide
7737519 the real focus to be successful long term is going to be that you have absolutely dynamite smaller vehicles to support worldwide customer preferences
7737520 i really think that the world has changed with fuel prices so the market will decide what it really values
7737521 the number one consideration right now almost worldwide is fuel economy and co2 carbon dioxide so i think we are going to continue to see movement to smaller engines but were not going to lose anything on the performance side
7737522 i think were going to continue to see v8s move to v6s and four cylinder
7737523 our best estimate of the market is that it will be 60 per cent small cars 25 per cent medium cars and 15 per cent large cars but each one of them will be important markets
7737524 each of the elements whether theyre investment support the green fund for technology the tariffs themselves the export credits are all elements of creating a viable automobile industry
7737525 our suggestion is that at this critical time when we are re tooling the industry and bringing out these new fuel efficient vehicles that this is a time when maybe a pause in that tariff reduction would be very appropriate to allow the automobile industry to complete this re tooling and get through this slowdown in the economy
7737526 we had a great conversation im personally very gratified that the leadership of australia believes in manufacturing and believes in a partnership to help create a viable exciting long term growing automobile industry
7737527 i think that we tried to express to the government when we met them that theyve got to work hard on bilateral ftas so as we produce focus here which we think is in the heartland of the size of vehicle that is appropriate for australia and for asia we need a strong export program and we need to be able to export into asia pacific
7737528 those ftas arent working in a balanced manner at this point in time
7737529 asia pacific is going to be the largest automobile industry in the world china is heading to exceed the united states and were forecasting that by 2015 to 2017 the asia pacific market will be 30 million vehicles largely small vehicles
7737530 thats why its absolutely critical that our australian operations make the transformation from only building large cars which have only one way to go which is progressively down to making cars that are relevant to what the australian customer wants and what the asia pacific customer wants
7737531 but i have a money belt or a fanny pack just for this
7737532 we are now controlling most of the key government offices to prevent them from coming to work
7737533 today we declare a long long holiday for the government
7737534 the government is still safe and sound and the cabinet meeting will be held at government house tomorrow
7737535 now you know why i asked her out so many times even though she said no
7737536 i think a lot of people were concerned about the situation at the municipal court making sure all cash collection points are covered
7737537 when i was working on state audit i had no intention of becoming the citys internal auditor i finished that up and went onto another city and i started looking for a job at the beginning of june and noticed this position was still open
7737538 going to shoot obama from a high vantage point using a rifle sighted at 750 yards
7737539 was directly asked if they had come to denver to kill obama he responded in the affirmative
7737540 clearly we found there are federal implications otherwise we would not have notified them
7737541 its premature to say that it was a valid threat or that these folks have the ability to carry it out
7737542 were absolutely confident there is no credible threat to the candidate the democratic national convention or the people of colorado
7737543 he also became well known through personal videos that were leaked showing him fornicating with animals this controversy has remained will hidden by simmons ability to buy people off with large sums of money
7737544 if obamas relationship with ayers however tangential exposes obama as a radical himself or at least as a man with terrible judgment he shares that radicalism or terrible judgment with a comically respectable list of chicagoans and others including republicans and conservatives who have embraced ayers and dohrn as good company good citizens even experts on childrens issues

7737546 hey those guys made a less than mediocre game on this gimmicky white piece of plastic and profited maybe we should too
7737547 i come here as a wife who loves my husband and believes he will be an extraordinary president
7737548 barack and i were raised with so many of the same values that you work hard for what you want in life that your word is your bond and you do what you say youre going to do that you treat people with dignity and respect even if you dont know them and even if you dont agree with them and barack and i set out to build lives guided by these values and pass them on to the next generation because we want our children and all children in this nation to know that the only limit to the height of your achievements is the reach of your dreams and your willingness to work for them
7737549 and in the end after all thats happened these past 19 months the barack obama i know today is the same man i fell in love with 19 years ago hes the same man who drove me and our new baby daughter home from the hospital ten years ago this summer inching along at a snails pace peering anxiously at us in the rearview mirror feeling the whole weight of her future in his hands determined to give her everything hed struggled so hard for himself determined to give her what he never had the affirming embrace of a fathers love

7737551 if i do i havent noticed them but then i wore a long sleeve shirt yesterday in case you hadnt noticed you wore a sleeveless shirt yesterday i did notice
7737552 i would say that as an ardent practicing catholic this is an issue that i have studied for a long time and what i know is over the centuries the doctors of the church have not been able to make that definition st augustine said at three months we dont know the point is is that it shouldnt have an impact on the womans right to choose
7737553 the christian tradition from the earliest days reveals a firm antiabortion attitude the condemnation of abortion did not depend on and was not limited in any way by theories regarding the time of fetal animation even during the many centuries when church penal and penitential practice was based on the theory of delayed animation the condemnation of abortion was never affected by it whatever one would want to hold about the time of animation or when the fetus became a human being in the strict sense of the term abortion from the time of conception was considered wrong and the time of animation was never looked on as a moral dividing line between permissible and impermissible abortion
7737554 destruction of the embryo in the mothers womb is a violation of the right to live which god has bestowed on this nascent life to raise the question whether we are here concerned already with a human being or not is merely to confuse the issue the simple fact is that god certainly intended to create a human being and that this nascent human being has been deliberately deprived of his life and that is nothing but murder

7737556 at the heart of any fertility incentive lies an attempt to encourage a particular group of women to orient their bodies in a traditional way
7737557 this is the type of thing that happens but not to you
7737558 you might be given jail time but for me this is like a life sentence
7737559 i think youve done this before and will do it again our family does not accept your apology we do not care about your self inflicted suffering you reap what you sow
7737560 whilst capital management remains an important issue given the current uncertainty in the debt and equity markets it is considered prudent to defer any capital management activity at this time
7737561 a share buyback will be continually assessed in the context of other initiatives and the capital market environment
7737562 whilst we are pleased with the momentum in the business we are mindful that discretionary spending continues to be influenced by macro economic factors such as inflation fluctuating petrol prices interest rates and lower consumer confidence levels the company said
7737563 the lower fuel margins reflect the decision not to pass onto customers the full cost increases experienced over the last 12 months increasing the competitiveness of our offer

7737565 at previous conventions the parties and candidates would hope that the video would be shown to the television audience and if you were at home watching you might see it

7737576 justice should go ahead now to seek a legislative fix to the digital telephony problem and all parties should prepare to follow through on the encryption problem in about a year success with digital telephony will lock in one major objective we will have a beachhead we can exploit for the encryption fix and the encryption access options can be developed more thoroughly in the meantime

7737581 the fbi could get a wiretap to investigate the mafia but they could not get one to investigate terrorists to put it bluntly that was crazy whats good for the mob should be good for terrorists
7737582 the justice department had the ability to use wiretaps including roving taps in criminal investigations of terrorism just as in other criminal investigations long before the patriot act
7737583 presidents illegal wiretapping program that allows intelligence agencies to eavesdrop on the conversations of americans without a judges approval or congressional authorization or oversight
7737584 i think most americans would be absolutely shocked if they knew what kind of bone chilling information is making its way over the internet
7737585 you can access detailed explicit instructions on how to make and detonate pipe bombs light bulb bombs and even if you can believe it baby food bombs
7737586 the extent to which the first amendment protects such material and its private and commercial distribution
7737587 can withstand constitutional muster in most if not all of its possible applications if such legislation is slightly modified
7737588 have been found in possession of bomb making manuals and internet bomb making information
7737589 what is even worse is that some of these instructions are geared toward kids they tell kids that all the ingredients they need are right in their parents kitchen or laundry cabinets

7737600 was directly asked if they had come to denver to kill obama he responded in the affirmative
7737601 we essentially had to duplicate a lot of the infrastructure
7737602 we wanted to reach out to the best folks in the business on what wed like to see as a forward looking technology strategy on everything from how to get more people engaged to information and data security
7737603 the tac has been a way for us to pull best practices from the private and public sectors
7737604 we built a brand new network because the network in place at the pepsi center could not handle the demand
7737605 we started by building a structure in the pepsi center which is essentially a main office and went underground to feed to customers
7737606 we essentially had to duplicate a lot of the infrastructure
7737607 as an example dnccs staff will be able to move among venue locations like invesco field and the hyatt hotel at the convention center with their cisco ip phones as they relocate depending on their changing functions
7737608 we are taking all of the steps that people would expect us to take
7737609 but were not going to talk a lot about them
7737610 weve added firewalls in place and weve got equipment in place to capture any kind of attacks
7737611 barack has chosen joe biden to be his running mate
7737612 joe biden brings extensive foreign policy experience an impressive record of collaborating across party lines and a direct approach to getting the job done
7737613 the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy
7737614 complimentary this is an incredible guy cmon hes a phenomenon
7737615 there has been no harsher critic of barack obamas lack of experience than joe biden
7737616 biden has denounced barack obamas poor foreign policy judgment and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realizing that barack obama is not ready to be president
7737617 this is not exactly a safe selection for obama with over 30 years of baggage accumulated in the u s senate biden is not the kind of running mate you would think of for someone who has campaigned on a pledge to change the way politics is done in washington
7737618 but it does signal that obama may be more of a realist than his rhetoric suggests and shows that the change candidate has decided that a wealth of experience may be important to an administration after all
7737619 for those subway riders who get off before the last stop the end is just a sign on the train whats there anyway it turns out there is often mystery lonesomeness and beauty
7737620 a washington d c native and staff photographer with u s news amp world report since 1994 he has a ma in photojournalism from the university of missouri columbia
7737621 the questions posed to mr bonds by two different prosecutors at his grand jury appearance were imprecise redundant overlapping and frequently compound
7737622 take the red ones ive never been disappointed by the red ones
7737623 i was sitting in the car not able to drive away because of the crush of people not believing my eyes
7737624 right in front of me policemen were beating young and old people some were on the ground badly injured it was the scariest thing i have ever seen
7737625 marvin gaye is the sexiest thing to happen to patriotism since the womens suffrage movement
7737626 mo fighter 3000 the entire cast of characters are females theres not even a male background character that ive seen well other than mike i guess but hes not human hes a stick and each of these females are exact replicas of every single
7737627 its not so bad being stuck its better than being stuck in the snow
7737628 in places the stormwater has overflowed into the sewer so there is the possibility of contamination we advise everyone to avoid stormwater ponding wherever possible if you come in contact with contaminated articles always wash your hands before eating
7737629 the only bridge into the motorcamp was getting up and was getting logs and debris blocking it and it was not certain if it was going to overflow
7737630 the water tables are high and all the paddocks in the para swamp area are completely covered the safety margins are okay at the moment but if this continues the water will get over the highway
7737631 it might have seemed a bit premature but in the long term it is better to be prepared than caught with our pants down
7737632 low lying properties adjacent to the omaka and opawa have been contacted where necessary for their security or livestock welfare
7737633 going to shoot obama from a high vantage point using a rifle sighted at 750 yards
7737634 was directly asked if they had come to denver to kill obama he responded in the affirmative
7737635 i just came up the rise and realised the road was fully flooded i hit the brakes and and went into the water
7737636 i cant wait to do this again when is the next photowalk
7737637 the thing about my family is theres five of us marge bart girl bart the one who doesnt talk and the fat one how i loathe him
7737638 i hate to jump on this bandwagon but katie holmes pre season football feel the excitement
7737639 no one has charged obama with wrongdoing something he has been quick to point out
7737640 instead of the softball questions hed promised to ask he threw a beanball straight at my head
7737641 the point id been making was the opposite of the one that senator biden claimed i had made
7737642 senator bidens smooth insincere promises that he would treat me fairly were nothing but talk
7737643 robert borks america is a land in which women would be forced into back alley abortions
7737644 it appears to me that you are saying that the government has as much right to control a married couples decision about choosing to have a child or not as that government has a right to control the public utilitys right to pollute the air
7737645 that the economic gratification of a utility company is as worthy of as much protection as the sexual gratification of a married couple because neither is mentioned in the constitution
7737646 do you think that there is a basic right under the constitution not to be forcibly sterilized by the state
7737647 acknowledges responsibility for most of the mistakes and misjudgments that led to his early departure from the race saying he was cocky immature and naive about the demands of a presidential campaign
7737648 to demonstrate the staying power and the seriousness a lot of you reporters doubted that i have
7737649 but only so far as it is clean and safe
7737650 no we cant at least not in the near term
7737651 if we were honest with the people having their profits yanked away wed call it the well earned and richly deserved profits tax
7737652 exceeding its after tax u s earnings by more than 19 billion
7737653 i was always hoping to wake up and the whole thing would go away
7737654 if youre going to do something like this you have to do it all at one time
7737655 you have to go and get a guy like mr druckenmiller and say its for control mr druckenmiller wants that or nothing as that has been made public
7737656 thats where its very difficult for me because this has been my life even in exile on the outskirts
7737657 justin is new he has to continue to develop that kind of relationship with the men he plays with but were excited with what he brings to the table and look forward to moving ahead
7737658 look around our division and look at some of the people we have to play against not only in the division but in the afc and there are some big and powerful men that play over center
7737659 hartwig has the skill set to wage that physical battle for us and well move forward
7737660 it wont require any medical procedure but it does need to heal hes going to heal this week
7737661 i dont want to speculate on that at this time i know hes not going to play this week
7737662 i would like to play it was good to get out there it feels good
7737663 we have a chance to get peyton activated and out to practice so well see how that goes
7737664 the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy
7737665 its a very naive way of thinking how youre going to conduct foreign policy
7737666 having talking points on foreign policy doesnt get you there
7737667 you cannot go to a 7 eleven or a dunkin donuts unless you have a slight indian accent im not joking
7737668 i would be honored to run with or against john mccain because i think the country would be better off be well off no matter who
7737669 i think he can be ready but right now i dont believe he is the presidency is not something that lends itself to on the job training
7737670 if the democrats think were going to be able to nominate someone who can win without that person being able to table unimpeachable credentials on national security and foreign policy i think were making a tragic mistake
7737671 i am not going to fail to protect these kids as long as we have a single solitary troop in iraq
7737672 this isnt cutting off the war this is cutting off support that will save the lives of american troops
7737673 we can call it quits and withdraw from iraq i think that would be a tragic mistake or we can set a deadline for pulling out which i fear will only encourage our enemies to wait us out equally a mistake
7737674 the clintons have to do this that and the other
7737675 you cant take on every special interest all at once
7737676 take mendenhalls ball away and get 100 from him and you get an extra 500 if you bring it to the running backs meeting room
7737677 hopefully he wont have too big of a tab by the end of the week
7737678 its for his sake to get his mind off last game
7737679 now he has other things to think about its not fun for him but it is fun for the other guys in the locker room its football its what we do we just want him to take it a little more serious
7737680 we just want to make sure that hes not fumbling at crucial times
7737681 we just wanted to give him a little extra incentive and motivation
7737682 eighty guys trying to strip the ball all the time but its something i have to do
7737683 if i see him out at a restaurant i better see that ball
7737684 the reality is he has to hold onto the football by whatever means that gets done i saw him walking around with a football a little bit as long as he doesnt fumble it hes fine
7737685 yeah im losing a little bit of money but it will be all right
7737686 its part of being a rookie you have to do anything thats asked of you especially if its a veteran like hines
7737687 hopefully he wont have too big of a tab by the end of the week what was his signing bonus he can afford it
7737688 its not fun for him but it is fun for the other guys in the locker room its football its what we do
7737689 margarita wil alleen met haar voornaam in de telegraaf uit angst voor boze rokers ze wil dat alleen thuis nog gerookt mag worden maar ook niet in de tuin daar zouden de buren last van kunnen hebben
7737690 het behoud van natuurgeneeswijzen in met name ontwikkelingslanden uit respect voor de eigen eeuwenoude geneeswijzen van de locale bevolking
7737691 a belief that i hold dear and write a story that illistrates that belief
7737692 our love is stronger then all the marvel heroes combined
7737693 a major reason that obamas rhetoric seems to soar so high is that our expectations have sunk so low
7737694 thats the first thing feed the dogs sabine and i do in the morning then we let the dogs out and then we feed the rabbits
7737695 advanced amateur photographers blur the line between the hobbyist and the professional looking for professional features and capabilities in their equipment that will allow them to capture that awe inspiring image canon is constantly striving to provide these shooters with the most advanced imaging technology like the new eos 50d digital slr camera to fuel their passion for photography and help them achieve their creative potential

7737700 o trabalho vai recome ar voltar a esperan a e o sonho seguir
7737701 estou aqui para homenagear dois homens que mudaram minha vida barack obama e edward kennedy
7737702 suas hist rias s o muito diferentes mas eles dividem o mesmo engajamento pelo eterno ideal americano por justi a e igualdade pela defesa do bem p blico dos valores e da fam lia dois l deres como eles raramente aparecem uma ou duas vezes por gera o
7737703 its very concerning and the warning is out there people who dabble in illicit drug taking can die
7737704 the factory is in hechi city but its location is far away from the city area we still have not received report of casualties said an official with the guangxi work safety bureau
7737705 we will release the related information as soon as we have something from the control centre at the scene said
7737706 the factory is in hechi city but its location is far away from the city area we still have not received report of casualties said an official with the guangxi work safety bureau
7737707 but well be looking as we always do to use the turnover figures and redeployment wherever we can to minimise the head count impact
7737708 were targeting good efficiencies but were arent doing that by quoting numbers of head count
7737709 but well be looking as we always do to use the turnover figures and redeployment wherever we can to minimise the head count impact
7737710 were targeting good efficiencies but were arent doing that by quoting numbers of head count
7737711 i want to see my kids the way i always saw them i put them to bed and id wake up in the morning and theyd jump into my bed i loved that and i missed that
7737712 you better stay away from me because im anti semitic
7737713 it puts the knockers on me working in this town
7737714 ive been waiting eight months for this day and what a wonderful opportunity to raise the plight of the murray river and make sure we have some action instead of reverting back to this constant talk and deferral of the tough issues
7737715 im excited and proud to be able to stand up in parliament tomorrow and move a motion about the murray as one of the very first things i do
7737716 thats what im about as a national representing country and coastal areas
7737717 by raising the tax on our truckies fuel how that leads to lower grocery prices for working families is beyond me
7737718 well certainly be having a close look at that one in the senate
7737719 the real concern in relation to these figures is that they werent included in the clinical excellence commissions latest report
7737720 the clinical excellence commission is meant to be looking at this whole area and it raises real concerns about the state governments commitment to that exercise if figures like this for an area health service arent contained within the report
7737721 this defense reliance on the incorrect advice of another is one of the most difficult to manage
7737722 presents an excellent example of what a difference good lawyering can make less deftly handled the defense case could easily have resulted in one or more convictions on the felony counts in that case the federal sentencing guidelines would have taken a severe bite out of bishops remaining years
7737723 gives them more leverage to do both markets for them and to aggregate more volume
7737724 the name of the game in the data centre is about uptime
7737725 its not sufficient to be in the ten major cities in canada
7737726 you have to be in the ten major cities around the world including peking and shanghai
7737727 as long as the data is at rest inside of canada if youre a canadian regulated firm i dont think youll have a big issue
7737728 if i want to expand my new line of printers theres lots of cheap ways
7737729 but in the data collocation business youve got build it and then sell it its a whole different ball game
7737730 so when you look at this group buying into q9 that says something
7737731 as a customer there is the ability now to work with a player like q9 but now customers can draw upon maybe other solutions other talent
7737732 uma m sica que o roberto fez para o caetano durante o ex lio dele
7737733 in the summer shade is our friend yesterday afternoon when the temp outside peaked at 99 9 degrees i checked the thermometer tucked into the deep shade of the mulberry trees on the west side of my house it read 88 degrees thats nearly 12 degrees difference hoorah for vegetation if your house isnt nicely shaded in the summer nows the time to plan for the fall planting of trees and shrubs plant mulberries they grow fast and yield the earliest fruit mulberry jam and cobbler are your friends too or they want to be anyway pay special attention to windows even if you have the best double pane argon filled low e coated windows they still only amount to about r 4 in insulating value divide the u value into 1 to get a rough approximation of the r value not counting our sun porch i have 291 square feet of windows if those windows were unshaded we would be pulling in nearly 4000 btus per hour of heat into my house from the hot afternoon outside just from the windows shading knocks a thousand btus hour off the heat gain shading plus r 20 insulated shutters for the window brings our heat gain down to 1700 btus hour the heat gain for our r 33 insulated walls is about 1000 btus hour and about the same from our well ventilated attic so even though windows are a much smaller area than the square footage of walls and ceilings as much heat gets in through them in the summer and gets out in the winter as the walls or the ceiling that suggests a need to pay more attention to windows its important that windows be actually shaded you still get heat coming through them but you get less heat if they are shaded from the outside one value priced window treatment that we used until our vegetation got sufficiently shady is to duct tape 2 or 3 auto sunshades together and hang them on the outside of the window while it takes a few years to grow a tree climbing vines like morning glories can cover a window quickly to make an easy trellis put eye hooks in the eaves thread string through them loop the string through a piece of lumber or pipe anchored to the ground below them grow the morning glories up the strings or other fast growing vines with lots of leaves to calculate heat loss or gain use this formula summer heat gain from the outside to the inside subtract the interior temperature from the exterior temperature divide this by the r value of the ceiling wall or window multiply the resulting number by the square feet of the ceiling wall or window you can use this same formula to calculate heat loss in the winter just reverse the outside inside temps so you are subtracting the outside temp from the inside temp you need a separate calculation for your windows your walls and your ceiling in a spreadsheet and substitute different r values to determine how adding insulation to walls or ceilings shade to the outside and or insulated shutters for your windows will impact the movement of heat to the interior in the summer or the exterior in the winter remember heat always moves toward cold
7737734 re using means rethinking our role as consumers and becoming conservers it means stepping outside the prevailing culture from time to time and liberating ourselves from the thousands of daily messages on television radio magazines and billboards exhorting us to spend and comsume
7737735 young women who were exposed to a number of life events should be considered as a risk group for breast cancer and treated accordingly
7737736 we can carefully say that experiencing more than one meaningful life event is a risk factor for breast cancer among young women
7737737 on the other hand general feelings of happiness and optimism can play a protective role against the disease

7737756 ruth was my life partner and we were called by god as a team
7737757 no one else could have borne the load that she carried she was a vital and integral part of our ministry and my work through the years would have been impossible without her encouragement and support
7737758 i am so grateful to the lord that he gave me ruth and especially for these last few years weve had in the mountains together weve rekindled the romance of our youth and my love for her continued to grow deeper every day i will miss her terribly and look forward even more to the day i can join her in heaven
7737759 we received reports from the field that two pairs of combat boots documents and aircraft debris were found by fishermen at davao gulf off davao city
7737760 its one of those things that if you do it you have to commit to it regardless of whether you go low tech or high tech
7737761 by going through each screenshot and watching it like a movie and seeing what the person was doing
7737762 gunmen in a landcruiser opened fire at the car but no one was hurt
7737763 there were no injuries and minimal damage to the vehicle

7737778 discontent over the failure of our political system is rampant throughout our citizenry
7737779 it is in this gathering of discontent that my candidacy intends to find its voice
7737780 we wonder why it is that blue collar workers who come from a heritage that is the democratic party began to leave it its because we really dont respect them

7737784 is it a surprise that russia would not be hostile to new missile sites on its borders or foreign involvement in its sphere of influence as despicable as russian intervention is in georgia remember our response to cuban missiles and our current intervention in iraq

7737795 and now when there is a lot of competition for nurses the medical center is losing valuable nursing talent
7737796 the hospital has already reached agreement with the mna on many important and substantive issues and we are hopeful that we will soon reach agreement with the mna nurses on the issues that remain unresolved
7737797 as swift and graceful as the shadow of a dancing leaf
7737798 they are the ones the locals say who are carousing brawling and getting violently sick they are the ones crowding into health clinics seeking morning after pills and help for sexually transmitted diseases they are the ones who seem to have one vacation plan drinking themselves into oblivion
7737799 the number of cases referred from law enforcement in years past was much smaller
7737800 users are very trusting of messages left by friends on social networking sites so the likelihood of a user clicking on a link like this is very high

7737803 the work begins anew the hope rises again and the dream lives on
7737804 my fellow democrats my fellow americans it is so wonderful to be here
7737805 and nothing nothing is going to keep me away from this special gathering
7737806 i have come here tonight to stand with you to change america to restore its future to rise to our best ideals and to elect barack obama president of the united states
7737807 as i look ahead i am strengthened by family and friendship
7737808 so many of you have been with me in the happiest days and the hardest days together we have known success and seen setbacks victory and defeat
7737809 but we have never lost our belief that we are all called to a better country and a newer world
7737810 and i pledge to you i pledge to you that i will be there next january on the floor of the united states senate when we begin the great test
7737811 has been a senator for all who believe that the dream has never died
7737812 two men who have changed my life and the life of this country
7737813 but once or twice in a lifetime they come along just when we need them the most this is one of those moments
7737814 when he is president he will have no stronger partner in the united states senate
7737815 barack si cu mine am fost crescuti in respectul a numeroase valori trebuie sa muncesti dur pentru a obtine ceea ce vrei in viata cuvantul dat este sfant si trebuie sa faci ceea ce ai spus trebuie sa tratezi oamenii cu respesct chiar daca nu ii cunosti sau daca nu esti de acord cu ei
7737816 we are united and we are together and we are determined
7737817 there is no way i will vote for any ticket with obamas name on it i will vote for john mccain instead
7737818 is that every delegate would stand up for her and she will be the nominee
7737819 we were not all on the same side as democrats but we are now
7737820 we are united and we are together and we are determined
7737821 support of barack obama is clear she has said repeatedly that barack obama and she share a commitment to changing the direction of the country getting us out of iraq and expanding access to health care
7737822 then i realised how lame i am for watching this
7737823 wed better burn it down so that they would never return
7737824 while they shelled the town tskhinvali i was in the cellar with the natives there were 10 adults and one child in the cellar he trembled with fear all the time they tried to close his ears but the cellar shook and the child felt that
7737825 do you feel sorry why you should not they came with guns here
7737826 just like the russian soldiers who got the order from the command
7737827 i didnt ask anyone no one is able to stop volunteers we went to defend ossetians
7737828 there were rumors that we were to get out of the village because war would start
7737829 they told us that the georgians warned us but no one believed some people left others stayed here we have got used to it
7737830 something fell in the yard the house shook my heart ached but i am alive
7737831 they were looking for me and i hid in the yard they couldnt find me and said i was dead im here alone there were tanks driving throughout the village i heard the soldiers speak georgian i lay on the ground i have no cellar and i was afraid to stay in the house if it had got ruined no one would have rescued me
7737832 they all left i should leave too they forgot to take me with them there are so many corpses here they smell i cant bury them i must get out of here
7737833 then the tanks followed it was at night then they started shelling the georgians fired two days when i asked one of them why they destroyed our houses he replied your militants fire at our villages the government will build other houses for you i asked what government saakashvili hasnt managed to build anything in his country he had nothing to answer
7737834 these militants came at night they are not natives they are town dwellers

7738150 barack and i were raised with so many of the same values like you work hard for what you want in life that your word is your bond
7738151 the same man i fell in love with 19 years ago
7738152 i come here as a wife who loves my husband and believes he will be an extraordinary president
7738153 hes the same man who drove me and our new baby daughter home from the hospital ten years ago this summer inching along at a snails pace peering at us anxiously through the rearview mirror feeling the whole weight of her future in his hands determined to give her everything hed struggled so hard for himself determined to give her something he never had the affirming embrace of a fathers love
7738154 are the heart of my heart and the center of my world
7738155 raised on the south side of chicago by a father who was a blue collar city worker and a mother who stayed at home with my brother and me
7738156 that you work hard for what you want in life that your word is your bond and you do what you say youre going to do that you treat people with dignity and respect even if you dont know them and even if you dont agree with them
7738157 if you wait around for 18 months and say ill be back later for your evidence its not going to be there
7738158 we executed a search warrant based on probable cause that evidence was being destroyed in the house democratic legislative research office you need probable cause for a search warrant
7738159 this is a delicate investigation you dont just go in and grab evidence without probable cause
7738160 mr morganelli doesnt know what has been obtained and what hasnt been obtained he doesnt know what hes talking about
7738161 these are elected officials and elected officials contribute to candidates of their party that doesnt mean theyre best friends or they go out to eat together every night
7738162 theres a lot of evidence bonuses went to a lot of senate republican staffers who were not even working in harrisburg during the time they were awarded i dont know how you reward someone for work when they were not even working in harrisburg they were on leave working on campaigns
7738163 could i just mention to you jay that in a moment of seriousness i spent 5 1 2 years in a prison cell i didnt have a house i didnt have a kitchen table i didnt have a table i didnt have a chair
7738164 and my friends im proud of my record of service to this country and it has nothing to do with houses
7738165 cindy is not here today and im sorry shes not
7738166 shes on her way to the little country of georgia
7738167 this is not going to be the year that we make big changes
7738168 i have never had someone inspire me the way people tell me my father inspired them but i do now barack obama
7738169 and to elect barack obama president of the united states
7738170 the torch will be passed again to a new generation of americans the work begins anew the hope rises again and the dream lives on
7738171 im hillary clinton and i do not approve that message
7738172 there was a lot in that story that was wrong
7738173 last week is going to be a seminal week in the campaign theres a real sense that he is out of touch
7738174 we are going to drive a truck through that this week and the rest of the election
7738175 the reality is john edwards didnt have a bright political future anyway
7738176 hed lost two elections he didnt have the confidence of the american voters and he was eclipsed by barack obama as a darling of the left
7738177 if your political brand hinges on morality its very difficult for you to tell such blatant lies to the nation
7738178 clinton came to symbolize of lot of things that were the 60s counter culture
7738179 for clinton there was already a narrative about someone who was the violator of social norms
7738180 hed have to really rewrite that story and thats a tough thing to do
7738181 political campaigns and political lives are often about being able to tell a convincing story
7738182 and its one of the things that would be particularly difficult for edwards right now
7738183 she has given him the very tangible qualities that she herself enjoys in the public eye
7738184 i am a delegate and i will proudly cast my vote for her in the first roll call
7738185 progressives will leave millions of votes on the table in november
7738186 and i am hillary clinton and i do not approve of that message
7738187 if you want hillary clinton to be president and i think someday she might be youve got to help elect senator obama hes a good man and if you care about hillary clinton youve got to do the things shes asked us to do
7738188 i am now supporting the democratic candidate which is more important than any feelings i may have had before all of this focus on clinton versus obama is distracting us draining our energy
7738189 the dnc made a terrible mistake when it underestimated the anger by her supporters at the way hillary clinton was treated by the party by the media by the obama campaign
7738190 there are a lot of very strong supporters of hillary clinton who are disappointed i am still a huge admirer of hers but when women see the contrast between barack obama and john mccain on the issues theyll come around and just by having these two candidates compete against each other this party has done something incredibly historic and important here and good for us

7738194 i tried to bunt to tie the game when i was on the visitors side ive never seen anything like that and hopefully we never see it again especially when you lose a game you wait this long and you think about this game and all of a sudden you lose this game
7738195 we hit a couple balls hard and they made good plays
7738196 everything went fine until the last inning all of a sudden we didnt bunt the ball late in the game and that was a key too
7738197 we dont think any organisms belong in the amniotic sac

7738206 packed with armed men wearing police and security forces uniforms hit us with rocket propelled grenades and machine guns
7738207 they were surprised by heavy gunfire from within the camp there was an exchange of fire and a number of victims
7738208 sudanese forces faced huge resistance with a large number of citizens blocking the entry of the forces with barricades civilians were brought into the streets as human shields
7738209 if government forces carry out more attacks against our people the sla is ready to confront and retaliate
7738210 the government sent a strong military force and attacked the camp with the intention of killing civilians
7738211 severely threaten the safety and security of civilians who have a right to protection
7738212 russias historic role of the guarantor of peace in the caucasus has increased
7738213 the caucasus has always been and will remain the zone of russias strategic interests
7738214 neither abkhazia nor south ossetia will be part of the georgian state
7738215 we are hoping to resolve this situation peacefully and if that doesnt work out there are other methods
7738216 if you dont have a sense of humor it just isnt funny
7738217 the truth may set you free but it will piss you off first
7738218 dont even ask about the tush push which was a partner exercise i did during a human sexuality workshop or the very obese female therapist who sat on my head for twenty five minutes at esalen institute so i could re experience being smothered by my mother
7738219 pure and undefiled religion before god and the father is this to visit orphans and widows in their trouble and to keep oneself unspotted from the world
7738220 love the lord your god with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind this is the first and greatest commandment and the second is like it love your neighbor as yourself
7738221 you are truly my disciples if you remain faithful to my teachings and you will know the truth and the truth will set you free
7738222 most important of all continue to show deep love for each other for love covers a multitude of sins
7738223 father i pray that your anointing would help to liberate us and keep us free
7738224 this is bad the devil is taking over our kids
7738225 do not be overcome by evil but overcome evil with good
7738226 by this you know the spirit of god every spirit that confesses that jesus christ has come in the flesh is of god and every spirit that does not confess that jesus christ has come in the flesh is not of god
7738227 therefore i make known to you that no one speaking by the spirit of god calls jesus accursed and no one can say that jesus is lord except by the holy spirit
7738228 whoever believes that jesus is the christ is born of god
7738229 he who has the son has life he who does not have the son of god does not have life these things i have written to you who believe in the name of the son of god that you may know that you have eternal life
7738230 that if you confess with your mouth the lord jesus and believe in your heart that god has raised him from the dead you will be saved
7738231 all of which meant that nobody in washington was surprised when biden was one of only four u s senators invited to a champagne reception in celebration of the digital millennium copyright act hosted by the mpaas jack valenti the riaa and the business software alliance
7738232 on net neutrality biden has sounded skeptical in 2006 he indicated that no preemptive laws were necessary because if violations do happen such a public outcry will develop that the chairman will be required to hold this meeting in this largest room in the capitol and there will be lines wandering all the way down to the white house

7738243 i ran for student government president against several boys and lost which did not surprise me but still hurt especially because one of my opponents told me i was really stupid if i thought a girl could be elected president as soon as the election was over the winner asked me to head the organizations committee which as far as i could tell was expected to do most of the work i agreed
7738244 probably the most seen talked about buzzed about speech of the campaign
7738245 were monitoring the track of gustav and reviewing our destructive weather plans and procedures
7738246 im just going to stay in my house and watch out for it
7738247 ive been waiting eight months for this day and what a wonderful opportunity to raise the plight of the murray river and make sure we have some action instead of reverting back to this constant talk and deferral of the tough issues
7738248 im excited and proud to be able to stand up in parliament tomorrow and move a motion about the murray as one of the very first things i do
7738249 thats what im about as a national representing country and coastal areas

7738252 its premature to say that it was a valid threat or that these folks have the ability to carry it out
7738253 to shoot obama from a high vantage point using a rifle sighted at 750 yards

7738257 number one they need to import a large amount of wheat
7738258 if they need wheat right now the us is the place to go
7738259 the idea of that in 2000 was to promote certain types of exports to sanctioned countries so there would be food medicine agricultural products medical products
7738260 it is still surprising that they are buying wheat from the us instead of waiting to buy wheat from someone else
7738261 maybe the relationship between iran and the us is not as terrible as it has been
7738262 iran is more interested in showing to its people that it is not restrained by sanctions
7738263 the real signal is look were doing fine we can buy wheat from the us
7738264 perhaps we should donate a pair to this very worthy cause a woman who works all day on her feet educating the youth of tomorrow yes we will

7738273 there were few athletes and lots of people in the delegation of gabon
7738274 unfortunately they did poorly during the competition and even the president denounced that there were many people in the delegation and not many athletes
7738275 i think most of the people think they went there only to do shopping
7738276 they have bought a lot of things and they went there only for shopping that is why there were a lot of officials in the delegation
7738277 the people are extremely enthusiastic about voting we are entering parliament with a clear agenda

7738300 as individual economies we do not figure highly in the minds of potential investors
7738301 but collectively we represent a market of over 550 million people a gross regional product of us 1 1 trillion and total trade of about us 1 6 trillion together as asean we stand a better chance at attracting investments
7738302 our respective governments face pressing domestic economic and political pressures from time to time but we must muster political will to implement the roadmap which we have agreed upon
7738303 were saving a round of oil and the hassle of traveling intercontinentally for many hours
7738304 but the fact that we meet here is a commitment to this region and this lab its a very important hub and will stay that way

7738306 media companies fit for the modern world need to be lean and agile
7738307 voters donated money goods and services to elect a nominee and were defrauded by sen obamas lies and obfuscations
7738308 if the dnc officers had performed one ounce of due diligence we would not find ourselves in this emergency predicament one week away from making a person the nominee who has lost their citizenship as a child and failed to even perform the basic steps of regaining citizenship as prescribed by constitutional laws
7738309 for candidates of either party to become the nominee when there is any question of the ability to serve if elected
7738310 voters donated money goods and services to elect a nominee and were defrauded by sen obamas lies and obfuscations
7738311 if the dnc officers had performed one ounce of due diligence we would not find ourselves in this emergency predicament one week away from making a person the nominee who has lost their citizenship as a child and failed to even perform the basic steps of regaining citizenship as prescribed by constitutional laws

7738313 we are turning the heat up on idol this year and are thrilled to welcome kara to the judges table
7738314 she is a smart sassy lady and one of americas most successful songwriters we know she will bring a new level of energy and excitement to the show
7738315 i went to lords for the first time in 1949 and since then mcc for me had been a home of cricket
7738316 so you will now say i hear the voice of an aclu member dennis do you think that this guy should have shot these people spray painting graffiti on his shop to which my answer is yes i do not to kill not to kill but if he shot them in the legs or in the arms i would have considered the man one of the great advancers of civilization in my time and that is what divides left from right because anybody on the left hearing this would think that this is barbaric whereas i consider not stopping these people in any way that is necessary to be barbaric dennis prager on his radio show
7738317 if the democrats think were going to be able to nominate someone who can win without that person being able to table unimpeachable credentials on national security and foreign policy i think were making a tragic mistake
7738318 came from a set of experiences that come from a life of living overseas having family overseas being able to see the world through the eyes of people outside our borders
7738319 if you tell me ive got to take away this protection for these kids in order to win the election some things arent worth it
7738320 would i make a blanket commitment to meet unconditionally with the leaders of these countries within the first year i was elected president absolutely positively no
7738321 poses no imminent and direct threat to the united states or to its neighbors
7738322 this is a guy whos used weapons of mass destructions this is a guy who has destabilized the whole neighborhood this is a guy who in a war with iranians over 800 000 people on both sides were killed this is a guy who is an extreme danger to the world and this is a guy who is in every way possible seeking weapons of mass destruction that case in and of itself ought to be sufficient
7738323 how to stop the partisan war that is destroying america
7738324 the 21 year old drinking age is bad social policy and terrible law
7738325 all the data show that by the time students go to college they have already experienced alcohol so how can anyone say the law is working
7738326 we think the college presidents first concern should be the health welfare and safety of the students and it certainly isnt their facts are terribly wrong they want to take themselves off the hook if they change the law its not their problem
7738327 it sounds kind of canned but i truly believe that there is a hero in all of us
7738328 once this work is done cabinet will be able to make some firm decisions on how to progress waterview
7738329 the way that that is constructed is quite important in terms of final outcome whether it is a good deal from a government perspective
7738330 dead presidents bling bling cut the check its a business
7738331 going to shoot obama from a high vantage point using a rifle sighted at 750 yards
7738332 i have no idea what this unity thing is about
7738333 we deserve respect and if they want unity they need to reach out and bring us into the fold
7738334 im hoping to see it and im looking forward to it
7738335 if they try to disrespect me as a delegate if they try to disrespect my vote as a delegate i wont take that quietly
7738336 i think that this is sort of a dissident group that is doing that i want us to be unified behind obama and biden
7738337 i think that would be mentioning mrs clinton at breakfast i think it would be speaking about her and not making her an invisible part of this convention i think that is how you gain unity and respect
7738338 i got to be an obama super delegate the day clinton stood up and said lets support barack obama that is going to be our message tomorrow night everybody is going to leave here unified and all of the clinton delegates are going to get to stand up and say what they want to say and then we are gong to all come together and win this election
7738339 we want to make it as easy as possible for people to find videos on metacafe and to recommend videos they are likely to enjoy this will help
7738340 unfortunately the number and complexity of passwords led to slow log on times or calls to the helpdesk for password resets this negatively impacted productivity our ability to serve members and our helpdesk costs
7738341 a nation which can prefer disgrace to danger is prepared for a master and deserves one
7738342 one of our recent accomplishments is in the field of e governance as we have transferred more than 90 percent of civic services to e services and we are aiming for zero visits of customers to the municipal offices which we hope will be accomplished very soon
7738343 if the bank really wanted to take care of me theyd make products i could understand but because they are not perhaps they are trying to fool me
7738344 the rupee depreciation will be a huge concern for the market i expect markets to be range bound with the nse nifty to trade between 4300 and 4450 levels
7738345 there is no one among your relatives who has that name
7738346 will be filled with the holy spirit even before he is born
7738347 not merely in these two millenniums but in all human history
7738348 i am an historian i am not a believer but i must confess as a historian that this penniless preacher from nazareth is irrevocably the very center of history jesus christ is easly the most dominant figure in all history
7738349 this is he of whom i said he who comes after me has surpassed me because he was before me
7738350 in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god
7738351 for centuries youve been talking thinking and writing about the word the logos now i will tell you who he is
7738352 do not be afraid zechariah your prayer has been heard
7738353 how can i be sure of this i am an old man and my wife is well along in years
7738354 i am gabriel i stand in the presence of god and i have been sent to speak to you and to tell you this good news 20 and now you will be silent and not able to speak until the day this happens because you did not believe my words which will come true at their appointed time
7738355 in these days he has shown his favor and taken away my disgrace among the people

7738358 the holy spirit will come on you and the power of the most high will overshadow you so the holy one to be born will be called the son of god 36 even elizabeth your relative is going to have a child in her old age and she who was said to be unable to conceive is in her sixth month 37 for no word from god will ever fail
7738359 because you don t believe me here s your sign you will be deaf and mute until what i said would happen comes about
7738360 you cant be president the outrageous barriers to democracy in america

7738364 he also became well known through personal videos that were leaked showing him fornicating with animals this controversy has remained will hidden by simmons ability to buy people off with large sums of money
7738365 if obamas relationship with ayers however tangential exposes obama as a radical himself or at least as a man with terrible judgment he shares that radicalism or terrible judgment with a comically respectable list of chicagoans and others including republicans and conservatives who have embraced ayers and dohrn as good company good citizens even experts on childrens issues
7738366 actually shes not a baby any more shes almost three

7738369 turn on meant go within to activate your neural and genetic equipment become sensitive to the many and various levels of consciousness and the specific triggers that engage them drugs were one way to accomplish this end tune in meant interact harmoniously with the world around you externalize materialize express your new internal perspectives drop out suggested an elective selective graceful process of detachment from involuntary or unconscious commitments drop out meant self reliance a discovery of ones singularity a commitment to mobility choice and change unhappily my explanations of this sequence of personal development were often misinterpreted to mean get stoned and abandon all constructive activity
7738370 it just started raining and it didnt want to stop
7738371 weve lost 50 percent of the crop we knew we were going to get a little rain but we didnt know we were going to get all this wind and rain together
7738372 if we dont dry out the cotton is going to be impacted a lot more than it is right now
7738373 it will not end the drought it will make a dent
7738374 its all about the science of spiritual healing an ideal path towards achieving a peaceful and stable existence
7738375 the basic purpose of the spiritual healing process is to give a perspective on how one should lead his or her life especially the way one goes about doing things in day to day life
7738376 a lot of social work is being done by the foundation from adopting a leper colony organising camps for polio and meals for the poor
7738377 with tornado warnings and driving rain weve had several blood drives cancelled in and around montgomery
7738378 these difficulties can come when the need for blood can increase if there are injuries due to these conditions
7738379 it looks like there is some potential for prolonged heavy rain over the athens area although the greater threat is north of interstate 85
7738380 there will be some heavy rain no question about that
7738381 i think were going to see a tremendous improvement in soil moisture so warm season grasses are going to be growing full tilt boogie
7738382 to end the drought we need several months of above normal rainfall
7738383 dogs belong either in a fenced area or in the home they need companionship its not humane to do this to a dog
7738384 chaining causes terrible depression and frustration and can lead to aggression too many people want dogs as lawn ornaments or guard dogs
7738385 but if it doesnt pass the first time therell be a second and a third
7738386 were monitoring the track of gustav and reviewing our destructive weather plans and procedures
7738387 im just going to stay in my house and watch out for it
7738388 what were actually seeing now is a different kind of equality that comes out of complementarity and a more complex set of negotiations based on peoples different circumstances
7738389 the indications are very strong that theres a much greater sense of convergence between men and women now in the work that theyre doing
7738390 very modern partner who is there 110 per cent for me
7738391 when the kids outnumber the parents something has to shift
7738392 if you dont get more efficient in the division of labour youre not going to make it as a couple youre going to spend all your time fighting over whos doing what
7738393 wider conception of what it means to care for children
7738394 previous studies on fathers were just looking at who was doing the cooking and the cleaning
7738395 while those are important aspects of care and domestic work its much wider than that the care of children doesnt just happen in the home it happens in the community
7738396 if we try to judge the care that fathers give by the standards used to study mothers and women we miss some of the creative ways that fathers are caring for children
7738397 women feel guilty for going back to work and men feel guilty if they take too much time off work
7738398 its going to take a few more generations for that to become more nuanced
7738399 men earn more per hour doing the same work as women do
7738400 so its an economic advantage to free up time for the higher income partner to work
7738401 you definitely need a good hurricane to improve your drought status
7738402 the rain thats coming in from fay will certainly help
7738403 i hate to jump on this bandwagon but katie holmes pre season football feel the excitement
7738404 the attitude of all those who somehow thought that a game which looks and feels exactly like scrabble would be permitted by hasbro and mattel to go on serving millions of facebook users around the world while reaping a steady flow of advertising dollars for its young indian creators
7738405 i hate to jump on this bandwagon but katie holmes pre season football feel the excitement
7738406 not just about themselves but about the direction of the country as a whole and theyve got good reason to be worried the fact is the economy is not working for ordinary americans
7738407 when you say the fundamentals of the economy are sound and your top economic adviser is saying youve become a nation of whiners then you dont get it
7738408 youre out of touch and youre not hearing the stories of ordinary americans who are working hard every day but feel like theyre just treading water and in some cases sinking
7738409 john mccain has a compelling biography he served america with bravery and distinction and he deserves respect for that
7738410 but his policies dont deserve respect his ideas dont deserve respect because theyre the same old ideas weve seen out of george bush for the past eight years
7738411 the most important issues for me are affordable health care and getting out of the war
7738412 it is just to let people know there are people in town who like sen mccain
7738413 like the immigration compromise it is designed to convince conservatives that the plan accomplishes what they want while in fact both plans simply capitulate to the special interest groups who fund the democrats if immigration and the drilling compromise is their idea of solving problems then conservatives dont need them

7738433 dude we totally have to go to cinnabon like now but seriously this is the best thing to come
7738434 while i consider myself an atheist at least in the strict sense of
7738435 83 posted by buddy66 buddy66 i was actually willing to give your claims about knowledge of age i
7738436 this has been on the internets for so long that by now these women are your grandma
7738437 id like to see some of these girls in the
7738438 may i get you a drink some ice cream pictures of my younger sister naked candy the dead bodies of my neighbors stacked up in the corner with a light dusting of lime on em watermelon cubes whats your pleasure
7738439 here read this oh and here are the deeds to my husbands my brothers and my mothers assets since i dont have any of my own just keep talking
7738440 im as amazed as everyone else by what heath ledger accomplished but i also thought that whathisface did a great job as well
7738441 and you know im always happy to see whatshisotherface in any movie how many have they done together at this point
7738442 right michael caine well there was the prestige and batman begins and this one of course i think its only three
7738443 okay on the tv series with the great theme that my mom rarely let us watch it was adam west michael keaton did it in a feature or two a movie series or two ago and the pick was controversial because some people thought for crying out loud that he didnt have the right jaw for the part and i think val kilmer played batman it at least once and i sure hope they didnt complain about his jaw since i dont think the whole thing fits into the state of california at least from side to side as i recall they have to film kilmer so his face is parallel to the ocean or one side of his jawbone pokes into nevada or arizona
7738444 not bad i mean the number of actors not the overwrought metaphor
7738445 even in my senility i can occasionally crank out a factoid or two but the best val kilmer movie was heat agreed
7738446 and bitchinest characterizations in a crime movie ever though remember that one little character discontinuity in heat did i ever tell you about that one
7738447 ich bin gekommen als ehefrau die ihren mann liebt und berzeugt ist dass er ein au erordentlicher pr sident sein wird
7738448 dass man hart f r seine ziele im leben arbeiten
7738449 wir wollen dass unsere kinder und alle kinder dieser nation wissen dass eure chancen im leben nur begrenzt werden durch die reichweite eurer tr ume und die bereitschaft euch daf r ins zeug zu legen
7738450 von der grundschule bis zum college eine weltklasse erziehung erh lt
7738451 die demokraten werden diese versammlung in denver geeint organisiert und st rker denn je verlassen um amerika mit barack obama als pr sident und joe biden als vizepr sident in eine neue richtung zu bringen
7738452 die arbeit beginnt von neuem die hoffnung w chst wieder und der traum lebt weiter
7738453 det b sta r nog n r hon ligger och sover
7738454 people just dont know if they are ready for the change candidate
7738455 our goal has been to reach out and tear down the walls of the convention
7738456 it just came with his nature he was always for helping people do better
7738457 so many of the times i called him to seek his advice had to do with personnel issues he was so good with that his counsel was always to be kind to people and treat them the way you wanted to be treated
7738458 she hasnt talked to anyone she just looks like your sweet little grandma and no one knows where she is
7738459 your generation has done more travel and service work than ours did your generation sees yourselves as citizens of the world
7738460 its premature to say that it was a valid threat or that these folks have the ability to carry it out
7738461 was directly asked if they had come to denver to kill obama he responded in the affirmative
7738462 it could also turn out that these were nothing but a bunch of knuckleheads meth heads
7738463 were watching how were spending our money and paying debt down aggressively
7738464 its kind of fun with younger kids to say what do you think its going to cost and then talk through it
7738465 bringing the kids in helps them understand why we cant go to chuck e cheese this week
7738466 in the end after all thats happened these past 19 months the barack obama i know today is the same man i fell in love with 19 years ago
7738467 hes the same man who drove me and our new baby daughter home from the hospital ten years ago this summer inching along at a snails pace peering anxiously at us in the rearview mirror feeling the whole weight of her future in his hands determined to give her everything hed struggled so hard for himself determined to give her what he never had the affirming embrace of a fathers love
7738468 this november the torch will be passed again to a new generation of americans so with barack obama and for you and for me our country will be committed to his cause the work begins anew the hope rises again and the dream lives on
7738469 i tried chasing him but i couldnt catch him i was a lot older than he was
7738470 it was a shock for a lot of people unfortunately they could not help me catch the man
7738471 he forcibly removed the box from the fathers hands and ran away
7738472 one thing that michigan quarterbacks coach rod smith pointed out to me is both beaver and newsome are athletic quarterbacks but im a quarterback that is athletic
7738473 i have every reason to believe chief lacroix had no knowledge that there were illicit drugs in his city vehicle
7738474 i have known joe lacroix for more than a decade he has served in the newton fire department for 36 years and his record as chief of the department over the last five years has been exemplary there is no evidence that he was involved in any wrongful activity
7738475 i want to make it clear that chief lacroix is being treated and will continue to be treated no differently than any other city employee would be treated under these circumstances
7738476 there are people who are not going to vote for him because hes black
7738477 and weve got to hope that we can educate people to put aside their racism and to put their own interests no 1
7738478 the work begins anew the hope rises again and the dream lives on
7738479 that you work hard for what you want in life that your word is your bond and you do what you say youre going to do that you treat people with dignity and respect even if you dont know them and even if you dont agree with them
7738480 there is no doubt in anyones mind that this is barack obamas convention
7738481 feel an obligation to the people who sent them here
7738482 the democratic party strongly and unequivocally supports roe v wade and a womans right to choose a safe and legal abortion regardless of ability to pay and we oppose any and all efforts to weaken or undermine that right
7738483 really cant explain the price of gas or what has happened to the middle class
7738484 do we really want four more years of the same old tune
7738485 we are ready to compete in all 50 states in november
7738486 i think its prejudicial against the state facilities and state operated services these are the most profoundly mentally retarded and fragile people in the commonwealth
7738487 we want to be assured that theyre able to staff the facilities adequately
7738488 we are like a family here i couldnt believe it when i heard the news
7738489 he took a personal interest in every county project he touched and that showed itself in the quality of the results
7738490 he loved his hometown and he dedicated his life to serving the people here
7738491 he was the kind of person who would be the first on the scene to help anybody in need
7738492 britney spears will not be performing at the vmas this year im telling you officially and unequivocally
7738493 she will run in two days time and can lift two suitcases and you can return to uk as per your plan on 3rd jan 2008
7738494 you have to pay the money to for me to give clearance for surgery
7738495 what they government troops did after the battle was unforgivable
7738496 i think that probably got blown out of proportion a little bit
7738497 my nature is that if anything is not exactly perfect im going to find fault with it and the expectation level is going to be set at a high standard
7738498 im always going to find the things that we didnt do up to the standard that i set all in all it wasnt a total wreck
7738499 theres going to be some things thursday night that dont happen exactly the way i want them to im sure in certain things
7738500 i think hes earned a couple of series in the game and well figure out when were going to put him in and play
7738501 i think hes good enough to help us win the game so were going to put him in there and see what he does under fire
7738502 my attention is just as much on the other side
7738503 im scared to death in the secondary and at linebacker and places weve got all kinds of young guys its not like weve done anything there either
7738504 nobody knows anything about this football team they havent played a game who knows what happens we might go out there on thursday night and it might be 3 0 it might also be 46 43 nobody knows
7738505 thousands of third party applications have been built on facebook since the launch of the facebook platform in early 2007 with the exception of a few most applications fall dramatically short of engaging users on a level that will attract major blue chip brands like we already have
7738506 as we look to build out a global sports media experience we recognize the incredible value of fantasy sports in that effort
7738507 im excited game week is finally here im looking forward to it i just had a j smith up in my office and he was talking about how excited all the players were to finally get to play somebody else to put all the hard work we put in at practice and in camp to use it should be an exciting and fun time i know it will be for me and i think for all the players when we run out on the field thursday and finally have a chance to play
7738508 my nature is that if something isnt exactly perfect im going to find fault with it and the expectation level is going to be set at a high standard im always going to find the things we do not up to standard there are going to be some things that happen thursday night that dont happen exactly the way i want im sure but im always the type that i dont ever satisfy until its exactly the way i want it i feel good where we are we have a couple of days to polish the game plan but i think our team will be ready to play
7738509 i dont know if i ever got it exactly where i wanted it to be if you look back to last year at the academy there were times where we would score over 50 points in a game and you could still get better and find fault until you play that perfect game youre probably not going to get to those expectations but i think we have made a lot of progress whether we can carry it from the practice field to the game field we will see thats why you play the games but i know we are a much better football team now then we were in the spring
7738510 its different everywhere when i left georgia southern and went to hawaii they had no base so i started from scratch there when i went to the naval academy in 95 they had no base so we were starting from scratch there when i got back to georgia southern as a head coach in 97 a lot of things had changed there were some of the base remnants and i think what happens sometimes is when people line up in the double slot or i formation people assume that is what they are doing and thats not always the case when i took the head job at navy the year before they had been in the gun half the time they were doing a lot of stuff so its been my experience that when you transition a lot of it has to do with how quickly you can pick it up but a lot of it also has to with the experience coming back the athletes your playing with and where your starting from so each one of them has been different
7738511 i get butterflies before every game i think if you dont you better get out of the business there is a lot of time effort and work put into it its like i tell the team all the time getting ready for the game is hard work the game should be fun thats where you prepared and got yourself ready to go you should enjoy it that should be the fun part of it and anyone that completes love to play i enjoy the chess match of the game thats one of the fun things of coaching so im always looking forward to that every time we have the chance to play someone else
7738512 not really weve had years where we played a couple of guys and years where one guy was the guy jaybo shaw is clearly going to play this year we arent going to redshirt him so in my take when you are going to do that he has earned a couple of series in the game and we will figure out when we are going to put him in i think that he is good enough to help us win the game so we are going to get him in there and see what he does under fire
7738513 you guys the media are the ones focusing all the attention on offense but i can promise you my focus is just as much on the other side im scared to death in the secondary at linebacker and places where weve got all the young guys its not like we have done anything there either nobody knows about this football team because they havent played a game who knows what will happen we may go out there thursday night and it might be 3 0 it also might be 46 43 and then all of a sudden all the push will be the other way and that might not necessarily be true as a coach you worry about everything on the defensive line im pretty sure i have seen those guys play and they are older so you kind of know what you are going to get there everywhere else we have new guys playing a lot of these guys have never really played when the game was seriously in doubt other than a few plays to give somebody a blow or whatever so you dont know whats going to happen
7738514 i dont know im just going to try to win the game having coached on that level i know how excited those guys are going to be to play youre going to have part of the team like perrilloux or the starting tailback that was at alabama or some of the other guys that have played in front of big crowds and the other part of the team will come in with a chip on their shoulder because they may not have been recruited by some of the bigger schools they have a point to prove they are going to prove that the rest of the schools messed up because im better than that guy and you should have taken me so we have to be ready to play from an effort standpoint because im sure that they are going to come in here and play hard
7738515 well see how it goes well probably rotate three guards i generally like to play three tackles and three guards and just rotate until we find the combination of the three guys that we feel like are better players and they will get most of the reps im not a big substitution guy every time i look up i dont want to see four guys running in and three guys running out if were going to tire them out lets tire them out playing not running in and out
7738516 i hoped to beat georgia we went into that game and we werent intimidated by them when i was there we saw it as an opportunity to go up there and try to win the game just like i said a lot of our guys that were playing viewed it as a lets show that we should have played here that we got overlooked or whatever so i think people that think there is the intimidation factor and awe of some sort when youre at the other school it doesnt work like that i promise you they are coming in with the mindset that they are going to win that game and you have to break their will a little bit
7738517 i feel good we havent missed one yet it could change on thursday but i think that scott blair has a strong leg and again he hasnt kicked one in a game so you really dont know ive seen a lot of guys that were good in practice and vice versa ive seen guys that werent as consistent in practice but come game time they didnt miss many so until you actually see them do it does he have the ability yes am i confident in him to try field goals yes until he proves otherwise thats the one big part that nobody has talked about that as a football coach i find ironic the kicking game here everyone wants to talk about the offense or whatever but the kicking game to me is the hardest thing that we have to replace durant brooks was a pretty good punter and if you go back and look at the tape he helped the defense a ton the defensive numbers wouldnt be the same without him travis bell was pretty good too and those are two really good guys that you have to replace
7738518 we work on special teams every day well concentrate on it the next two days before we play because its a very big part of the game there are very few plays of the game with as big a change in field position as on a kicking play so its something that we work on
7738519 god this comic is so good i could cry and im very butch
7738520 ive been waiting eight months for this day and what a wonderful opportunity to raise the plight of the murray river and make sure we have some action instead of reverting back to this constant talk and deferral of the tough issues
7738521 im excited and proud to be able to stand up in parliament tomorrow and move a motion about the murray as one of the very first things i do
7738522 thats what im about as a national representing country and coastal areas
7738523 by raising the tax on our truckies fuel how that leads to lower grocery prices for working families is beyond me
7738524 well certainly be having a close look at that one in the senate
7738525 imposing conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms
7738526 eighty people a day die at the hands of guns
7738527 its just completely befuddling that our supreme court would be in alliance with the gangbangers
7738528 the man has no understanding of the good that guns do or the difference between criminals and the rest of the citizenry he needs education along with well deserved scorn
7738529 a state may not impose a charge for the enjoyment of a right granted by the federal constitution
7738530 i follow the logic so what what does this do for me
7738531 what has this got to do with me i dont even want to own a gun
7738532 i want to see my kids the way i always saw them i put them to bed and id wake up in the morning and theyd jump into my bed i loved that and i missed that

7738535 only a few paragraphs about pacific peoples and relied on out of date data that gave a misleading impression of the situation
7738536 no evidence was provided to support the statement that they pacific people were an underclass or a drain on the economy they suffered disproportionately from the economic and social policies of the 80s and 90s
7738537 although they do continue to experience social and economic disadvantage their situation is generally improving and their economic social and cultural contribution is significant

7738541 if bradman could come back today and see whats happening in the game of cricket i think hed be terribly disappointed
7738542 when i heard about ricky ponting delivering the bradman oration i thought to myself dear oh dear oh well thats the way they do things these days
7738543 i heard ponting being interviewed on the wireless one day it was after the india test at the sydney cricket ground where they disgraced themselves and all that baloney and i heard him say no im not going to tell my players what they can say
7738544 i thought god strike me that would be the equivalent of field marshal montgomery calling his colonels together on the night before the battle of el alamein well boys weve got rommel tomorrow at el alamein do it your way and ill see you at the finish
7738545 people have been a little bit askance about bradman they talk of him being unapproachable and so forth it wasnt the case
7738546 im certain i never queried him on it but he wouldnt say to a player later on when he was a selector look billy i think youre not travelling well it might be because of so and so that wasnt his go
7738547 but all you had to do was say can you help me hed bend over backwards then

7738559 the real concern in relation to these figures is that they werent included in the clinical excellence commissions latest report

7738561 young women who were exposed to a number of life events should be considered as a risk group for breast cancer and treated accordingly
7738562 we can carefully say that experiencing more than one meaningful life event is a risk factor for breast cancer among young women

7738570 we have always said that the sale of hillside is on the table hrina said
7738571 once hillside is sold to a for profit company our community loses any say in deciding what its future will be
7738572 the bottom line is that corporations are in business to make money the present hillside status is nonprofit it allows local control of the hospital and its profits
7738573 it is important to maintain the connection between hillside and trumbull memorial hospital in order to serve the patients of our community and protect jobs
7738574 are ready to roll up our sleeves and work with forum to keep hillside from being sold off but the company has made it clear that their priority is cash flow not patient care
7738575 it would be a tragedy if forum sells off hillside to some for profit corporation said roger mease a quadriplegic who was treated at hillside and now works there
7738576 the people we care for at hillside are like family to us

7738617 thats pretty rare especially for a guy when he first arrives in the big leagues you usually struggle with at least one side but if he is its not too apparent

7738624 i keep telling myself itll make me a better player said tulowitzki who is batting
7738625 i dont like going through it but it does make you hungrier now tulowitzki understands what his father ken has been telling him ever since coaching his sunnyvale team that finished a game away from the little league world series

7738669 to stay wallowing in all of this is not productive

7738746 heaven forbid you might actually have to talk to a neighbor hanging theirs

7738765 i hate school why american kids are turned off learning
7738766 by the time american students are in junior high and high school they hate school and cannot wait to finish an acceptable terminal level of education and establish careers and families mimicking the suburban lifestyles of their parents
7738767 our schools are failing because they are warehouses and work houses they verge on penal colonies where teachers are wardens and children are inmates children constitute a pre labor force tasked with producing homework instead of goods and services
7738768 school has become a job and childhood merely a preparation for busy adulthood
7738769 how can kids see the bigger picture of getting an education when testing has taken the place of curriculum and now serves as a benchmark for their success
7738770 i dont think anything would make me excited for school but its nice that theyre trying

7738781 ive been waiting eight months for this day and what a wonderful opportunity to raise the plight of the murray river and make sure we have some action instead of reverting back to this constant talk and deferral of the tough issues
7738782 im excited and proud to be able to stand up in parliament tomorrow and move a motion about the murray as one of the very first things i do
7738783 thats what im about as a national representing country and coastal areas

7738793 he doesnt appear to have a weaker side giants outfielder randy winn said
7738794 thats pretty rare especially for a guy when he first arrives in the big leagues you usually struggle with at least one side but if he is its not too apparent
7738795 he takes an aggressive swing and he seems to be able to handle a lot of different pitches said winn who needed several years before his left side caught up with his natural right handed swing
7738796 i started switch hitting in the spring of 96 and was in the big leagues in may of 98 i was still a work in progress

7738799 i initially became aware of gold farming through my own games playing but assumed it was just a cottage industry

7738808 wouldnt that be something he comes back and we start a trend
7738809 as i know it he is probably on a beach somewhere sipping on some pina coladas so i doubt football is the first thing on his mind today
7738810 he has not been bouncing back and forth like favre
7738811 he has been pretty happy we saw him up here and he said he missed it but he was content he has decided to go on to the next phase of his life so i dont look too strongly into that him playing again
7738812 it is something that he all of us really wanted but obviously we didnt want these circumstances for him to get back
7738813 it is a good thing for him it is a good thing for this team he is definitely a d lineman at heart and hopefully he can just come back in and not miss a beat
7738814 the real concern in relation to these figures is that they werent included in the clinical excellence commissions latest report

7738851 once we assemble the packets they are sent through iraqi channels to be vetted
7738852 if they are approved and deemed appropriate candidates the applicants will receive a class date and will attend the iraqi police academy for approximately four weeks

7738874 and barack and i set out to build lives guided by these values and pass them on to the next generation because we want our children and all children in this nation to know that the only limit to the height of your achievements is the reach of your dreams and your willingness to work for them
7738875 theres no doubt in my mind that is barack obamas convention

7738883 the bloomberg administration had a strategic plan from the beginning to rezone or redevelop manufacturing areas to promote originally office space
7738884 but its worked out to be almost entirely residential development
7738885 the 184 block rezoning wiped out 1 million square feet of manufacturing only zones and turned an industrial area with a 35 block shoreline perimeter to residential zoning for luxury towers inland light industrial zones were drawn the citys attempt to help small business but rents as much as tripled industrial job loss was estimated at 4 000 by a rutgers university study promised public green space has yet to materialize

7738898 theyre refuges in some respects for last remnants of some vegetation were talking about birds and fish speaking about fish for example weve got aquatic submerged vegetation which is pretty much just confined to some of these reaches of water here in the finniss
7738899 it would be devastating salt water couldnt be supplied into this river and see it survive so there would have to be some way of keeping it out
7738900 if we start putting weirs or regulators across any sections of the wetlands around here its a negative and would only be contemplated as a last resort to try and conserve this area here and in turn would spell a significant impact on the lakes
7738901 i mean the interchange between the currency and the finniss and the lake as an integrated whole theyre very important to each other
7738902 in the first year that we came there was a very good flow and there was a flow for most of the year

7738904 it was just heart wrenching to see the aridness that was down there and what was normally very lush surroundings even the trees there was no birdlife everything was just starting to disappear
7738905 we have over allocation here and we need to address it
7738906 weve got seven sites that we go to around the catchments sort of evenly spaced around the catchment the meadows creek and bull creek both flow into the finniss and we just try and keep track of whats happening in those places with salinity and nitrates and phosphates
7738907 it gives you a bit of an idea if theres too much fertiliser coming off peoples land and flowing into the rivers and upsetting the sort of balance and we also look at macroinvertebrates so looking at the little critters to see whos alive and how theyre doing
7738908 i think the governments a bit scared that theyre going to get a lot of court action about youve taken away my livelihood because you wont let me have my water

7738934 that no jew can ever accept another jew as a god
7738935 his immediate disciples were always misunderstanding him and his work wanting him to call down fire from heaven wanting him to declare himself king of the jews wanting to sit on his right hand and on his left hand in his kingdom wanting him to show them the father to make god visible to their bodily eyes wanting him to do and wanting to do themselves anything and everything that was incompatible with his great plan this was how they treated him until the end and when that came they all forsook him and fled

7738940 a poor hard toiling ill provided man careless of what vulgar men toil for
7738941 they called him prophet you say why he stood there face to face with them bare not enshrined in any mystery visibly clouting his own cloak cobbling his own shoes fighting counselling ordering in the midst of them they must have seen what kind of a man he was let him be called what you like no emperor with his tiaras was obeyed as this man in a cloak of his own clouting during three and twenty years of rough acutal trial i find something of a veritable hero necessary for that of itself

7739003 i havent authorized a resolution in this im not behind that
7739004 whats the dnc going to do thats the key issue
7739005 will he be chair or will obama choose his own
7739006 obama has given his pledge to the four early states
7739007 the battle rages on and it has been some battle
7739008 its not a big issue for me but the problem for me is that new hampshire isnt indicative of the rest of the nation
7739009 if its advanced technology for him then its probably something that could be made easier for us mere mortals
7739010 starbucks is always looking for great locations to better meet the needs of our customers and reach people who may not have the opportunity to visit our stores

7739012 there are people who are not going to vote for him because hes black
7739013 and weve got to hope that we can educate people to put aside their racism and to put their own interests no 1
7739014 the work begins anew the hope rises again and the dream lives on
7739015 that you work hard for what you want in life that your word is your bond and you do what you say youre going to do that you treat people with dignity and respect even if you dont know them and even if you dont agree with them
7739016 there is no doubt in anyones mind that this is barack obamas convention
7739017 feel an obligation to the people who sent them here
7739018 the democratic party strongly and unequivocally supports roe v wade and a womans right to choose a safe and legal abortion regardless of ability to pay and we oppose any and all efforts to weaken or undermine that right
7739019 really cant explain the price of gas or what has happened to the middle class
7739020 do we really want four more years of the same old tune
7739021 we are ready to compete in all 50 states in november
7739022 theres a moment that you want to enjoy your bitterness
7739023 im getting a lot of calls and e mails especially from women who are quite upset that she was not vetted for vice president even though senator obama said she was on the short list
7739024 to stay wallowing in all of this is not productive
7739025 youre going to have to bring something from your boss office
7739026 your generation has done more travel and service work than ours did your generation sees yourselves as citizens of the world
7739027 people just dont know if they are ready for the change candidate
7739028 our goal has been to reach out and tear down the walls of the convention
7739029 ive seen whats on tv and im not going to comment on it
7739030 i was unable to locate sgt bruss video we have searched everywhere for it we were in the process of changing out old cars for new cars and we couldnt find it
7739031 this makes it impossible for me to listen to how sgt bruss talked to you
7739032 the torch will be passed again to a new generation of americans
7739033 the work begins anew the hope rises again and the dream lives on
7739034 my fellow democrats my fellow americans it is so wonderful to be here
7739035 and nothing nothing is going to keep me away from this special gathering
7739036 i have come here tonight to stand with you to change america to restore its future to rise to our best ideals and to elect barack obama president of the united states
7739037 as i look ahead i am strengthened by family and friendship
7739038 so many of you have been with me in the happiest days and the hardest days together we have known success and seen setbacks victory and defeat
7739039 but we have never lost our belief that we are all called to a better country and a newer world
7739040 and i pledge to you i pledge to you that i will be there next january on the floor of the united states senate when we begin the great test
7739041 has been a senator for all who believe that the dream has never died
7739042 two men who have changed my life and the life of this country
7739043 but once or twice in a lifetime they come along just when we need them the most this is one of those moments
7739044 when he is president he will have no stronger partner in the united states senate
7739045 it was kind of awkward knowing that some teachers were carrying guns
7739046 i dont feel like they should be cause we already have locked doors and cameras but i didnt feel threatened by it
7739047 as far as im concerned teachers were trained to educate my children not carry a gun even police officers need years of training in hostage situations
7739048 i dont want my child looking over her shoulder wondering whos carrying a gun
7739049 when you outlaw guns in a certain area the only people who follow that are law abiding citizens and everybody else ignores it
7739050 i can lead them from a fire tornado and toxic spill we have plans in place for that i cannot lead them from an active shooter
7739051 there are people who are going to think this is extreme but its easy to defend
7739052 look how long it takes the police or anybody else to get here
7739053 if someone wants to come here and harm someone at least we would have sort of defense
7739054 theres a lot of incidents where that would have saved a number of lives
7739055 its unfair of us to ask teachers to take on the additional job of being police officers
7739056 now you know why i asked her out so many times even though she said no
7739057 theres only one preseason game left theres not much opportunity to show the coaches what youve got in a game situation so i have a hard week of practice coming up to get prepared for the last one thats how i approach it
7739058 people just have more questions about my injuries more than others it seems like more of a big deal it is what it is last year i just went out there and played and did all i could do and i did make it it may not be the same case this year
7739059 the nfl is a tough business and people get hurt sometimes guys have worse luck than others
7739060 but in this league you have to be available thats part of the requirement
7739061 we were praying for the baby unfortunately he could not survive i hope hes in a better place hes with his mother
7739062 this story hit me like a ton of bricks i was just hoping for the fathers sake that the baby would survive the lords will was to take the baby and be with his mother in heaven
7739063 you just have to stick to the will of god but for those who are driving a vehicle thats not safe i hope this will be a warning to them
7739064 we need to be responsible for our cars and make sure our cars are in perfect working condition because we know things fail and we need to be responsible for our actions
7739065 she went way ahead of her time it wasnt her time but life is so unfair
7739066 i was hoping to read the rest of the story where we learn that the young man in these photos is now msgr
7739067 i come here as a wife who loves my husband and believes he will be an extraordinary president
7739068 you know what struck me when i first met barack even though he had this funny name and even though he had grown up all the way across the continent in hawaii his family was so much like mine
7739069 i stand here today at the cross currents of that history knowing that my piece of the american dream is a blessing hard won by those who came before me
7739070 for those whose triumphs we mark this week and those whose everyday sacrifices brought us to this moment let us devote ourselves to finishing their work and lets stand together to elect barack obama president of the usa
7739071 who put those 18 million cracks in that glass ceiling so that our daughters and sons can dream a little bigger and aim a little higher
7739072 who has never forgotten where he came from and never stopped fighting for folks who work long hours and face long odds and need someone on their side again
7739073 nothing nothing is going to keep me away from this special gathering tonight
7739074 i have come here tonight to stand with you to change america to restore its future to rise to its best ideals and to elect barack obama president of the united states
7739075 for me this is a season of hope new hope for justice and fair prosperity for the many and not just for the few
7739076 barack obama will close the book on the old politics of race and gender and group against group and straight against gay
7739077 the climate in the industry high profile pds get put out to pasture when they open themselves up to the press downsizing is real in this business many urban programmers just dont want to stick out a lot of pds want to be stars and the company wants a pd
7739078 theres only so many radio companies if theyre looking for a pd they at least know my name they will at least talk about me or contact me when i was in a smaller market it was harder but they know who i am and what ive done there are some companies in urban radio that require programmers get permission to do interviews black programmers are asking themselves if they really want that exposure if they have to go through all of that and risk being misquoted or to be viewed as an opportunist
7739079 when youve got sites out there like the vent which is not policed and those people are brutally and viciously attacking urban programmers that adds even another element to the decision not to do press at all those people dont know us and its just too negative there are people even urban radio people out there to destroy you when you put yourself out there to do an interview you might be positioning yourself for an attack you have to ask yourself if its really worth it to take that chance or remain in the background
7739080 it could but you have to find a middle ground programmers who are lucky enough to have a great staff would do themselves good by stepping back and letting the staff shine you can also cause internal problems by putting yourself in front of the media your staff and station may assume that you are trying to be the star of the station when in reality its the entire staff
7739081 that can create a problem especially between the programmer and the on air staff i dont think its a good idea to have both jobs pds have to be careful with how they position themselves when they are also on air talent
7739082 younger pds in smaller to mid sized markets create this situation when they are on the air i dont think it happens as much to older pds younger pds often get confused with the roles
7739083 corporate specifically told us not to speak with media including industry trade media because as a company we dont have anything to gain and more to lose by doing so i dont necessarily agree and i truly miss the networking opportunities of interacting with urban pds outside of our company so i do so on the low
7739084 of course you know theres no simple answer to this i think the climate has just changed
7739085 most programmers these days have lost touch with music and their listeners
7739086 i personally try and keep a low profile so that my on air personalities can shine
7739087 perhaps were just so busy that keeping the radio station on a winning path supersedes anything else we have time for
7739088 devemos contar com a participa o de todos na promo o dessa campanha t o apta a aperfei oar ainda mais a vibrante democracia brasileira
7739089 acredito mais que tudo tenha sido causado por algum v ndalo noite aqui tudo muito deserto mas isso n o tira meu nimo posso perder o quiosque mas n o vou perder meus clientes
7739090 men make their own history but they do not make it as they please they do not make it under self selected circumstances but under circumstances existing already given and transmitted from the past
7739091 hegel remarks somewhere that all great world historic facts and personages appear so to speak twice he forgot to add the first time as tragedy the second time as farce
7739092 society is saved just as often as the circle of its rulers contracts as a more exclusive interest is maintained against a wider one
7739093 geralmente esses criminosos compram o ve culo em um estado e levam para vender em outra regi o
7739094 aqui a gente ap ia dyonizio porque max fez muita coisa na regi o muitas obras boas escolas a unidade de sa de
7739095 tudo de bom que a gente tem foi feito por ele como o cal amento de ruas importantes e todo o cep do bairro

7739097 cada diretor tem a liberdade de ter seu pr prio candidato mas de acordo com a lei org nica da assist ncia social que regulamenta o terceiro setor as associa es de bairro n o devem ter fins pol ticos e partid rios o conselho comunit rio deve ter neutralidade n o nossa fun o fazer campanha e manipular o voto dos moradores que secreto e compete a cada um

7739100 if they kill our revered leaders in such a brutal manner the people will react in any manner to vent their anger we cannot restrain them
7739101 we dont solicit nominations they are nominated by someone else
7739102 its been a slow process but its definitely going in the right direction its starting to look good
7739103 its definitely happening its just a project thats going to take time
7739104 the bourgeoisie wherever it has got the upper hand has put an end to all feudal patriarchal idyllic relations
7739105 it has pitilessly torn asunder the motley fuedal ties that bound man to his natural superiors
7739106 and has left remaining no other nexus between man and man than naked self interest than callous cash payment it has drowned the most heavenly ecstasies of religious fervour of chivalrous enthusiasm of philistine sentimentalism in the icy water of egotistical calculation
7739107 it has resolved personal worth into exchange value and in place of the numberless indefeasible chartered freedoms has set up that single unconscionable freedom free trade
7739108 in one word for exploitation veiled by religious and political illusions it has substituted naked shameless direct brutal exploration
7739109 constant revolutionizing of production everlasting uncertainty and agitation distinguish the bourgeois epoch from all earlier ones
7739110 the need of a constantly expanding market for its products chases the bourgeoisie over the whole surface of the globe
7739111 industries no longer work up indigenous raw material but raw material drawn from the remotest zones industries whose products are consumed not only at home but in every quarter of the globe
7739112 in place of the old wants satisfied by the productions of the country we find new wants requiring for their satisfaction the products of distant lands and climes
7739113 in place of the old local and national seclusion and self sufficiency we have intercourse in every direction universal interdependence of nations and as in material so also in intellectual production the intellectual creations of individual nations become common property national one sidedness and narrow mindedness become more and more impossible and from the numerous national and local literatures there arises a world literature
7739114 experiments in high tech edutainment engaging students in a media rich popular culture course
7739115 generic intellectual abilities and a broad understanding of the world
7739116 they criticize themselves constantly interrupt themselves continually in their own course come back to the apparently accomplished in order to begin it afresh deride with unmerciful thoroughness the inadequacies weaknesses and paltrinesses of their first attempts seem to throw down their adversary only in order that he may draw new strength from the earth and rise again more gigantic before them recoil even and anon from the indefinite prodigiousness of their own aims
7739117 a person obstinately or intolerantly devoted to his or her own opinions and prejudices especially one who regards or treats the members of a group as a racial or ethnic group with hatred and intolerance
7739118 and you know what struck me when i first met barack was that even though he had this funny name
7739119 and you know what struck me when i first met barack was that even though he had this funny name even though hed grown up all the way across the continent in hawaii his family was so much like mine he was raised by grandparents who were working class folks just like my parents and by a single mother who struggled to pay the bills just like we did like my family they scrimped and saved so that he could have opportunities they never had themselves and barack and i were raised with so many of the same values that you work hard for what you want in life that your word is your bond and you do what you say youre going to do that you treat people with dignity and respect even if you dont know them and even if you dont agree with them
7739120 according to dr mendelsohn she hugged him and said i just want to thank you
7739121 he says she then leant down and unzipped his trousers and performed oral sex on him he says she swallowed his semen and did not spit
7739122 i can still taste it i want to be sick
7739123 she looked upset and said words to the effect you promised me you cant leave me
7739124 this november the torch will be passed again to a new generation of americans
7739125 i pledge to you that i will be there next january on the floor of the united states senate
7739126 the substantial changes we have won to the ets justify voting for it
7739127 a target for agricultural emissions reduction before 2013 will be gazetted along with other targets for emission reductions government has also agreed that there will be investment in a range of technologies and practices which can reduce agricultural emissions particularly nitrous oxide these will include not just nitrification inhibitors but also low input farming which can be just as profitable biogas plants to convert manure to energy and methods to control soil damage in wet conditions such as herd homes and stand off pads

7739132 i am like the energizer bunny i keep going and going
7739133 ive made it through the tallest sandy sand dune and accomplished something so great
7739134 some people who spend a lot of time thinking about popular music try awfully hard not to associate themselves with other people who spend a lot of time thinking about popular music
7739135 20 is a great return but i dont see any reason for you to sell at this stage
7739136 many had no education no self worth until they went to the ccc camps they learned how to take care of themselves they learned a skill it could have been maybe mechanics love of nature and they learned discipline and they learned how to respect each other
7739137 if the transit union wants that money let them explain to people why were having to eliminate routes to pay for that
7739138 im not going to be the one to explain why labor needs that money they can explain it

7739157 heritage tourism is a specific area of the tourism market and its growing
7739158 heritage tourists are a distinct group of people identified as overnight visitors who plan to visit historic sights and museums during their stays they tend to be more affluent and better educated and they spend more money while they travel
7739159 thats a good tourism market to aim for and were trying to develop a more refined way of going after it
7739160 for example somebody might be interested in the 150th anniversary of the pikes peak or bust gold rush so well suggest they go to the rock ledge ranch because they interpret that era or go to the pioneers museum for an exhibit on the gold rush
7739161 we want people to know that if they are at the garden then the rock ledge ranch is adjacent or they are only a few miles from monument valley park and the museum
7739162 improving way finding to link these sites and area trails is a big component of this
7739163 eventually the program will encompass a variety of sites but for now were concentrating on just the sites i oversee
7739164 we realized about 10 years ago that heritage tourism was a potential revenue generator
7739165 the old days of sitting around the pool are being replaced by people who are active they want to experience things the heritage tourism trend is something we are marketing
7739166 history as a marketing niche really took off in 2005 or so
7739167 the preserve america initiative creates a potential new demand and could bring new visitors into our region it attracts people looking for a different experience an educational experience
7739168 the rush brought people trade trails and towns to this region
7739169 among my priorities will be working with congress national state and local leaders and the full range of stakeholders to promote u s energy security and implement a national market based cap and trade system tailored to protect the nations economic environmental and national security as part of this initiative i will use the powers of the presidency to see that the international community including china and india fulfill its obligations to address climate change in a manner that will effectively protect the global environment and our economy i will institute federal policies to help achieve an energy mix that is far more diverse dependable economical clean and sustainable i would refer you and the lcv membership to the speech i delivered on energy security to the center for strategic and international studies csis this past april which outlines a number of these initiatives and priorities another of my top objectives will be to draw into my administration the most qualified individuals in our country to fill key cabinet and other positions in these vital policy areas
7739170 we asked israel not to sell offensive weapons to a hostile neighboring state but they said theyre a sovereign state
7739171 well israel shouldnt be surprised if we sell offensive weapons to israels neighbors
7739172 whether this will be a serious offer or something just to scare the israelis well know in another few months
7739173 we told the israelis that this was a very unwise move and that russians were being killed because of georgias policy
7739174 they didnt take us seriously probably because they were encouraged by the united states
7739175 in 2007 israeli experts trained georgian commandos in georgia and there were plans to supply heavy weaponry electronic weapons tanks and other arms at a later date
7739176 the significant military aid provided by israel to georgia in its war against russia will affect in the future probably in the near future relations between russia and israel as well as russias attitude toward arab states
7739177 russia will reassess its relations with israel and it is likely that moscow will decide to increase its military aid to arab countries in conflict with israel including syria

7739548 you ask me that about fenway park and itd be different were not a part of what goes on there
7739549 so you go to yankee stadium and you felt like the game was important you knew you were playing a game that people care about and thats a nice feeling
7739550 its very hard not to think about the olympic games
7739551 very difficult to refocus i mean all my thinking is there in beijing
7739552 in russia if you stop anyone in the street and ask what is a grand slam i dont think many people can tell you but everyone knows the olympic games there is nothing bigger
7739553 people just come to me and say oh im happy for you
7739554 i was thinking i could cut off the run at home plate to protect that shutout
7739555 nationwide its too new for us to go from a slap on the wrist to the death penalty
7739556 there had to be an intermediate step and thats what weve chosen here
7739557 one of the things you have when a new coach is coming in is you have to be careful that you dont have a lot of conversation on the headsets when somebody is trying to call a play
7739558 we actually worked on conversation nobody talks while theyre calling the defense or the offense unless theres a question or i have something to ask them
7739559 hes a true leader and really intelligent like kosar was he makes the right reads and the right throws and we trust him with audibles one of the reasons its so easy for us to have a quarterback under center is we trust smith to make the right call
7739560 no i think its time that we got out there and played somebody else
7739561 to me it means you have to be consistently good and then you have to look back and thats when you say you were a great team
7739562 i think this right here will be contagious and it will rub off on a lot of people
7739563 i think guys will see how much fun we had and be like man i want to be a part of that
7739564 but the good news is this unsolicited five or six of these guys have already said they want to be part of what we do
7739565 you dont know how to treat her you dont know that i need her do you know that i need ya
7739566 the first thing to remember is how to protect yourself
7739567 par le pouvoir du cr ne ancestral je detiens la force toute puissante
7739568 i considered signing up with the communist party but then realized if i did i probably wouldnt get that job at nasa ive been talking about so i registered as a democrat which is pretty close anyway
7739569 you can still be a fireman or a cowboy if you want
7739570 yeah theres a lot of pressure on me because as a young receiver youve got a lot of the older guys veterans whove been doing it a few years and doing it with tom
7739571 it would be a great deal if i could get on the same page with tom a great opportunity for me to be like the other guys
7739572 ive had some ups and ive had some downs and i had an up last week
7739573 it felt great it was my first touchdown in gillette stadium so i was real excited about that
7739574 i dont know what happened to the ball i wish i would have kept it
7739575 it was just me going up there im a big receiver and just getting the ball
7739576 i learned something from moss just going up jumping over guys and making plays
7739577 it gave me a lot of confidence that i could go out there and make plays and help this offense progress
7739578 they want to see if there is any interest there
7739579 people think im old im not that old yet so hopefully those healing cells are still in there
7739580 its exciting for me being from the state i know the history of the team actually all the sports history
7739581 when they gave me the opportunity i was grateful now i have a week to show what i can do hopefully i can play well enough use what i did in the past and that will give me a chance to stick around and try to win a championship
7739582 if im fortunate to make it past this week and god forbid if something happens to somebody i can keep the train rolling that will be my role itll be a great role and an honor because any time you play with these guys you have a chance to win games
7739583 at first it was coming along a lot slower than i would have liked but i think ive put my head down and im chugging along right now
7739584 my job is to go out there and do the best i can every time i get the opportunity to prove myself so far i think ive done that
7739585 at the same time that doesnt mean you dont make mistakes
7739586 i think im getting to the point where im able to be myself out there play like i know how im just trying to get better within the system each and every day
7739587 if you wrote the perfect fairy tale ending theyd be meeting us again in the alcs but this is our chance to kind of put that on the backburner
7739588 weve got to go in there and take care of business but as far as being able to play at yankee stadium that and fenway are the two meccas of baseball
7739589 getting to play at fenway every day and getting a chance to play at yankee stadium before they open up the new one is a pretty cool experience and something ill be able to say i did for the rest of my life
7739590 ive played in that stadium for the last 14 years so its a pretty special cathedral of baseball
7739591 hopefully im around next year to see the new one
7739592 when i was with cleveland as a player in 1988 we were terrible but you go to yankee stadium and you felt like the game was important
7739593 you know you were playing in games that people cared about

7739598 unavailable for a brief period while we sort out a problem with the riaa
7739599 this is a new step in our good will to try to find a solution to the problem through peaceful negotiations
7739600 theres going to be an independent kosovo were dedicated to that
7739601 in our statement we recorded our fundamental position that the unilateral declaration of independence by kosovo contradicts resolution 1244 russia india and china encourage belgrade and pristina to resume talks within the framework of international law and hope they reach an agreement on all problems of that serbian territory

7739609 well excuuuuuuse me but thats horseshit the prophet of change runs with the duke of folding money
7739610 great choice they find some big mouth refugee from scranton to speak to the bitter gun totin bible thumpin white people he left behind because al obama cant and they call that balance
7739611 congresswoman richardson is fully prepared when full transfer of the property is made and reinstated to manage and maintain the sacramento property
7739612 tragic time in our nations history calling for unification of the democratic party and of course a time for healing
7739613 she didnt check with her neighborhoods or her area she hasnt had a public meeting in that area and shes more or less thrown that area away
7739614 until she is willing to be responsible for what shes done the neighbors will continue to picket her
7739615 it is an eastside police station not a 5th district police station
7739616 an entire areas going to benefit by having that police substation there
7739617 what youve got to do is convince four other people
7739618 so are we getting rid of the cats no are we killing cats absolutely not but we will be defining how the cats here on the university property will be managed
7739619 but right now we have not done anything to the cats
7739620 to the best of our knowledge it wasnt a big crime area and there has been little crime activity
7739621 as far a law enforcement drain the club hasnt been one at all
7739622 as for the actual business itself ive been here two years and can only remember one or two incidents where weve responded to a fight inside
7739623 if i was running a business with employees working there for 20 plus years id have the decency to let them know they no longer have a job
7739624 it is with great pride and honor that i endorse and join the team supporting u s sen barack obama for president of the united states
7739625 the 08 primaries represented a new milestone in american political history
7739626 with record voter turnout across the country future generations will look back and realize that the democratic and republican campaigns were monumental turning points in american politics
7739627 in the 90s former president clinton brought his youth and competence to build a bridge to a new government in the 21st century
7739628 sen obama is now poised to unite this country by geography party age sex and ethnicity as we walk that bridge into the future
7739629 i am honored to address this historic convention for change
7739630 in my home state of california and around the nation voters will have an opportunity to hear from a candidate who is talking about issues that affect their families gasoline prices jobs and home ownership
7739631 im very pleased to see the addition of sen biden to the ticket
7739632 the most important thing will be introducing the ticket to a general election audience and emphasizing our message of change
7739633 there are so many issues on the table economy energy the environment and education
7739634 truly honored to be one of a handful of delegates representing long beach at the democratic national convention
7739635 this is an exciting and monumental time in our nations history
7739636 californias delegation in denver will no doubt be engaged spirited and diverse
7739637 it is a great honor to be elected by the people of long beach to attend the second national nominating convention in a row
7739638 in 2004 i was in the fleet street center in boston mass when a young man from chicago electrified the entire convention center with his message of hope change and promise
7739639 it still gives me goose bumps to remember how everyone of us in the hall were struck by his vision of the future that man barack obama will be the next president of the united states
7739640 i am going as press but i am going to lobby for my campaign
7739641 how can you be a leader of anything if you cant be a leader of your home
7739642 i walk the streets and people say please run as a write in
7739643 if she cant take care of herself then how is she going to take care of other people while serving in congress
7739644 we were trying to identify the ideal size concept that would allow us to expand
7739645 you have a lot of fast food outlets baja fresh and chipotle and others taking up all the smaller spaces and of course as we stayed big its very difficult to get into those prime locations
7739646 so we felt we could be quite successful by having our quality of food which is not fast food in a
7739647 its casual dining and quality food and at the same time a faster execution
7739648 it allows us to be perhaps a little more competitive at attracting landlords to want us in their centers
7739649 we have a unit in fullerton off the 91 freeway plus it allows us a point of entry toward expansion into the inland empire market
7739650 they may work in long beach or lakewood but they live out there in the riverside community
7739651 this man is suspected of being involved in one of the most heinous mass killings in recent times
7739652 the similarities between downtown los angeles and broadway in particular are very striking to what existed here in san diego they took what was a blighted area with a lot of potential and made it into an active lively entertainment destination that is a true neighborhood
7739653 what is amazing to me is how theyve integrated older structures with new structures and at the same time provided multiple means of public transportation
7739654 no shit robocop im not in your system because i never gave you my fn information let me talk to a fn person note the truly funny part of this is that the people are actually trained to operate like robocop
7739655 lady im pretty sure i nail that one every time by now
7739656 lady cut the crap and listen to every syllable that i tell you
7739657 im sorry one out of like 40 calls gets monitored and we have to talk like that or we get fired
7739658 haha no wonder all these jobs are being outsourced to india
7739659 i will never be irritated by having to do this again this was sort of necessary i think
7739660 well thank you miranda im no longer torqued off by being screwed out of 129
7739661 i dont know how theyre going to rebuild a place like that for 10 million
7739662 theres too much space too much function to just get rid of the library
7739663 a lot of people who have no stake in the library come to the conclusion that this is all about a redevelopment deal
7739664 but the mayor is insistent that there is no real estate deal in place whats to say that once this plan is approved there wont be a deal the second that happens
7739665 theres really nothing to draw people up there so people didnt go and not long after it opened the city closed it its beautiful up there it should be a place to hang out in the city
7739666 it takes a while for us to be satisfied that the oriental fruit fly has been eliminated
7739667 i was born here 50 years ago approximately 50 years ago and this is in the district
7739668 credibility with the voters and misuse of taxpayer funds is why i have had to relocate into the district to run against her
7739669 the issues are too important the stakes are too high and the voters of the 37 th congressional district are too smart to risk their future on a completely unknown orange county republican and political opportunist
7739670 i am not surprised laura richardson made an issue of this she has nothing else to go on
7739671 ive been at most of the schools in the district
7739672 ive done this on purpose to better understand our education system and what needs to happen for positive change
7739673 when people ask me why i havent taken on a full time assignment its because the system is set up for failure
7739674 i am just one person who stuck it out for 15 years
7739675 i left long beach primarily because the large class sizes make it difficult to maintain discipline
7739676 its not the fault of the school district its a systemic problem
7739677 one of the things i want to do in congress is lower class sizes to 20 or less and scrap no child left behind
7739678 i am just a school teacher with myself and some volunteers
7739679 i dont believe that a write in is viable whether its peter mathews or anyone else
7739680 ive been out in the community for 30 years and i have never bumped heads with him and that says a lot
7739681 hes a good guy and we think hes got what it takes to end the war hes got it all
7739682 really fundamentally hes running against laura because shes had these personal financial challenges
7739683 i initially felt that someone with more standing in the community should come forward but they declined after being propositioned
7739684 there is no doubt in anyones mind that this is barack obamas convention
7739685 feel an obligation to the people who sent them here
7739686 really cant explain the price of gas or what has happened to the middle class
7739687 do we really want four more years of the same old tune
7739688 we are ready to compete in all 50 states in november
7739689 theres a moment that you want to enjoy your bitterness
7739690 to try to suppress the celebration that we all want to have about her achievements is what would tear this party apart
7739691 im getting a lot of calls and e mails especially from women who are quite upset that she was not vetted for vice president even though senator obama said she was on the short list
7739692 to stay wallowing in all of this is not productive
7739693 so we can talk about this forever or we can talk about how were going to take our message to the american people to women all across america to see the distinctions
7739694 obamas major challenge at this convention is to focus on the middle class to show empathy because he had to climb his way up
7739695 must collectively expand the core capabilities of u s seapower
7739696 if he gives me 100 million ill give him the franchise
7739697 hands cannot be thrust forward above the frame to contact an opponent on the neck face or head
7739698 we try to give the benefit of the doubt to the defense when offensive players do stiff arm theyve got to be careful about going to the face this could seriously impact a few players who use the stiff arm as a weapon ladanian thomlinson jamal lewis thomas jones and mb iii come immediately to mind we had a very tight spreadsheet with all of the top players with a bunch of bells and whistles but a formatting issue has forced a change so here are the top fantasy running backs with comments after each we include the bye week for redraft rankings along with age only two rbs over age 30 ranked in the top 30 fantasy rbs last year height and weight and bmi body mass index so fantasy owners can begin to note patterns one bmi insight is that most running backs fall into the 29 31 bmi range rbs with low bmis tend to be unable to handle all three downs whereas those rbs with high bmis tend to get nagging injuries over their careers disclaimer there are exceptions to every rule sd bye week 9 age 29 ht 510
7739699 hes light years ahead of where he was last season
7739700 you know were over there running the ball a lot its a good offense for me
7739701 we have so many other weapons that the defense has to respect
7739702 you dont really see a player my size at this position being able to do the things i can do
7739703 i think hes the colossal bust in this draft he doesnt run with patience hes a very incomplete back who tries to run you over if he gets a crease he can take it to the house but he doesnt break tackles and he fumbles im not impressed
7739704 he has the quickness the acceleration and also the strength to make people think he wants something and he really wants something else
7739705 matt forte does something that you like each day we say were a running team we get off the bus running the ball we need to be able to that
7739706 right boss thats not much of a challenge first we wiped his memory amp identity then we throw his mind into chaos we give him a gun he goes on a shooting rampage results are the same
7739707 it was fun initially back in the beginning of time during the days of hitler amp stalin its not the same anymore we need a suitable candidate
7739708 henry blanking kissinger in 1st class car w me short for a war criminal will need more wine if he smiles me again also garlic amp a stake
7739709 in cursive i know all the lower case letters but not the upper case ones
7739710 did i pick the right camps for the kids this summer who are these counselors
7739711 hows the third grade class looking this year whos this teacher
7739712 the reason to do this is to protect the campus community first and foremost
7739713 and in those circumstances there is a high likelihood that there would be euthanization because there isnt a place for them
7739714 this is really an unfortunate circumstance all the way around
7739715 its not the cats fault that the coyotes were there
7739716 they didnt tell us how or anything else and we have 40 days to do it
7739717 we just think we should be able to continue to manage the cats and they should focus on the coyotes not the cats
7739718 i would say the long term solution is that we need to address the issue of the feral cat situation on campus
7739719 cal state long beach has put an execution order out on these cats basically
7739720 theyve been there for years and years and years so they have no other shelter
7739721 we have people who are not responsible first of all for maintaining their own pets and spaying and neutering their own pets
7739722 and they drop litters off here and thats an irresponsible citizen who would do that
7739723 the most critical factor facing the refining industry on the west coast is surplus refining capacity supply significantly exceeds demand year round this results in very poor refining margins and very poor refinery financial results
7739724 if the u s petroleum industry doesnt reduce its refining capacity it will never see any substantial increase in refinery margins
7739725 the walls we build around us to keep the sadness out also keeps out the joy
7739726 which 21 topics would you suggest for an advanced ruby course and why
7739727 even though we hear horror stories the majority of teachers are really there to pass on the gift of education
7739728 el comprador acepta pagar el precio total de salida de 1 y adem s lo har en met lico
7739729 what need is there for something as outdated and unnecessary as art and artists
7739730 it had puzzled me for some time why i had even been invited to participate
7739731 while it was a shame we at linden lab did not have an official presence
7739732 just a little observation i think you have unconsciously written something from the mind of god something people dont understand is that god is not merely an overseer a distant observer of the happenings of human beings he is the father of human beings the human feelings of a father towards a daughter or a son come from god but in fact in him are made perfect what that means is in pouring over your own fatherly emotions you get a glimpse of the perfect emotions in god he too feels exactly the way you have described for each and everyone one of his children that turn away from him because he will not force himself on anyone his hands are tied as well he suffers out of sadness as he waits for others to come around relying too on friends to plead his case so that his children find their way back home and all the while he knows it must unfold this way because as you so aptly noted it is somehow necessary for our survival people dont always comprehend this fact that god as father means he has fatherly emotions and just like us he too suffers emotionally for his children and perhaps in nearly the same exact manner in which you have described your own suffering
7739733 he was there all the time you just didnt see him
7739734 the next thing i knew the woman in the floppy black hat plopped herself down next to me and loudly proclaimed
7739735 i was saved eleven years ago when the lord healed me i had three fused discs in my back and he replaced them with new ones havent had a bit of pain ever since do you dream at night
7739736 you won the spiritual lottery my dreams theyre secret even i dont get to know what theyre about dont remember a thing
7739737 my brothers mission is to save all the muslims in the world hes been in the middle east for over 40 years hes been thrown in jail twice
7739738 he told me recently that i wouldnt die in a plane crash which was one of my worst fears do you know jesus
7739739 i know him fairly well actually in fact were on pretty good terms but we dont feel the need to talk every day
7739740 would you like to have a personal relationship with the lord and be born again in his spirit
7739741 but wait wouldnt you like to have a personal relationship with cory linden
7739742 i have to hand it to you for tolerating her for the entire flight without telling her to shut the hell up i certainly couldnt have done it
7739743 i didnt dare insult her until the plane had landed safely god after all is her co pilot
7739744 now were mostly born in and grow up in big cities thats the new mexico and thats our music
7739745 my interest in pop culture and the culture of the sale is both personal and social i sometimes question as may most of us whether i am choosing the things i consume or if they are choosing me i am constantly feeling overwhelmed by the mass and size of the advertisements that attract my eyes by painting the images from these sources it slows down the processing of their intended use and allows room for another look
7739746 who the fuck do you think youre talking to you sun roasted asshole if you cant behave nicer than that when you run into a stranger my man you got some deep fucking problems some real problems just dont dump em on me got it rasta boy

7739751 he wont play that is it for pav harvey told
7739752 he has developed a stress hot spot in his foot and we think it is on the back of his knee injury
7739753 that is the unfortunate path we wont see matthew pavlich this friday night but having said that we have played really well in the two games we have not had him
7739754 my last conversation with him he was going to consider maybe something with the afl or maybe the two new franchises harvey said
7739755 at that stage melbourne was not in the picture but they have obviously been able to attract cameron back to his old stomping ground
7739756 from a personal point of view i still feel like ive got some time left
7739757 im not hanging my hat on getting a spot on at an afl club next year but im definitely putting my hand up to say look my mind feels good my body feels good i want to continue playing
7739758 tapi menurut kpk belum cukup sehingga hari ini saya mau konsultasi sebaiknya bagaimana agar kasus ini bisa tuntas

7739775 i have never had someone inspire me the way people tell me my father inspired them but i do now
7739776 the 8 power profit secrets to making more money with less risk in real estate
7739777 we cannot keep these people if we dont pay them
7739778 people just dont know if they are ready for the change candidate
7739779 our goal has been to reach out and tear down the walls of the convention
7739780 she hasnt talked to anyone she just looks like your sweet little grandma and no one knows where she is
7739781 ive seen whats on tv and im not going to comment on it
7739782 i was unable to locate sgt bruss video we have searched everywhere for it we were in the process of changing out old cars for new cars and we couldnt find it
7739783 this makes it impossible for me to listen to how sgt bruss talked to you
7739784 it just came with his nature he was always for helping people do better
7739785 so many of the times i called him to seek his advice had to do with personnel issues he was so good with that his counsel was always to be kind to people and treat them the way you wanted to be treated
7739786 your generation has done more travel and service work than ours did your generation sees yourselves as citizens of the world
7739787 we understand that asking people to allow the county to raise taxes is never a popular thing but we think the timing is optimum
7739788 ive walked out there twice in the last two years and saw two kids go through that theyre two great young men
7739789 you just have so much respect for these guys that play and what they go through to play you understand what the consequences could be with just one wrong hit
7739790 its interesting because i heard from cedric on my way to dallas talking to me about how well hes doing were all better people from being around those two guys
7739791 while i had tremendous opportunities as a student the students today have even many more
7739792 as a student it seemed like there were many options but now really the options are endless for students who are looking to get into any of our majors
7739793 these days it seems like many students who you meet are doing two or even three majors and a minor on top of it its neat to see that they have those opportunities to combine all of their interests rather than having to choose just one thing that will help prepare them for their career
7739794 its very rare to meet a student who doesnt know where he or she is going after graduation
7739795 all of us who have worked with kathleen know that she brings a high level of energy and creativity to her assignments
7739796 she has led innovative programs to help attract top students to our school including overseeing the direct admission program and coordinating the young womens institute having received her undergraduate degree here will give her a special perspective on the undergraduate experience
7739797 for example there are many more global opportunities such as our taking students to india or our emerging markets trips over spring break
7739798 none of those opportunities were there our students benefit so much from trips like that as well as the classroom learning that accompanies those types of programs
7739799 weve really become a forerunner on the international front and were talking about forming partnerships with other universities beyond the traditional studies abroad programs
7739800 nows the time to go beyond that whether its more of these short term experiences or helping students find an internship abroad and take that area of interest to the next level
7739801 kathleen with her enthusiasm tireless effort and kind disposition will enhance student experiences outside of the classrooms and in the professional development dimension combination of world class staff and her leadership will usher in an era of innovation in student services at the kelley school of business
7739802 by looking at our numbers i think it can be intimidating to a number of prospective students it was a little bit to me when i was in their shoes many years ago
7739803 just making sure that we provide a personal and engaging experience to all of our students is of utmost importance we need to keep sight of the fact that this is not a group of students its a collection of individuals and we need to provide that attention in whatever way to every single person
7739804 we can simplify what they do back there much easier
7739805 we had some growing pains were going to need some help back there
7739806 the one that runs out there first really doesnt matter
7739807 we are trying to make it a midseason playoff atmosphere
7739808 this audience record is something i thought id never see again but what really satisfied me is the way in which these olympics truly captivated and seemed to inspire our country
7739809 for me the greatest measure of success at an olympics is the number of messages i receive from parents of young kids who have fallen in love with the olympics that child means more to me than anything because i think a love affair with the olympics is the greatest in all of sports
7739810 to go on that field and see him lying there i just thank the good lord that hes going to be fine i know were all disappointed he wont be able to play but thats not whats most important i know its a very difficult time he has an amazing mom hes got great support harry is going to be ok and thats whats important
7739811 the first thing that goes through your mind is the rest of his life thats what this league is about thats where people dont really understand what these guys subject their bodies to it is a sacrifice when these guys put on a helmet and go out every time on the field thats why we appreciate it our thoughts and prayers are with him and his family
7739812 coach kubiak talked with him and he kubiak said all he talked about was his teammates i cant wait to see him walk through those gates to watch us practice thatll be a great day for this team
7739813 its very hard not to think about the olympic games
7739814 very difficult to refocus i mean all my thinking is there in beijing
7739815 in russia if you stop anyone in the street and ask what is a grand slam i dont think many people can tell you but everyone knows the olympic games there is nothing bigger
7739816 people just come to me and say oh im happy for you
7739817 i dont know what is best to be a little bit tired but very comfortable and very positive or to be fresh and not play in the olympic games
7739818 we have probably six guys right now with two on the fringe bouncing back and forth
7739819 the coaches think were going to do real well hey theyre confident and were confident those are the only people who need confidence in us were going to get it done
7739820 we have a lot of young guys guys who dont have a bunch of experience but these guys the receivers are some of the hardest workers out there they come out here before practice and theyre staying out here long after practice is over theyve gotten a lot better and theyre going to continue to do so
7739821 hafner is by far the cornerstone of our receiving corps right now
7739822 he is the guy hes a proven guy so hes a guy we want to rely on heavily hes one of the guys that we have to do some things with
7739823 its just a matter of maturing the guys that we have right now
7739824 i kind of see them in the same mold as the 03 group as far as being young guys
7739825 who knows four years from now those guys may have the same numbers or even better numbers as the guys who just left here if these guys work as hard as those guys worked then i dont see any problem as far as being successful with the guys we have here now

7739846 i really dont care how many houses you have but it does matter how you got that house
7739847 other stations that follow sinclairs lead should expect a similar response from people who dont want the political discourse cheapened with these false negative attacks
7739848 to avoid the obvious problems that will occur when the republican party raises these issues after obama is nominated
7739849 multi citizenship with responsibilities owed to and allegiance to other countries
7739850 apparently a normal restriction to avoid births during a flight
7739851 voters donated money goods and services to elect a nominee and were defrauded by sen obamas lies and obfuscations
7739852 if the dnc officers had performed one ounce of due diligence we would not find ourselves in this emergency predicament one week away from making a person the nominee who has lost their citizenship as a child and failed to even perform the basic steps of regaining citizenship as prescribed by constitutional laws
7739853 bullying you can believe in obama threatens tv stations airing ayers ad obama sued in philadelphia federal court on grounds he is constitutionally ineligible for the presidency
7739854 our market is certified to take them you cant have them for baked goods its mostly for fresh fruits and vegetables i think its a great program these are all families with moderate incomes
7739855 the anecdotal evidence were getting from farmers in the field is that yes the coupon usage is up but desire to go to farmers markets has increased as well
7739856 the coupon recipients are no different than the rest of us
7739857 we have somebody from the wic program thats going to be coming every week to the market to publicize it
7739858 shes going to try to come out and give out wic information
7739859 i think funding has been less in the last few years so i think there are fewer coupons being redeemed by farmers
7739860 just in the sheer fact that in tough times the program has been cut back more on the state level i dont know if thats the case this year
7739861 we had some state money we were using for that program in the last few years this year we have that extra funding for the senior program so we used that to go up from 10 to 30 per coupon per senior
7739862 its enough to serve an additional 2 000 seniors on that benefit level
7739863 we actually have a little less money but were actually serving more people
7739864 were estimating about 102 000 participants up from 97 000 from last year
7739865 the real question was what can we do to set ourselves apart from the surrounding towns that will make their residents want to come here instead of stay there or go downtown
7739866 we realized the river was a neglected beautiful natural resource thats a visual focal point
7739867 the river is a natural attraction that once businesses came to the street added to the dining experience margaritas solea all those places that are here now have outside dining options because of that
7739868 they had to retool the uses of the property first
7739869 retail stores werent moving in because they had all moved into the malls so we had to make restaurants the main theme of the street
7739870 im sure hell tell you that when he moved in it wasnt a sure thing
7739871 but the renaissance really took off about two years after we moved in here and weve been busy every summer since
7739872 we now have things in waltham you cant get anywhere else you could go to boston and eat at a chain restaurant that has 35 locations in the boston area but if you want jakes or solea or the tea leaf or any of those places youve got to come to waltham
7739873 we add to the variety of the other restaurants from other ethnicities not the other way around
7739874 theres so many places to go on moody that you can have a place where you go every night
7739875 its great to be able to stay on one street and eat food from around the world depending on your mood
7739876 but i found out that people from those towns come to moody street anyway so if i opened here id get everybody we have lots of traffic on this street and lots of customers
7739877 people come from all over the state and sometimes from new hampshire and connecticut to my store
7739878 i go to the india grocery too you cant get mangos like they have there in bulk at costco or anything
7739879 everywhere i go if i mention im from waltham one of the first things people mention is oh yeah you have a lot of great restaurants down there
7739880 now thats not the only thing we have but for some reason thats what people remember about us
7739881 we have enough restaurants around here im tired of them
7739882 weve got plenty of apartments on the street so you know that theres people here but itd be nice to have some trendy shops around so that they would come out during the day
7739883 its a catch 22 if there were lunch here people would come but theres no lunch because theres no people
7739884 but especially after 9 11 all the offices in the office parks went out and that was about 50 percent of our lunch crowd
7739885 people from the other towns can just go to the arsenal mall in watertown if they want clothes
7739886 a lot of our donations come from people in the surrounding communities with a higher standard of living
7739887 where else but moody street can i buy a samosa for 80 cents
7739888 not that they have a specific characteristic but that they are unique and not at all bland
7739889 the little shops couldnt survive and all sold out to big chain places now theres still a lot of cool places but it lost its uniqueness
7739890 thats not happening to moody though the city enjoys the non chain restaurants we all put our foot down when they try to bring a chain in here
7739891 but thats what keeps us busy it gives restaurant row its flavor no pun intended
7739892 competition is a good thing everybody gets along well here
7739893 the fact that we havent sold ourselves out to chains shows that the community holds itself in high regard
7739894 waltham was the start of the industrial revolution but not the start of the first labor riots and i think that says a lot about us that we all care about each other
7739895 we look to the past and how we were a self starting town and find new brilliant ways to revive what we used to have our future isnt a shot in the dark were just continuing on with the uniqueness that the past gives us
7739896 mengapa ketika seseorang sedang dalam keadaan marah ia akan berbicara dengan suara kuat atau berteriak
7739897 lawan bicaranya justru berada di sampingnya mengapa harus berteriak apakah ia tak dapat berbicara secara halus
7739898 ketika dua orang sedang berada dalam situasi kemarahan jarak antara ke dua hati mereka menjadi amat jauh walau secara fisik mereka begitu dekat karena itu untuk mencapai jarak yang demikian mereka harus berteriak namun anehnya semakin keras mereka berteriak semakin pula mereka menjadi marah dan dengan sendirinya jarak hati yang ada di antara keduanyapun menjadi lebih jauh lagi karena itu mereka terpaksa berteriak lebih keras lagi
7739899 sebaliknya apa yang terjadi ketika dua orang saling jatuh cinta mereka tak hanya tidak berteriak namun ketika mereka berbicara suara yang keluar dari mulut mereka begitu halus dan kecil sehalus apapun keduanya bisa mendengarkannya dengan begitu jelas mengapa demikian
7739900 karena hati mereka begitu dekat hati mereka tak berjarak pada akhirnya sepatah katapun tak perlu diucapkan sebuah pandangan mata saja amatlah cukup membuat mereka memahami apa yang ingin mereka sampaikan
7739901 think of it all they need to do is put up a big banner behind the speakers each night saying join the conversation go to https www democrats org page contribute joinus or http www rnc org and set up an interface to involve people in live chats by state or zip code state delegations could be enlisted to participate
7739902 turned out to be a little more arduous and a little more complicated that we thought
7739903 it is now clear taxpayers will pay millions of dollars extra for the rann governments financial mismanagement and incompetence and the claimed savings of the shared services project will never be achieved
7739904 providing greater opportunities for cycling through the creation of more bike lanes and the provision of cycling infrastructure means more people will choose to ride their bike to work or study in the city
7739905 please take these instructions to heart and abide by them

7739909 despite taking significant number of potential toublemakers off the streets and seizing dozens of weapons a small minority still managed to marr the end of what had been a largely good natured and peaceful two days of celebrations
7739910 the number of arrests is up on last year but that is predominantly because of proactive policing
7739911 the message is that there is no place for knives at the carnival
7739912 we share the concern of londoners over the recent spate of knife
7739913 as a former resident of ladbroke grove i have watched the notting hill carnival go from strength to strength each year to become an internationally acclaimed event
7739914 nothing beats the sounds of the steel pans the aroma of delicious caribbean food and the dazzling colours of the costume parade
7739915 the carnival is the perfect london spectacle to captivate the world with its dazzling array of costumes and music
7739916 our principle focus right now has been on the india civil nuclear deal having worked through the international atomic energy agency now working through the nsg and still trying to get into a position to make the appropriate presidential determinations in early september so thats our focus right now on the civil nuclear side
7739917 we are going to continue to review what we will do about the various elements of the relationship with russia as you know weve been very focused on what to do for georgia weve been making certain that theres a clear message that there arent going to be any new lines in europe
7739918 and weve been very focused on getting the russians to live up to the obligations that they undertook to french president sarkozy not all of which have been yet fulfilled
7739919 a lot of the investment in online advertising has been from technology focused folks trying to solve problems and impose solutions on a market
7739920 ex yahoo execs take on brand ad network raise funds
7739921 our customers are spending more time online and we want to help them stay connected with their favorite people and memories

7739927 the city of newton has been a very good neighbor to those people who live adjacent to the project
7739928 we try to respond as quickly as possible to all of the issues that arise that concerns neighbors
7739929 they didnt give us any notice they were going to be working 14 hours a day
7739930 i have had to listen to music i went out to buy earplugs and ive rearranged my hours because of the construction i would have never taken a vacation these two weeks had i known
7739931 no one will answer my question on how long is this going to take
7739932 we were never notified of the cutting machine coming down
7739933 my summer is ruined by this road work at least give me the heads up as to how much more time please
7739934 one thing i think people in newton need to realize is on the front page of the newton tab you will be seeing stories every time there is something that anyone is unhappy about with the project if you want to look to the progress of the project you have to be looking toward the back pages of that publication or the citys web site

7739940 this is tangency we flogged common sense to pay our pie bill a couple years back
7739941 the most replayed moment almost assuredly will be one stolen directly from the republican handbook ronald reagan just after wife nancy had spoken memorably appeared on a big screen in dallas to send his regards at the 1984 convention that would renominate him so it was with the obamas tonight though two young cute children were added to the mix including one sasha who stole the show by engaging her father in a running dialogue
7739942 our study found that pregnant women were more likely to aim for a vaginal delivery and they accept a higher threshold of risks from vaginal delivery when compared with clinicians
7739943 this indicates that experiencing labour and attempting a normal birth are two very important priorities in womens decision making
7739944 it may also indicate that doctors are biased by their inevitable involvement in complex cases or labours where things have gone wrong
7739945 if theyve seen a traumatic birth or been involved in a tragedy there is no debriefing for them
7739946 it can mean they are more judgemental about the risks involved
7739947 i recognise that this is very difficult to avoid but they need to realise that for most women this is something that they feel it is important to do for themselves
7739948 the numbers are relatively small but the important thing is that these deaths are preventable
7739949 every year a number of patients die in the bath so convincing people to take showers would be life saving
7739950 were not saying that people shouldnt swim but that they need to be aware of the risk and to go with someone who can help if they have problems
7739951 we always need to do whatever we can to ensure seizure control
7739952 people with epilepsy can enjoy the benefits of taking part in many water activities but need to take sensible precautions to reduce risk of drowning
7739953 because there is always a possibility that a seizure could happen it is important not to underestimate the potential risks when in or near water
7739954 this study shows a consistent 20 increase in the risk of diabetes
7739955 it is important to stress that the reason for this is still not understood although it is possible that the caesarean section itself is responsible perhaps because babies born via that method are first exposed to bacteria originating from the hospital environment rather than to maternal bacteria
7739956 type 1 diabetes in childhood has become more prevalent across europe recently and the rate of this increase suggests that environmental factors are the cause
7739957 however despite much investigation these actual factors remain largely unknown
7739958 the findings of this study indicate that the way a baby is delivered could affect how likely it is to develop this condition later in life
7739959 not all women have the choice of whether to have a caesarean or not but those who do may wish to take this risk into consideration before choosing to give birth this way
7739960 we like his instincts and his ability to run a team he also puts a lot of pressure on the ball

7739969 its a real concern theyre very talented and very much like the group we just lost to the nfl two years ago and we played them as redshirted freshmen the michael huffs and the cedric griffins and michael griffin was a true freshman but were back to that again we had some growing pains so were going to need some help back there
7739970 ive created a lifestyle brand that enables women to make socially and environmentally conscious decisions about clothing while still being fashion forward and trend oriented everyone needs to do their part but it doesnt need to be a sacrifice

7739973 now you know why i asked her out so many times even though she said no you want a persistent president
7739974 barack doesnt care where youre from or what your background is or what party if any you belong to thats not how he sees the world
7739975 he knows that thread that connects us our belief in americas promise our commitment to our childrens future is strong enough to hold us together as one nation even when we disagree

7739981 i have to give my partyroom the opportunity to meet and discuss the issue
7739982 but based on my knowledge of my 18 members previous positions in relation to this i doubt very much whether our partyroom will endorse it
7739983 i have a recommendation that will go to party rooms tomorrow and on thursday we will come out of that party meeting with a clear idea of what were going to do thats an issue for my colleagues
7739984 taxpayers are now funding labor party polling simply because you no longer know what queenslanders want
7739985 prices are not going up as a result of what were doing
7739986 prices will rise as a result of emissions trading they will rise as a result of actions of governments around the world to tackle climate change and gas emissions
7739987 the point is this if you increase the supply of electricity then you put a downward pressure on electricity prices
7739988 theres a national regulator these companies operate in a national market if theyre going to switch their power stations off then their competitors in victoria south australia and queensland and their other competitors in nsw will supply their electricity
7739989 the second point is the national regulator holds back around 850 megawatts of power
7739990 if theres a company or power station that wants to play games theres penalties but the reserve trading capacity of the national regulator can come in and have that electricity supplied
7739991 thirdly making a return on behalf of shareholders whats the best way to do that get more customers and thats exactly whats happening
7739992 and there is a simple reason i got elected to do what is right not necessarily what is popular
7739993 the easy thing would have been to not have taken action but that would have been the wrong thing by nsw
7739994 we have party meetings commencing tomorrow we have shadow cabinet on thursday and a joint party meeting on thursday and well have a vote on thursday or friday whenever mr iemma brings it on
7739995 im confident about my colleagues their vote will as usual be worked out within our party room structure and well be ready to vote when the legislation is put on either thursday or friday
7739996 ive invited a number of people to offer their views to me i invited the business community in this afternoon to see me
