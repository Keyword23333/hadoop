400041 in trying to stretch every kilowatt of energy that we have we need to know that what is spent is lost and if we can conserve we can use that kilowatt more efficiently
400042 weve heard of hybrid vehicles plug in hybrid vehicles and even fuel cell vehicles
400043 at the same time if coe supplies could be limited then its a signal that if you want to buy conventional vehicles then theres a premium you need to be paying to use it
400044 when you buy a computer there is a lot of packaging so upfront you are charged 5 for the waste management but if you buy from another company which uses less packaging you are charged slightly lower products which require more waste management processes will actually cost slightly more in this way you can encourage consumers to think before they consume

400046 there were no birds out there today which is very good the distraction showed up in my flying yesterday if you have distractions with birds all the time you dont fly well without the birds it went much better
400047 i thought id take it easy to get a good run in i can fly faster thats good to know for me tomorrow
400048 were all in the same situation i think you can tell from our sort of nerves wed all rather have more training time normally you can work up to an extreme level gradually whereas were having to go fast right away thats making it exciting
400049 it was very windy very blustery and tricky drift was a big problem youve got to kill the drift i had no pylon hits a good time and a safe landing so im happy youre trying to fly the airplane through two pylons but its drifting to youve got to set it up so that when you get there it drifts through the middle without hitting a pylon thats the trick out there and thats why there are all the pylon hits
400050 im flying a better line im flying a tighter line than he is im flying a shorter distance in the turns and the half cuban so im going to catch up hes got a faster plane so he can fly that bigger rounder smoother line its so much nicer when youve got more speed i have to fly crazy but i still can only make up so much on him
400051 of course the conditions were much worse for me than everyone else
400052 its coming together we are making progress with the feel and handling of the plane every race i have been making massive changes in terms of set up and i am feeling more comfortable
400053 the conditions are pretty horrible its very windy very turbulent ive got to find a way to save a couple of seconds because im sure the other guys are going to go faster
400054 im very pleased with the airplane hopefully the other pilots will be annoyed we dont want them to sit back and relax
400055 im happy because it was really turbulent out there it was important for me to do a full run to see if i can get through the first part of the track the way i want to ill focus on the other details tomorrow
400056 i think its the most difficult race weve had this year
400057 the set up the runway the holding area you have no time and space to really prepare your aircraft for the track to warm up the engine as well as youd like to all in all its the most difficult track everythings really stressful here
400058 the weather was quite windy and bumpy which makes our job not easy maybe thats why some of the pilots hit the pylons the wind is difficult its challenging but i had a good flight im pleased
400059 im flying in some pain but other than that im doing okay whats annoying to me is not winning it doesnt matter whos moving in front of me now i want to be back on top
400060 ill try my best obviously tomorrow and that is as much as i can do
400061 we discovered that its kind of difficult for woodruff scholars to meet the colleges community service requirements for campus organizations because of our busy schedules
400062 so one day i sat with lelania and we discussed it and she came up with a fantastic idea of adopt a highway its easy and its convenient were right here on campus and its right up in front of the college
400063 its easy and it is convenient were right here on campus and the sign is right up front
400064 one day we came to school and there it was
400065 the adopt a highway program we have initiated is going to be open not only to woodruff scholars
400066 were going to encourage the entire student body staff and faculty to join in with us
400067 no estoy muy enterada de lo que es el comercio justo pero me he acostumbrado al caf que venden aqu y ya no podr a vivir sin l

400075 i have no hard feeling for cam after all he did give me a chance but i will say this i was loyal to him and he took advantage
400076 dealing with the press is something that youve gotta start getting used to
400077 and you know people want something to talk about so theyre going to have the two disney girls or three disney girls kind of feuding
400078 theres no feud theres nothing to feud about so why start a fight
400079 its something that we all have to live with and unfortunately it involves friends
400080 im not interested in being anybody but myself and im not here to replace anyone
400081 i think that shes a wonderful performer and of course its a compliment but i would like to take a different route
400082 i would love to step out of disney and maybe do a couple of roles maybe challenging roles and fun roles new things like that
400083 something sexy and edgy something where i get to use a knife
400084 we are always interested in any kind of workshop that is empowering and will encourage girls to feel like they can do anything
400085 they can create their own environment and be creative in the risks that they take
400086 if you can find other girls to play with its not just a bonding experience its not just about the music its sort of this big empowerment thing
400087 its a confidence builder youre playing and youre jelling together on a stage in front of people who are pumping you up and its just a really big empowerment and confidence booster
400088 we actually put a bunch of names in a little baggy and drew out four or five random words and put them together and we wrote down about 40 different possible names
400089 we were down to finding nowhere and broken media and we all voted for broken media
400090 total teenage drama its like us making fun of girls because we say they are talking on their cell phones listening to the radio looking in the mirror and trying to fix their hair
400091 we thought we should make it about people who would say lol
400092 our main rivals seem to still be a little quicker than us even if there is the usual question mark over any difference in the fuel loads
400093 there is still room for improvement and we will concentrate all our efforts on this in preparing for qualifying and the race
400094 of course its not nice when its not going so well but its not the first time
400095 we will just keep pushing and at some point things will start to improve
400096 they mclaren have been very fast in the last races and we have not exactly been doing so well
400097 there are many races to go and he hamilton has a little gap over us so its not easy to catch up
400098 if we dont start winning it will be pretty difficult hopefully we can catch up
400099 it would be so easy to say that just because they won the last two races they are the kings
400100 before the last two races they were not the kings so we know how this sport works
400101 weve just passed the halfway point of the championship so there is still a long way to go
400102 we have a good team were ahead in the constructors championship and second and third in the drivers championships
400103 we are not far behind we are very close and we all know in f1 things can change very easily
400104 we are 100 motivated to be competitive here and not just here but through to the end of the season
400105 i will go to north finland to see my parents do a little bit of fishing walking in the forest enjoying not seeing anyone else

400109 if its time to join the club i will join if she says no then i wont join
400110 if they ask me to join the club ill make my decision whether my girlfriend is happy or not
400111 i try to keep it that way i think its better
400112 first of all i dont think lewis needs any help
400113 he has shown himself he can do the job and he doesnt need anyone there
400114 the second point is i am trying to do the maximum for myself and i am not helping any other drivers thats for sure
400115 i have no instructions from the team in the past it has been very clear at mclaren they have had the policy of equal drivers and both have the same opportunities
400116 i have the same car the same opportunity and i am working towards improving the pace and the results
400117 the last few races have been a little disappointing but the only way to move on is to keep working hard and eventually the results will come

400133 la magistrada act a a t tulo personal y no representa a la comisi n de admisi n ni al tribunal constitucional por una sencilla raz n estas instancias son cuerpos colegiados
400134 hemos establecido un criterio t cnico de aplicaci n que de ninguna manera es una interpretaci n de la ley menos una iniciativa legislativa tampoco un pedido al congreso y peor una modificaci n a la ley sino es un criterio t cnico electoral de aplicaci n por el cual se establecieron dos principios
400135 nosotros nunca nunca vamos a estar con la derecha nunca vamos a estar con el imperialismo yanqui porque tenemos nuestra independencia pol tico sindical y esta cob reclama los derechos de los trabajadores la unidad de los bolivianos unida fuerte con desarrollo y progreso

400138 la corte est faltando a la aplicaci n de la constituci n no est cumpliendo con su deber hoy d a est usurpando la funci n del poder legislativo que es la nica que puede modificar esta ley de referendo revocatorio
400139 este criterio de aplicaci n acata plenamente la ley porque aplica tres art culos de la cpe que reconocen el principio democr tico y la ley 3850 del referendo es decir no viola ninguna de la dos porque son complementarias
400140 hemos tenido contacto con algunos vocales de la corte departamental de santa cruz y sabemos que se van a reunir en sala plena para dar a conocer su posici n en relaci n con la consulta popular

400146 i was sure that i would never have my own restaurant but still i was inspired by my father in his restaurant he always listened to the radio music television had long since arrived but my father never gave it a chance so i took over that attitude
400147 we often went to thailand for holidays during the christmas 1972 when the americans bombed hanoi i was in pattaya with my mother and my aunt the air was full of the sound of b 52 aeroplanes and i asked my mother where they were heading
400148 she told me that there was an u s air base a few kilometres from where i was always playing and had a wonderful time and that the b 52 i saw in the air was on their way to hanoi in vietnam to bomb the city full of playing children like myself
400149 from that moment my ambition to work with the radio news was created from that second i knew what i would do i would tell other people about what happened in the world
400150 it was radio for people made together with the people i was a part of local society my first interview was with a young 17 year old guy who was in a wheelchair he could not get into the post office by himself the story led to a proper solution and within a very short time they changed it so it became possible it was not just my contribution alone but i was a part of it
400151 at the same time i had a good friend and colleague who had a project running in vietnam it was about the radio type i deeply loved like my first job in s rmland
400152 i said yes joined the project and it grew i went back and forth this is why i took leave of absence for two years so i was more or less officially team leader in vietnam my biggest challenge as journalistic team leader was to get people to abandon the other jobs so the journalists could begin to work full time and produce live radio
400153 i was in the job in 18 months and i found out that i had lost something i was full of emptiness inside me but it took some time before i was aware that what i had lost was asia
400154 once again i arrived in a country which was very different from anything i had experienced before lao people are relaxed the work is not the most important thing in the world of course we must work to eat but people have glorious lives
400155 for instance we had a very good printer but there was no money to buy colour so the printer was collecting dust in a corner of an office there was no money for maintenance did something break down there was no money available for repairing the stuff
400156 i accepted the job and was initially only to be here for a year but my contract has been extended so i can at least be here altogether three years the work is exciting
400157 many laotians see and hear more thai tv and radio than programs from laos it appeals more to them thais are more advanced and their programmes are talented done and very entertaining but it is still thai culture and it is sad if thailand and its culture take over
400158 last year the swedish government decided to pull out of laos it closed its embassy and sida is moving its activities we have money until march 2009 but the project must run at least two years more if our work shall be sustained if we stop when the swedish engagement is finished i and many others fear that it all falls apart

400185 his voting record is more to the left than the announced socialist in the united states senate bernie sanders of vermont

400193 jennys situation is of great concern to many people i represent
400194 this is not an indictment of the zoo in mexico but jenny deserves to be somewhere she will be happy
400195 we know she is a nervous elephant and with protected contact she can approach people if she wants to and we can monitor her stress levels easily without anyone getting hurt or killed
400196 these animals need our help to protect their natural habitat as well as facilitate conservation programs throughout the country that are helping new generations of wildlife stewards and conservationists

400431 apabila bertambah banyak pikiran dalam batinku penghiburan mu menyenangkan jiwaku
400432 sebab selama masih diam di dalam kemah tubuh pen ini kita mengeluh oleh beratnya tekanan tetapi allahlah yang mengaruniakan roh kepada kita sebagai jaminan maka oleh karena itu hati kami senantiasa tabah
400433 bukankah di negerimu ini tidak ada yang mustahil untuk dilakukan bukankah peribahasa sekejam kejamnya harimau tidak akan memangsa anaknya sendiri sudah dipecahkan di sini bukankah di sini kejahatan yang tidak mungkin menang ternyata dapat mengalahkan kebenaran lalu semustahil apakah permintaanku ini
400434 kita belum punya teknologi secanggih amerika dan eropa yang bisa membawa manusia ke bulan teknologi kita sangat jauh tertinggal dari mereka pak
400435 itu masalah kalian dan aku tidak mau tahu pokoknya aku harus dikuburkan di bulan

400437 pak sudah hampir jam satu siang saya harus kembali ke kantor nanti biar si burhan yang menemani bapak di sini
400438 betul pak bahkan perwakilan dari mereka akan menuju ke mari bersama dengan rombongan presiden besok siang
400439 lho bukankah seharusnya bapak merasa senang karena akhirnya wasiat mbah sudirjo bisa dilaksanakan kenapa air muka bapak malah tampak sedih
400440 hah bagaimana beliau bisa berubah pendapat bukankah kata bapak beliau adalah seorang yang berpendirian keras
400441 saya tidak bisa mengatakan sebabnya biarlah beliau sendiri yang mengatakannya
400442 harap tenang karena sebentar lagi ayah saya akan masuk ruangan ini untuk memberikan pernyataan
400443 saat ini saya akan memberikan pernyataan seputar wasiat terakhir saya
400444 mengenai pembatalan wasiat terakhir saya untuk dikebumikan di bulan hal itu memang sepenuhnya benar
400445 apakah anda mengambil keputusan itu sendiri ataukah ada tekanan dari pihak pihak yang berkuasa
400446 lalu bagaimana pula dengan tanggung jawab anda terhadap rakyat dan para sponsor yang mendukung wasiat anda itu
400447 pertama saya ingin meminta maaf sebesar besarnya kepada masyarakat dan semua pihak atas pembatalan wasiat terakhir ini pembatalan ini disebabkan karena dua hari yang lalu sekitar pukul satu dinihari saya didatangi oleh seorang malaikat utusan tuhan
400448 beliau mengatakan bahwa tuhan sangat marah atas wasiat terakhir saya itu terlebih dengan alasan saya yang selama ini saya kemukakan saat itu juga saya diperlihatkan seluruh kesalahan yang pernah saya buat sepanjang hidup saya dan sungguh saya sendiri sangat terkejut dengan apa yang saya lihat kemudian setelah memperlihatkan semuanya itu malaikat itu berkata kepada saya kamu itu tidak ada bedanya sama sekali dengan mereka yang kamu anggap jahat oleh karena itu tuhan tidak rela jikalau jasadmu mengotori rembulan nya setelah itu dia menghilang dan meninggalkan cahaya yang luar biasa terang di dalam kamar saya saat itu juga saya langsung memohon ampun kepada tuhan atas kesombongan saya menganggap diri sebagai orang yang paling suci dan paling layak untuk disemayamkan di bulan seharian saya menyimpan pengalaman itu dan tadi malam saya baru menceritakannya kepada kedua putra saya
400449 lalu apakah itu berarti bapak bersedia untuk dikebumikan di bumi nanti kalau sudah meninggal
400450 saya ingin tubuh saya dikremasi lalu abu jenasah saya ditaburkan di angkasa biarlah saya terbang dan menghilang bersama angin kalau yang ini tuhan tidak keberatan
400451 saya pikir cukup sekian saja jumpa pers kita hari ini biarlah ayah saya beristirahat
400452 mbak ini pura pura tuli apa tuli beneran sih dari tadi ditanyain kok nggak bereaksi sama sekali

400462 waktu itu kan kebun tehmu lagi diserang hama teruuusss kebun kopimu belum ada hasilnya terus apalagi ya o iya sapimu masih sekolah iya kan
400463 hari ini tepat dua tahun sejak kamu maen ke sini waktu itu waktu itu asri ngerasa aneh banget soalnya kamu itu ngomongnya nyambung banget sama asri dan di antara temen temen asri yang laen kamu itu yang paling terbuka kecuali satu hal
400464 sebenernya sejak saat itu asri mulai suka sama kamu tapi berhubung asri punya prinsip kalo masih sekolah asri nggak akan pacaran dulu jadi asri pendam perasaan itu meskipun susahnya minta ampun selain itu asri juga takut jangan jangan kamu udah punya pacar tapi sekarang asri udah kuliah dan asri mo belajar buat ngungkapin perasaan asri dan asri siap menanggung segala resikonya
400465 mas obed asri suka sama mas obed dan meskipun mungkin asri bukan yang pertama asri pengen jadi cewek terakhir di hati mas obed
400466 asri ambilin gitar dong aku pengen nyanyi sebuah lagu yang aku bikin buat kamu
400467 lagu ini kubuat untuk kamu dan memang sebenernya aku juga suka sama kamu sri tapi aku juga takut jangan jangan kamu udah punya pacar jadinya aku lebih memilih untuk jadi sohibmu aja asal aku masih bisa terus maen dan ketemu kamu thanks ya soalnya kalo kamu nggak ngomong duluan aku nggak akan pernah tau isi hati kamu dan pasti nggak akan pernah ngungkapin perasaanku sama kamu

400706 karadzic indicted for genocide and war crimes was under the us protection until 2000 when the cia intercepted his telephone conversation that clearly proved he personally chaired a meeting of his old political party
400707 im not sure there was a written document confirming so but i do have holbrookes admission of verbal guarantees given to karadzic from the highest level of the us
400708 during the year 2000 at the time of the november general elections in bosnia the cia learned that karadzic was still leading the sds the serbian democratic party founded by karadzic despite their deal that he was not to interfere in political life
400709 in 2000 there was a sds meeting in the eastern bosnian town of bijeljina chaired personally by karadzic he was providing instructions to members and the leadership who to be replaced and who to be appointed to which position
400710 in america they went crazy realizing karadzic was making a fool of them
400711 the americans and cia then withdrew the informal protection enjoyed by karadzic
400712 we were able to clarify at a most senior level there was absolutely no shift that had occurred

400714 i had a good time shooting with rajini sir he seemed to be a humble person it was very easy to pick up a conversation with him he is just like any other person i had my bit of interaction with rajini sir before i went for my first shot i was to say well done mr ashok and shake hands with him he is such a simple person that he does not make his co actors feel nervous i did not feel nervous either
400715 as a matter of background my fathers family is very large he is second eldest of 13 children the children arrived from around 1932 to 1953 and all 13 lived and grew into adulthood despite 3 of them serving in the marine corps in korea my dad included despite a much high mortality rate from childhood diseases and despite having 11 rowdy boys a feat that i consider to be somewhat blessed all on its own my grandmother is or should be a certified saint having raised these 11 boys and 2 girls dont pity the heavily outnumbered girls they are today two of the most amazing and strong women i know grandmother was named mother of the year in san jose california in the mid 50s a title she earned many times over she was also on her own from the mid 60s or so when my grandfather died i hardly knew him really but she remains a firm memory the sad part of the whole event came as allens mother not only could not come but has not been told she is very old now her memory failing the decision was made not to tell her because it would really serve no purpose as it is unsure how much she would understand and how she would respond as well as the fact that her health is too fragile for her to have been able to attend even if she had understood my fathers family has been a joy to me for they embody so passionately what we all strive for love and with this tragedy they again have fallen back to that foundation of love and support that all seem to naturally feel when my step mother died in 1999 the reaction was the same as it was here this weekend the gathering from all corners of the country to share the memories of a loved one and to show support and love as all shared my fathers grief this weekend even as all grieved the loss of a father or a loved one or a brother they also rejoiced in a life filled with memories and laughter as they recalled their favorite moments of his life and events they all shared with him i still struggle with life its mysteries and death i still have a hard time reconciling my feelings on the whole subject what i did recognize on saturday however gives me hope and a lot of comfort it was a concept so simple in its nature and so deeply profound in its effect imagine if you will my father and his siblings all standing in a circle holding hands when allen was lost from that circle a gap now existed but only momentarily as all stepped slightly forward shortening the length of the circle the two open ends joined hands and once again completed the circle the circle has changed yet remains a circle and as an ironic bonus all are a little closer together then they were before in the circle of our family where some families fracture with deaths ours just draws closer together rest in peace uncle allen you will never be forgotten for you live in our hearts and we hear your voice in our laughter

400739 the provisions of the hyde act and not the assurances made by the indian prime minister in parliament are shaping the course of the indo us nuclear deal through the various stages
400740 that the interpretation of the indian government regarding the corrective measures mentioned in the preamble of the safeguards agreement providing for a check against disruption of fuel supplies does not hold has been made clear by the iaea
400741 this belies the prime ministers assurance in parliament that indias civilian nuclear facilities would be put under perpetual iaea safeguards only under the strictly reciprocal condition of uninterrupted fuel supply guarantee

400762 junto con lo mencionado previamente es menester mencionar y explicitar el hecho que el acusado est siendo procesado por el mismo tribunal militar regional que dej impune a los asesinos de los hermanos alex lemun y mat as katrileo por lo cual es clara la tendencia del tribunal en cuesti n
400763 tengo la sensaci n de haber hecho todo lo posible y haberlo hecho bien en el fallo el tribunal le dio validez a la presunci n de inocencia que en los casos mapuches ha sido muy pocas veces respetada y ahora espero que ese fallo sea respetado

400789 las llamadas entidades del campo s lo pronuncian los dictados de los agronegocios su s mbolo actual es la soja transg nica que ha devastado bosques desalojado comunidades contaminado suelos y aumentado los precios de los alimentos en el mercado interno el avance del modelo sojero iniciado durante el menemismo y acentuado en esta d cada significa un desierto verde y contaminado sin agricultores y ciudades saturadas de familias expulsadas de las zonas rurales

400823 his nature was more primitive bedouin person and far from civilization he was not fit to plan or execute

400850 for men its less of a shortfall when they are older because thats when they tend to be married and when women have already experienced things like divorce and widowhood
400851 usually people who are married have a better financial situation since often they have double incomes
400852 they also are more likely to fulfill their financial aspirations
400853 in economic theory one of the assumptions is that preferences are stable so you basically dont change your wants but we see the wants do change that people really adapt to achievement
400854 so when they attain goods then they want more goods
400855 what that means for happiness is quite interesting it means that when you acquire something in the material goods domain it will not really increase your happiness because you just adjust your aspirations

400870 in order to prepare ourselves to face the climate change due to global warming the government should widen the food security basket by including tubers potato and onions and orphan crops such as minor millets kodu ramdana banana crops and red variety riceunder msp
400871 in several countries the tuber crops such as potatoes onions etc and minor millets are recognized as food crops therefore these crops should also be covered under msp

400925 karadzic indicted for genocide and war crimes was under the us protection until 2000 when the cia intercepted his telephone conversation that clearly proved he personally chaired a meeting of his old political party
400926 im not sure there was a written document confirming so but i do have holbrookes admission of verbal guarantees given to karadzic from the highest level of the us
400927 during the year 2000 at the time of the november general elections in bosnia the cia learned that karadzic was still leading the sds the serbian democratic party founded by karadzic despite their deal that he was not to interfere in political life
400928 in 2000 there was a sds meeting in the eastern bosnian town of bijeljina chaired personally by karadzic he was providing instructions to members and the leadership who to be replaced and who to be appointed to which position
400929 in america they went crazy realizing karadzic was making a fool of them

400937 but clearly they are very quick i didnt feel too comfortable on the softest tyre while on the harder one which i used first the situation was much better
400938 as usual on the first day at the hungaroring it is difficult to understand how the tyres are behaving because you always get a lot of graining while the situation changes bit by bit as more rubber goes down on the track
400939 we know in which direction we have to work and will do all we can to bring home a good result it will be tough but i am confident
400940 fridays results are always difficult to evaluate as one doesnt know what fuel loads the other teams are running

400952 the main theme and lessons drawn from these two cases is that these guidelines that the state has established if they are to be legitimate at all need to be considered thresholds not limits
400953 thats important because the legislation at least the intent of the legislation was never meant to cap the amount patients could cultivate or possess the intent was to set guidelines that were helpful to law enforcement but not set limits

401000 we are over the moon it is just such a relief
401001 we are very pleased with the outcome of the case but we are extremely disappointed that we had to come to the high court in the order to give our daughter the right to wear the kara in school
401002 in this case there is very clear evidence it was not a piece of jewellery but to sarika was and remains one of the defining focal symbols of being a sikh
401003 it was not taken lightly we regret that this action became at all necessary
401004 we note the comments of the judge regarding the advice offered to the school
401005 should sarika wish to return to school in september in accordance with the judgment she will be offered help and support to reintegrate her into the normal day to day life of the school
401006 its a shame that each generation has to fight the same battles this battle was already fought 25 years ago and sarika shouldnt have had to go through that again

401047 giving voice to the struggles of the african working class from around the world
401048 in the face of all these attacks that are clearly being made on the african community why is it that you have not had the ability to not one time speak to the interests and even speak on behalf of the oppressed and exploited african community or black community in this country
401049 this is democracy at work and he asked a legitimate question so i want to give him an answer

401053 hes not from central casting when it comes to candidates for president of the united states
401054 they clearly walked away from his statements and we are moving on
401055 hey weve heard that there might be some kind of oil something on this boat

401063 recyclers can make vast profits from combing through ordinary rubbish processing it and then reselling it to other companies and that leads to another bigger thought trash is no longer just an environmental liability it is becoming a financial asset
401064 waste and recycling drew a record 622 million of investment in 2007 compared with 245 million a year earlier and just 20 million in 2001 according to cleantech group

401074 karadzic indicted for genocide and war crimes was under the us protection until 2000 when the cia intercepted his telephone conversation that clearly proved he personally chaired a meeting of his old political party
401075 im not sure there was a written document confirming so but i do have holbrookes admission of verbal guarantees given to karadzic from the highest level of the us
401076 during the year 2000 at the time of the november general elections in bosnia the cia learned that karadzic was still leading the sds the serbian democratic party founded by karadzic despite their deal that he was not to interfere in political life
401077 in 2000 there was a sds meeting in the eastern bosnian town of bijeljina chaired personally by karadzic he was providing instructions to members and the leadership who to be replaced and who to be appointed to which position
401078 in america they went crazy realizing karadzic was making a fool of them
401079 the americans and cia then withdrew the informal protection enjoyed by karadzic

401086 on inspection engineers determined that fluid was coming from the spoiler actuator that was not evident before departure
401087 one of the main aims of the trip was to help the stormont parliament build on its existing excellent relations with the north american continent
401088 however our ulster economy can be further boosted by also developing closer ties with another of our natural commonwealth partners in north america canada
401089 many families and especially in north antrim have close ties with canada through family and friends and it is important that this ulster canada partnership is progressed to the benefit of both commonwealth nations
401090 through the commonwealth parliamentary association northern ireland has already seen a building of the ties with another commonwealth partner india
401091 with the peace process now firmly established in northern ireland the potential for enhancing ulsters business and tourist reputation in canada provides our assembly with a terrific challenge
401092 during the recent commission trip to canada we cemented the bond between the various parliaments when we held discussions between the speakers and representatives of the upper and lower houses of the canadian national parliament in ottawa
401093 later we in the commission travelled to nova scotia to meet the provincial parliamentary representatives in halifax nova scotia has a devolved administration like our assembly
401094 ironically given the vast land mass of canada we in the northern ireland assembly are actually geographically closer to the halifax provincial parliament than the canadian residents of british columbia
401095 among the more emotional moments in halifax was a visit to the cemetery where many of the dead from the 1912 titanic disaster are buried i had the privilege of laying a posie of flowers at the grave of the unnamed baby
401096 the babys body had been found in the sea by fishermen the baby had been a victim of the titanic but there was nothing to identify the child it was interesting to note that in spite of the passage of time since the titanics sinking people were still laying baby toys at the childs headstone
401097 another four years will see the centenary of that terrible night when so many people were lost when the titanic sank
401098 in terms of tourism and business opportunities we in north antrim especially have so much to offer the canada people

401111 i refer to the long foreseen crisis in prisons and the howls of alarm from all those forces and individuals who have the solution at their fingertips it is quite simply this let the women go the government should close womens prisons down forthwith they could then use the buildings to house the male prisoners
401112 how to solve the prisons crisis release all the whites to make more room for blacks
401113 all research by penal reformers tends to the view that it is totally inappropriate to slam women when other ways of dealing with them help avoid their re offending
401114 crime is one human activity where there is a clear difference between men and women
401115 after six young women committed suicide within one year at just one prison styal in cheshire they the government were forced to take notice following a fawcett society report in april about the very same subject the matter could be delayed no longer earlier this year baroness corston was asked to conduct a review of vulnerable women in the criminal justice system
401116 in 2005 there were 78 suicides in prison this included four women and 12 prisoners under 21 years old the proportion of suicides by black and minority ethnic prisoners has risen from one in ten of all prison suicides in the last five years to over one in five during 2005
401117 radical proposals to close all 13 womens jails in england and wales and replace them with small house units holding up to 20 offenders were today rejected by the government todays announcement is a bitter blow to penal reform groups who had put their trust in key female members of the government my emphasis instead the ministry of justice highlighted initiatives to support women including pilot projects in five jails in which a new search technique is being used which does not require them to remove their underwear
401118 baroness corston proposed closing womens jails and replacing them with a network of small units located in city centres and run by
401119 but even as her report was published last year ministry of justice sources made clear there was no money to implement such an ambitious and controversial proposal
401120 prison is certainly not one of the places where women aspire to equal treatment
401121 last year 87 200 women and girls were arrested for attacks the equivalent of 240 every day it is the first time in history that violence has been the most common crime among women and girls taking over from theft

401158 when they want to riot they stop classes and send the students in an organized fashion onto the roads the frustrating side of all this is that teachers are involved these are government employees

401201 it seems to me that if mr obama wins the presidential election then messrs farrakhan wright ayers and pfleger will gain power for their need to demoralize this country and help create a socialist america
401202 the radicals of that era were successful in giving the communists power to bring forth the killing fields and slaughter 2 5 million people in cambodia and south vietnam did they stop the war or did they bring the war to those innocent people in the end they turned their backs on all the horror and suffering they helped create and walked away
401203 luke has only one obsession do anything to stop the sending of young guys to war
401204 this is a perilous time and more than ever the world needs a united and strong america if god forbid we live to see mr obama president we will live through a socialist era that america has not seen before and our country will be weakened in every way

401213 so w re dies die bestimmung der photographie indem sie mich glauben l sst einmal freilich nur von wie vielen malen
401214 bar eines solchen prinzips sind photographien zeichen die nicht abbinden
401215 auskunft geben ber das was man das intellektuelle imagin re unserer zeit nennen k nnte
401216 sprache und sprechen trennen hei t gleichzeitig den proze des sinns er ffnen
401217 es w re also sinnlos diese trennung von vornherein auch f r systeme von gegenst nden bildern oder verhaltensweisen vorzuschlagen die semantisch noch nicht untersucht sind
401218 somit w re man gen tigt in den nicht sprachlichen semiologischen systemen drei und nicht zwei ebenen zu erkennen die ebene der materie die der sprache und die des gebrauchs weil sie im allgemeinen anders als die menschliche rede langage einen utilit ren und nicht signifikaten ursprung haben
401219 der tod ist das wann immer eine photographie als zeichen in linguistischer signifikat signifikantensystematik verstanden wird verkommt sie zum eidolon und t tet das dargestellte ab
401220 ich hatte begriffen dass ich von nun an die evidenz der photographie nicht unter dem gesichtspunkt des vergn gens sondern im hinblick darauf befragen musste was man romantischerweise liebe und tod nennen k nnte
401221 verr ckt wenn dieser realismus absolut und sozusagen urspr nglich ist und damit das signum der zeit
401222 da der mensch berhaupt fragen kann und nach sich selbst durchaus fragen mu ist zwar auch f r die biblische anthropologie ein den menschen charakterisierendes faktum doch die frage ist im horizont theologischer anthropologie weder ein er stes noch ein letztes die klassische belegstelle f r die lehre von der gottesebenbildlichkeit ist gen 1 26f die auslegung hat davon auszugehen da schon das blo e dasein des menschen als nach dem bilde gottes geschaffen verstanden wird des menschen dasein seine existenz ist seine gottesebenbild lichkeit
401223 indessen wird man guttun so wenig wie m glich das leibliche und geistige zu zerrei en der ganze mensch ist gottesbildlich geschaffen somit weist also am menschen alles auf gott
401224 interessant daran ist zun chst nicht die tatsache da dieser mechanismus sich in seinem gebrauch unendlich reproduziert indem er seine identit t von einem produktionszyklus zum anderen wiederherstellt und so eine gewisse zeitlichkeit festlegt sondern da er eine falle ein dispositiv ist das eine umkehrung der kr fteverh ltnisse erm glicht die maschine ist somit weder ein instrument noch eine waffe sondern ein listi ger kunstgriff der an die natur gebunden ist und auch wieder nicht die maschine ist mit der natur verbunden weil sie ohne die vereinnahmung und ausbeutung der naturkr fte nicht funktionierrt sie ist es n icht weil si e diesen kr ften einen streich spielt schw cher als jene kr fte setzt sie dennoch die ungeheuerlichkeit ins werk da der schw chere st rker ist als der st rkere
401225 berall sind es maschinen mit ihren kupplungen und schal tungen angeschlossen eine organmaschine an eine quellenmaschine der strom der von dieser hervorgebracht wird von je her unterbrochen die brust ist eine maschine zur herstellung von milch und mit ihr verkoppelt die mundmaschine der mund der appetitlosen h lt die schwebe zwischen einer e maschine einer analmaschine einer sprechmaschine einer atmungsmaschine asthma anfall
401226 das gehirn ist die komplizierteste maschine des universums soviel wir wissen der ganzen welt und ich denke die humanisten sind eigentlich respektlos wenn sie sagen unsere gedanken kommen von einer seele einem winzig kleinen ding ohne struktur
401227 diese forschung inspirierte eine wahre flut neuer ideen wie man maschinen beibringen k nnte dinge zu tun die bisher dem geist vorbehalten waren die meisten leute glauben immer da keine maschine je ein gewissen ehrgeiz neid humor entwickeln oder andere geistige lebenserfahrungen machen kann nat rlich sind wir noch weit davon entfernt maschinen mit menschlichen f higkeiten bauen zu k nnen aber das bedeutet nur da wir bessere theorien ber die denkt tigkeit brauchen
401228 der angestrengt in den weltraum hinausblickende mensch bekam nicht das ganz andere und fremde zu gesicht sondern den kosmischen spiegel seiner eigenen welt ihrer geschichte und ihrer m glichkeiten vorgehalten
401229 ich glaube der neandertaler geh rt zur spezies homo sapiens es gibt leute die glauben man k nnte ihm einen stra enanzug anziehen und ihn in die untergrundbahn einsteigen lassen ohne da er dort besonders auffallen w rde er war nur et was grobknochiger als die heutigen menschen und sein gesicht sah etwas urt mlicher aus aber er war ein mensch sein gehirn war ebenso gro oder gr er als das des heutigen menschen hatte aber eine etwas andere form h tte er sich am fahrkartenschalter ein billet besorgen k nnen ich glaube er w re durch aus in der lage gewesen er konnte auch noch viel kompliziertere dinge tun und hat das in einem gro en teil europas und asiens vor etwa 70 000 100 000 jahren bewiesen der neandertaler hatte menschliche vorfahren vor ihm lebte ein evolutiv betrachtet weniger hochentwickelter typus der homo erectus w rde er in die untergrundbahn einsteigen dann w rden die menschen ihn wohl mit einigem mi trauen betrachten vor dem homo erectus gab es einen ganz primitiven typus den homo habilis erschiene er in einem ffentlichen verkehrsmittel dann w rden die menschen ihm wahrscheinlich ausweichen und sich ans andere ende des wagens setzen vor dem homo habilis k nnte es einen typus wie lucy gegeben haben alle diese spezies sind hominiden sie haben alle einen auf rechten gang gehabt einige von ihnen waren menschen wenn auch eines entwicklungsgeschichtlich betrachtet sehr primitiven typs andere waren keine menschen auch lucy war kein mensch gleichg ltig wie man lucy anziehen w rde sie w rde nicht aussehen wie ein menschliches wesen sie war zu primitiv und geh rte nicht mehr in die kategorie der menschen diese feststellung k nnen wir machen wenn wir die evolution zur ckverfolgen wenn man weit genug zur ckgeht bekommt man es mit einem ganz anderen lebenwesen zu tun die fr hesten hominiden waren zu primitiv um als menschen bezeichnet zu werden
401230 die frage nach der semiotischen struktur der sprache wird von der stellung des menschen in der welt her begr ndet d h von der zwischenstellung des animal rationale zwischen den tieren und den engeln
401231 mit anderen worten stellt der mensch konkrete werkzeuge und symbole her die beide auf den gleichen proze oder besser die gleiche grundausstattung im gehirn zur ckgehen dies f hrt zu der feststellung da die sprache nicht nur ebenso charakteristisch f r den menschen ist wie das werkzeug sondern da beide ausdruck ein und derselben menschlichen eigenschaft sind sprache ist von dem augenblick an m glich da die vorgeschichte werkzeuge liefert denn werkzeuge und sprache sind neurologisch miteinander verbunden und beide lassen sich nicht von der sozialen struktur der menschheit trennen das bild dieser lt ersten gt menschen stimmt fast berhaupt nicht mehr mit dem berein was zwei jahrhunderte philosophischen denkens im menschen zu sehen gelehrt haben die tatsachen zeigen da der mensch nicht wie man zu denken gewohnt war eine art affe ist der sich langsam verbessert die majest tische kr nung des pal ontologischen geb udes sondern sobald er zu fassen ist bereits etwas ganz anderes als ein affe in dem augenblick da er uns erscheint bleibt ihm noch ein langer weg zu r ckzulegen aber diesen weg wird er weniger in der richtung der biologi schen evolution als in richtung auf die befreiung von seinem zoologischen rahmen in einer v llig neuen organisation bei der die gesellschaft fo schreiten an die stelle des stromes tritt

401237 i think the fbi owes us a complete accounting of their investigation and ought to be able to tell us at some point how were going to bring this to closure

401256 i think what we wanted to build was too much money and they saw how bad the contest went last year because of the format and they felt like they didnt want to blow their wad on something like that
401257 this is not the way for her to show that she cares for the rakyat as we had just concluded the general election
401258 she was supposed to deliver her campaign promises but she has given in to her personal interests and this is not a wise thing to do

401261 some people will tell you look at the walls and say they are still pretty high while others will tell you that there is a lot of space between the walls
401262 the police dont check our paperwork anymore and even if they found you without a permit they wont arrest you but rather would suggest you get one as soon as possible
401263 chinas economic development relies on the flow of migrants into cities
401264 you cant tell me that our appeal and calls for revision of the law had no meaning at all
401265 they know that as taxpayers we support the government not the opposite
401266 human rights has become more than just a theory for the public
401267 in the past they petitioned and complained about injustice but that wasnt about defending their rights they let the higher authorities to decide their rights
401268 what they are asking for now is a change in the system and this reflects a widespread change in attitude
401269 i saw a gap between the official story and the reality which was mind blowing like the presence of the armed police
401270 so i put some of these things on the internet on my personal blog
401271 the media has made a huge step forward from the 80s
401272 would have been impossible for the public to know about in the past
401273 today even the farmers in remote areas have satellite tvs
401274 so whenever they see an election such as the one held in pakistan recently they may wonder why even though we have approximately the same economic conditions they can elect their top leaders and we cant even vote for the leader of a small county i think a consciousness of political rights has increased more than anything
401275 there has been progress but its so slow that sometimes one becomes pessimistic
401276 its empty talk to speak of having an independent judiciary if the party leads everything
401277 this is kind of a big deal thank you so much ive sat in front of this computer for 20 minutes trying to put into words how i feel who all to thank and how to celebrate this is a true honor and i am humbled by it
401278 i dont think that jumpsuits are going to work because my friends actually instead of it being a punishment theyll see it as an opportunity to be like rebels

401290 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices
401291 this rebate will be enough to offset the increased cost of gas for a working family over the next four months
401292 it will be enough to cover the entire increase in your heating bills or you could use the rebate for any of your other bills or even to pay down your own debt
401293 any individual using a personal cell phone will be disciplined
401294 termination is an option of discipline the cell phone will be confiscated
401295 im surprised at this sort of culture policing i believe culture is more of a choice my generation feels theres no harm in kissing in places like parks thats probably the reason why kissing scenes are not censored in movies and serials
401296 it was just a spontaneous gesture being made out to be an offence that too at around 8 45 pm when the place was quite deserted im sure we were not offending anyone
401297 going by the law the police do not have the right to fine anyone for kissing even if it amounts to indecent behavior in public only a court can levy a fine
401298 lewd impure or indecent behavior calculated to shock the moral regard of citizens
401299 the majority of people feel kissing in public places is wrong both families and couples visit the citys parks so we have to ensure that no one causes embarrassment to others
401300 of course we try not to disturb the privacy of people who might be friends spending time

401356 india seeks to establish peaceful friendly and cooperative ties with pakistan we are committed to addressing all outstanding issues including the issue of jammu and kashmir through bilateral discussions
401357 however improvement in our relations requires an atmosphere that is free from terrorism
401358 we have a duty to ensure that our people prosper and progress in a secure environment
401359 the scourge of terrorism must be removed from our midst and criminals and terrorists must never go unpunished
401360 there can be no economic growth or development without peace and security we need to take all necessary measures to combat terrorism and trans national crimes like trafficking of women and children

401393 if the opportunity comes again i feel like it would be a definite id think about it
401394 i think if i played a couple pga events in a row it would be a different story
401395 its just hard to play one and then one maybe a year later
401396 i think if i played eight in a row and i missed all eight that would be a different story
401397 missing greens ive always had to find a way to get up and down so my wedge game has always been pretty good and if you put a little bit of luck in there you hole out a few shots
401398 obviously the score doesnt show it but i know what i need to work on i gave it my best today and i felt like i did a lot of good things and hopefully that outshines the ones i made mistakes on
401399 everything went pretty smoothly out there i hit a lot of fairways lots of greens and made a bunch of 10 footers i mean just kind of the way you like to draw it up
401400 i didnt know what the course record was but i caught myself thinking about 59 at no 14 i had like about a 10 footer
401401 i thought if i birdie the last five holes i can shoot 59 and thats just the worst thing to think so i made par there
401402 it was tricky out there sometimes with the wind so to get out of there with a 66 im pleased
401403 im trying to get ready for the senior tour so im trying to play well out here
401404 it is difficult to justify paying more per km for the land portion than the sea portion where the engineering challenges are greater also at a time when malaysians are being asked to tighten their belts giving a hefty contract to a glc would not have gone down well

401406 the reform of the police force has already begun although there are still one or two things to look into financial education and other reforms they all take time

401444 arthur rhodes floridas one addition thursday can get those lefthanders on the phillies and mets out something renyel pinto and taylor tankersley couldnt do
401445 and nobody seems to know it but now that theyve got josh johnson and anibal sanchez back theyve got the best starting pitching in the division the phillies and mets have holes they need to address and neither one of them did it
401446 because you start to think oh ive got the guy on this one then you throw that pitch again and bam its gone
401447 i had people try to help me with my bags at the airport
401448 he might be trying too hard to hold them down
401449 i dont see anything different hes still got good stuff
401450 but his best pitch is his changeup and hes been leaving it up in the strike zone in the last two games
401451 now that i think of it in the big innings ive given up i havent been able to locate down in the zone
401452 thats definitely an issue i have to be able to locate that pitch if i want to put the team in a position to win
401453 i wanted to help the team out especially with the winning streak
401454 my last start was poor and i wanted to redeem myself but i didnt do it
401455 rudys had some back problems and his shoulders been a little sore
401456 his last few times out he hasnt thrown good he looked like he couldnt bend over but hes one of those stubborn guys who wont tell when theyre hurt
401457 we got him as a starter and we havent had a very good look i feel like we definitely have to give him a better chance than that
401458 its their decision and im going to have to respect whatever they do
401459 whatever role they put me in theyre going to expect me to be ready
401460 well see what we can do we consider him a starter hes showed hes capable of pitching a good game when we put him out there

401480 digital media will have a transforming impact on the olympics at multiple levels
401481 it will change story telling for the games by making it more human and personal
401482 the olympic games are not that credible or relevant to most young people in the developed or developing world
401483 i will maybe watch highlight shows on tv later in the evening but i can never see myself watching it live
401484 the youth olympics will also be the platform through which youngsters will learn about olympic values and the benefits of sport and share their experiences with other communities around the globe
401485 the olympic games will be played out on facebook youtube and flickr whether we like it or not we need to engage not disengage with them
401486 people taking pictures and videos with their cellphones will change the way we watch the games
401487 for the first time digital technology will liberate how we all sitting outside see the games
401488 as the iphone capabilities are growing by the day i can probably see myself using my iphone to view olympic clips on the go maybe on my way to work or when out with my friends
401489 digital marketplace has the potential to re engage hundreds of millions of people with sport

401496 wrong decisions have been made and it is time for the politicians to wake up and give some direction to this sorry state of affairs
401497 we see the new fund as the unfair scotland fund as there will be more losers than winners
401498 its a fast road and then there is a roundabout and people just dont slow down quickly enough
401499 the exit and entrance roads join on to the a1 so if you are going north you have to cross the carriageway and join the traffic so these are difficult junctions and obviously busy when people are going to and from work
401500 we would have to look at how the volume of traffic on the road has increased
401501 and we dont know what the level of accidents would have been if dualling had not taken place
401502 it could be something as simple as improving lighting at junctions the a1 is popular with people who do not know the area so perhaps improved signage would help

401513 gt will may of east rochester is doing well after receiving a new kidney from kaylea seward
401514 i didnt understand any of the terminology they were using
401515 i cannot deal with just taking him home and letting him pass away at home
401516 i knew will since he was born when i saw he was really sick his mom talked to me about everything that was going on with him i just thought about it for a few weeks i felt like he was kind of like a part of my family hes always been very special to me and i love him very much so i think thats probably why
401517 i was really nervous and excited at the same time to see if i could be the one to save his life
401518 not to brag about it but it seemed kind of cool and exciting a lot of things were going through my mind about a lot of the risks the doctors were telling me
401519 hes getting back to where he was before the surgery hes awake now and hes smiling and laughing again hes doing excellent
401520 because will was so ill going into the surgery we were very concerned about his recovery
401521 but hes a strong child and hes doing very well now if he werent such a fighter he might not have made it through those first weeks following the transplant
401522 theres a lot of risk involved but i think its really important to help other people and not just think about yourself
401523 when i called kaylea she showed up with her mom and i just instantly knew that this was a really great family
401524 my kids and my whole family are so happy that weve gotten to know her for a young woman she has incredible generosity and love that she could teach any adult
401525 she went in and she did it all without ever hesitating whatsoever
401526 it was like the happiest thing you could ever dream of this has been a very long road it has not been easy by far this is my child this is all i could dream of the past two and a half years getting him to this point to get the surgery done
401527 the boy is a charmer you put him in the little stroller thingies in the hospital walking down the hall and anybody that sees him is going to stop and say isnt he so cute what a little prince will still catches peoples eyes he is just so amazing
401528 snoop dogg and the band appreciate the professionalism displayed by the texas dps troopers yesterday afternoon
401529 the tour bus was stopped for what was thought to be expired tags upon further investigation it was determined the bus was current on its registration and was eventually allowed to continue to snoop doggs show in dallas
401530 the alleged offense a class b misdemeanor was listed as less than two ounces of marijuana
401531 the young men arrested dont appear to have prior criminal records i expect that once everything has run its course there will be a favorable resolution to this case
401532 later in the evening snoop dogg and the band entertained a great crowd in dallas as they performed with

401562 the interesting question is where to place it for that family audience
401563 it does moderately well for the sci fi channel but it transmits for a 9 p m slot which it isnt written or made for
401564 you know what were pleased with the way its been performing for us
401565 my familys worried ive got alzheimers but i know i havent
401566 youre not special youre not powerful youre not connected youre not clever youre not important
401567 because it is reminiscent of calls for a fortress europe
401568 basically the idea is that everyone is down takes off the 24th and 25th of december and thats it
401569 this one for a whole lot of reasons is right up there
401570 we are wide open on both parties and we are possibly going to nominate and or elect a woman or a black or a mormon or an italian american president none of which has ever happened on that level alone its fascinating
401571 the campaign trail goes relatively quiet on the 24th and 25th but i dont think youll see that on the first
401572 even though its new years and everything its 48 hours out from the caucus and thats when people are deciding
401573 for eight or nine days itll be a topic of full interest by everybody
401574 now its pretty frenetic until the 6th of february after super duper tuesday
401575 then it goes into hibernation while they raise money and figure out what the spring campaign will look like there will be a lull theres an end to this craziness in february
401576 if you want to have your button up newscast packaged with a bow there are stations in town that do that and have been doing it for 25 years
401577 ive never seen a story where so many hands are out
401578 the utter confidence with which everyone had been wrong 20 minutes earlier they have the same utter confidence about what produced this surprise its intellectually dishonest
401579 mccain front runner mccain dead mccain is back hillary inevitable hillary toast hillary is back there is no defense for this it is built into our dna
401580 ok hillary won tonight oh waiter two orders of crow please this is what happens when you ignore your own advice to let the people vote first
401581 women watched the media treat her in almost demeaning ways not for what kind of president she would be but whether she looked angry or practiced tearing up
401582 with a cluster of new polls in new hampshire showing obama building a substantial lead the state appeared poised to play its storied role in humbling perceived front runners
401583 democrat barack obama may be heading for his second big victory in less than a week
401584 there is talk and evidence of an obama wave moving through this state on the eve of its primary
401585 with his presidential campaign in a state of near collapse
401586 sen john mccain accepted the resignations of two top advisers tuesday then quickly named a new campaign manager in a bid to put his candidacy for the republican nomination back on course
401587 the campaigns mounting problems have raised doubts about whether mccain can survive in the crowded but still wide open republican nomination contest
401588 two thirds of the press are caught in the cliches of the moment and the groupthink of the echo chamber in washington and new york
401589 his whole staff imploded and he was broke the press was covering mccain in deep trouble because he was in deep trouble
401590 superficial sportswriters covering the campaign is almost like joining a cult with a cocoonlike bubble as you travel from event to event theres a lemminglike quality
401591 when you have a campaign in disarray story that is one of the juiciest stories in presidential politics
401592 everyone is intoxicated by that its a tremendous distraction for a campaign but voters could care less
401593 the daily blab incorrectly reported in july that sen john mccains campaign lacked a pulse despite an absence of medical evidence
401594 we regret our unseemly rush to judgment about hillary clintons chances
401595 could be the msms katrina political media youve done a heckuva job
401596 ive never seen a story where so many hands are out
401597 the reason shes a u s senator the reason shes a candidate for president the reason she may be a front runner is her husband messed around
401598 was it fair to imply that hillarys whole career depended on being a victim of an unfaithful husband no and thats what it sounded like i was saying
401599 saying senator clinton got where shes got simply because her husband did what he did to her is just as callous and i can see now came across just as nasty worse yet just as dismissive
401600 chris matthews is a repeat offender when it comes to sexist attitudes toward women politicians i wasnt really looking for an apology i was looking for a behavior change and for him to treat female politicians the same way as male politicians
401601 this is a victory for all women we are pleased that chris matthews has shown remorse
401602 you know i dont know what to do with men who are obsessed with me honestly ive never understood it
401603 i thought what i said was unexceptional about what happened back in 98

401609 it was something that has kind of been on my mind in general and once i started looking at balance it became very clear it would have applications in that direction
401610 poor balance isnt something you have to accept you can help yourself you can improve balance
401611 if they have a sensor that can detect differences in balance it is fairly easy to train the elderly using physical therapy to improve their balance

401725 the whole industry has been doing really quite well but it has grown so fast over the last couple of years that returns are starting to drop pretty sharply
401726 all of a sudden therell just be too many blueberries one year and they wont be worth anything
401727 weve had the best of both worlds increasing supply and increasing pricing really driven by the whole health interest in blueberries
401728 we have to continue to keep supply and demand in balance for the blueberry growers
401729 a lot of people who traditionally buy from growers theyre not committing and its creating a lot of uncertainty in the market
401730 this industry was due for a tremendous growing pain and i think this year is the first year of the effects of that its due to the success of the crop farmers do jump on each others bandwagons when theres a successful crop
401731 how long it will last will depend on whether the average consumer can continue to afford our crop
401732 i would not be surprised if one of these mornings bissau woke up under a military uprising or even a coup it has been such a long time that nothing happens
401733 police chiefs shouldnt get involved in everyone elses business when it comes to their personal life its inappropriate

401742 one should not focus on the deadline too much what matters is that we get a clear answer quickly its not a matter of one day
401743 the main reason for their enmity with this nation in the past 30 years is that they want to force the iranian nation to retreat
401744 whenever the enemies have failed against this nation they have tried to make excuses but the iranian nation will stand against them with its power
401745 comments like those arent productive he should instead be focused on the generous incentives package weve offered
401746 it will not do shareholders or yahoo any good to have the annual meeting turn into a media event for no purpose
401747 there was never a conversation in which we didnt discuss shareholder value
401748 there was never any doubt about the position of this board at no point did we ever resist microsofts proposal in fact we proactively engaged with them
401749 to this day i cannot understand why they did that
401750 an ambitious strategic plan during this difficult time and hitting targets in q1 and q2 was an astounding achievement

401752 the core of microsoft growth is based around office the server products and sharepoint i think this is a huge announcement in terms of giving people the ability to choose
401753 we wanted to eliminate the advantage microsoft has with the office monopoly and this eliminates that advantage for microsoft because now a user can choose to use alfresco as easily as they would choose to use sharepoint
401754 if he beats his chest and says we are not playing fair or whatever like this is some closed secret of microsoft then i think that proves that sharepoint is the worse product but if its really as good a product as they say then should not be ashamed to have it compete fairly with alfresco
401755 theyre able to leverage other infrastructure investments in data centers maybe the java world maybe linux to be able to deploy a much more cost effective and scalable solution to meet their content management needs
401756 its very good news for the cio who clearly has had a tough time negotiating with a monopoly
401757 enjoined and restrained from copying modifying distributing or making any other infringing use of plaintiffs software
401758 account for and disgorge to plaintiffs all profits derived by defendant from its unlawful acts
401759 we attempted to negotiate with extreme networks but they ultimately ignored us
401760 like too many other companies we have contacted they treated gpl compliance as an afterthought that is not acceptable to us or our clients
401761 supermicro has agreed to appoint an open source compliance officer within its organization to monitor and ensure gpl compliance to publish the complete and corresponding source code for the version of busybox it previously distributed and to undertake substantial efforts to notify previous recipients of busybox from supermicro of their rights to the software under the gpl

401843 no bird soars too high if he soars with his own wings
401844 the church of rome is fearful that it could lose more priests like us
401845 and it should be afraid given its level of scandal over internal abuses and hypocrisy in combating poverty
401846 what they want to do is put an end to the catholic church but they have not succeeded
401847 they get dressed up as priests conduct baptisms and confirmations all paid for by the government while the people go hungry
401848 i share the revolutionary project of president ch vez since it is a socialist and humanist project for the masses
401849 ch vez is carrying out the work of god and i hope our priests here do the same
401850 the old catholic church claims to work on behalf of the needy but what have they done for us in all these centuries
401851 the roman catholic authorities decided the best way to belittle them is to claim some sort of link to ch vez
401852 a kind of chicken soup a tossed salad something that will not have any internal coherence
401853 but we just happen to share many of the same ideas as our president
401854 saw a great need for comprehensive marriage preparation that spanned a weekend and covered very important topics in marriage such as the faith communication children and finances
401855 though it is more social and not as intense at the three to get married weekend
401856 ongoing guidance at least in the first 10 years is of the utmost importance
401857 my husband and i have been married three and a half years
401858 but i can definitely say despite a very happy marriage we need lots of support and guidance all young married couples need guidance because it is hard and guidance from a priest or from another more experienced couple can really help you persevere
401859 in marriage two people meld two lives into one and we need as much prayer and support as we can get it is important to hear over and over again that the most joy will come from what seems the most challenging giving yourself for your spouse and for your children
401860 most parishes offer bible classes catechesis and mens and womens groups you dont often see programs specifically for couples to build marriages
401861 i believe this is where the laity need to get involved according to vatican ii we are called to get involved and support our pastors he cant do it all
401862 couples that are living marriages faithful to the teachings of the church need to be out there supporting one another and boldly proclaiming the truth about marriage that is the goal of three to stay married an environment where young couples can get started on the right foot in living the churchs teachings and sharing that message with other married couples who may need support
401863 we have to get involved and support our priests by living and preaching the truth
401864 as many famous spiritual writers have said we prepare for the business or professional world with years of study but somehow we embark on the most important decision of our life marriage and the spouse we choose with little to no reflection
401865 i think a weekend for marriage preparation although even too short for such an important decision is the only way to make it as comprehensive as possible it is difficult to live a catholic marriage in our society today so sufficient preparation is essential but unfortunately it is missing in some dioceses due to a lack of resources support or simple man power
401866 our task in the three to get married program is to impart to participants what it means to be married in the church and what that entails in their daily married life
401867 even for couples who are there simply because they want the traditional church ceremony if they are sincere find that they can glean useful information from the weekend and may even have a change of heart or conversion by the end
401868 the human but more importantly the spiritual transformation of the couples participating cannot be underestimated on these weekends
401869 one of the big issues of sexual ethics is that of family planning
401870 three to get married covers the church teaching on natural family planning and birth control and several of the other talks cover treating your spouse respectfully in the sexual act making it an act of mutual love and not simply self serving
401871 we live in a culture where the catholic ideal of marriage being a gift of self and being open to life are often challenged by society and even family
401872 when a couple is constantly challenged on the way in which they are living their lives they need support and they do not always get it from family
401873 meeting and knowing other couples who are striving for the same goals as you can really help
401874 the boys have been hurting all week and wanted to put together a good performance
401875 when you lose two in a row its a question of how you get back on the horse weve set the standard tonight
401876 the all blacks contested lineouts and won ball from australian throws improved their handling reduced turnovers in general play and stiffened their defense outscoring the wallabies four tries to one
401877 it was almost a complete role reversal from last week
401878 a weeks a long time in rugby and theyve proved that
401879 they were desperate and urgent and played with a passion and intensity you come to expect from them here
401880 western culture is hellish when it persuades men that the sole aim of life is pleasure and self interest today more than ever the christian must be aware that he belongs to a minority and that he is in opposition to everything that appears good obvious logical to the spirit of the world as the new testament calls it it is time to find again the courage of non conformism the capacity to oppose many of the trends of the surrounding culture renouncing a certain euphoric post conciliar solidarity
401881 if by restoration we understand the search for a new balance after the overly positive interpretations of an agnostic and atheistic world then a restoration understood in this sense a newly found balance of orientation and values within the catholic totality is altogether desirable and for that matter is already in operation in the church
401882 what the popes and the council fathers were expecting was a new catholic unity and instead one has encountered a dissension which to use the words of paul vi seems to have passed over from self criticism to self destruction there had been the expectation of a step forward and instead one found oneself facing a progressive process of decadence that to a large measure has been unfolding under the sign of a summons to a presumed spirit of the council and by so doing has actually and increasingly discredited it
401883 the absolute good and this means the building of a just socialistic society becomes the moral norm that justifies everything else including if necessary violence homicide mendacity and what looks like liberation turns into its opposite and shows its diabolic visage in deeds
401884 in many episcopal conferences the group spirit and perhaps even the wish for a quiet peaceful life or conformism lead the majority to accept the positions of active minorities bent upon pursuing clear goals
401885 every theologian now seems to want to be creative but his proper task is to deepen the common deposit of the faith as well as to help in understanding and proclaiming it not to create it
401886 the church of christ is not a party not an association not a club her deep and permanent structure is not democratic but sacramental consequently hierarchical
401887 what radical feminism at times even that which asserts that it is based on christianity is not prepared to accept is precisely the exemplary universal unchangeable relationship between christ and the father i am in fact convinced that what feminism promotes in its radical form is no longer the christianity that we know it is another religion
401888 those who like ratzinger exalt themselves in such a triumphalistic manner above everything exclude themselves as dialogue partners
401889 were having a synod around a council not a book
401890 ratzinger is right in what he has written in the book
401891 but he is not right in what he has not written
401892 the only really effective apologia for christianity comes down to two arguments namely the saints the church has produced and the art which has grown in her womb
401893 a theologian who does not love art poetry music and nature can be dangerous blindness and deafness toward the beautiful are not incidental they necessarily are reflected in his theology
401894 salvation for the church comes from within her but this in no way means to say that it comes from the decrees of the hierarchy
401895 guys guys it looks like its getting a little hot and heavy in here
401896 before we take this to the next level we want to make sure that you know how to use a condom
401897 it seems to make fun of sex making it as some kind of game as planned parenthood claims when sex is something so sacred that it should only be between a married man and woman
401898 we wanted to empower people to really take care of their own reproductive and sexual health
401899 through the web site and the videos we wanted to speak in a language that would be non threatening to a younger demographic
401900 this web site was especially repulsive to me because it appeals first to very young teenagers and contains scientifically inaccurate information but also because it denigrates sexual intimacy
401901 for men especially regular testing does not show threat information on human papillomavirus hpv or herpes
401902 the plan was for a lot of it to go back into catholic schools and be redeployed there but in terms of how far and wide that will spread were still to be given direction on that at the moment were still in the middle of cleaning everything up
401903 we built a citrix farm on hp blade equipment basically all the backend infrastructure was stored in our head office email file systems document management etc and accessed via a citrix client that allowed us to drop a computer anywhere and any staff member from any site could log on at any site
401904 from one node there would be three 10 gigabit fibres to three other nodes so if we ever lost a connection the network would continue to run
401905 i think that was the handiest thing we had across the sites
401906 the catholic church can claim income tax relief on any money donated through gift aid
401907 for the past decade the money has been held in a bank account controlled by the diocese of shrewsbury there must be approximately 350 000 sitting in it all donated by parishioners
401908 yet nothing but the most essential repairs have been made on the building
401909 the catholic church are going to be surprised how far we are going to take this
401910 the building is absolutely fantastic and in very good condition and what the diocese has been doing is no less than shocking
401911 the tragic thing is that the diocese dont seem to recognise the quality and importance of this building and i feel very strongly that there is no good reason to close other than pure greed
401912 in the name of human freedom and autonomy gods name is passed over in silence religion is reduced to private devotion and faith is shunned in the public square
401913 the creation of atheism as the de facto established religion to drive real religion from the public domain
401914 some say there is no place for faith in the 21st century i say they are wrong some say that faith is the enemy of reason i say also they are wrong
401915 and i say this that christianity has been an overwhelming force for good in the world
401916 by promoting natural family planning and female education we have curbed population growth to 2 04 percent during our administration down from 2 36 percent in the 1990s when artificial birth control was pushed our campaign spreads awareness of responsible parenthood regarding birth spacing long years pushing contraception made it synonymous to family planning therefore informed choice should mean letting more couples who are mostly catholic know about natural family planning
401917 if there is discipline in marital bed there is discipline in the streets there is discipline in schools there is discipline in government said the archbishop
401918 when a filipino husband comes home frustrated tired drunk in bed with his wife she hasnt got a chance to check her calendar if it is a bad day
401919 the population policy of this government is clearly flawed because of the undue subservience of president gloria to catholic bishops
401920 basically arguing that resorting to artificial means of family planning as opposed to natural methods is abortion is completely wrong
401921 we should respect all of them because what were trying to protect is the quality of life of the filipino family and it has to be moderated in terms of numbers
401922 since you have a growing number of people to take care of shouldnt it be logical and reasonable to include that factor in our national planning
401923 while the bible tells mankind to multiply it has specific instructions for humanity to care and protect all of the creation the board of the philippines council of evangelical churches pcec said in a statement released on the weekend
401924 one doesnt have to be an economist to tally how much more food water shelter medicine and other resources will be needed for their support
401925 the present uncontrolled population growth over these many years has undeniably contributed to and accelerated the poor getting poorer and has led to thousands of abortions unnecessary maternal deaths abandoned children increase of street dwellers
401926 the problem of population growth is the problem of poverty
401927 dont blame population growth for poverty the problem is disparities in the income levels
401928 why not address the issue of how many calories of food are wasted by the rich how much energy is wasted by the rich world
401929 they the rich are becoming greedier and greedier and dont want to change lifestyles the debate therefore is more an issue of morality disparity and inequity the debate should focus on asset reform how much is too much and not manipulating population the priest argued
401930 i took the pill and later injectables after having the fifth child the catholic told ips
401931 if i cant take contraception i will give birth to more children
401932 it will be a sin to give birth to more children and not be able to support them as they grow up and give them a good life
401933 issue advocacy conveys information and educates an issue ads impact on an election if it exists at all will come only after the voters hear the information and choose uninvited by the ad to factor it into their voting decisions
401934 issue advocacy cannot be regulated by the fec and groups that engage in it cannot constitutionally be required to register as federal pacs
401935 the fecs enforcement actions arising out of the 2004 election were outrageously unconstitutional and we hope that this lawsuit will to put a stop to a repeat in 2008
401936 instead the fec plans to use its complicated pac enforcement policy developed in 2004 to punish groups for engaging in issue advocacy
401937 this is unconstitutional and we hope the federal courts will put an end to it
401938 the fec pursued these organizations claiming that they should have registered with the fec as a federal pac and be subject to all their issues and restrictions
401939 they were able to coerce many of these organizations into paying heavy fines
401940 rather than risk an enforcement action they have decided to bring suit so they can get a federal injunction
401941 anything that they would do to pursue even funding for this project would be illegal under the fecs unconstitutional enforcement policy
401942 they dont want to be violating any law they chose to go to court to determine whether the fecs rules are lawful or not
401943 obama voted for or against this bill hes in favor of partial birth abortion hes in favor of federally funding for abortion in the united states thats just talking about an issue
401944 they would regulate groups that engage in issue advocacy by requiring them to be a federal pac subject to very extensive requirements and restrictions
401945 if this group started talking about obamas radical pro abortion position then they would be punished by the fec and they dont think its lawful for them to be punished
401946 we wish this wasnt the big issue because there are bigger ones but we cant now avoid it
401947 confidence in the validity of the anglican communion is severely damaged
401948 bishops cannot be a symbol of unity when their consecration itself divided the church
401949 the holy father spends his days in prayer rest study and playing the piano
401950 only his walks in the garden and the piano interrupt his intellectual activities
401951 the church of rome is fearful that it could lose more priests like us
401952 and it should be afraid given its level of scandal over internal abuses and hypocrisy in combating poverty
401953 what they want to do is put an end to the catholic church but they have not succeeded
401954 they get dressed up as priests conduct baptisms and confirmations all paid for by the government while the people go hungry
401955 i share the revolutionary project of president ch vez since it is a socialist and humanist project for the masses
401956 ch vez is carrying out the work of god and i hope our priests here do the same
401957 the old catholic church claims to work on behalf of the needy but what have they done for us in all these centuries
401958 this is yet another poke in the eye to the venezuelan catholic church
401959 the roman catholic authorities decided the best way to belittle them is to claim some sort of link to ch vez
401960 but we are not homophobes since our services are open to anyone
401961 a kind of chicken soup a tossed salad something that will not have any internal coherence
401962 but we just happen to share many of the same ideas as our president
401963 id say that 50 percent of catholic priests in venezuela secretly have wives
401964 it is our quest to free the poor from the yoke of others while having a fulfilling life of our own
401965 we believed in slavery for 18 and a half centuries before we came to know gods will for us with respect to people of colour
401966 it has been more painful than i thought it might be
401967 ive felt the exclusion profoundly i understand thats just the way it has to be but its a very odd and difficult feeling to have been separated from your own house of bishops by an external force
401968 as a constant and steady reminder that every bishop in the anglican communion has gay and lesbian people in their diocese whether they know it or not whether they know who they are or not whether it homosexuality is legal or not
401969 i dont consider them enemies at all and its no surprise to me that people who live in contexts very different from our own in the united states see this problem very differently
401970 its no surprise that many of these bishops and people in these countries where homosexuality is publishable sometimes by imprisonment have not had the experience we have had in the american church which is of faithful lesbian and gay people in the pews making themselves known to us and our having to grapple with that issue
401971 that doesnt mean i dont believe we shouldnt be changing those attitudes
401972 resist the push by those who are not here to try and settle this once and for all because in the end i think we will come to regret our rejection of gay and lesbian people the way we have come to regret our support for slavery and our virtual rejection of women
401973 the beauty of anglicanism is that it has been a big umbrella under which we can disagree about many things so long as we agree on the essentials
401974 i would plead for a continuation of that great tradition in which we hold together and we continue to be the church despite our differences on this issue because i dont think it rises to the level of being an essential
401975 you dont hear anyone on the side of those who would argue for greater inclusion of gay and lesbian people argue that anyone else has to leave no one is saying that the conservatives within the communion should leave because they dont understand the will of god
401976 that is what you hear coming from the other side and the difficulty of course is that you cant make anyone stay i would make a plea for our holding together while we live in this tension for a while
401977 we have no parishes threatening to break away i might even say its the one diocese in the whole of the anglican communion that doesnt deal with this issue at all
401978 i will be so glad to return home and not have to talk about being gay or gay and lesbian issues
401979 because mercifully in my own diocese im just the bishop im not the gay bishop
401980 we have 700 men here do you think any of them beat their wives chances are they do
401981 the most devout christians beat their wives many of our bishops come from places where it is culturally accepted to beat your wife in that regard it makes conversation difficult
401982 it was quite clear we were being guided to a foregone conclusion
401983 why have you separated us if we cannot discuss such things in a safe place like this where can we discuss them the answer was because for some of the women present this isnt as safe a place as you might think evidently this had been determined before the meeting began
401984 i have never beaten my wife although i cant talk about other people
401985 alienates anglicans from the orthodox church and contributes to further division of the christian world
401986 such a practice contradicts centuries old church traditions dating back to the first christian community orthodox christians consider women bishops to be even more unacceptable
401987 special blessing to lead the people of god and a special responsibility to maintain the purity of the faith and be symbols and guarantors of the churchs unity
401988 in our view the decision of the general synod of the church of england
401989 not dictated by theological or practical church needs but by a tendency to follow the secular idea of sexual equality in all spheres of life
401990 the ordination of women to the episcopate effectively and definitively blocks a possible recognition of anglican orders by the catholic church
401991 the constitution prohibits school districts from adopting policies that disfavor religion contrary to popular myth our constitution does not require complete separation of church and state it affirmatively mandates accommodation not merely tolerance of all religions and forbids hostility toward any
401992 most of the assets of the church of england in terms of buildings schools and other property either come from the pre reformation catholic church or as a direct result of the tractarian and catholic revival
401993 this property is very much our heritage and inheritance and to suggest that many wish to steal it from us in a very unpleasant form of legalised theft would not be an understatement
401994 i do wonder if this would stand in the european court
401995 it is quite apparent that we are being subjected to what i would call institutional bullying of a kind that if it were found in the commercial world would be the subject of serious litigation
401996 the atmosphere and the approach of some of those opposed to us reveals that not only are they not very good christians they are also not nice human beings
401997 the issue of homosexuality comes down to an issue about the bible
401998 underneath all the discussions and debates is how do we view the bible
401999 living under scripture the bishop and the bible in mission
402000 everyone in the anglican communion has their own process of making sense of the bible people who claim that their way of making sense is taking the bible more seriously than someone else are just trying to talk more loudly or stamp their foot more firmly
402001 is there such a thing as homosexuality in the ancient world did it exist then
402002 what you think is important in your context shapes the way you see scripture
402003 are understanding the bible in a very different way from that in which the rest of us think that it asks to be understood
402004 god uses language to tell us things and the bible is the language that hes used
402005 the bible is personal communication from the creator to us creatures and in personal communication you speak and write to be understood you dont communicate in code you dont say one thing in a way which is intended to be understood as meaning its opposite
402006 god is we believe straight forward the bible in that sense is straight forward and paul in 1st corinthians is straight forward
402007 whats the high common ground when we approach the bible
402008 amends the california constitution to provide that only marriage between a man and a woman is valid or recognized in california
402009 changes california constitution to eliminate right of same sex couples to marry provides that only a marriage between a man and a woman is valid or recognized in california
402010 revenue loss mainly sales taxes totaling in the several tens of millions of dollars to state and local governments
402011 what proposition 8 would do is eliminate the right of same sex couples to marry which is exactly what the attorney general put in the title of the measure
402012 we feel the ballot language is so inflammatory that it will unduly prejudice voters against the measure
402013 proposition 8 simply seeks to restore the definition of marriage back to its original meaning of the previous 158 years of california statehood
402014 at the end of the day it should be the people of california not the attorney general who decides what their opinion of a ballot measure is
402015 in each case one would have to look at the social political economic cultural and religious factors that relate to the vocational statistics
402016 other influencing factors have to do with the experience of the local church as for example the fact that a religious congregation moves its centers of formation from one country to another which increases or decreases the number of seminarians in each one a quantitative study is not sufficient
402017 i would like to invite the holy father to visit our country following in the footsteps of st paul
402018 i am available for a meeting at the vatican i would like to see him one on one to plan the visit together
402019 there is a dialogue and between religions and intellectuals there are always discussions

402035 ein bericht ber die unm glichkeit der sonate in form einer sonate
402036 eine erz hlung dar ber wie schwierig und unm glich es ist diesen film zumachen so hnlich war f r mich dieses st ck
402037 die zweite violinsonate ist ein buntes ineinander von klassischem und barockem atonalem tango und walzer
402038 immer wieder haben sich die kommentare zu schnittkes werken darin ersch pft seine verwendeten materialien aufzuz hlen seine corelli bach mahler br ckner ives schostakowitsch reminiszenzen offenzulegen
402039 i had hoped for it but i still want to see some more races
402040 i am very confident that he has overcome the weak period but you dont get into this within a week and you dont get out of it within a week
402041 so he has to work systematically and he is working systematically and i am confident he will get back to full performance and full confidence
402042 the ratio of reflection in the paint will be a bit higher than the current one
402043 the paint used will be different it will be similar to what is used on the white lines on the road which reflect a lot we will use those ingredients
402044 it could be the sidewall but with the super soft soft medium and hard tyres so four different types of sidewall it is very difficult
402045 we are still trying things on the machine at the moment so in september we will decide the final design
402046 it is not totally sure but ferrari could be very gentle for the tyres and the mclaren a little bit aggressive for their tyres
402047 so mclaren could generate the proper temperatures for the tyre under those conditions
402048 if it had been hot then maybe mclaren would have faced overheating with their tyres and ferrari could have got the proper conditions for them
402049 i think the last race for us was very difficult for finding the good grip from the tyres but we were not the only team most of the drivers were having during the race mainly a lot of problems to find grip
402050 the tyres were very very hard probably too hard for that kind of circuit especially the hard tyre there was no wear at all the tyre just was not working for that kind of circuit this was valid for us and it was valid as well for most of the teams
402051 of course after the race we can comment very easily this compound was a little bit too hard but nobody could predict the actual weather because we faced many times very very hot conditions at hockenheim and then we had many troubles
402052 sometimes we could not find the root cause sometimes we could so we decided to choose the compound for hockenheim with a little bit of a conservative choice
402053 the conditions at hockenheim were a little bit cooler than usual so if we think about that our choice could have been a little conservative
402054 aanvankelijk konden we niet aan zijn eisen voldoen maar na een lang gesprek bereikten we toch een akkoord met vladan we zijn blij dat we iemand met zo een mooi palmares konden strikken

402080 should not play with fire because they could get their fingers scorched
402081 it was raining and she was going too fast for conditions
402082 all this applies to the church as a specific organization living in the world
402083 moreover a christian has the duty to be active in society to move forward and up to the full measure of his strength and to live according to his convictions with such an intensity that other people who are strangers to these convictions can get to know them to share in them to come alive in their turn
402084 each christian has the duty to be fully responsible for the condition of the world which surrounds him and has the duty to demand if only of himself an active and effective participation in the life of his society in the husbandry of our environment
402085 upp till kamp s nger f r arbete frihet och fred
402086 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
402087 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
402088 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
402089 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
402090 your father abraham rejoiced that he was to see my day he saw it and was glad
402091 you are not yet fifty years old and have you seen abraham
402092 truly truly i say to you before abraham was i am
402093 you are not yet fifty years old and have you seen abraham
402094 is not to decide whether or not i will be in relationship with you but to realize that i am in communion with you my life is yours and your life is mine without this there is no way that we are going to be able to carry on
402095 one should not focus on the deadline too much what matters is that we get a clear answer quickly its not a matter of one day
402096 the sisterhood of the traveling pants 2 world premiere in new york city
402097 we have atheists and satanists getting the bibles ten commandments removed from public property
402098 yet the satanic georgia guidestones have stood for decades and nobody seems to care well we do
402099 maintain humanity under 500 million in perpetual balance with nature
402100 regardless of anyones religion i think they would find it objectionable that theres this monument that calls for the elimination of over 90 percent of the worlds population
402101 they told me that on halloween people party out there and often leave their occult regalia behind during certain solstices pagan groups use it
402102 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
402103 nos encanta venir aqu le dijeron esta ciudad cuando cae la noche parece un espejismo junto al r o

402106 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
402107 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
402108 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
402109 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
402110 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
402111 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation

402117 if we can do something about the pain at the pump the obvious question is why arent we
402118 skyrocketing gas prices is the most important issue on the minds of my constituents in georgia and all over the country
402119 there are several issues that need to be addressed with respect to the issue of skyrocketing gas prices
402120 supply and demand dictates the price of everything in our economy weve got to have the capability of providing the kind of supply that is demanded by americans
402121 weve got to continue down the road of researching and developing more alternative fuels
402122 weve also got to implement conservation practices from an individual and household standpoint
402123 another common sense solution republicans have offered and ive supported is an immediate federal gas tax holiday
402124 if we can do something about the pain at the pump the obvious question is why arent we
402125 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
402126 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
402127 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment

402131 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
402132 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
402133 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
402134 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
402135 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
402136 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
402137 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
402138 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
402139 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
402140 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
402141 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
402142 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
402143 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
402144 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
402145 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
402146 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
402147 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
402148 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
402149 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
402150 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
402151 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
402152 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
402153 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
402154 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
402155 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
402156 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
402157 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
402158 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
402159 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
402160 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
402161 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
402162 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
402163 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
402164 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
402165 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
402166 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
402167 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
402168 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
402169 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
402170 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
402171 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
402172 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
402173 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
402174 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
402175 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
402176 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
402177 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
402178 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
402179 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
402180 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
402181 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
402182 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
402183 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
402184 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
402185 who are open to doing something on the production side
402186 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
402187 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
402188 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
402189 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
402190 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
402191 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
402192 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
402193 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
402194 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
402195 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
402196 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
402197 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
402198 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
402199 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough

402202 most everyone was on a steady diet of ibuprofen and there were a lot of knee braces and back braces
402203 i realized this man really had a kind heart and a kind soul
402204 i nudged the guy next to me and said hey look its dede she looks exactly the same
402205 it was like the best thing that ever happened to you in your life
402206 you get goose bumps thinking about it and your heart has this feeling of wanting to burst
402207 if there is anyone present that has just cause why this couple should not be united
402208 i had come to the realization that i would likely spend the rest of my days without that special person in my life
402209 if anyone ever asked me what part of my life you are i would just have to look at them and smile and say the best part

402227 the deterioration of every government begins with the decay of the principle upon which it was founded
402228 in 1998 1999 trials anwar experienced the phenomenon of fabrication of dna evidence we had sac rodwan illegally removing dna samples from forensic custody in cross examination of the prosecutions witnesses it was exposed that dna taken from blood samples was planted on the infamous mattress
402229 when confronted with this fact the prosecution amended its charge and persuaded the judge augustine paul to expunge the entire dna evidence from the record preventing anwars lawyers from responding

402237 its hard enough for a government analyst to tell it like it is and be just one step removed from the president

402245 the issue of sexual harassment has become less taboo recently in the egyptian media within academic circles and has even become a part of daily discourse among women in egyptian society regardless of social or economic status or political belief
402246 men and women are getting married later so obviously men and women are both sexually frustrated but women have no way of showing their sexual frustration
402247 a combination of religion and politics tells young men and women that unless a woman is covered up she is fair game and now men enact their sexual frustration on women without any sense of shame
402248 the notion of blaming ones leader for the death of a family or community member from a terrorist attack or war might seem odd at first but a personal tie to a victim converts abstract distant costs of international violence into a vivid personal and profoundly emotional experience one that has clear strong and consistent political implications
402249 we can confirm that the minister had a private meeting with the ulster political research group uprg and other leading loyalists
402250 we can confirm the security minister held a meeting with the uprg and other leading loyalists which the chief constable was invited to attend
402251 the window of opportunity for loyalists to comply with decommissioning has closed
402252 however what is unacceptable and quite shocking is his attitude to going and recovering these weapons
402253 it is the function of the psni to recover these guns the purpose of these weapons is to attack catholics and protect organised crime rackets indeed last year in carrickfergus these very weapons were used to attack the psni
402254 many people from across society will be angered by the comments made by mr sheridan and the position adopted by the psni in recovering loyalist weapons to most people it is very simple if you know where these weapons are then go and get them

402323 se il pd non vuole ritrovarsi nei prossimi anni in una condizione stabilmente minoritaria deve mettere in discussione assunti considerati intoccabili definendo la propria identit e la propria agenda con coraggio
402324 sulla nostra agenda gli italiani devono discutere litigare se necessario
402325 su questi temi siamo troppo sbrigativi certo pi facile staccare la spina si fa prima molto pi complicato doloroso e faticoso invece gestire e assicurare unassistenza continua ai malati affrontare problemi spinosi e confrontarsi con la sofferenza durante la vita e anche alsuo punto estremo senza facili scorciatoie
402326 i voti che mi sono mancati afferma erano in parte quelli della sinistra radicale sia come conseguenza del tracollo della sinistra arcobaleno sia per lostilit verso un candidato visto come troppo moderato e in parte erano i voti dellarea dipietrista direi persino indipendentemente dalla volont dei dirigenti
402327 nei prossimi anni avremo una radicalizzazione a sinistra con rifondazione comunista e le altre forze che si metteranno in competizione in quellarea che per un tempo non breve sembrano decise a disinteressarsi di una prospettiva di governo e con unaltra componente litalia dei valori quella cio che abbiamo scelto come nostro unico alleato che sembra interessatissima a collocarsi in una posizione concorrenziale con il pd
402328 tutto questo ci dice che i voti ce li dobbiamo andare a prendere nel vasto pelago del popolo che ha votato centrodestra

402342 what prompted me to sell was my need to do more international service and the fact that i was getting tired and not paying as much attention as i should have been to the business

402352 union leadership did request and receive eid al fitr which is apparently spelled various ways including id al fitr and eid ul fitr as a paid holiday in place of labor day
402353 since all team members will still have eight paid holidays the change will not affect production

402376 this is the first evidence that myostatin regulates muscle mass in people as it does in other animals
402377 that gives us a great deal of hope that agents already known to block myostatin activity in mice may be able to increase muscle mass in humans too
402378 the mutation caused the genes message the messenger rna to be wrong
402379 if the message had been used to make a protein it would be much shorter than it should be but we think the process doesnt even get that far instead the cells just destroy the message
402380 both copies of the childs myostatin gene have this mutation so little if any of the myostatin protein is made
402381 as a result he has about twice the muscle mass of other children

402399 but no one denies that it is individuals who make choices
402400 nothing is wrong and nothing is anyones fault it is always someone elses
402401 every course of action is justifiable since the actor must either be a free agent whose choice should be respected or a victim of constraint whose lack of freedom should be pitied

402406 a 100 years ago we had a working class now we have an upper middle and lower middle class and an underclass the stratification of society is nearly complete
402407 government figures show only 15 of white working class boys in england got five good gcses including maths and english last year poorer pupils from indian and chinese backgrounds fared much better with 36 and 52 making that grade respectively
402408 white working class pupils are the lowest achieving group in english schools because they have low aspirations and do not do their homework an official study shows
402409 the issue here is not left vs right its science vs ego
402410 a 100 years ago we had a working class now we have an upper middle and lower middle class and an underclass the stratification of society is nearly complete

402413 the figures for economics a level students have been in a prolonged downturn down by more than a quarter between 1996 and 2006 to about 17 000 with the subject overtaken by a range of other subjects that have become much more popular
402414 there are three times as many pupils taking psychology a level as economics and almost twice as many taking a level media studies sport and physical exercise and the expressive arts are now bigger subjects at a level than economics

402423 last year 2004 a report from the organisation for economic cooperation and development oecd revealed that britain came seventh from bottom in a league table of staying on rates in education and training for 19 countries only mexico and turkey had significantly lower rates of participation for this age group italy new zealand portugal and slovakia have marginally lower rates

402425 puts the final nail in the coffin of gordon browns reputation for economic competence
402426 this is because government borrowing is by identity the counterpart of private saving the government is borrowing a lot because companies and overseas residents mostly in asia are saving so much

402428 mayor of london boris johnson is increasing the living wage for london to 7 45 per hour

402438 local residents can expect a reduction in the number of daytime break ins following joeys death
402439 it finds that people do indeed fully adapt to both marriage and the birth of a child they get happier as these events draw nearer but less happy afterwards
402440 it might have something to do with the fact that speaking as a parent when i look at the behavior of the people i know i end up concluding that those without children havent really become adults yet by which i mean that they have yet to learn the meaning of the word responsibility they dont understand the interdependence of human life
402441 the world is awash in a sea of problems most of which are caused by overpopulation the breeders are constantly whining about how the rest of us should pay for their kids and yet it us without kids who are the irresponsible ones

402443 it shows that workers bargaining power is weak thanks in part to the entry into the global labour market of billions of chinese and indian workers the oprw has fallen pretty consistently since 2003

402445 if i gave the labour party 30 000 worth of leaflets it would be a donation just as if they printed off 30 000 worth and sent me the bill and i paid it that would be a donation
402446 i really dont see the difference between them sending a bill to me or getting the leaflets from me and them sending the bill to the parliamentary service or getting the leaflets from the parliamentary service

402454 olaf believes there are influential forces in the bulgarian government and or the bulgarian state services which have no interest in the punishment of any person from the nikolov stoykov group
402455 a criminal network of companies which includes more than 50 bulgarian european and offshore firms
402456 this network is managed and financed by nikolov and stoykov who are said to have close relations with the present bulgarian government one of them has allegedly funded the election campaign of the current bulgarian president and is a business partner of a former deputy minister of foreign affairs who has tried to influence an investigation in progress against this person
402457 i am amazed about the statements regarding 50 companies since i participate only in one company
402458 this is a political process i believe that some political forces are trying to attack the president who is not at all involved if i was under a state cover up why have i been detained without any proof why i am involved in this scandal

402470 i went to a meeting with dai young and warren gatland and we spoke about me moving to tighthead
402471 i have had limited opportunities at loosehead with gethin and the other good players in wales so we decided i should have a go on the other side of the scrum
402472 so i will start the season at tighthead and see how it goes it gives me a lot of confidence when people like dai and warren ask me to do something and believe i can succeed
402473 hopefully i can prove them right for the blues and wales
402474 a lot of people assume it would be easy to change over but it is a completely different position
402475 the scrummaging positions and techniques are a lot different and there are a lot of new things to learn
402476 opposition front rows tend to target the tighthead and that is something i am going to have to cope with
402477 it felt very strange at first in the opening couple of games

402484 its a good opportunity to provide people with insight into what goes on here what were doing why were doing it and how were doing it
402485 this is a lot more creative than what were used to
402486 a lot of diplomacy has to be conducted behind closed doors
402487 the challenge we face is striking a balance between having informed and interesting comment and giving diplomacy the space it needs diplomacy is not transparent by nature blogs are
402488 we want to break through some of the opacity that surrounds this business
402489 were never going to completely do away with that but we want to make the process policies and the state department itself more transparent

402499 also we were told by wac commissioner karl benson that the tournament has already been awarded to us this year if we want to keep it theyre not going to pull it hopefully thats the way it will stay
402500 its a complicated environmental review and we have to make sure we do it right its a top priority at the agency
402501 clearly theres not been strong enough project management on this
402502 it seems it has not been given the priority that they assured us in december that it would have
402503 the reason i did this is that the mayors office did not consult with any members of the board whose district was affected
402504 there are approved ways to go about this and build consensus and get input and gauge what the traffic and economic impacts with be

402522 the four secrets to speaking with experts in the room
402523 when people are made to be self aware they are likelier to stop and think about what they are doing
402524 a byproduct of that awareness may be a shift away from acting on autopilot toward more desirable ways of behaving
402525 of course youre going to be persuaded by what other people have done
402526 jerry i have already accepted jesus christ as my lord and savior he is my only hope now i surrendered my life to him and i am very much at peace with him you will be surprised that i also talked to the devil i told the devil that he may make me suffer he make take my body and strength away but one things for sure the devil cannot take away my spirit and my soul for i have given and committed it to my one and only true god jesus christ
402527 lord what went wrong how come my prayers were unanswered i prayed hard day and night asking only one thing save my angel eva heal her totally and bring her back to normal i gave and surrendered my life to you committed to serve you in whatever way you want me to serve you begged you for mercy and grace why did you allow this to happen why take away the most important lady of my life
402528 my son not only did i healed eva but i also healed you and your family you asked and prayed for her physical healing i gave eva you and your family spiritual healing physical healing is temporary spiritual healing is permanent and eternal
402529 you asked me why i took eva from you yes i did for her purpose in life has been accomplished she has brought you back to me and that was all she wanted and i am giving her her reward and that is to be with me in paradise
402530 but didnt you realize that while i took eva away from you i also gave you three evas you have your three daughters with you and eva is inside the three of them
402531 i gave you five months to show eva how much you love her care for her and how much she means to you all this time you thought you were treating her did it ever occurred to you that she was actually the one treating you
402532 all your treatment failed but look at your family now i am now at the center of your family and i am now residing inside you and your families heart

402883 some people were puking some people were crying other people were in shock
402884 then he tried to drive off but the bus driver disabled the bus somehow from the back im not sure how he did it and at that point i think the police showed up
402885 we were watching zorro the next thing i know i hear someone screaming
402886 some people were puking some people were crying other people were in shock everybody was running screaming off the bus
402887 by the time the police had arrived the driver and the remaining passengers had all safely exited the bus
402888 at 1 28 am the suspect attempted to jump out of the bus after breaking a window he was immediately subdued and arrested without incident and is currently in custody

402890 they would like to say they miss him and he will always be in their hearts
402891 we are really delighted we finally have justice i want to thank everybody who has supported us throughout these years

402896 i would be surprised if there was not a claim for compensation for the eight years of suffering plans are already afoot
402897 we are disappointed by todays verdict but especially disappointed for jills family and friends however we respect the decision of the court the investigation into her murder was complex thorough and professional with more than 2 500 statements taken and 3 700 exhibits recovered we would like to thank the members of public who came forward following the murder to give us information in particular those that gave evidence in court

402899 it is most unlikely that we will be able to get lugovoi but we can try to make sure that we dont have another litvinenko
402900 send a strong message that this kind of thing will not be tolerated
402901 litvinenko was a former member of the fsb and he became a very unpopular man i assume as a result of that his death was either officially sanctioned or that some faction or other of the fsb tried to get him
402902 if he litvinenko had drunk the whole cup of tea he would have died instantly it is only because he sipped it that he lingered and polonium was detected
402903 we will see a number of failures as there are quite a lot of weak carriers that will not survive we are in the worst trading environment the industry has ever faced

402943 the guitars travel well they sound amazing great tone playability and they look incredible
402944 pink slips have already been sent out to teachers and county workers and unless congress acts quickly these devastating losses to the very fabric of rural communities would become permanent
402945 were hoping that maybe just before the election someone will want to take credit for doing something good
402946 this congress has not been in my opinion terribly functional in the last year and a half and were caught in the crossfire like a lot of other programs
402947 i have two counties curry and josephine where the commissioners have had discussions about dissolution
402948 theyre saying that with their existing resources they cant meet state minimums even with dramatic cuts

402963 all the hardships he has gone through since he has come back but he has played some terrific football peake said
402964 what it means to me is a pretty big thing but all the guys know deep down we have to go out there and win for shaun and nothing else
402965 there have been high expectations of us this season but we have failed to live up to them he said
402966 the least we can do is send shaun off in the right way and have a good win for him because he deserves it

403022 the prospect of having to face papi and manny back to back in the bottom on the 9th inning with the season on the line is gone
403023 who does allow you to call me uncle eh im still young
403024 do you want to wear the blue shirt or the green one
403025 which book shall we read before bed this one or that one
403026 im so angry about what has happened to me i try and tell people about being charged for bed and board in jail and they cant believe it
403027 when i left prison i was given no training for freedom amp no counselling or psychological preparation yet the guilty get that when they are released to charge me for the food i ate and the cell i slept in is almost as big an injustice as fitting me up in the first place
403028 while i was in prison my family lost their home yet they get no compensation but the state wants its money back its like being kicked in the head when someone has beat you already
403029 i have to put up with this yet there has not been one police officer convicted of fitting people up the home office had no shortage of money to keep me in jail or to run a charade of a trial
403030 but they had enough money to frame me nevertheless when it comes to paying out compensation for ruining my life they happily rip me to shreds
403031 the establishment hate me and people like me as we proved them wrong
403032 morally the position of the government is just outrageous it shows total contempt for the victims of miscarriages of justice it makes me livid
403033 i really believe if we win the appeal this week the government is evil enough to take me to the house of lords they are trying to break us i really think this is personal as far as the government is concerned
403034 a government really cant get much worse than this but i am confident that we will win as the law and morality are on our side
403035 if i had known this i would have stayed on hunger strike longer that way i would have had a smaller bill
403036 this is reprehensible how can we call ourselves a democratic civilised society when our government is acting like this
403037 the government seems intent on punishing innocent people the state wants to be paid for making a mistake its hard to believe someone actually thought this policy up if you tell a child about this they will think it insane
403038 only a sick mind could have invented this policy yet the government is fighting to retain the right to act like this it is cruelty with intent they seem to want to punish people for having the audacity to be innocent
403039 this is outrageous it is another assault by blunkett on the rule of law and on civil liberties these people didnt chose to go to prison they were wrongly convicted and to charge them for it beggars belief
403040 independent assessor appointed by the home secretary takes into acccount the range of costs the prisoner might have incurred had they not been imprisoned
403041 ive tried to maintain my dignity but the state has treated me with nothing but contempt amp now they are asking me for money for my bed and board in jail
403042 i never contemplated suicide once while i was in prison but its different on the outside i have received no counselling or support society is treating me like something youd wipe off the bottom of your shoes but im an innocent man and a victim of a terrible injustice
403043 its horrific ive been out of jail for 14 months and in that time the state has put me through a war of attrition that it never needed to conduct i feel my life is disintegrating around me
403044 making me pay for my bed and board is abhorrent
403045 yong six months na nabakasyon ako from tv work ano yon e it was very humbling na parang ika nga sa ploning e hindi ibibigay sa yo hanggat hindi handa yong puso mo parang sa akin the way i see it yong six months na wala akong show it was a very humbling part on my end na parang sinabi ng diyos kasi na siguro kung ibinigay niya sa akin to nung january malamang hindi ko ma handle baka lumaki ulo ko
403046 pero it really gave me the opportunity to find out yong mga totoo kong kaibigan and i got to spend time with them and i saw how my family stood by me tapos si juday nandiyan through thick and thin
403047 kami ni juday weve never been apart for more than a week since weve been together buti na nga lang nakapagpondo kami ng six months na constant we were together so at least itong isang buwan may pagkakataon namin ma miss ang isat isa
403048 hinahanda namin ang sarili namin for that kasi matagal e usually kahit nag a amerika siya o nag a amerika ako noon in six days nakabalik na e talagang gagawin lang namin yong trabaho tapos balik na dito sa pilipinas
403049 wala akong kasamang barkada yon yung mahirap kasi usually kahit wala si juday noon at least kasama ko ang mga barkada ko or yong family ko ito lahat sila maiiwan ko dito sa pilipinas

403097 this post is for you mate i must confess i was a little agitated with what appears to be a lack of understanding on soes part about the greatness of faction so heres my take on it
403098 let this be a message to all evildoers have no place in the fair city of qeynos
403099 n o existe um modelo espec fico e nem mesmo a beleza t o relevante o que realmente conta s o as facadas
403100 a expectativa o maior impedimento para viver que fica ligada no amanh e perde o hoje

403102 i should be dead i was positive i would be killed in that drive
403103 henri paul almost killed us honest to god he was driving way too fast and recklessly and i was saying slow down slow down but nobodys listening and nobodys doing anything
403104 im like were all going to get killed dodys people all get killed
403105 we went down the freeway and he was still driving crazily and i still dont understand what we were trying to outrun i couldnt see any motorcycles
403106 he was driving like a maniac through the traffic he drove from the left hand lane all the way across the freeway to the offside ramp and the range rover almost tipped over and i was sure we were all going to die
403107 the bottom line is that with all due respect to him he was probably a really nice man but he was s for a driver and that is a fact
403108 i saw two people who were smitten with each other
403109 i would say to dodi you cannot take off without your bodyguards they are here to look after diana
403110 he looked at me as if to say that he did not understand that there could be any danger
403111 neither dodi or diana were listening to their advice she knew their needs better than we did
403112 when mohammed would call diana would say god is calling and they would giggle
403113 pretty much sums it up perfectly i too camped lodizal as stormfeather too and hadden etc
403114 one of the key outcomes of this review is to ensure that the future service provided for children and young people equals comparable european countries
403115 there are real challenges currently in ensuring that children can access the full range of clinical trials available this is likely to continue unless the service is developed appropriately
403116 level 3 services performing a number of procedures including chemotherapy and some diagnosis of common cancers
403117 level 4 service which includes all level 3 services plus childrens brain tumour treatment academic training diagnosis and early clinical trials of new drugs
403118 this means patients will have to travel further and scotlands geography makes this particularly difficult the prospect for families in aberdeen having to travel to edinburgh or glasgow hardly bears thinking about children with serious brain tumours might have to spend a considerable time a long way from home and if parents have other children to look after or jobs that they depend on it makes it extremely difficult
403119 any attack on the services provided in aberdeen is an attack on the whole system there is no case to centralise services like this and it is simply not acceptable to centralise services to two cities in the central belt
403120 we currently do clinical trials and paediatric neurology and we will continue to do so we believe we would provide the same level of service
403121 we await with interest the outcomes of the ongoing national reviews which we know are intended to ensure best care for children with cancer across scotland
403122 the report on childrens cancer services will feed into the national delivery plan for specialist childrens services which will be consulted on in the new year
403123 the evidence demonstrated that his co defendant radler was calling as many shots and directing where the money was going
403124 one aspect is psychological you were the ceo and now you are taking orders from a corrections officer who but for the prison would be a dairy farmer its an extreme adjustment
403125 its a very difficult adjustment for family members as well because telephone calls you can recieve are limited
403126 have a glass or two of good french white wine
403127 there are going to be people who are like himself white collar criminals you are going to have child pornography offenders both touch and pictures
403128 the murderers and the rapists are mostly in medium security facilities and up but you are going to have mafia figures you are going to have drug offenders
403129 the worst that will happen is that inmates will want to barter for services
403130 they will come to him and say i will make your bed every day and keep your area clean if you put money in my commissary each month or i have a smuggled cell phone and you can use the extra time on it
403131 milibands problem was that he came down on his own and didnt actually have anyone to shake hands with
403132 with the stage empty after he signed the only person whose hand he could find to shake was the european attendant who carries all the books and paperwork the chap looked utterly bemused
403133 i have got the advantage of being able to do both you i gather will not wish to join me
403134 gordon brown has left britain with the worst of all worlds today
403135 with a stroke of a pen he has signed away a swathe of powers to the eu but his sulky rudeness to our european partners means that he has actually managed to lose influence in brussels
403136 this latest blunder is another sign that gordon brown is struggling to cope as prime minister

403139 we are a bit disappointed that all the world is still waiting for the united states
403140 the u s has been using new words on this engagement leadership but words are not enough we need action thats the one main tlocking issue
403141 those who are suggesting that you can magically find agreement on a metric when you are just starting negotiations that in itself is a blocking element
403142 we will lead we will continue to lead but leadership also requires others to fall in line and follow
403143 we are in an all or nothing situation in that if we dont manage to get the work done on the future terms for negotiations then the whole house of cards basically falls to pieces
403144 bali is the beginning of the process it is not the end meaning what you dont get agreement on here you push it to poland and the negotiation will continue so if there is no agreement in bali it doesnt mean its a disaster
403145 gordon i think ive discovered a bit of a problem
403146 it takes us to questions about the prime ministers own integrity
403147 are people not rightly now asking is this man simply not cut out for the job
403148 the prime ministers remarkable transformation in the past few weeks from stalin to mr bean creating chaos out of order rather than order out of chaos
403149 within both the letter and the spirit of the law
403150 the public know sleeze when they see it the people know spin when they hear it and the voters will know what to do when they have their say they will get rid of this sleazy labour government
403151 you the prime minister and the labour party treasurer are like the three wise monkeys you see no evil hear no evil and speak no evil
403152 in respect of my deputy leadership campaign and donations to my deputy leadership campaign myself and my campaign team acted at all times in good faith we acted at all times within both the letter and the spirit of the law
403153 for the record there is repeated correspondence initiated by me personally dealing with the issue of permissibility and demonstrating my interest in ensuring that donations received were indeed permissible
403154 i have always believed politicians should have the highest standards of integrity
403155 it would be easy to quit but also wrong to give up this job in these circumstances would be also giving up my reputation for integrity and honesty and im not prepared to do that
403156 i have never sought to mislead i am not dishonest in any way my campaign did not set out to mislead anybody or break the rules
403157 i am delighted to say that she has got clear and overwhelming support within the group there was no dissent at all
403158 i will make an announcement about my political future later in the week
403159 how the labour party managed to get themselves in this mess is something i find difficult to understand
403160 i think what you have to say is that this has to be gross mismanagement
403161 just looking at it from afar who in their right mind is going to try and hide 950 i could possible understand if it was 9 500 or 95 000 or 950 000 but you just cant believe 950
403162 i find this very sad because i have known charlie gordon for a number of years and i have found him to be a very honourable and decent man charlie must have been misled or didnt do his homework
403163 we are a very private family and all of a sudden we are pushed into the limelight here for something thats completely innocent
403164 fortunately i have been exonerated completely by those that know all the facts and whilst i can live with this sort of thing i think its most unfair on my family and friends
403165 genuinely prepared to rejoin all party talks but only if they are prepared to take matters forward rather than returning to square one
403166 which for the first time would apply capping to trade union donations and genuine transparency to affiliation fee payments
403167 individuals have to have a real choice as to whether they pay the political levy and to which party they give the money
403168 this sensational poll shows that the people of scotland prefer the snp government in scotland over the labour government in london by an overwhelming margin of 5 to 1
403169 even a majority of labour voters prefer the scottish government to gordon browns beleaguered administration
403170 these figures are of huge significance it is clear that the minority snp government is thriving and delivering for the people while the london labour government is sinking fast in a sea of financial sleaze and internecine warfare
403171 i was informed by peter watt to whom i reported that this was an arrangement with david abrahams which was long standing and which was appropriately dealt with in relation to the partys reporting requirements
403172 he told me these donations fully complied with the law and i had no reason to doubt that information
403173 however i was unhappy with the arrangement whereby donations were taken through a third party and was determined it would not play a part in our future plans i was very concerned that these arrangements did not meet the strict transparency test that i wished to see in place
403174 i did not discuss this with the officers of the national executive committee or party leadership but i decided to tell mr abrahams that his method of contribution was unacceptable i had no intention of asking mr abrahams for donations and wanted to give him the courtesy of explaining this personally
403175 the letter is soliciting funding from me and i dont need a letter from anybody in the labour party to solicit donations because im a regular donor and they can rely on me when they need me
403176 the party is of course very appreciative of all the help and support you have given over many years at some point i would like to have the opportunity to talk to you personally about our plans
403177 as one of the partys strongest supporters it is only right that you are kept informed with what we are doing and the priorities that we are assigning to our resources any time that you are next in london i would very much like to meet to discuss this
403178 on september 3 he started employment in the labour party he has had absolutely no involvement in the donations that have been made
403179 these donations have been happening for a period of four years before he took office
403180 are you telling us that mr mendelsohn knew and did not tell either you or the police is that an acceptable situation
403181 mr mendelsohn says in his statement that he was led to understand by the general secretary of the party that this had been cleared with the ec executive committee
403182 he also says he was unhappy in principle with these arrangements and he had approached one of the people involved and was seeking a meeting to sort these things out
403183 but of course if anything untoward has happened in this respect that will be a matter for the inquiry and we will take whatever action is necessary to sort this out
403184 we have had 155 days of this government weve had disaster after disaster his excuses go from incompetence to complacency and there are questions about his integrity
403185 arent people rightly asking now is this man simply not cut out for the job
403186 they are using the existence of this inquiry to deflect any criticism coming at them
403187 that is gordon browns way of trying to ride the storm
403188 i do not know whether my campaign team contacted her or she was contacted by my campaign team
403189 a great example of a politician on top of his game
403190 my comments have been taken out of context i wrote them as a journalist in july and they do not reflect my own views
403191 mr yates support for the actions of the snp government is welcome before he goes the way of ms alexanders other spin doctors it sounds like he should check hes working for the right party
403192 understanding the influencing factors of global warming on venus could help us in mitigating the threat here on earth
403193 it is really surprising how un earth like venus is now
403194 it is now becoming clearer why the climate on venus is so very different from that on earth despite the planets themselves being very similar
403195 there are many common processes at work such as a carbon dioxide driven greenhouse effect volcanic activity and atmospheric erosion by solar particles and radiation on venus these have worked to virtually eliminate water from the planet while maintaining high levels of carbon dioxide while earth has retained much of its water and lost most of its atmospheric carbon dioxide
403196 in the light of the new data it is possible to construct a scenario in which the climates on venus and earth were very similar when they started out and then evolved to the state we see now like twins separated at birth billions of years ago there is even the possibility that venus would have been habitable
403197 it is possible that life could have developed long ago if venus was more earth like and had liquid water oceans in its early history as the data seems to indicate
403198 however even if life did develop i would be very surprised indeed if anything has survived in the present conditions
403199 i would certainly not say that we have evidence for life in the clouds merely that it cant be ruled out given what we know about the clouds and that there are some qualities of the clouds that could make them a viable habitat
403200 because venus is closer to the sun it was more susceptible to a runaway greenhouse than earth
403201 one of the evolutionary differences that has made venus the earths evil twin is that present day venus lacks a magnetic shield this means that its atmosphere feels the onslaught of the solar wind and cosmic radiation and has done for billions of years
403202 there may be as much lightning on venus as there is on earth
403203 it may be earths evil twin but it is in many respects earths twin
403204 it is worthwhile mentioning the amazing 3d images of the south polar vortex the fine details of clouds some very earth like and hazes precise wind measurements and the nicest views ever of the phenomena that make venus glow in space at infrared wavelengths
403205 the contribution of volcanoes to the atmosphere could be enormous not knowing leaves a huge hole in our understanding of the climate

403212 this legislation has indicated to investors that fannie and freddie are not implicitly guaranteed not explicitly guaranteed but were close to that point
403213 this is maybe the most taxpayer unfriendly legislation weve seen in the past decade
403214 congress ought to recognize that these firms are insolvent that it is allowing these firms to continue to exist as bastions of privilege financed by the taxpayer
403215 at some point were going to reach that inflection where the government is going to have to either guarantee explicitly or fannie and freddie are going to have be left to fend for themselves
403216 were getting to that point where a decision has to be made by washington
403217 we know in a crisis the federal reserve tap would be open
403218 w ere pretty sure that any bank holding as much of its own obligations as freddie would need to have a great deal more reserves in place to handle the resulting liquidity risk
403219 the numbers tell that freddie mac is continuing to provide critically needed liquidity and stability to the housing finance system during this time of crisis

403221 you have to look at companies with the greatest exposure to the highest risk assets which include construction loans and exotic mortgages
403222 the final nail in the coffin for any depository institution would be a funding crisis where it is unable to gather deposits at reasonable cost or wholesale funding markets are cut off
403223 the system is not anywhere near the danger that existed in the late 1980s and early 1990s despite all of the whining by public officials
403224 the fact that any expenditure under this bill would be subject to the debt limit is a cap in effect on the amount

403229 christs faithful have the right indeed at times the duty in keeping with their knowledge competence and position to manifest to the sacred pastors their views on matters which concern the good of the church they have the right also to make their views known to others of christs faithful but in doing so they must always respect the integrity of faith and morals show due reverence to the pastors and take into account both the common good and the dignity of individuals
403230 the catholic church is the only thing which saves a man from the degrading slavery of being a child of his age
403231 on the basis of the accumulation of the various testimonies and indirect evidence the international court of the nascent sanhedrin came to the conclusion that there were unnumbered cases of killing of innocent falun gong practitioners by agents of the chinese government perhaps also out of consideration of material benefits derived from organ harvesting
403232 if the human rights issues are not addressed before the olympic games begin we consider participation in them by athletes and by spectators and political leaders to be an indirect danger to world peace
403233 report into allegations of organ harvesting of falun gong practitioners in china
403234 as a jewish child growing up in the wake of the holocaust i made a vow to myself at the very young age of 13 that if it ever happened again i would do all i could to put a stop to it
403235 now as a human rights lawyer and legal participant in this case i thank the sanhedrin for finding the courage and wisdom to expose and condemn the crimes perpetrated by the chinese communist party against members of the falun gong faith in china
403236 not only as an objective judge but at the same time as attorney for the side which is absent
403237 assure the minimum of liberties as indicated by the seven noahide commandments
403238 if the human rights issues are not settled before the opening of the olympics participation in these games may be understood to indicate indifference to human rights violations in china and support for suppression
403239 i have tried the going on strike tactic and all that happens is the job goes to somebody else and i no longer have any influence like all strikes it only works if everyone does it and sadly i cant see that happening in this industry
403240 despite one of the many meanings of the labs name lars kr ckeberg wolfram putz and thomas willemeit of graft architects are completely incorruptible it was hard work along with music in the pursuit of happiness that made up for their story of success

403262 im very much looking forward to being back in the english game
403263 when i returned to germany last year i found myself really missing the english style of football
403264 thats why im happy to be here at walsall and cant wait for the season to start
403265 i enjoy the atmosphere at the club ive been impressed by the training facilities and the stadium
403266 the team is very talented and im looking forward to working with the manager
403267 my target is to play well on a regular basis and help the team be successful i dont know too much about league one but i know its going to be a high standard
403268 wolves have given me permission to talk to him and thats what were doing
403269 he wants to speak to his wife and to weigh everything up and hopefully he will come and join us
403270 its difficult because we dont want to lose anyone again at the 11th hour
403271 i think jay would be a great acquisition for us and were still on the look out for more
403272 hes had maybe one or two seasons where people say hes not fulfilled his potential hopefully we can turn that around for him
403273 we will see what happens it is still early in the season so i think he oneill has some other things to take care of first by getting players in
403274 when the time is here we will look at it he cannot do everything at the same time i am really happy here so i would like to stay longer
403275 i am going to go in there and work as hard as i can learn as much as i can and try and become a better player and help the team in any way i can
403276 whether that is as a no 2 or competing for a no 1 i am going to be pushing to make myself better or pushing to make the person who is playing to play better
403277 hij weet dat ik wat voor hem voel ik weet dat hij wat voor mij voelt dus waarom doet hij er niets mee ik heb hem genoeg hints gegeven

403279 ole is an inspiration to anyone hoping for a long career in football
403280 in the modern day game anyone who manages 10 years or more at one club is exceptional particularly when that one club is not from the players own country
403281 when the fans show their respect for ole it will not just be for his goal in barcelona it will be for his overall contribution over a very long period of time
403282 ole came to us at 23 but i looked at him and thought he was 15
403283 i told him he had potential but his first season was going to be an introduction and mostly he would be playing for the reserves
403284 but after two games reserve coach jim ryan said i needed to put him in the first team
403285 that last league championship summed up oles strength of character
403286 it was never going to be easy after all those operations
403287 but we gave him the platform and he just kept working away in that gym believing he would come back when i dont think anyone else thought he would do it
403288 but once we introduced him to the team his impact was fantastic he got 11 goals which were really important for us in the end
403289 when a young kid walks in here eventually i want them to go home to their mother and father and be the same person
403290 success can change people so can money and this is in an industry which is very vulnerable
403291 you need to take special care of yourself in order to deal with that to remind yourself where you have come from and keep your feet on the ground
403292 not admissible if a period of more than ten years has elapsed since the date of the conviction or of the release of the witness from the confinement imposed for that conviction whichever is the later date unless the court determines in the interests of justice that the probative value of the conviction supported by specific facts and circumstances substantially outweighs its prejudicial effect
403293 t o the extent that the state proposes a separate rule for criminal defendants who testify on their own behalf such a suggestion is not well taken
403294 a t common law in civil cases the parties and their spouses were incompetent to testify the same rule applied in criminal cases to accused persons and their spouses save in cases that involved the witness spouses person liberty or health
403295 t here is no question that the spousal incompetency rule is in nature
403296 u nless there is good reason to modify an established common law rule the modern approach to hearsay should be applied in a manner which preserves and reinforces the integrity of the traditional rules of evidence
403297 b ecause exclusion of evidence under the spousal incompetency rule has nothing to do with the reliability or probative value of the evidence
403298 hawkins was based on its own particular fact situation and did not create a broad exception that would admit all out of court statements made by spouses on the basis of threshold reliability alone

403300 a lawyer who is participating or has participated in the investigation or litigation of a matter shall not make an extrajudicial statement that the lawyer knows or reasonably should know will be disseminated by means of public communication and will have a substantial likelihood of materially prejudicing an adjudicative proceeding
403301 discourage investigators law enforcement personnel and other persons assisting or associated with the prosecutor in a criminal matter from making an extrajudicial statement that the prosecutor would be prohibited from making under rpc 3 6
403302 a judge shall disqualify himself or herself in a proceeding in which the judges impartiality might reasonably be questioned including but not limited to instances where t he judge is to the judges knowledge likely to be a material witness in the proceeding

403304 the matter in issue and the parties are essentially the same in both causes
403305 any evidence concerning an individuals religious beliefs or lack thereof is highly prejudicial and should only be admissible if it has a direct bearing on a case
403306 youre supposed to help them assist them if you can youre supposed to help him thats why i did agree to help him
403307 unfairly prejudiced the jury against him as the jury could well have anti muslim beliefs and that any probative value of the evidence was outweighed by its
403308 e vidence of the beliefs or opinions of a witness on matters of religion is not admissible for the purpose of showing that by reason of their nature his credibility is impaired or enhanced provided however such evidence may be admitted for the purpose of showing interest or bias
403309 w hile the rule forecloses inquiry into the religious beliefs or opinions of a witness for the purpose of showing that his character for truthfulness is affected by their nature an inquiry for the purpose of showing interest or bias because of them is not within the prohibition
403310 t he declarant testifies at the trial or hearing and is subject to cross examination concerning the statement and the statement is consistent with the declarants testimony and is offered to rebut an express or implied charge against the declarant of recent fabrication or improper influence or motive

403316 a statement which was at the time of its making so far contrary to the declarants pecuniary or proprietary interest or so far tended to subject the declarant to civil or criminal liability or to render invalid a claim by the declarant against another that a reasonable person in the declarants position would not have made the statement unless believing it to be true
403317 a statement tending to expose the declarant to criminal liability and offered to exculpate the accused is not admissible unless corroborating circumstances clearly indicate the trustworthiness of the statement
403318 illinois courts used a mechanistic approach holding that all four factors as listed in chambers had to exist before
403319 the four factors which the court enumerated in chambers v mississippi are to be regarded simply as indicia of trustworthiness and not as requirements of admissibility the question to be considered in judging the admissibility of a declaration of this character is whether the declaration was made under circumstances that provide considerable assurance of its reliability by objective indicia of trustworthiness
403320 collapsed rule 804 b 3 selecting parts of each to reach its decision
403321 try to do something with possibly codifying the law of evidence in illinois
403322 evidence which is admissible under s 972 11 2 must be determined by the court upon pretrial motion to be material to a fact at issue in the case and of sufficient probative value to outweigh its inflammatory and prejudicial nature before it may be introduced at trial
403323 e vidence of prior untruthful allegations of sexual assault made by the complaining witness
403324 intentional touching whether direct of through clothing if that intentional touching is either for the purposes of sexually degrading or for the purpose of sexually humiliating the complaining or sexually arousing or gratifying the defendant or if the touching contains the elements of actual or attempted battery
403325 the purported evidence would not have been admitted because its probative value is significantly indeed grossly outweighed by its prejudicial effect the alleged false accusation by the complaining witness against his father was of a rather ambiguous nature was temporally remote from the allegations against the defendant especially considering the youth of the complaining witness and contained vastly different surrounding circumstances thus the probative value of the evidence would have been quite low the potential for improper use and confusion by the jury however would have been unacceptably high extensive testimony regarding this alleged report of sexual abuse would likely have focused undue attention on the complaining witness behavior in a situation quite unlike the one actually being tried
403326 admitting the excluded evidence in this case however would not create undue prejudice the evidence is distinguishable from evidence of an adult or sexually mature minors sexual history which could be improperly used by the jury in deciding whether she was raped rather the evidence in this case concerned non consensual sexual abuse of a young child thus the jury was unlikely to draw an unfavorable and unwarranted impression of the alleged victim
403327 highly coercive environments and conditions under which they were made
403328 we need to evaluate to what extent it has an impact on our ability to fully portray his criminality in this case but also what it might set out for
403329 the natural consequence of agents seeking to help detainees in order to build rapport
403330 a lthough relevant evidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice confusion of the issues or misleading the jury or by considerations of undue delay waste of time or needless presentation of cumulative evidence
403331 our supreme court has held that the marital communications privilege provides protection only against a spouse being questioned as a sworn witness about a marital communication and accordingly does not preclude introduction of the marital communication through other means indeed the court specifically held that the marital communications privilege was inapplicable to hearsay statements from a police detective about statements made by a defendants spouse thus the marital communications privilege would not have precluded the prosecution from eliciting testimony from detective declerq relating what defendants wife told him about a statement made by defendant similarly the distinct spousal privilege generally protects a person from being compelled to testify against his or her spouse

403334 the main problems with the dead mans statute are that it runs contrary to the philosophy underlying the general rule of witness competency and that it stifles potentially valid claims where an honest claimant has only his own testimony upon which to rely the statute operates to level the playing field by sealing the lips of an interested survivor who wishes to testify about a transaction with a person whose lips have been sealed by death the problem arises then when the claimant is honest yet has only his own testimony on which to rely without his own testimony to prove his claim the honest claimant is left without a remedy

403340 1 whether extraneous prejudicial information was improperly brought to the jurys attention 2 whether any outside influence was improperly brought to bear upon any juror or 3 whether there was a mistake in entering the verdict onto the verdict form

403342 a lthough it was improper for the jurors to discuss the case before the trial court instructed it to so and to allow their need to return to work to motivate their deliberations these are the sorts of internal influences deemed inadmissible by the case law

403396 some didnt play so well but its just unacceptable the way we played tonight weve got to play better
403397 even though the defence played well the special teams did not play so well and neither did the offence
403398 i played ok at times but obviously as a quarterback you gotta find ways to get the offence out of the slump and get the ball moving i didnt do that tonight
403399 it gives us hope that were 1 5 and still have a shot to get in there but i really dont give a s what everybody else is doing in the east we gotta get better we have to get on a streak just for our own sake

403431 we would like to see the implementation in letter and spirit of commitments made to bring to an end terrorist activities originating in pakistan
403432 india seeks to establish peaceful friendly and cooperative ties with pakistan
403433 however improvement in our relations requires an atmosphere that is free from terrorism
403434 we have a duty to ensure that our people prosper and progress in a secure environment
403435 the scourge of terrorism must be removed from our midst and criminals and terrorists must never go unpunished
403436 there can be no economic growth or development without peace and security
403437 if the cabinets support rates remain low there is a possibility that moves to oust fukuda will become public due to anxiety about fighting an election with him as the campaign poster boy
403438 that is why some think that the appointment of aso is a strategic step toward replacing fukuda ahead of the election
403439 i will support the fukuda cabinet and put in my best effort
403440 for aso cooperating with fukuda is a risk if they lose the election he will go down with fukuda
403441 but if fukuda steps down before the election there will be a chance for aso to take the reins
403442 it could also backfire and that cannot be helped that is a matter of chance

403478 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
403479 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
403480 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
403481 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
403482 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
403483 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
403484 every time i looked at her i wanted to be like her
403485 always the option and it did exist it was real of standing up to fascism a lot earlier than we did a lot of the catastrophic consequences are the result of postponing the resistance until 1940
403486 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
403487 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
403488 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
403489 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
403490 i was going through a time when i was beginning to look to alternative medicine as a solution to several of my own skin issues
403491 i was drawn to dr hauschkas line and began to see unbelievable results
403492 the dr hauschka line really considers environmental factors in order to harvest all of their ingredients at the right time they use all of their own gardens in germany and manage the product creation from start to finish
403493 it is such a holistic thing their facial care hair care and body care all work to keep the mind body and spirit connected
403494 when clients come to me this is sometimes their only break from work or their family they are really trying to bring down their stress level and so we really focus on breathing and relaxation people dont realize how good is for the skin but its really about getting rid of any negative energy
403495 the certification really educates you on every step of the treatment from how their ingredients are grown to complete product knowledge
403496 now that im certified i am able to perform treatments but i continue with the education twice a year they push you constantly learn because they want people to be at a higher level they really look for those who have a passion for the work
403497 there are a lot of people out here in cedarburg and mequon who really like the newer things coming out in milwaukee there is so much going on in the third ward and downtown milwaukee and there are a lot of people interested in being a part of that but dont have access to going downtown
403498 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
403499 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
403500 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
403501 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
403502 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
403503 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
403504 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
403505 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
403506 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
403507 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis

403552 nobody wants to continue on this path but the key is in tehrans hands
403553 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
403554 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
403555 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
403556 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
403557 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
403558 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
403559 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
403560 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
403561 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
403562 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort

403565 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
403566 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
403567 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
403568 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
403569 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
403570 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
403571 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
403572 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
403573 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
403574 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
403575 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected

403581 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
403582 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
403583 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
403584 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
403585 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
403586 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
403587 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
403588 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
403589 the price of gasoline is one of the most critical issues facing floridians right now its adversely affecting families and businesses alike we need a comprehensive solution to address this crisis
403590 this bill will do a great deal to put our nation on a path to cleaner renewable energy alternatives while also addressing current needs americans want and deserve real solutions to lower fuel costs our bill is a step in that direction
403591 while this allows the development of offshore oil and natural gas exploration by states wishing to do so this measure protects floridas moratorium in the gulf of mexico
403592 i asked that this bill include protections for floridas wishes and those protections are included in this bill
403593 the space program is an essential cornerstone of floridas economy
403594 i understand that this is a challenging and uncertain time i believe we can and will transition smoothly into the constellation program and i look forward to working with the good people of nasa and all those involved in the space program as we begin to chart americas future in space flight
403595 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
403596 this demonstrates a long term u s commitment to the people of our hemisphere it will further develop and promote cooperative relationships with friendly countries to ensure we continue economic development and the growth and promotion of democratic institutions
403597 we must work in a bipartisan manner to avoid any negative influence of nations that seek to increase false democracies and prop up existing dictatorships this is an important effort that will fund programs to improve education reduce poverty promote better healthcare and provide improved housing i commend members of the committee for approving this bill and urge senate leadership to bring the bill to the full senate for consideration
403598 this initiative aims to make the united states safer stronger and more prosperous by making our hemisphere more stable and more affluent
403599 our lack of engagement in latin america has created a vacuum that has allowed some to sell an anti american agenda which simply has no place in the region this type of commitment to the development of latin american nations and their institutions helps fill that vacuum and make our nation more secure a strong social and economic backbone is a foundation upon which democracies can prosper this will enable stable communities and a stable region

403605 it is too deep in the army they cant root it out the real question is is this taliban influence spreading to punjab sindh and other parts of the country that is the real worry

403621 i was strapped up and at a push of a button i was going to get pulled back and the pulley was hydraulically powered and the pull took me up about 25 feet in a wink of the eye and thats that oouch

403640 we have not had a national report since we were established in 2002
403641 we dont want to rely on the foreign institutions it is better that we have a local report that will be more relevant
403642 we will cover many areas including politics the government private sector and political societies
403643 we will address official letters to everyone concerned and see what will be their response

403647 when we knocked out the receptor the number of tumors went up dramatically
403648 we decided to work with pollens because they have a unique structure resistant to temperature and easily recognizable its also easily dispersed and carried around in clothes skin etc
403649 the most challenging part of the project was nanoengineering a coating robust enough to withstand the high temperatures of firing and that would still release the tags when touched

403655 among these tortures was the ana tsurushi or hanging in the pit which quickly became the most effective means of inducing apostasy the victim was tightly bound around the body as high as the breast one hand being left free to give the signal of recantation and then hung downwards from the gallows into a pit which usually contained excreta and other filth the top of the pit being level with his knees in order to give the blood some vent the forehead was lightly slashed with a knife some of the stronger martyrs lives do more than a week in this position but most did not survive more than a day or two
403656 sie ist falsch und muss aus meiner sicht aus der welt geschafft werden
403657 ein derartiges vorgehen ffnet der willk r t r und tor
403658 der versuch die agenda 2010 zur ckzudrehen ist grundfalsch es falsch f r das land es ist falsch f r die spd und darum streiten wir
403659 wenn es dabei bleibt wird das f r die spd heftige folgen haben dann werden sich die mitgliederverluste beschleunigen

403662 frau ypsilanti ist mit h chster geschwindigkeit in eine sackgasse gefahren und berlegt jetzt ob sie durch die mauer an deren ende durchkommt
403663 es ist v llig klar auf bundesebene gibt es keine zusammenarbeit mit den linken

403667 the ordination of men to the priesthood is not merely a matter of practice or discipline within the catholic church but rather it is part of the unalterable deposit of faith handed down by christ through his apostles
403668 to those that sit around and say why dont the priests do this or that or why dont
403669 one thing i realized after joining the jesuits was how little catholic culture i had grown up with or at least absorbed while other novices had grown up in families that went to daily mass attended novenas said grace at meals and knew the difference between the immaculate heart and the sacred heart i was still trying to remember how many sacraments there are

403671 ive always been interested in electronics so this was an easy choice for me
403672 what im actually trying to do is create a business thats almost like a wholesaler its a deep cut in prices im not taking much of a mark up on items to begin with and now were running a sale on top of those prices i want to see how that works out passing savings on to customers
403673 im almost retired so im not looking to get rich
403674 im doing this more or less as a hobby i think its fair to the customer to not take a huge margin on the product and to give them the necessary savings that other retailers dont offer
403675 ill be using my blog to promote the different products on my web site
403676 im going to do research on each of the products and give customers all the necessary details im also going to talk about my future projects and communicate with customers about our deals
403677 the prime minister has suggested that a joint working mechanism intelligence sharing between the cbi and state police is required
403678 people have been joining the cbi from other organisations but they do not have the requisite expertise to handle crime cases the standard of people joining from other organisations is declining
403679 it is a government agency and it cannot say no to any state government if a case is transferred to it
403680 this horrifies me it is another example of how rich people exploit and pollute the planet because of their money
403681 im trying to save the planet im trying to save the planet
403682 i will not have this debate trivialized by their excuse for their failed policy

403685 there is one rule for industrialists and that is make the best quality of goods possible at the lowest cost possible paying the highest wages possible
403686 the meeting leader said i am not telling you how to vote but if the democrats win this bill will pass and you wont have a vote on whether you want a union
403687 i am not a stupid person they were telling me how to vote
403688 were not seeing the level of layoffs you tend to see in a recession at this point

403715 kozens has some really good speed at running back if i had those running backs and that line i think id run the ball and see what happens we know if we cant stop the run were going to get a heavy dose of that weve told our front seven that
403716 we could run 80 percent spread and 20 percent i or we could go 80 percent i and 20 percent spread we just dont know right now well see how they react to both sets

403730 the relentless pressure of accusation and innuendo takes its toll in different ways
403731 in dr ivins case it led to his untimely death
403732 i think he was just psychologically exhausted by the whole process
403733 if he was about to be charged no one who knew him well was aware of that and i dont believe it

403747 anyone who drives an electric car falls in love with an electric car
403748 we could further increase the value and efficiency of a unified national grid by helping our struggling auto giants switch to the manufacture of plug in electric cars an electric vehicle fleet would sharply reduce the cost of driving a car reduce pollution and increase the flexibility of our electricity grid
403749 i guarantee you if id have showed up there and theyd have said you cant come in just by yourself and with your maybe a senate one of your staff id have gone nuts i would have called the secretary of defense and said secretary gates i want to visit these people instead apparently sen obama decided to go to the gym at the ritz
403750 surrender of personal excellence and community value in the mere accumulation of material things it measures neither our wit nor our wisdom and can tell us everything about america except why were proud to be americans
403751 it may seem like a fun easygoing event but we do it to celebrate breastfeeding the relationship between mother and baby and to promote breastfeeding as normal and natural
403752 moms can nurse anywhere in public and it can be done discreetly
403753 its just a welcoming and accepting place for moms to relax
403754 though realizing that many other factors were involved i reasoned that if we could get a freer flow of trade freer in the sense of fewer discriminations and obstructions so that one country would not be deadly jealous of another and the living standards of all countries might rise thereby eliminating the economic dissatisfaction that breeds war we might have a reasonable chance for lasting peace
403755 the greatest act of political courage that i have ever witnessed
403756 and yet few politicians have seemed inclined to address solutions particularly if those solutions involve a modest individual sacrifice
403757 since taking steps to make his home more environmentally friendly last june gore devours an average of 17 768 kwh per month 1 638 kwh more energy per month than the year before the renovations by comparison the average american household consumes 11 040 kwh in an entire year according to the energy information administration the cost of gores electric bills over the past year topped 16 533
403758 the commonwealth cannot afford to ignore the negative effects of global warming and climate change any longer
403759 sea temperatures continue to rise storm intensity is predicted to heighten and our economy the publics health and our precious ecosystem are in jeopardy
403760 if global warming and climate change continue to remain unchecked in the commonwealth the cost of inaction will be in the billions
403761 we can effectively end our reliance on fossil fuels by aggressively increasing our reliance on renewable energy sources solar wind geothermal
403762 we have an historic opportunity to shift to a clean energy economy and in the process create new sustainable jobs to support the development and deployment of these new technologies
403763 the greenhouse gas reductions goals laid out in this bill are exceedingly aggressive perhaps to the point of being unattainable and could only be achieved through greatly increased costs for consumers and for employers
403764 thats just as powerful just as strong just as well funded
403765 green homes are shining through as the bright spot in an otherwise gloomy housing market
403766 this twin crisis of peak oil and climate change is spurring innovation experimentation and excitement
403767 these big challenges are what the u s is best at frankly
403768 by providing guidelines and strategies in essence our job is to keep saying yes its possible heres how
403769 there are a zillion different codes and standards out there
403770 we want to make it much easier for people to adopt our goals
403771 for three decades ive heard speakers say things similar to what ive heard today thirty years ago they were called doomsdayers today we know enough to respect their opinions but we still havent changed our lifestyles i take good care of my clothes and they last a long time i have short cold showers and i dont own a car these solutions arent complex theyre right before every one of us
403772 until youve heard andy debate al gore you havent lived
403773 the need for math and science education and higher level thinking skills
403774 the capital costs of wind and solar are terrifying to contemplate
403775 war is the supreme test of man in which he rises to heights never approached in any other activity
403776 in the councils of government we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence whether sought or unsought by the military industrial complex
403777 lets put a man on the moon in 10 years
403778 they can only make a small difference at the margins
403779 it was as though he was running for an ohio senate seat
403780 we cant find any evidence in our recent polling that the vice president made a significant difference
403781 people ultimately see the promises and the voice coming from one person
403782 the choice can shape how a presidential nominee is perceived
403783 signaled what kind of a chief executive officer he was going to be
403784 gets nearly all its facts wrong e very number in the ad is wrong except one and even that number is rounded upward so generously as to flunk third grade arithmetic
403785 snubbing wounded soldiers by canceling a visit to a military hospital because he could not take reporters with him despite no evidence that the charge is true
403786 has resorted to lies and distortions in what sounds like an increasingly desperate attempt to slow down sen barack obama t hese baseless attacks are raising more questions about the republicans campaign and his ability to control his temper
403787 the mccain commercial on this subject is completely wrong factually wrong
403788 so is that your campaign you know shtick right now that he is sort of out of the mainstream elite
403789 honestly i dont think we are focusing on it youre the one bringing it up today
403790 newly aggressive campaign to define mr obama as arrogant out of touch and unprepared for the presidency
403791 included some assertions from the mccain campaign that have been widely dismissed as misleading
403792 i have become the symbol of the possibility of america returning to our best traditions
403793 the conrad foundation is based on petes history of innovation and entrepreneurship
403794 we believe that ultimately it will offer a platform to encourage students to explore entrepreneurship while creating innovative solutions to important issues that face our world and their future
403795 when al gore recently challenged america to convert to clean renewable energy he struck a chord within our foundation
403796 if al gores challenge can galvanize the nation to develop renewable energy why not ask americas youth to answer the challenge in our 2009 competition we have invited our students to answer al gores challenge
403797 should we ignore gore or put him in charge hes an absurd extremist says mark davis the planet does not need saving the climate is not in crisis
403798 options fade for failing schools outside managers lack of interest in texas has forced campus closures
403799 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
403800 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
403801 if they dont make any changes it wont be such a big deal the more changes they make the more it could affect us and how we have to adjust our operations accordingly
403802 what they want you to believe is that the subsidies are providing the feast thats on our tables
403803 in reality the subsidies are going to a very small percentage of the total number of farmers a lot of farmers in the fruit and livestock industry are being left out of the loop
403804 we in america should remember the hardworking people who put the food on our tables and yet earn very low wages and labor in one of the most dangerous occupations in this country
403805 cheering hooting and salivating youd expect at a campus rally
403806 while obama got a warm and even rousing welcome the audience was not cheering his every word
403807 one sure way to get applause from the crowd in the cavernous skyline ballroom for the opening ceremony was to mention sundays appearance
403808 many journalists in the audience leapt to their feet and applauded enthusiastically after being told not to do so during a two minute break halfway through the event journalists ran to the stage to snap photos of obama
403809 obama received a standing ovation from many in the audience at the start and end of his appearance there was also a rush toward the stage after his speech as obama shook hands and signed autographs one journalist was also overheard wishing him luck while another squealed he touched me as she left the ballroom
403810 the worst thing you could do is raise peoples payroll taxes my god
403811 on social security he sen obama wants to raise social security taxes i am opposed to raising taxes on social security i want to fix the system without raising taxes
403812 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
403813 has provided documents to the campaign as it combs through his background according to several sources close to kaine sens evan bayh ind and joseph r biden jr del are also being seriously vetted by the campaign staff according to sources with knowledge of the process
403814 to recap kaine was a city councilman in richmond for 4 terms a two term mayor of richmond lieutenant governor of virginia for 4 years and governor of virginia for 3 years no al gore there
403815 doesnt have to be pro choice or pro gay rights
403816 fancy farm represents something very special in the american political tradition
403817 isnt it remarkable that a community like this one for 112 years has been able to play a key role in shaping the future of kentucky and sometimes the future of this nation
403818 every state is important to john mccain but there are other states where hes going to have to be
403819 i would love to see him come to kentucky i really would during this election and i hope he will
403820 but you dont have to be a mental giant to look at the map and see that there are more fruitful opportunities in terms of winning the election
403821 its the changing nature of the south and southern border states which has not been favorable to democrats and the movement of white conservative democrats to the republican party
403822 i wouldnt put kentucky or tennessee out there with utah and the really strong overwhelmingly republican states but at least with presidential politics democrats will struggle in those states
403823 there might be a give of one or two points but i think for the long term we have consistently led by double digits for some time for kentucky i dont see that narrowing to single digits
403824 when i ran for u s senate in 04 we werent on that map either before fancy farm i think i was behind somewhere around 27 points so no one was looking at kentucky
403825 there are a lot of things that can happen between fancy farm and november
403826 i told them i was appalled by such a statement we are talking about taxpayers dollars that must be treated with as much transparency and openness as possible and spent with as much due diligence as possible to assure the best return on those tax dollars
403827 but he has no plausible way to achieve it his budget would actually move things in the opposite direction away from balance
403828 government is not the solution to our problem government is the problem
403829 the american society of civil engineers estimates that were going to have to spend 1 6 trillion over the next five years to rebuild our infrastructure
403830 weve let things lapse for 20 years the pipes wires asphalt bridges and radar systems are old and everything seems to be falling apart at once
403831 he hasnt talked very much about his vision for modernizing american infrastructure
403832 spoiler is a word of political bigotry i dont recognize it at all
403833 i dont think small party candidates or third party candidates are second class citizens
403834 spoiled our political system theyve turned the government over to big business
403835 none of us should be considered spoilers unless we all are spoilers
403836 it seems a vicious circle if youre not on the debates you dont reach tens of millions of people i can guarantee you if i was on the presidential debates the polls would surge
403837 are you a sports fan do you know any sports player who gives up
403838 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
403839 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
403840 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
403841 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
403842 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
403843 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
403844 will his policies keep my family safer healthier and more prosperous
403845 liberals mock americans who love their country calling them cowboys warmongers religious zealots and jingoists liberals relentlessly oppose the military the pledge of allegiance the flag and national defense liberals malign the flag ban the pledge and hold cocktail parties for americas enemies
403846 anti flag anti family criminal rights welfare traitors endanger bizarre radical sick corrupt
403847 were doing all these message events why dont we try a messenger event why dont we find the kind of venue topic setting format atmosphere that highlights gore at his best and most likable people dont vote for issues they vote for a candidate lets show them the candidate
403848 did you see gore hes totally different he should run for president
403849 gore is not different gore is immutable that was a messenger event
403850 gloried in cultural warfare dividing the nation geographically generationally racially religiously he believed that was what all politicians did
403851 i apologize for it i did not know about these remarks but i take responsibility for them i repudiate them i will certainly make sure that nothing like that happens again
403852 i am in keeping with the vision of one ronald reagan
403853 theres a lot of us voting against obama more than anything else
403854 over the years there are a lot of issues ive disagreed with you about and i would like to know how do you assure me and other conservatives that you will hold to our values and give me something to be excited about
403855 everywhere i go i am hearing the same thing i am uneasy about obama and i think mccain is going to win
403856 it is win win all the way this fiery take no prisoners attitude is what will do it for him for the first time he is really beginning to get his moorings
403857 climate change my friend i have to tell you with all due respect is real its real and the question is how do we address it
403858 i may disagree with all the ways of getting there but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue and his continuous leadership and i am in no way trying to get into a fight with him
403859 unlike barack obama john mccains words are backed up by his votes and his many conservative achievements and conservatives take great comfort in his remarkable record
403860 that was just resting there as a negative issue but the approach he is taking is making it a positive
403861 a politician with a troublesome reputation for trying to have it both ways
403862 mr gore has a bit of a reputation for flip flopping and corner cutting
403863 at least you know what i believe and where i stand
403864 lacks the qualities needed to lead britain effectively through its current economic problems
403865 browns hypocrisy is much closer to the classical sense of the term which involves not believing what you say
403866 answering clintonism with ken starrs inquisition impeachment was offering a cure worse than the disease
403867 116 000 jobs and nearly 19 billion in investment at risk
403868 chances would be zero because they dont work comment by jk july 30 2008 at 5 23 pm
403869 obviously senator clinton will play a major role in the convention but we have not finalized the program yet and are not making any announcements at all about the program yet
403870 which many historians believe would have collapsed of its own weight no matter who was commander in chief
403871 to show that he is a regular guy despite a perceived surplus of gravitas which at least some americans seem to find intimidating
403872 all over this country people are asking whether or not george bush is smart enough to be president of the united states
403873 does anyone in america doubt that kerry has a higher iq than bush im sure the candidates sats and college transcripts would put kerry far ahead
403874 i dont know how theyve done it because my record is not public
403875 i must have been drinking the night before i took that military aptitude test
403876 once you settle for a ronald reagan then its easy to settle for a george bush and once you settle for a george bush then its real easy to settle for bush ii you know this should be evolution instead its devolution whats next
403877 all of us are ignorant of many things its just that the liberal here thinkss he knows what the conservative is ignorant of
403878 small c conservatives are smeared as stupid by liberals because they respect the values of western civilisation
403879 sounds like a gimmick to take advantage of this phony baloney scheme that al gore hatched to fill his own pockets with
403880 stick it on the tailpipe of every car out there
403881 at the same time were seeing our national security experts saying were highly vulnerable with 70 percent of our oil coming from foreign countries the largest reserves being in the most unstable region of the world the persian gulf
403882 we are being told by scientists around the world particularly the international group that is charged with studying this and reporting to world leaders that we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
403883 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
403884 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that
403885 im convinced that the marketing and pr experts surrounding the obamas clued in to the enormous influence that celebrities have had on the american public particularly women over the past seven years since the emergence of us weekly star and other celebrity newsweeklies and the subsequent explosion of celebrity news and they want to take advantage of the deep affection that americans have developed for celebrities
403886 more than most presidential candidates the obamas have to introduce themselves and make sure the american public is comfortable with them they havent been on the national stage that long
403887 and they need to go in short lead publications like people and us weekly they cant wait another month or two for monthly magazine interviews they want the american public to understand who they are and who they are as a family immediately
403888 gas prices are not coming down in the near future
403889 if all electricity used in the united states can be produced by using sun wind and geothermal energy vehicles that operate on rechargeable batteries would become practical
403890 achieving the goal before this decade is out of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to the earth
403891 we are being told by scientists we may have less than 10 years to make dramatic change lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
403892 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
403893 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
403894 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
403895 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous
403896 by 1985 enough millions will have died to reduce the earths population to some acceptable level like 1 5 billion people
403897 we have to offer up scary scenarios make simplified dramatic statements and make little mention of any doubts we may have each of us has to decide what the right balance is between being effective and being honest
403898 once again the oilman in the white house is echoing the demands of big oil
403899 americans deserve policies that free us from fossil fuels and give us better choices that will bring down our energy costs make our air cleaner and help solve global warming
403900 the idea that we can drill our way out of this is just so absurd
403901 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
403902 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment
403903 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations
403904 our country needs a new energy policy that reinvests in america and it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy
403905 the phrase clean coal is a contradiction in terms theres no such thing as clean coal now
403906 mr gore proposed dramatically improving our national electricity grid and energy efficiency while investing massively in clean solar wind geothermal and carbon sequestered coal technologies that we know can work but just need to scale
403907 were building up co2 so rapidly that were seeing the consequences scientists have long predicted
403908 the phrase clean coal is a contradiction in terms theres no such thing as clean coal now
403909 what if we could use fuels that are not expensive dont cause pollution and are abundantly available right here at home we have such fuels scientists have confirmed that enough solar energy falls on the surface of the earth every 40 minutes to meet 100 percent of the entire worlds energy needs for a full year tapping just a small portion of this solar energy could provide all of the electricity america uses and enough wind power blows through the midwest corridor every day to also meet 100 percent of us electricity demand geothermal energy similarly is capable of providing enormous supplies of electricity for america the quickest cheapest and best way to start using all this renewable energy is in the production of electricity in fact we can start right now using solar power wind power and geothermal power to make electricity for our homes and businesses today i challenge our nation to commit to producing 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
403910 mountaintop mining is an atrocity its part and parcel of the energy system thats causing global warming and the same moral blindness
403911 inside the caucus according to a witness obama told the house members this is the moment
403912 in response to what one of the house members prefaced the question by
403913 said i wish i could take credit for that but i cant because its not about me its about america its about the people of germany and the people of europe looking for a new hope new relationships as we go forward in the world so he expressly said that its not about me
403914 lots of people are reading the quote about obama being a symbol and getting it wrong his entire point of that riff was that the campaign is not about him
403915 the post left out the important first half of the sentence which was something along the lines of it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all
403916 ordered up a teleconference with the current presidents treasury secretary granted an audience to the pakistani prime minister then he went up to capitol hill to be adored by house democrats in a presidential style pep rally
403917 along the way he traveled in a bubble more insulating than the actual presidents traffic was shut down for him as he zoomed about town in a long presidential style motorcade while the public and most of the press were kept in the dark about his activities
403918 capitol police cleared the halls just as they do for the actual president the secret service hustled him in through a side door just as they do for the actual president
403919 house democrats had called the session to allow the left wing to vent its collective spleen
403920 in the capitol basement yesterday long suffering house democrats took a trip to the land of make believe
403921 they pretended a small conference room was the judiciary committee hearing room draping white linens over folding tables to make them look like witness tables and bringing in cardboard name tags and extra flags to make the whole thing look official
403922 banged a large wooden gavel and got the other lawmakers to call him mr
403923 i looked around the country for other sites like that i found a little place in upstate new york called love canal had the first hearing on that issue and toone tennessee that was the one that you didnt hear of but that was the one that started it all
403924 we passed a major national law to clean up hazardous dump sites and we had new efforts to stop the practices that ended up poisoning water around the country weve still got work to do but we made a huge difference and it all happened because one high school student got involved
403925 that was the one that you didnt hear of but that was the one that started it all
403926 gore boasted about his efforts in congress 20 years ago to publicize the dangers of toxic waste
403927 gore said his efforts made a lasting impact i was the one that started it all he said
403928 al gore is simply unbelievable in the most literal sense of that term
403929 its a pattern of phoniness and it would be funny if it werent also a little scary
403930 heres the guy who said he was the character ryan oneal was based on in love story it seems to me hes now the guy who created the love canal case i mean isnt this getting ridiculous isnt it getting to be delusionary
403931 add love canal to the list of verbal missteps by vice president gore
403932 the man who mistakenly claimed to have inspired the movie love story and to have invented the internet says he didnt quite mean to say he discovered a toxic waste site
403933 it reminds me of snoopy thinking hes the red baron
403934 i mean how did he get this idea now youve seen al gore in action i know you didnt know that he was the prototype for ryan oneals character in love story or that he invented the internet he now is the guy who discovered love canal
403935 what is it the zelig guy who keeps saying i was the main character in love story i invented the internet i invented love canal
403936 again hes been caught red handed and again he has been left sputtering and apologizing this time he falsely took credit for breaking the love canal story yep another al gore bold faced lie
403937 says he was the model for love story created the internet and this time he sort of discovered love canal
403938 never mind that he didnt invent the internet serve as the model for love story or blow the whistle on love canal all of this would be funny if it werent so disturbing
403939 the real question is how to react to mr gores increasingly bizarre utterings
403940 websters new world dictionary defines delusional thusly the apparent perception in a nervous or mental disorder of some thing external that is actually not present a belief in something that is contrary to fact or reality resulting from deception misconception or a mental disorder
403941 the part that bugs me is the way they nit pick
403942 in fact gore said that was the one that started it all referring to the congressional hearings on the subject that he called
403943 they fixed how they misquoted him but they didnt tell the whole story
403944 it can be frustrating knowing people who supported clinton and edwards who still say they dont know what to do
403945 hes in danger of being sucked into a negative campaign
403946 mccains trying to make him out to be a risky unsure leader he has to respond but has to stay above the fray its a very thin line
403947 the idea that voters pay attention to three or four critical moments of a campaign is a theory thats outmoded
403948 with the 24 hour news cycle you have a lot more process coverage and everything tends to flatten out instead of peaks and valleys you have more of a straight road a lot of times people simply arent paying attention to whats supposed to be a critical moment
403949 he has problems that no candidate has ever had before
403950 hes the first person of color to be the nominee of his party he had to show he could be on the international stage with foreign leaders and he did that now what he has to do is get back to relating to regular people gore had to do it and never quite succeeded to get there
403951 i tried to get him to water ski because he was good at it i tried to get him to play pick up basketball but he wouldnt do that because he thought hed be copying former new jersey sen bill bradley he played pool and he wouldnt do that in public either these were all things that would make him approachable to ordinary people and he just wouldnt do them that what obama has to do make the public understand what hes really like and how he relates to them
403952 americans are looking to see if he can do the job of president of the united states what we he have to do over the next 97 days in convince them he can
403953 the voters we need to get are people not a whole lot unlike obama
403954 they werent born into a wealthy family and theyve worked hard for what they have obviously you have to demonstrate hes a real person and thats the easiest thing in the world to do because hes the most down to earth candidate ive ever worked for and i think the size of events is important you look at today we have two town halls and a barbecue you cant get much closer to the ground than that i think thats the kind of campaign youll see us run for the rest of the race
403955 are you better off now than you were four years ago
403956 the driver of the town car that eventually whisked away gores wife and daughter left the engine idling and the ac cranking for 20 minutes before they finally left
403957 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
403958 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
403959 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
403960 there may be some aspects of climate change that he and i are in disagreement on but overall i mean ive always been a supporter of nuclear power and he has not agreed with that
403961 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
403962 john mccain stood up to the president and sounded the alarm on global warming five years ago
403963 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now
403964 we are in the midst of an international climate treaty process that will conclude its work before the end of the first year of the new presidents term it is a great error to say that the united states must wait for others to join us in this matter in fact we must move first
403965 let me just say again sen obama no storage and no reprocess and thats nuclear power no drilling offshore thats a way of finding oil and gas reserves dr no
403966 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
403967 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
403968 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
403969 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
403970 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
403971 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
403972 i didnt read all the specifics of his plan i agree with his goal i may disagree on all the ways of getting there but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue
403973 i am in no way trying to get in a fight with gore because we share the same goal
403974 gore s talking about electricity generation and what hes really substituting out is one of our most abundant resources that makes us energy independent and thats coal
403975 and if oil can be obtained from our own domestic locations either the outer continental shelf or anwr or oil shale in utah and the rockies and it can be done without environmental harm now not 100 percent guarantee of no environmental harm but reasonable kinds of risks of environmental harms that would not be catastrophic then why wouldnt we why wouldnt we do that
403976 we need to explore all avenues that we can for energy many factors should be taken into consideration it has to be safe cost effective and timely we cannot be limited in our thinking
403977 did democrat mary landrieu not read the gore memo she now 21 years later for the purposes of reelection wants drilling in the gulf she and democrats have oppposed it for 21 years vote em out and join drill now drill here polar bears eat the baby seals democrats protect how stupid of democrats to save everything and lose their own souls respectfully john mcintyre
403978 how soon we forget old gore has lost it take a look at his scare brain ideas he tried to legislate when vp population control acid rain etc and now his global warming placing the blame on we the people have you read the scientific reports who disagree its costing us billions amp we the people are paying for his errors
403979 i think coal is a very good partial solution to our energy needs there is coal for hundreds of years there is also a system close to final stages of development that will use electron technology to remove toxic pollutants so2 and nox as well as particulants this system is near production just a couple of miles from congress at escrub in alexandria va add this to wind solar hydrogen nuclear and domestic oil and we would have a smooth steady and possible transition to the future sources that are not available now
403980 how thankful i am that god did not allow gore to be elected to an office
403981 dr chiltons ideas are practical and need to be implemented without further delay
403982 i respect speaker pelosi i think shes one of the great american success stories
403983 we talk about new york sen hillary clinton and her inspiration to millions of americans speaker pelosi has been an inspiration as well
403984 i may disagree with all the ways of getting there but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue and his continuous leadership and i am in no way trying to get into a fight with him
403985 but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue and his continuous leadership and i am in no way trying to get into a fight with him
403986 mccain is going to be just like obama mccain is a socialist and will pick nancy pelosi as his vp because he hates conservatives
403987 i respect speaker pelosi i think shes one of the great american success stories
403988 what politics has become requires a level of tolerance for triviality and artifice and nonsense that i have found in short supply
403989 is that the right kind of signal to send to the young people of this country who more than any time in recent memory are deeply involved in the political decisions that were making this year and young people who want to get into the political arena look to al gore and he said its all about trivia and nonsense
403990 the new internet based forms of organizing and mobilizing people
403991 what politics has become requires a level of tolerance for triviality and artifice and nonsense that i have found in short supply
403992 both are serious and must be addressed that having been said i think that the climate crisis is by far the most serious threat we have ever faced
403993 well ive endorsed barack obama im a democrat but i think that john mccain deserves credit for having provided some leadership in the republican party years ago at a time when it was needed
403994 youre looking at a different list than i am ive decided to impose a personal term limit of two terms as vice president
403995 produce every kilowatt of electricity through wind sun and other earth friendly energy sources within 10 years this goal is achievable affordable and transformative
403996 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet
403997 we have been drilling for more oil and the prices have gone up
403998 a lot more oil has been found a lot more has been produced
403999 the exploding demand for oil especially in places like china is overwhelming the rate of new discoveries by so much that oil prices are almost certain to continue upward over time no matter what the oil companies promise
404000 wants the government to act to address the immediate price consequences and to act now for achieving energy independence in the medium and long term
404001 believe that coupling an investment in alternative fuels with increased domestic production of oil is preferable to alternative fuel investment combined with energy conservation alone
404002 the only way to break free from the burden of rising gasoline prices and electricity rates is to get free
404003 bid up the price of every last drop of oil and every last lump of coal
404004 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
404005 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
404006 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
404007 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
404008 the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
404009 this is an investment that will pay itself back many times over
404010 its an expensive investment but not compared to the rising cost of continuing to invest in fossil fuels
404011 for decades al gore has challenged the skeptics in washington on climate change and awakened the conscience of a nation to the urgency of this threat i strongly agree with vice president gore that we cannot drill our way to energy independence but must fast track investments in renewable sources of energy like solar power wind power and advanced biofuels and those are the investments i will make as president its a strategy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and cannot be outsourced and one that will leave our children a world that is cleaner and safer
404012 we want to jump on this bandwagon we have to
404013 i rode the south shore line from south bend to chicago to see the show this year for some reason i dont recall much about the spec despite the fact that a 12 tall hamburger mary should be difficult for a 19 year old to forget
404014 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
404015 the leading experts predict that we have less than 10 years to make dramatic changes in our global warming pollution lest we lose our ability to ever recover from this environmental crisis
404016 eliminate carbon from the us electricity supply by 2018 or we are doomed
404017 a challenge to all americans in every walk of life to our political leaders entrepreneurs innovators engineers and to every citizen
404018 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront this issue as president next year
404019 given how hot its been this summer can there be any doubt about global warming
404020 does anyone have any reliable information from knowledgeable sources regarding how much oil is out there
404021 on this anniversary of his first landmark testimony hansen once again appeared before congress today
404022 i tell you the truth it is hard for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven again i tell you it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of god
404023 im convinced at this point in time that making reductions based on conditions on the ground are very important
404024 this is where terrorists can plan attacks they have sanctuary here they are gathering huge amounts of money as a consequence of the opium drug trade in the region
404025 i would look to be able to make recommendations to president bush in the fall to continue those reductions
404026 certainly there are assumptions which you could make which would make that possible
404027 i dont think theres any doubt that we were distracted from our efforts not only to hunt down al qaeda and the taliban but also to rebuild this country
404028 the interesting thing is that the people who are very experienced in foreign affairs i dont think have those doubts
404029 the troops that ive been meeting with over the last several days they dont seem to have those doubts
404030 im not yet able to put an exact time line on it per se
404031 i think the strategic goals of having time horizons are ones that we all seek because eventually we would like to see u s forces draw down and eventually all come home
404032 the day is coming when american forces will step back more and more from combat roles the day is coming when will be doing more in the way of training and less in the way of fighting those goals are being achieved now
404033 senator mccain and i and others want us out of iraq sooner rather than later
404034 but we want us out in a way that does not compromise all the gains that american and iraqi forces have made in iraq w e want to stay there to a victory because we dont want all those who have served in the american uniform there to have served or in some cases died in vain
404035 i think its important to note that barack obamas judgment about these issues has been excellent from the beginning the kind of judgment youd want in a commander in chief and others are now beginning to adopt his positions
404036 we wouldnt be discussing surges in iraq or anything else if barack had had his way we wouldnt have started that war to begin with
404037 thats not the sort of thing you say no to
404038 if john asks me and he thinks i can help him
404039 we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
404040 this climate crisis is threatening our country threatening all of human civilization
404041 we need to reset the bar and change the debate
404042 the devastating effect on main street and the rest of the country is coming from the present cost of electricity
404043 the price increases are likely to continue until we stop just taking baby steps
404044 the focus now is past president bush toward whats going to happen in january
404045 i disagreed with those who wanted a so called gas tax holiday
404046 the people of this country are ready for bolder more dramatic actions
404047 im under no illusion that theres any position with as much influence as that of president and in fact i tried to get that position but that didnt happen
404048 but i personally feel that my own best role is to try to bring about a sea change in public opinion
404049 someone should inform the ghettto michelle shaniqua obama that when the republicans release her
404050 okay weve got it from here you can leave now
404051 when two elephants fight its the grass that suffers the most
404052 remove all u s troops from iraq by early 2010
404053 a residual force will remain in iraq and in the region to conduct targeted counter terrorism missions against al qaeda in iraq and to protect american diplomatic and civilian personnel
404054 as an active member of the armed forces i believe that admiral michael mullen should refrain from political speeches and campaigning its the law and its a good one i am tired of having our servicemen and women used as political footballs if mullen wants to enter the campaign then he can retire and comment to his hearts content
404055 someone should inform the ghettto michelle shaniqua obama that when the republicans release her
404056 even those who back aggressive steps to combat climate change viewed the proposal with some skepticism they said the proposal was impractical and far too costly
404057 the nations senior military official warned against a plan to remove all u s troops from iraq by early 2010
404058 im convinced at this point in time that making reductions based on conditions on the ground are very important
404059 obamas remarks that if he takes office in 16 months he would withdraw the forces we think that this period could increase or decrease a little but that it could be suitable to end the presence of the forces in iraq
404060 who wants to exit in a quicker way has a better assessment of the situation in iraq
404061 if we dont get our way we will bomb you
404062 i want this job done in 18 months now tell me how you are going to do it
404063 there is no mountain over which you can see the future
404064 bridging the worlds of environmentalism finance technology and politics together mr gore is ideally suited to speak to this audience of innovators striving to integrate green building practices and leading edge technology into the 21st century in a way that is both smart and sustainable

404334 you need to get out of that rotten old neighborhood istra its a slum
404335 its broken down and its just not safe you cant argue that youre still shaking
404336 it wasnt that bad it was just a guy trying to get a little attention
404337 if youre upset and you are then its more than bad enough youre so stubborn what did he do what did you do
404338 he followed me a bit got in front of me blocked my path
404339 thats so scary youve gotta find another place and move did you fight him kick what
404340 i bluffed him i faked having a beholder and he bought it ran off like i was going to peel his skin off him or something
404341 wow so you just did that weird blinking stuff and he was that scared of what are these things that bad
404342 theres alot of rumor around about exactly what a beholder can do word is out enough that some beholders can do some really major stuff
404343 no no danatech is only selling limited services with civilian beholder systems so they dont talk about the experimental stuff but the military is interested in the possibilities
404344 yeah yeah im good really im fine its no big deal i just needed a bit to get distance from it and relax some and were not here to talk about me anyway right wheres this ring show me
404345 oh my the poor bastard is in love isnt he
404346 how did he ask you was it over the top
404347 poor poor bastard connor is all about you miss myra
404348 well you know hes been working for himself right he does sales and computer support for businesses with contracts and things i dont really understand it all well danatech bought his business from him and now hes got all these benefits and things
404349 that seems go be going around but congratulations thats wonderful for you both
404350 i know were basically set for life now no worries at all so he didnt tell me all this but called me the other day and was being all sad and told me he had bad news and he wanted to meet me at the river to talk about some things
404351 i had no idea though i thought he was going to say he was bored with me or had some dick disease or something or his mom was going to die i was a mess so i went out there ready to cry basically i walk out to meet him and he was already on one knee
404352 so im all like what are you doing right and he says all formal and everything i have something to tell you oh my god i was all dizzy and almost hyperventilating
404353 and he says i was bought so i bought this and i want to be yours and he opened the ringbox
404354 i know im still giddy and its been almost a week now
404355 this calls for a celebration we need to get everyone together
404356 oh that would be fantastic i havent told anyone else and im about to burst i wanted to tell you first
404357 thats so nice thank you but now we need everyone to know
404358 ok so ill get everyone together and well do something
404359 great that will be so fun im too excited to eat even
404360 ok ok so you said in your vid you had some stuff going on at work is everything ok whats going on with you
404361 well yeah thats the thing on my mind well until this thing this morning
404362 danatech bought us out too so now ultimately i work for the same place connor does
404363 oh thats neat we can go to all the company parties together
404364 i guess youre right but now i mean you know how i feel about tech
404365 not like that silly you just live in the past is all
404366 maybe i just dont like the ideas of machines inside us
404367 istra im just saying there are some lovely machines on the market
404368 im serious though the idea of microscopic programmed machines inside our bodies doing god knows what i just think were giving away an incredible amount of trust to something we have very little control over ultimately
404369 jesus youre thinky well i think i can understand your fear but i dunno i think its great for alot of things in fact im thinking about getting a beholder would you hate me if i do
404370 no its not like that i approve of you making choices you think are right for you but its just not for me creeps me out
404371 i can see that but i think youre an uptight bitch and you need to get laid
404372 so whats the problem working for danatech is working for the devil
404373 i supposed thats part of it but at the same time i dont know how much my job will be changing i mean right now im basically at the top of my game i have my client base i know where they all stand and how theyre progressing or not and im in tune its all tidy i think its just the idea that so much might be changing that i find unnerving
404374 might be so you have no idea if anything is changing or not
404375 right theres a meeting upcoming where well be discussing terms and expectations and changes it just seems like such an open ended agenda unfocused so i cant get my mind around it
404376 youre just going to have to forget it and go in there and find out stop stressing over it
404377 youre quite aware of the intricacies of my business and youre very familiar with the lengths to which i go to ensure only the top quality products reach you in the most timely of fashions yeah so i would very much appreciate a bit of respectful recognition of the effort i expend to serve your every need
404378 look lets not kid ourselves i bring you items that are very difficult to obtain so i often cannot predict when or how my stock replenishes i know what you need and i get it to you thats the arrangement
404379 youre quite aware of the intricacies of my business and youre very familiar with the lengths to which i go to ensure only the top quality products reach you in the most timely of fashions yeah so i would very much appreciate a bit of respectful recognition of the effort i expend to serve your every need
404380 look lets not kid ourselves i bring you items that are very difficult to obtain so i often cannot predict when or how my stock replenishes i know what you need and i get it to you thats the arrangement
404381 pardon me i hate to interrupt im not begging or anything of the sort i simply have a a bit of a quandry
404382 the uncomplicated truth of the matter is the fact that the mote is not the smallest bit of the machine right right
404383 were fresh out of seating sir youll have to come back another time
404384 but i only need to know how big is the mote thats the key i can put it all together if i knew how big the mote
404385 and why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brothers eye but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye
404386 or how wilt thou say to thy brother let me pull out the mote out of thine eye and behold a beam is in thine own eye
404387 you are augmented and not registered this is an infraction disclose your district or submit to process
404388 thou hypocrite first cast out the beam out of thine own eye and then shalt thou see clearly to cast out the mote out of thy brothers eye
404389 you are now registered in the caspaia district and are on record as a public nuisance you will depart the premises and not return you will not leave your district your silence signifies compliance
404390 yes thanks for the help i dont know why we cant just be rid of these no account people i mean were not registered of course but i mean all those robot people those unregistered modifieds need to just be herded and kept on farms or something

404403 ser n mero uno es un regalo por tanto trabajo realizado en el pasado
404404 he sentido cosas muy diferentes y es dif cil comparar esta sensaci n con la conquista de roland garros pero es un momento muy emotivo
404405 estoy muy muy muy feliz de poder ser n mero uno y me ha dado una gran satisfacci n alcanzar lo m s alto del ranking
404406 estoy contento pero tendr poco tiempo para disfrutarlo porque est n muy cerca los juegos ol mpicos y el abierto de estados unidos

404410 he might be trying too hard to hold them down
404411 i dont see anything different hes still got good stuff
404412 but his best pitch is his changeup and hes been leaving it up in the strike zone in the last two games
404413 now that i think of it in the big innings ive given up i havent been able to locate down in the zone
404414 thats definitely an issue i have to be able to locate that pitch if i want to put the team in a position to win
404415 i wanted to help the team out especially with the winning streak
404416 my last start was poor and i wanted to redeem myself but i didnt do it
404417 its the only race track that we go to all year long that you can only run 4 5 6 laps of practice before the tires are completely worn out that means the surface is a factor
404418 it is a difficult tire to build its goodyears responsibility to try to do it goodyear has to find a way to build a tire that we dont have to go through the process of having to lay rubber down on that particular race track to get where we can race on it
404419 under the circumstances nascar did 100 percent the right things there was conversation that they should have just let the race go and leave it up to the teams thats ludicrous that thought process would get people hurt
404420 but its still one of my favorites tracks ive won at martinsville and dont like the place at all
404421 rudys had some back problems and his shoulders been a little sore
404422 his last few times out he hasnt thrown good he looked like he couldnt bend over but hes one of those stubborn guys who wont tell when theyre hurt
404423 we got him as a starter and we havent had a very good look i feel like we definitely have to give him a better chance than that
404424 its their decision and im going to have to respect whatever they do
404425 whatever role they put me in theyre going to expect me to be ready
404426 well see what we can do we consider him a starter hes showed hes capable of pitching a good game when we put him out there
404427 he has a big heart he plays hard ive said it before hes been one of the good surprises at camp
404428 hes played a lot better than i thought he could and hes fighting to be one of those tackles in the rotation hes doing a great job
404429 of course id like to play three technique where i can be a little quicker play on the edges but you know it is what it is ive just got to shut up and go do it
404430 every now and then throw a little power move at em or something its just working hard for a guy like me every play youve got to work hard whereas some of the bigger guys can maybe take a play off here or there i dont have that luxury
404431 its getting out of that indianapolis style too where its a little more under control staying in your pass rush lanes and all but its coming back to me
404432 well you have to make up for lack of size with other things quickness balance determination heart things like that thats what he has hes not a really big tackle but he does have quickness and its helped him
404433 probably his best camp i think he is really solid right now im happy with him
404434 i think its going to be a little bit more of a hairy situation in the games with substitutions and personnel
404435 i was just trying to make contact use the middle of the field get the run in and not hit a ground ball

404440 and kobe takes on the challenge of guarding their best perimeter player regardless of who it is
404441 he had a great game against us a few years ago and was real brash about it
404442 this is what i do i knew prior to it and they reminded me of it so sic the doberman on him
404443 the settlers must leave if the settlers are here there is no safety only fear
404444 shes not afraid of people or dogs and shes never expressed aggression toward them
404445 very severe separation anxiety which needed to be managed medically
404446 we just choose a club thats so boring nobody in their right mind would ever in a million years join it
404447 im only here because rain broke her hip and they wont let me live alone at the community
404448 ive lost nia so im going to raise this baby
404449 if its some jerk i went out on a couple of dates with i can do without that drama
404450 text messaging someone i would prefer not to see you again is really not my style
404451 but at the same time i wanted to avoid an awkward conversation
404452 were in this mode where were telling everybody everything all the time
404453 it becomes about saying things just blathering on were at the apex of that trend
404454 you pretend to be communicating when youre actually stifling communication
404455 a phone conversation is like wildfire you dont know where its going to go
404456 were slaves to our devices blackberries and phones reachable 24 7
404457 i dont want to get into hey whats going on how you doing
404458 i just get to the point like ill meet you at 3
404459 i just say i wont be coming in im under the weather by the time he hears voice mail its already noon
404460 when that happens on the field usually guys have helmets on
404461 but this happened on the sidelines so it probably wasnt a good idea
404462 he was trying to apologize so i was walking with him just to be there
404463 we hope that colleagues will have heard from their constituents that something has to be done and done before congress finishes its business this year
404464 can begin to break the current legislative stalemate on the senate floor
404465 would bring down gas prices in the short term or significantly reduce our oil dependence in the long term
404466 we would need to see a bill that would increase the supply here in our own country across the board in a comprehensive way
404467 the fact that theyre uncomfortable means were doing the right thing
404468 they probably wont ask for mine either but i am going to show it to them trust me
404469 dont put it on im telling you we get searched every time you put your jewelry on
404470 im sorry you werent here so we gave your seat to someone else
404471 im sorry i realize that this isnt your fault and i really would have been here sooner if i could have been but i have 35 friends waiting for me in
404472 all you have to do is let him cry it out
404473 little did i know the future that god had for me god really does have an incredible sense of humor i finally got over the idea that i couldnt have another baby obviously i already was maybe ill have a little girl the two of them will be close in age and i will be done having kids
404474 im sorry michele i have to call your dr with the results and he has to tell you
404475 im sorry i have to tell your dr and he has to tell you
404476 im sorry i wasnt supposed to say anything im so sorry michele i didnt mean to say anything
404477 you said heads and you said they you said heads and you said they oh my god oh my god oh my god you said heads and you said they
404478 im not kidding we are going to have twins hahahahaha
404479 im not ha ha ha ha kidding ha ha ha ha
404480 okay were going to let you have the babies we are not going to do anything to stop your labor this time
404481 i will be the first woman in history to be permanently pregnant
404482 im going to cough while at the mall and out will come two babies cradle and all
404483 honey that baby is tiny shes not huge at all
404484 long this sweet little baby was huge compared to the 2 and 3 lb babies i had been visiting at the nicu
404485 push michele push im considering taking a dirt nap and they want me to push
404486 its o k there is a little play in the cord i can get the head out
404487 well its somewhat of a miracle because this little girl was struggling to breathe yesterday and needed blood transfusions is doing great today and is breathing on her own how would you like for her to be brought back over to you there at phoenix general
404488 we are disappointed in this outcome but our complete review and this final decision is in the best interest of our program
404489 we outlined for josh the expectations we had for him when he arrived and unfortunately those expectations have not been met josh needs to learn from this experience we hope he can move forward in a positive manner
404490 was i disappointed by his attitude not at all i found him to be very serious and focused
404491 he wanted to leave chelsea i am certain of that although it created a lot of anxiety for him and in fact he remained because of family matters
404492 he stayed for his father who he is extremely close to and for his whole environment therefore he was unable to create that split that they expected and we were hoping for
404493 jose mourinho did hope for this move but we knew it was going to be difficult
404494 so instead we thought of a player who in terms of age and wages is a good deal i am happy that sulley ali muntari has arrived
404495 if id have asked he abramovich would have given him to me but not to mourinho
404496 ill let you figure out why however i never thought about buying him
404497 im very attached to lampard he would be great in italy because he is always interested in different types of football

404510 any nuts any dried fruits are great for sure try fresh fruit added after the halava sits for a while off heat things like berries mango banana or fresh figs dates and spices cardamom saffron star anise poached in the syrup cinnamon vanilla try coarse polenta instead of semolina farina por los lectores americanos for a gluten free halava honey is hydroscopic moisture absorbing which means it draws water out of things my experience of honey sweetened halava is that it doesnt set so well not more than 40 sweetener as honey id say also ayurveda says that cooked honey is not very good for you just by the way best wishes

404518 ben said it was the best three weeks of his life he made several new best friends and felt an immediate kinship with the other thinkers many of the kids return year after year and the staff tries to pair each newbie with a returning student for a roommate kids seem to integrate into the group quickly and it is an inclusive community they have a nice balance between work and play with six hours of classes per day and a lot of cool stuff to do in the off hours

404530 one of the firs planted by jones had fallen and hit the gazebo breaking tiles on the roof it took me seven years to fix it
404531 its a distinctive piece of architecture it would have been a shame to let it just fall down
404532 i could not for the life of me understand why there was nothing not a parade a frank jones day nothing

404551 you might not find bird feeding mentioned in any shastras or tomes on vaastu but if you feed birds everyday it boosts your spiritual growth in this materialistic world where nobody looks beyond his nose you learn to give without expecting a little thank you that selfless act washes away past life sins
404552 i picked this habit from my grandmother i feel there is nothing better than feeding birds and animals

404566 there are british passport holders who live in the u k who are being found in places like kandahar
404567 while my troops have not actually found british passports on enemy dead there has been a suspicion that with the high number of taliban casualties they have needed to recruit a lot of foreign fighters and some of these are likely to be of british muslim descent
404568 there is a link between kandahar and urban conurbations in the uk

404576 we have now received ben mullany at our intensive care unit at morriston hospital
404577 he arrived here by ambulance at 5am today following an air ambulance flight from antigua
404578 initial medical assessments are now being undertaken by the morriston staff and it is too soon to give any further details
404579 the mps metropolitan police service will be sending a team of officers to antigua today
404580 the team which will include one officer from south wales police will support the local senior investigating officers and has been sent following a request from the antiguan authorities received through the foreign office

404583 the horse has got a leg and a half between two holes in the floor its eight feet underneath
404584 it basically was straddling this support beam its legs dangling
404585 because it fell in the corner we had to take part of the stall wall apart
404586 somewhere along the line the vet showed up and gave it a sedative so it wouldnt hurt itself
404587 we pushed it up enough to get a plank under its butt
404588 we had heard rumblings that new figures were going to be released but no one would tell us anything
404589 however we sort of expected it weve seen 20 new clients since january which is a lot for our small agency
404590 what concerns us most is that much of this group is made up of young people in their 20s and 30s
404591 theyre people who either dont remember what was going on in the 80s or think that with all the medications available now its no big deal to contract hiv that its like having asthma
404592 we need to get back to doing education in the schools which we havent been doing for the past few years
404593 weve seen a loss of funding for education and when hiv aids is discussed in the classroom it is lumped in with other sexually transmitted diseases like gonorrhea or syphilis which are curable
404594 it does not allow for the best quality of life
404595 if we dont get a handle on this now it just will spiral into a situation that is much worse than it already is
404596 the hiv epidemic in the u s continues to spread and at a rate greater than was previously thought
404597 the real measure of political leaders and the american people is if this bad news spurs good action the establishment of a comprehensive and accountable national aids strategy that will eliminate barriers to effective prevention generate adequate resources and hold our government accountable for ending this epidemic
404598 what prompted me to sell was my need to do more international service and the fact that i was getting tired and not paying as much attention as i should have been to the business
404599 coming to work every day was a joy but it was a joy because i wasnt working hard enough
404600 my life has been divided into score 20 year periods
404601 the first 20 years i spent growing up the second 20 were spent as a tobacconist and the third will be spent in international service
404602 i think the planning board has made the right decision concerning new developments in town
404603 im thankful for all the help we received without it things would be devastating
404604 i didnt really think anything of it when he went overseas
404605 but the army told us wives they would be different when they returned
404606 we were there to support each other and if we had questions have someone to talk with
404607 it makes them very self conscious and not trusting of people
404608 he started screaming in our bed something about get down incoming guns yes sir heard roger it was frightening i was thinking what happens if he starts swinging i got out of bed and slept on the couch he didnt take offense to it it takes them a while to get back into the rhythm of being a civilian again were still not there
404609 he was easygoing about talking to people now he was not social and was paranoid he thought there were people following him hed ask what is that black box on the road or why did you ask me that the military expects them to turn that switch were waiting at home doing it all ourselves and they come home and add more stress its like who is this guy the kids dont know who he is holy mackerel they come back so different
404610 im supposed to understand their feelings but it doesnt seem like they understand me
404611 when we had the veterans returning party there were no balloons because we had been warned that if even one popped it could set them off
404612 a neighbor shot off fireworks and it was pretty loud a trigger for paul
404613 i ran around the house and hes lying with his face in the ground patting the grass
404614 the next year on the fourth of july neighbors in dover were setting them fireworks off and my husband was on the floor trying to get under the bed
404615 we ended up losing our duplex and with four kids moved to the projects in dover
404616 my two oldest got out of control hanging with the wrong crowd
404617 i called the manchester v a and explained the paranoia the high anxiety he was either not sleeping for days or just sleeping and not changing clothes they said admit him and he stayed two months they put him on meds and counseled him
404618 i headed to hanscom air force base and asked if i could stay in their lodging
404619 save said they were looking for people to start a support group through them and asked if i were interested yeah i was interested
404620 they asked no questions and even agreed to shut down a few hours once a month so thered be no gunshots
404621 our starting pitcher kept us in the game and gave us a chance to win thats all you can ask for
404622 we got a couple of good breaks in the sixth
404623 we didnt have good at bats we didnt do the things weve been doing all year
404624 sometimes you need to see a pitcher a second or third time
404625 we left guys on base but most of it was that we had selfish at bats we werent trying to go the other way
404626 stanclift was throwing mostly fastballs and we were trying to hit home runs he left some out on the corner and we didnt shoot them the other way like we usually do
404627 making the a1307 safer and saving lives on this road is a top priority of mine
404628 i will be doing everything i can to make sure measures to reduce deaths on this road are put in place as a matter of urgency
404629 this speed reduction is just one of a number of measures i am implementing along this road
404630 im very excited to be involved with the do something 101 campaign and to help motivate teens to get involved
404631 there are so many kids in america that need school supplies that dont have them and all somebody has to do is donate its so easy
404632 as a benefactor of this program we will receive periodic shipments of school supplies from our local staples stores we will also receive staples gift cards based on the funds raised from local staples customers following the campaign
404633 we plan on using the supplies for our members that are in need of school supplies for the upcoming school year we will also have some of
404634 we would collaborate with them in supplying families that need assistance with school supplies

404639 it hurts me so much to miss the olympics and the u s open you have no idea
404640 the first year i was pleased last year i was just overwhelmed by the response
404641 there is always somebody who needs backpacks and would be happy to get it
404642 if you have ever delved into the medicare system you know that its very complicated
404643 unless you study the details and the fine print you might not know about certain benefits such as this part b payment mandate
404644 while the rule itself has not changed the cms discovered that many folks entitled to this benefit were not using it
404645 thats why they recently reminded the states about the plan
404646 kozens has some really good speed at running back if i had those running backs and that line i think id run the ball and see what happens we know if we cant stop the run were going to get a heavy dose of that weve told our front seven that
404647 we could run 80 percent spread and 20 percent i or we could go 80 percent i and 20 percent spread we just dont know right now well see how they react to both sets
404648 size wise i do like the way we match up this year
404649 i really like our two big tight ends adam chicoine burlington and andrew baker rutland
404650 in practice we looked really polished were ready were game ready
404651 i know mark murphy talked to me about it in the past how important it was for brett to continue to be part of the organization after he was done playing
404652 and frankly its good for brett brett needs to stay a part of football obviously hes a part of the green bay packers
404653 the commissioner will take no action today on brett favres reinstatement request discussions are continuing between the packers and brett
404654 there isnt a perfect solution to this but mark murphy is at least trying
404655 we know what they want and where i stand his solution although awkward and unsettling for most may be the best in the end
404656 you could hand me a billion dollars and im still going to be on the field
404657 it doesnt matter to me but everyone has different situations has different views on money money is not more important than football to me right now
404658 hes ready to go back but he cant go back until the commissioner reinstates him
404659 on a windy day it makes more power than we need and it turns our electric meter backward

404661 last year we were probably getting a call a week or every two weeks
404662 when youre buying a renewable energy system youre hedging future cost increases
404663 at the same time youre pre buying renewable energy for 30 to 40 years
404664 but if we create the situation where individuals can do this and make it easier for them then this will ultimately reduce our dependency on power produced by fossil fuel
404665 i think theres still a lot of misconceptions around wind turbines and a fair amount of public resistance to them
404666 a lot of people think of solar energy when they think of producing energy at home but this is just another alternative
404667 we had some concerns about it because theres an effort by the state to limit towns ability to exercise their zoning power

404671 obviously the weight of the tree leaning exceeded the strength of the roots luckily there was no real damage
404672 its been there a long time its amazing its been able to survive in this environment for so long

404674 obviously were glad no one was hurt its always sad when a big old tree comes down but i guess nature knows when its time
404675 the whole industry has been doing really quite well but it has grown so fast over the last couple of years that returns are starting to drop pretty sharply
404676 all of a sudden therell just be too many blueberries one year and they wont be worth anything
404677 weve had the best of both worlds increasing supply and increasing pricing really driven by the whole health interest in blueberries
404678 we have to continue to keep supply and demand in balance for the blueberry growers
404679 a lot of people who traditionally buy from growers theyre not committing and its creating a lot of uncertainty in the market
404680 this industry was due for a tremendous growing pain and i think this year is the first year of the effects of that its due to the success of the crop farmers do jump on each others bandwagons when theres a successful crop
404681 how long it will last will depend on whether the average consumer can continue to afford our crop
404682 i didnt really agree with it i feel like hes given a lot i feel like hes one of the greatest hitters in the mlb
404683 to give him up in a pennant race is tough i dont know what happened behind the scenes but its tough i thought he brought a lot to red sox nation
404684 its a shame that you always give someone up in the year of free agency they should have held onto him until the end of the year wow eight years
404685 we miss manny we liked manny best pure hitter in the major leagues
404686 i dont think they should have traded him but it happens
404687 the red sox dont deserve a player like me during my years here ive seen how they have mistreated other great players when they didnt want them to try to turn the fans against them
404688 they love coming here and we have so many programs for all ages its a perfect way to spend some time during the hot summer days

404715 my fastball the two seamer is my go to pitch and that was working today my curveball was working too with those two pitches i felt pretty confident
404716 the kids hit the ball and goffstown made some mistakes

404723 i was pulling for him its one of those tournaments where you dont think how young how old you are you just kind of manage to get through those conditions thats why he played that well
404724 i talked to a lot of senior golfers that were at tpc sawgrass that week and they were all excited about it
404725 they said it gives all the guys hope that they can go out there and still do it
404726 in that respect i think it was good for all the senior tour players and obviously the older generation guys myself kenny perry and those guys that you can still compete past 50

404785 she had a wonderful sense of humor and was very considerate of the students

404788 the interior of the bank features a beautifully scaled two story high banking floor with a mezzanine at the rear
404789 the banking floor has a wonderful natural lighting provided by monumental triple hung divided lite wood windows
404790 the bank came in with samples of the materials and drawings of the proposed changes
404791 at that time they werent designated so it was more of a courtesy the bank was very much in favor of the designation here we had an example of a building owner that was welcoming the design and being a good citizen in taking care of their buildings its respected history and its place in the community
404792 were learning a lot about the history of the village and weve learned that respecting and recognizing the history of the village through its architectural resources is just a good form of planning
404793 the planning is really there to help maintain and build the villages pride in itself which helps businesses and brings in businesses and visitors and brings back your children to this place we call fairport so thats the part of the planning that is looking toward the future by recognizing the past
404794 gt will may of east rochester is doing well after receiving a new kidney from kaylea seward
404795 i didnt understand any of the terminology they were using
404796 i cannot deal with just taking him home and letting him pass away at home
404797 i knew will since he was born when i saw he was really sick his mom talked to me about everything that was going on with him i just thought about it for a few weeks i felt like he was kind of like a part of my family hes always been very special to me and i love him very much so i think thats probably why
404798 i was really nervous and excited at the same time to see if i could be the one to save his life
404799 not to brag about it but it seemed kind of cool and exciting a lot of things were going through my mind about a lot of the risks the doctors were telling me
404800 hes getting back to where he was before the surgery hes awake now and hes smiling and laughing again hes doing excellent
404801 because will was so ill going into the surgery we were very concerned about his recovery
404802 but hes a strong child and hes doing very well now if he werent such a fighter he might not have made it through those first weeks following the transplant
404803 theres a lot of risk involved but i think its really important to help other people and not just think about yourself
404804 when i called kaylea she showed up with her mom and i just instantly knew that this was a really great family
404805 my kids and my whole family are so happy that weve gotten to know her for a young woman she has incredible generosity and love that she could teach any adult
404806 she went in and she did it all without ever hesitating whatsoever
404807 it was like the happiest thing you could ever dream of this has been a very long road it has not been easy by far this is my child this is all i could dream of the past two and a half years getting him to this point to get the surgery done
404808 the boy is a charmer you put him in the little stroller thingies in the hospital walking down the hall and anybody that sees him is going to stop and say isnt he so cute what a little prince will still catches peoples eyes he is just so amazing
404809 they really did set the standard for us and get us started
404810 it was when i started dreaming in french that i knew i was going to be ok
404811 everyone used public transportation and we ate cheese and bread during every meal and dessert was always part of dinner i loved the crepes
404812 he wanted to make sure that i became as fluent as possible and in a short amount of time
404813 about a month ago i got a test back in history class
404814 my teacher announced to the class that i had received a grade and that my grade was actually better that some of the others in the class not only did i know the information but my french was at the level of the others
404815 the exchange program is one of the hallmark programs of the rotary international organization
404816 our kids go out as kids and come back as very mature adults julia was a fantastic ambassador for the organization and perfectly embodied our belief that the best way to achieve international goodwill is through a person to person connection
404817 i decided that i was going to go for my passion instead of all your benefits your vacation time your guaranteed salary i wanted to be happy in my career
404818 i figured i would go into it an give it a try for a couple of weeks in school and if i didnt like it i didnt lose anything
404819 youre going to have to work forever in life so you might as well do something you enjoy doing
404820 ill put a lot of thought into a cut but i enjoy just jumping in and going for it having fun with it
404821 a lot of its based on the eye as long as you have the principals down run with it dont be afraid of it
404822 i wanted to get more creative than a day of retouches
404823 i wanted to get in there and cut i wanted to use the scissors i wanted to use razors in the hair
404824 when you find a good person you stick with them
404825 he always takes the extra mile and talks to you lets you know what would be good on you
404826 i wanted to bring something fresh and unique to the area
404827 its got that small town feel but its also very professional
404828 i feel like ive gotten to know him a lot better in his own salon
404829 he very warm and honest and he has a really good sense of humor
404830 i think the biggest thing is to respect your clients
404831 theyre number one youve got to make them happy and you need to listen to them theyre your advertising
404832 its very stressful but its more in a positive way because its your own place
404833 your working for yourself not someone else you see the direct payoff
404834 try as hard as you like theres just no pleasing a disapproving rabbit let them hop around your house theyll disapprove of your decorating skills feed them tasty veggies theyll disapprove of your culinary skills sit together in your yard and theyll disapprove of your gardening even as they devour it long thought of as mindless raiders of gardens and happy couriers of colored eggs its almost as if rabbits have been getting the best of us for years secretly disapproving of all our non rabbit ways fortunately sharon stiteler known as the bird chick for her work in the birding community began to notice something not quite right about her pet rabbit cinnamon it appeared that cinnamon didnt approve of anything after studying a great many photos sharon has soundly and without out a doubt proved that rabbits have some major attitude
404835 the hard part of getting water to split is not the hydrogen platinum as a catalyst works fine for the hydrogen but platinum works very poorly for oxygen making you use much more energy
404836 what we have done is made a catalyst work for the oxygen part without any extra energy
404837 nickel oxide cant be used around anything else in the environment because of corrosion even the carbon dioxide in the air will react with it to make carbonates
404838 but our catalyst uses abundant materials that dont react with environment
404839 because our catalyst is green the machines that perform electrolysis can be much less expensive than they are today since they dont need to be protected from environmental contaminants
404840 solar cell makers can add super cheap electrolyzers to their system so that they work 24 7 during the day making hydrogen and oxygen then at night recombining it in fuel cells to generate electricity
404841 i didnt really agree with it i feel like hes given a lot i feel like hes one of the greatest hitters in the mlb
404842 to give him up in a pennant race is tough i dont know what happened behind the scenes but its tough i thought he brought a lot to red sox nation
404843 its a shame that you always give someone up in the year of free agency they should have held onto him until the end of the year wow eight years
404844 we miss manny we liked manny best pure hitter in the major leagues
404845 i dont think they should have traded him but it happens
404846 the red sox dont deserve a player like me during my years here ive seen how they have mistreated other great players when they didnt want them to try to turn the fans against them
404847 i know mark murphy talked to me about it in the past how important it was for brett to continue to be part of the organization after he was done playing
404848 and frankly its good for brett brett needs to stay a part of football obviously hes a part of the green bay packers
404849 the commissioner will take no action today on brett favres reinstatement request discussions are continuing between the packers and brett
404850 there isnt a perfect solution to this but mark murphy is at least trying
404851 we know what they want and where i stand his solution although awkward and unsettling for most may be the best in the end
404852 you could hand me a billion dollars and im still going to be on the field
404853 it doesnt matter to me but everyone has different situations has different views on money money is not more important than football to me right now
404854 hes ready to go back but he cant go back until the commissioner reinstates him
404855 our starting pitcher kept us in the game and gave us a chance to win thats all you can ask for
404856 we got a couple of good breaks in the sixth
404857 we didnt have good at bats we didnt do the things weve been doing all year
404858 sometimes you need to see a pitcher a second or third time
404859 we left guys on base but most of it was that we had selfish at bats we werent trying to go the other way
404860 stanclift was throwing mostly fastballs and we were trying to hit home runs he left some out on the corner and we didnt shoot them the other way like we usually do
404861 it seemed like he was fully in control i read a lot about how he didnt allow a run earned or unearned for portsmouth high school last season you shouldnt be able to do that in wiffle ball i know portsmouth dropped to class i but when i saw him today i knew he was the real deal
404862 my fastball the two seamer is my go to pitch and that was working today my curveball was working too with those two pitches i felt pretty confident
404863 the kids hit the ball and goffstown made some mistakes
404864 we got some breaks today if we can play solid defense and hit the ball well be all right
404865 it hurts me so much to miss the olympics and the u s open you have no idea
404866 kozens has some really good speed at running back if i had those running backs and that line i think id run the ball and see what happens we know if we cant stop the run were going to get a heavy dose of that weve told our front seven that
404867 we could run 80 percent spread and 20 percent i or we could go 80 percent i and 20 percent spread we just dont know right now well see how they react to both sets
404868 size wise i do like the way we match up this year
404869 i really like our two big tight ends adam chicoine burlington and andrew baker rutland
404870 in practice we looked really polished were ready were game ready
404871 these are the same people who have spent decades and millions of dollars to hide the problem
404872 i agree because i dont think we can ever do enough
404873 there is no way to fully repair damage done to a child
404874 psychosexual immaturity expressed in heterosexual or homosexual activity was encountered often virtually all of these priests were suffering from a severe to moderate frustration neurosis
404875 it was hugely prophetic the description it gives of underdeveloped priests closely resembles the profile of priests who have sexually abused children and adolescents unfortunately those to whom it was presented did not heed it at all
404876 if the catholic church saw the writing on the wall in 1971 and ignored it and didnt provide counselling it is tantamount to bad practice and maladministration which will be the foundation for any action in negligence it seems to be a highly damaging report
404877 it is about time the church stopped making excuses and started to address the issue of the real pain caused to the victims

404884 i hope that maybe we can try and get together in the next week or two and sort something out
404885 at the moment my energies are focused on bringing in new players we have a certain amount of money to improve what we have got here
404886 i will not bring in just for the sake of it
404887 we need to bring in three or four main players that are going to cost big money and my standards are that high that im not going to bring them down

404954 a hist ria do mundo foi dominada pelos chineses a maior parte do tempo a china foi o pa s mais rico do mundo quase at o s culo xix se voltar a se tornar a maior economia do mundo no s culo xxi ter o sido apenas dois s culos com os ocidentais frente diante de um mar de s culos de dom nio chin s
404955 eles conduzem sua pol tica externa com a id ia de que melhor chegar a um consenso do que os pa ses se baterem para um ficar com tudo e outro com nada
404956 de modo geral o confucionismo marca o desenvolvimento da china uma linha que enfatiza que deve haver uma ordem no estado que seja harm nica com a ordem do universo no terreno social isso se expressa muito nas rela es de fam lia no respeito filial
404957 o confucionismo enfatiza mais a quest o do consenso n o como o liberalismo ocidental segundo o qual as opini es diferentes existem na sociedade devem se chocar e que ven a o melhor no confucionismo n o h a vis o de que um deve ganhar e outro perder deve haver longas discuss es at que se chegue a uma situa o de consenso que seja aceit vel por todos n o que os indiv duos se apaguem mas que as id ias sejam aceit veis para todos e como se chega a isso por meio de uma ordem de certa forma patriarcal os mais jovens obedecem aos mais velhos e dentro da fam lia o homem o dono da casa
404958 h quem considere que o comunismo enfatize justamente a rebeli o e a luta de classes outros enxergam que o comunismo como forma de poder na china recriou a figura do imperador em mao tse tung por exemplo claro que num outro contexto na realidade se voc tirar os r tulos de imperador e de chefe do partido comunista s o muito parecidas as formas como essas figuras atuam
404959 os membros do partido n o colocam suas posi es de forma antag nica e da sai um vencedor as decis es s o tomadas a partir de consensos
404960 os chineses t m muito medo do luan caos j houve v rios momentos de caos na hist ria chinesa com grandes fomes por exemplo a pr pria revolu o cultural foi um grande caos
404961 antes do comunismo e depois da queda do imp rio havia diversas correntes minorit rias de pensamento liberal a china centralizou o poder antes de cristo mas de tempos em tempos houve grandes rebeli es nessas pocas de rebeli o houve alguns elementos do que poderia ser chamado democracia
404962 os comunistas t m uma vis o de democracia diferente da democracia burguesa para eles a democracia n o se resume a elei es livres e multipartidarismo tem que haver tamb m o que eles chamam de democracia econ mica por essa vis o os meios de produ o n o podem estar em m os privadas porque do contr rio os detentores desses meios t m maior poder de influ ncia

404974 this country with its institutions belongs to the people who inhabit it whenever they shall grow weary of the existing government they can exercise their constitutional right of amending it or their revolutionary right to dismember it or overthrow it
404975 i cannot undertake to lay my finger on that article of the constitution which granted a right to congress of expending on objects of benevolence the money of their constituents
404976 the constitutions of most of our states and of the united states assert that all power is inherent in the people that they may exercise it by themselves that it is their right and duty to be a all times armed that they are entitled to freedom of person freedom of religion freedom of property and freedom of the press
404977 the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism
404978 mr president former secretary of state colin powell says the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism
404979 if a former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and former secretary of state feels this way dont you think that americans and the rest of the world are beginning to wonder whether youre following a flawed strategy
404980 if theres any comparison between the compassion and decency of the american people and the terrorist tactics of extremists its flawed logic
404981 its just i simply cant accept that its unacceptable to think that theres any kind of comparison between the behavior of the united states of america and the action of islamic extremists who kill innocent women and children to achieve an objective

404988 the tools of conquest do not necessarily come with bombs and explosions and fallout there are weapons that are simply thoughts attitudes prejudices to be found only in the minds of men

404990 a media campaign to create a wedge between the american people and their government
404991 in the 1920s a failed austrian painter published a book in which he explained his intention to build an aryan super state in germany and take revenge on europe and eradicate the jews
404992 the world ignored hitlers words and paid a terrible price

405024 its a fast road and then there is a roundabout and people just dont slow down quickly enough
405025 the exit and entrance roads join on to the a1 so if you are going north you have to cross the carriageway and join the traffic so these are difficult junctions and obviously busy when people are going to and from work
405026 we would have to look at how the volume of traffic on the road has increased
405027 and we dont know what the level of accidents would have been if dualling had not taken place
405028 it could be something as simple as improving lighting at junctions the a1 is popular with people who do not know the area so perhaps improved signage would help

405048 it is in the opinion of mr todd noteworthy that at each scene some personal materials and documents such as id cards were found relating to the bombers although they were damaged to some extent they did not show the damage that would be expected if they were on the body of the bomber or in the rucksack suggesting that in each case they had been deliberately separated by some distance from the actual explosion

405063 a few years ago we began requesting bottles of hand sanitizer along with our request for tissues and other items
405064 now every classroom has a large bottle with a hand pump right inside the classroom door
405065 students never miss the chance to use the hand sanitizer they love it
405066 now when children are coming in from recess or going to lunch without time for a restroom break they get a squirt of the gel

405112 an anal fistula is a narrow tunnel like passage that connects the remains of an old anal abscess to the surface of the skin the opening of the fistula eventually becomes plugged with draining debris causing the abscess to flare up again as a firm pocket of pus but dont worry it doesnt affect the act

405115 just when you think nothing better could happen she flips the dildo stick out of her pussy and catches it in her mouth and the plate is still spinning up there have you ever seen anything like it
405116 she can keep that plate going like that even with shit in her mouth

405189 to validate the statute an individual must have the specific intent to inflict severe pain or suffering
405190 because specific intent is an element of the offense the absence of specific intent negates the charge of torture
405191 such as death organ failure or serious impairment of body functions
405192 that statute defined an emergency medical condition that warranted certain health benefits as a condition manifesting itself by acute symptoms of sufficient severity including severe pain such that the absence of immediate medical care might reasonably be thought to result in death organ failure or impairment of bodily function
405193 the health benefits statutes use of severe pain had no relationship whatsoever to the torture statute and even if it did the health benefit statute did not define severe pain rather it used the term severe pain as a sign of an emergency medical condition that if not treated might cause organ failure and the like olcs clumsily definitional arbitrage didnt seem even in the ballpark

405213 and i must say i am impressed you have brought more suffering to this land that i could have ever dreamed to your attempts at rule and law and civilization have only alienated the inhabitants and furthermore have within them fostered a hatred of their very existance that i could never have instilled upon them
405214 after your noble attempts at supplanting my rule i drifted beyond the walls of existence
405215 so i stayed outside reality and allowed my strength and power to grow i saw every single thing that you were doing and each act that you committed against the people of my world was like a single drop of water now that i have returned i see that your drops have accumulated to a gigantic mass impossible to withstand and my first action as the returned lord of this realm is to destroy the floodgates and watch the mayhem ensue
405216 mthlzzt you did nothing for these people you merely encouraged them to behave as savages if they desired you merely allowed them

405251 another 1 f of warming in the next few decades
405252 global emissions of heat trapping gases are now increasing even more rapidly than the highest emissions scenario scientists have been analyzing
405253 crops show mixed responses to lower levels of warming but higher levels of warming often negatively affect growth and yields
405254 to reach 90 percent certainty in any scientific work is remarkable but the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc has reached this unusual state
405255 historical climate and weather patterns are no longer an adequate guide to the future
405256 the ccsp program initiated within the bush administration offered the opportunity to provide an independent assessment of the role of humans and natural variability in the climate system as well as a comprehensive framework for reducing societal and environmental vulnerability to risk from climate variations and change through adaptation and mitigation the ccsp process however has not succeeded in this goal
405257 historical climate and weather patterns are no longer an adequate guide to the future

405291 didatangkan untukku buraq yang merupakan hewan putih panjangnya diatas himar dan dibawah bagal kukunya berada di akhir ujungnya
405292 sesungguhnya aku hanya diberi harta itu karena ilmu yang ada padaku
405293 moga moga kiranya kita mempunyai seperti apa diberikan kepada qarun sesungguhnya ia benar benar mempunyai keberuntungan yang besar
405294 kecelakaan yang besarlah bagimu pahala allah adalah lebih baik bagi orang orang yang beriman dan beramal saleh
405295 aduhai benarlah allah melapangkan rezeki bagi siapa saja yang dia kehendaki dari hamba hamba nya dan menyempitkannya kalau allah tidak melimpahkan karunia nya atas kita benar benar dia telah membenamkan kita pula aduhai benarlah tidak beruntung orang orang yang mengingkari nikmat allah
405296 dan juga qarun firaun dan haman dan sesungguhnya telah datang kepada mereka musa dengan membawa bukti bukti keterangan keterangan yang nyata akan tetapi mereka berlaku sombong di muka bumi dan tiadalah mereka orang orang yang luput dari kehancuran itu maka masing masing mereka itu kami siksa disebabkan dosanya maka diantara mereka ada yang kami timpakan kepadanya hujan batu kerikil dan diantara mereka ada yang ditimpa suara keras yang mengguntur dan diantara mereka ada yang kami benamkan ke dalam bumi dan diantara mereka ada yang kami tenggelamkan dan allah sekali kali tidak hendak menganiaya mereka akan tetapi merekalah yang menganiaya diri mereka sendiri
405297 dan ingatlah ketika ibrahim dan ismail meninggikan fondasi baitullah sedang dia berkata ya tuhan kami terimalah amal kami
405298 dan orang orang yang memberikan apa yang telah mereka berikan dengan hati bergetar
405299 semoga allah melimpahkan rahmat kepada ibu ismail jika dia membiarkan zamzam atau jika dia tidak menciduk airnya niscaya zamzam menjadi mata air yang mengalir
405300 kemudian dia megirim satu atau dua orang utusan ternyata mereka menemukan air mereka kembali memberitahukan ihwal air maka mereka mendekatinya
405301 saat itu ibu ismail berada di sekitar air mereka berkata kepadanya apakah engkau megizinkan kami untuk tinggal di dekat airmu dia menjawab boleh saja namun kalian tidak berhak atas air ini mereka menjawab baiklah
405302 pada saat itu mereka belum memiliki makanan pokok berupa biji bijian seandainya mereka punya niscaya ibrahim akan mendoakannya supaya biji bijian itu diberkati
405303 daging dan air memang ada pada selain penduduk mekkah namun tidak cocok menjadi makanan pokok
405304 kemudain ibrahim meninggalkan mereka selama beberapa waktu seelah itu dia datang lagi sementara ismail tengah meraut anak panah di bawah pohon dauhah dekat sumur zamzam ketika ismail melihatnya dia bangkit dan terjadilah adegan yang maklum terjadi antara anak dan ayahnya dan ayah dengan anaknya ibrahim berkata hai ismail sesungguhnya allah memberiku sebuah perintah ismail berkata lakukanlah apa yang diperintahkan oleh tuhanmu ibrahim berkata apakah kamu akan membantuku ismail menjawab aku akan membantumu ibrahim berkata sesungguhnya allah menyuruhku membuat suatu rumah di sana ibrahim menunjuk ke tumpukan tanah yang lebih tinggi dari sekelilingnya

405306 allah swt berfirman memberitahukan nikmat keutamaan dan kebaikan nya yang telah dianugerahkan kepada hamba hamba nya yang beriman dalam menghadapi dan mengalahkan musuh musuhnya pada saat mereka terkepung
405307 di situlah diuji orang orang mukmin dan digoncangkan hatinya dengan goncangan yang sangat dasyat
405308 hai orang orang yang beriman ingatlah akan nikmat allah yang telah dikaruniakan kepadamu ketika datang kepadamu tentara tentara lalu kami kirimkan kepada mereka angin topan dan tentara yang tidak dapat kamu melihatnya dan adalah allah maha melihat akan apa yang kamu kerjakan
405309 mengapa kamu melakukan perbuatan tercela itu yang belum pernah dikerjakan oleh seorangpun di dunia ini sebelummu kamu mendatangi lelaki untuk melepaskan nafsumu bukan kepada wanita bahkan kamu ini adalah kaum yang melampaui batas
405310 akan kutunjukkan kepada kalian suatu lubang yang dapat menghalangi seruan luth
405311 tidak akan kukatakan hal itu kecuali aku mendapat sekeping perak sebagai upahnya
405312 kalian harus bekerjasama dengan isteri luth untuk menghentikan seruannya kepada kalian
405313 dengar baik baik peranan isteri luth sama seperti perananku bagi kalian sekarang ini
405314 jadi apakah kamu berharap agar isteri luth dapat menunjuki kami siapa orang orang yang dapat memenuhi keinginan kami sebagaimana yang engkau lakukan kini
405315 hai anakku adakah seteguk air yang dapat menghilangkan dahaga yang kurasakan ini
405316 kami hidup bersama suamiku luth namanya dan dua anak perempuanku
405317 aku tidak sengsara bahkan rumah ini cukup bagi kami dan aku mempunyai suami yang memberiku makan dan minum bersama kedua puteriku
405318 dapatkah ruangan seperti ini disebut rumah dapatkah yang engkau teguk dan engkau rasakan ini disebut makanan atau minuman
405319 panggillah aku dengan sebutan ibu bukankah kedudukanku seperti ibu saudaramu
405320 sesungguhnya semua ini adalah kemiskinan dan kesengsaraan hidup yang membawa kemalangan bagimu hai anakku mengapa kamu tidak masuk ke rumah orang orang kaya di antara kaummu tidakkah kamu melihat kehidupan mereka yang penuh kemegahan kesenangan dan kenikmatan kamu berparas cantik hai anakku tidak layak kamu membiarkan kecantikanmu itu dalam kemiskinan hina begini tidakkah kamu sedari bahwa kamu tidak mempunyai anak lelaki yang dapat bekerja untuk memberimu makan kelak apabila suamimu meninggal dunia
405321 hai anakku apakah yang dikerjakan suamimu bagaimana hubungannya dengan penduduk negeri sadom dan kampung kampung kecil di sekelilingnya sesungguhnya orang orang di sini menginginkan sesuatu yang dapat menyenangkan hati mereka sesuai dengan yang mereka kehendaki dan sesuatu yang dicarinya itu dapat menjadi sumber penghasilan dan kekayaan bagi orang yang mahu membantu mereka lihatlah lihatlah hai anakku kepingan kepingan emas dan perak ini sesungguhnya emas dan perak bagiku adalah barang yang mudah kuperolehi aku menunjukkan kepada kaumku beberapa lelaki berwajah cantik yang datang dari kota sedangkan kamu di rumahmu sering datang beberapa pemuda dan remaja lelaki kepada suamimu ya suamimu yang seruannya diperolok olok oleh kaum kita pekerjaan semacam ini sebenarnya tidak memberatkan kamu suruhlah salah seorang puterimu menemui sekelompok kaum kita dan memberitahu mereka akan adanya lelaki tampan di rumahmu dengan demikian engkau akan memperoleh emas atau perak sebagai hadiahnya setiap kali engkau kerjakan itu bukankah pekerjaan itu amat mudah bagimu dengan itu engkau bersama puteri puterimu dapat merasakan kenikmatan sesuai dengan apa yang kalian kehendaki
405322 perempuan tua itu telah menasihatimu ia tidak mengharapkan sesuatu kecuali kebaikan dan kebahagiaan bagimu kamu tidak bertanggungjawab atas apa yang dilakukan oleh kaummu dan lagi pekerjaan yang dicadangkan perempuan tua itu sama sekali tidak memberatkanmu kamu hanya memberitahu mereka tentang kedatangan tamu tamu suamimu luth lekaslah lekaslah nanti akan kukatakan lekas supaya engkau memperoleh kekayaan dan kenikmatan cepatlah
405323 mengapa kalian mengerjakan perbuatan tercela itu yang belum pernah diperbuat oleh seorangpun di dunia ini sebelum kalian sesungguhnya kalian mendatangi lelaki untuk melepaskan nafsu kalian bukan kepada wanita bahkan kalian ini adalah kaum yang melampaui batas
405324 jika engkau selalu menolong kami nescaya engkau akan dapatkan terus sekeping perak sementara suamimu tidak dapat menyeru kepadanya
405325 datangkanlah kepada kami azab dari allah jika kamu termasuk orang orang yang benar
405326 ya tuhanku tolonglah aku dengan menimpakan azab atas kaum yang berbuat kerusakan itu
405327 dia luth merasa susah dan sempit dadanya karena kedatangan mereka
405328 kali ini tidak kurang dari empat potong emas harus kuterima
405329 kalian akan memperoleh apa yang kalian kehendaki iaitu dua orang lelaki yang berwajah tampan
405330 inilah harta untukmu tetapi cepat katakan di mana lelaki yang berwajah tampan itu
405331 bukakan luth bukalah pintu pintumu kalau tidak kami terpaksa akan memecahkannya
405332 sesungguhnya engkau telah tahu bahwa kami tidak mempunyai keinginan terhadap puteri puterimu dan sesungguhnya kamu tentu mengetahui apa yang sebenarnya kami kehendaki
405333 sesungguhnya kami adalah utusan utusan tuhanmu sekali kali mereka tidak dapat mengganggu engkau

405384 i have a special affection for him an admiration and a respect for everything he has done he should remain an example to all youngsters
405385 it is a sad moment for me but he has made the right decision

405390 the governments seizure of indymac bank raises concerns for many consumers about whether their banks might be next
405391 those who are trenched in more risky business who are feeling more heavy losses may be at more risk
405392 i think the important point to make is that historically only a very small percentage of the banks on our problem banks list ever failed
405393 while there are 90 banks on the list there would be no expectation that 90 of those banks would fail
405394 consumers may want to pick an institution that has a substantial brand
405395 but you dont necessarily want to run to a big bank because you think a smaller bank is going to fail
405396 as mortgage money becomes harder to get and real estate prices go down even more the solvency of many banks is called into question
405397 the fed is moving to protect the solvency of the banking industry by maintaining integrity
405398 one must have a bit of faith in the fdic that they are going to be able to take care of whomever fails
405399 were a bit threadbare right now the players i have here are all ive got
405400 bobo balde is here and is looking to move on and we have two young kids we really need to get players back fit
405401 they have luka modric david bentley dimitar berbatov then the left back gareth bale comes on and hes worth 12m
405402 its easy for them to progress when they have money to spend we dont have that money and we have to do our best with what weve got and make players better
405403 what are our limits do you get half a bentley a quarter of bentley do we get bentleys right leg
405404 if you said to juande ramos to get rid of all his top players and give him x amount and say get to the champions league last eight he would just laugh at you
405405 we know that its nothing new and were not complaining
405406 this teaching is founded in the old and new testament and the fidelity to scripture and to apostolic tradition is absolute
405407 homosexuality is a disordered behaviour the activity must be condemned the traditional approach to homosexuality is comprehensive a clear declaration about this theme must come from the anglican communion
405408 for those children who were separated from their families or even orphaned by the cyclone the future is uncertain
405409 the number of childrens homes and orphanages is on the rise but it is not only orphans who end up living there children whose parents are still alive are being sent to institutions because nobody has yet traced their parents or extended families and those currently looking after them cant afford to continue to support them
405410 save the children has clearly demonstrated that aid given to myanmar can be effective and make a dramatic difference whilst still meeting international standards of accountability
405411 if donors break their promises and fail to give generously to the survivors of the cyclone they will be punishing the children of myanmar for a government that they have no control over
405412 i think the fbi owes us a complete accounting of their investigation and ought to be able to tell us at some point how were going to bring this to closure
405413 its been seven years theres a lot of unanswered questions and i think the american people deserve to know more than they do today
405414 we need to know exactly how mr ivins was involved if he was involved how this relates to the case and information that so far has been withheld from the american people ought to be provided

405447 we have strong evidence that the other driver ran a red light

405667 we encourage people to send us their views on our services so we can change for the better
405668 we always expected the number of complaints to go up in line with the promotion of the service the areas that people often highlight are the services that are most visible which is why transport and highways and schools are top of the list
405669 a section of wire has been taken from the houses we are told there is not much value in scrap metal we are getting more and more calls coming in about this
405670 there has been approximately a metre taken from each house its not personal and it looks random
405671 it happened early on tuesday morning between 4am and 10am i noticed because i was in the middle of recording a programme
405672 if you are going to cut it you just do it and take off someones known that cut cant be repaired
405673 it is not for copper or they would have taken more of the cable and it is not worth it
405674 it must have been someone who is right handed and used pliers or side cutters
405675 there was only an inch of cable left why would they want to do that for it cost us about 30 to repair if it happens again we are going to put metal over them

405686 circumcision with this technique promises to be faster safer and more acceptable to patients than conventional surgical circumcision methods
405687 circumcision is the only new hiv prevention method to demonstrate consistent efficacy in randomized controlled trials
405688 the beauty of this device is its simple innovative design
405689 although many male circumcision devices are available they have not gained widespread acceptance due to high complication rates or difficulties with surgical technique
405690 even non physician health care providers will be able to learn this procedure to safely perform circumcisions in resource poor regions

405693 new therapies have a positive influence on the course of the disease but are often not initiated at early stages since the diagnosis of ms is not yet established
405694 in general our results show that mutations in the filaggrin gene are extremely strong risk factors for atopic dermatitis and beyond that for hay fever in the case of pre existing eczema they may also cause asthma
405695 we are now interested in finding out the precise consequences of filaggrin mutations
405696 the next thing to do is to examine the metabolic pathway of this important protein in addition we want to clarify which molecular mechanisms play a role at the genetic level but also concerning the protein itself then the final aim of course is to find a therapy for patients with atopic diseases
405697 if a lack of filaggrin is such an important factor in allergic diseases it would be almost conceivable to increase production of this protein or to replace its function in other ways
405698 climate change and its expected increase in global temperatures altered circulation of air masses and effects on local and regional weather patterns are expected to have profound impacts on the foraging and migratory behavior of insects birds and bats
405699 in contrast to organisms that depend strictly on terrestrial or aquatic existence those that routinely use the aerosphere are almost immediately influenced by changing atmospheric conditions e g winds air density precipitation air temperature sunlight polarized light moonlight and geomagnetic and gravitational forces
405700 appropriate integration of diverse tools and concepts for probing into the lives of organisms aloft can help inform important ecological and evolutionary concepts and management decisions associated with the spread of invasive species emergence of infectious diseases altered biodiversity and sustainability of terrestrial aquatic and aerospheric environments
405701 the room had to be dark for the good reason that a sharp image requires a small pinhole but a small pinhole also produces a dim image
405702 to get a brighter image without lenses you have to use many pinholes the problem then becomes how to assemble the information including depth information from the overlapping shadow images this is where coded apertures come in
405703 what would happen if we put a ura right next to an object we were imaging with the x ray beamline it should allow us to create a holographic image one with orders of magnitude more intensity than a standard hologram
405704 imaging with coherent x rays will be a key technique for developing nanoscience and nanotechnology and massively parallel holography will be an enabling tool in this quest
405705 this exhibition provides visitors with an opportunity to explore the origins and rationale for nazi germanys racial policies and to understand how such policies contributed to the holocaust
405706 our interest in using genomics to study metabolic diseases led us to screen dna from liver cells that expressed foxa2 with an assay called chip on chip
405707 we were surprised that a cluster of genes involved in lipid and steroid metabolism was identified by being bound to foxa2
405708 in order to lay the groundwork for developing new treatments we have to determine how foxa2 itself is regulated

405811 of any moralising or demoralising effect that muhammads teaching had upon his followers we cannot say with precision
405812 warfare is ordained for you though it is hateful unto you but it may happen that you hate a thing which is good for you and it may happen that you love a thing which is bad for you allah knoweth you knew not
405813 they question you o mohammed with regard to warfare in the sacred month say warfare therein is a great transgression but to turn men from the way of allah and to disbelive in him and the inviolable place of worship and to expel its people thence is a greater transgression for persecution is worse than killing
405814 by him who holds my soul in his hands anyone who fights for me today will go to paradise
405815 rejoice here lies the head of the enemy of allah praise allah for there is no other but he
405816 o people of the pit have you found that what allah threatened is true now for i have found that what my lord promised was true rejoice all muslims
405817 o prophet who will look after my children if i should die
405818 o prophet exhort the believers to fight if there be of you 20 steadfast they will overcome 200 and if there be of you a 100 they shall overcome a 1000 because the disbelievers are a folk without intelligence
405819 it is not for any prophet to have captives until he hath made slaughter in the land you desire the lure of this world and allah desires for you the hereafter and allah is mighty wise now enjoy what you have won as lawful and good and keep your duty to allah lo allah is forgiving merciful
405820 will no one rid me of this daughter of marwan
405821 you have done a service to allah and his messenger her life was not worth even two goats
405822 no by god i will not let you go until you deal kindly with my allies 400 men without armour and 300 with who have always supported me against enemies and you want to slay them all in one morning by god if i were in your place i would fear a reversal of fortune
405823 lo the worst of beasts in allahs sight are the ungrateful who will not believe
405824 those of them with whom you made a treaty and then at every opportunity they break their treaty and they keep not duty to allah if you come on them in the war deal with them so as to strike fear in those who are behind them so that they may remember
405825 this rebate will be enough to offset the increased cost of gas for a working family over the next four months
405826 or if you live in a state where it gets very cold in the winter it will be enough to cover the entire increase in your heating bills or you could use the rebate for any of your other bills or even to pay down debt
405827 and if ye have recieved a blow the disbelievers have recieved a blow the like thereof these are the vicissitudes which we cause to follow one another for mankind to the end that allah may know those who believe and may choose witnesses from among you and allah loveth not wrong doers and that allah may prove those who believe and may strike the disbelievers
405828 when you climbed the hill and paid no heed while the messenger mohammed in your rear was calling you to fight therefore he rewarded you grief for his grief that he might teach you not to sorrow either for that which you missed or for that which befell you allah is informed of what you do
405829 who will rid me of the dog kaab ibn al ashraf
405830 leave my city and live here no longer after the treason which you have plotted against me
405831 he it is who hath caused those of the people of the scripture jews who disbelieved to go forth from their homes unto the first exile
405832 and if allah had not decreed migration for them he verily would have punished them in this world and theirs in the hereafter is the punishment of the fire
405833 that is because they were opposed to allah and his messenger and whoso is opposed to allah for him verily allah is stern in reprisal
405834 whatsoever palm trees you cut down or left standing on their roots it was by allahs leave in order that he might confound the evil livers
405835 it was allah surely who saved you from the company of the oppressive non believers
405836 and zayd the freedman of muhammad counted his freedom as naught compared with the service of muhammad and islam
405837 the punishment of those who wage war against allah and his messenger and strive with might and main for mischief through the land is execution or crucifixion or the cutting and removing off of hands and feet from opposite sides or exile from the land that is their disgrace in this world and a heavy punishment is theirs in the hereafter
405838 and many gains will they pious muslims acquire besides and allah is exalted in power full of wisdom allah has promised you many gains that ye shall acquire and he has given you these beforehand and he has restrained the hands of men from you so that it may be a sign for the believers and that he may guide you to a straight path and other gains there are which are not within your power now but which allah has compassed for you and allah has power over all things
405839 and those of the people of the book jews who aided them meccans allah did take them from their strongholds and cast terror into their hearts so that some ye slew and some ye made prisoners and he made you heirs of their lands their houses and their goods and of a land which ye had not frequented before khaybar and allah has power over all things
405840 they are a hurt and a pollution so keep away from women in their courses menstrual periods and do not approach them until they are clean but when they are purified ye may approach them in any manner time or place ordained for you by allah for allah loves those who turn to him constantly and he loves those who keep themselves pure and clean
405841 o prophet why holdest thou to be forbidden that which allah has made lawful to thee thou seekest to please thy consorts but allah is oft forgiving most merciful allah has already ordained for you mohammed the dissolution of your oaths in some cases and allah is your protector and he is full of knowledge and wisdom
405842 we were lusting after women and chastity had become too hard for us but we wanted to get the ransom money for our prisoners
405843 you are not under any obligation to stop yourselves from doing it like that
405844 and all married women are forbidden unto you except those captives whom your right hand possesses
405845 hey muslims its a crime to go after married women but if they happen to be your captives which obviously all the non muslim women were feel free to indulge yourself in rape and sexual torture of them

405853 el optimismo es aprendido asegura andr s l pez pell psic logo director de la fundaci n para la salud y la educaci n funsaled y autor de investigaciones sobre el tema por lo tanto se mejora a trav s de distintos recursos entre ellos la psicoterapia se puede traer un bagaje gen tico que marque una tendencia o la influencia de aspectos de crianza pero todo es modificable el optimismo no es ingenuidad ni fantas a es un conjunto de expectativas respecto del futuro que nos permite interpretar verazmente la realidad si la canoa se est hundiendo se est hundiendo el punto es no llorar sino intentar nadar o aplicar otro recurso que siempre existen para ponerse a salvo
405854 se puede aprender a ver lo positivo de cada situaci n dice hirsch un psicoterapeuta de larga trayectoria hay personas que lo logran m s f cilmente que otras existen aquellos que lo hacen naturalmente pero todos podemos entrenarlo por medio de distintos m todos por ejemplo la autoconciencia y el autoconocimiento aprendiendo a identificar pensamientos negativos y cuestion ndolos si tenemos en claro la propensi n hacia el pensamiento negativo somos conscientes de la dificultad para ver lo positivo es un buen inicio
405855 despu s de 25 a os de estudiar la depresi n seligman dijo basta explica hugo hirsch entonces comenz a preguntarse por qu hab a muchos que en lugar de deprimirse eran o intentaban ser felices advirti que desde fines de la segunda guerra mundial o quiz s antes todas las disciplinas vinculadas con la salud mental se hab an ocupado nicamente de lo que andaba mal de recuperar lo roto por decirlo de alguna manera pero poco y nada se hab a investigado para trabajar con lo bueno
405856 por ejemplo enumera las caracter sticas familiares que tienen aquellos hogares con ni os m s sanos o c mo incide el sentimiento de esperanza en el proceso de curaci n de las enfermedades no es una escuela no hay un nico modelo lo que s existe es una b squeda de investigaciones cient ficas que demuestren c mo es posible que alguien desarrolle una virtud se parte de un supuesto que podemos ser felices y se busca identificar factores que conduzcan a eso y producir material cient fico con evidencia emp rica que permita que cualquiera los utilice por ejemplo est demostrado cient ficamente que la actividad f sica regular mejora el estado de nimo es bien pr ctico la informaci n les sirve tanto al profesional de la salud como al lego es una reacci n al nfasis de m s de 50 a os de b squeda de soluci n de la patolog a m s que identificar debilidades se busca se alar fortalezas y trabajar sobre ellas y es m s probable que se consigan resultados trabajando sobre fortalezas que sobre debilidades
405857 pero la psicolog a positiva se vincula tambi n con el concepto de resiliencia agrega hugo hirsch que ha sido tomado de la f sica y es la capacidad de los materiales de regresar a su estado inicial aunque hayan sido completamente alterados pero si lo utilizamos en psicolog a o en cualquier otra ciencia humana resiliencia quiere decir m s que eso y es por ejemplo la capacidad que muestran las personas por caso muchos ni os para atravesar circunstancias por dem s dif ciles o tr gicas y salir fortalecidos de eso todos estos a os aprendimos mucho sobre factores de riesgo sin embargo olvidamos que un factor de riesgo no es necesariamente una condena
405858 lo que se cree de las cosas es muchas veces una idea infundada que se adquiri a lo largo de la vida sin saber bien ni cu ndo ni c mo y que probablemente nunca haya sido sometida a un an lisis racional seligman afirma que a menudo muchas de las creencias son prejuicios y por lo tanto sumamente in tiles la indicaci n es tomar distancia de las explicaciones pesimistas al menos hasta verificar su certeza
405859 uno tiene que actuar como un detective buscando evidencias de esa creencia
405860 aunque se obtengan pruebas que apoyen esa creencia agrega el psic logo generalmente la realidad estar a favor de rebatirla porque las ideas pesimistas tienen un punto d bil suelen exagerar alg n aspecto de la realidad y los hechos pueden poner de manifiesto esas distorsiones generalmente asociadas a explicaciones catastr ficas los acontecimientos son siempre multideterminados y las personas pesimistas suelen aferrarse a las explicaciones m s negativas por eso la tarea consiste en desechar esa costumbre destructiva y habituarse a generar pensamientos m s realistas y l gicos
405861 lo que me pasa de malo es lo nico que me pasa abarca toda mi vida va a durar para siempre y yo soy responsable o culpable de eso
405862 durante mucho tiempo explica hugo hirsch se puso tanto nfasis en lo inconsciente que les hemos restado demasiada importancia a los aspectos conscientes que son los voluntarios pensar en t rminos positivos nos dispone a que algo salga razonablemente bien podemos ampliar nuestro margen de conciencia perfectamente la felicidad depende m s de desarrollar ese margen y con esa conciencia hacer algo porque de poco o nada sirve entender y entenderse sin autogesti n el autoconocimiento sin autogesti n no sirve para nada tengo que conocer mis recursos pero tambi n saber c mo administrarlos
405863 toda la sintomatolog a que corresponde al estilo som tico dice l pez pell
405864 cuando tambi n puede ser sin nimo de sabidur a por qu no mirarla tambi n de esta manera
405865 seligman envi a un delegado james pawelski que es hispanohablante para que asistiera a la reuni n de este a o comenta la psic loga sin disimular su entusiasmo y el a o pasado l mismo prolog la edici n especial de la revista psicodebate que edita la universidad dedicada completamente a art culos sobre psicolog a positiva
405866 uno es el respeto al aporte de las neurociencias dice la psic loga y otro el enfoque sociocultural hoy est demostrado que el medio ambiente no es s lo estresor y negativo sino que tambi n puede influir positivamente en el individuo la psicolog a positiva de hace eco de este esp ritu de poca y recupera temas que han sido olvidados a pesar de que tienen una importancia central en el bienestar de las personas entre stos los valores que constituyen en buena parte el capital ps quico del sujeto y que lo ayudan a buscar el bienestar a partir de sus posibilidades de sus propios recursos si se trabaja desde all es posible que las expectativas sean m s reales para cada uno de nosotros y enfrentemos menos frustraciones
405867 y no hablamos del perd n como sin nimo de reconciliaci n o de anular la demanda ante una ofensa o un delito es en realidad un trabajo de autoperd n para lograr que la propia persona no se sienta culpable el desarrollo de la capacidad de perdonar deber a integrar programas de promoci n y prevenci n de la salud porque son muchas las personas que podr an beneficiarse si tuvieran la posiblidad de hablar y reflexionar sobre el tema
405868 por la necesidad concreta de sobrevivir en ambientes m s adversos reflexiona por ahora para sectores m s ligados a lo intelectual no se trata de un pensamiento de primera l nea se lo ve facilista o simplista se lo asocia a la new age sin tener en cuenta que se gest y se est desarrollando en mbitos acad micos y cient ficos y tampoco se tiene en cuenta lo m s importante que contempla temas esenciales de la vida que recupera lo mejor de la psicolog a human stica y existencial y de la psicolog a social
405869 el balance de lo que se hizo durante el siglo xx es negativo dice martina casullo ensayando una sonrisa que oscila entre el realismo m s cruel y la t mida esperanza no hacen falta ni m s resentimientos y ni m s broncas tenemos que tener un prop sito y este enfoque puede ayudarnos a ir tras l

405872 they have us working jobs that we hate so we can buy stuff that we dont need
405873 were the people who do your laundry and cook your food and serve you dinner we make your bed we guard you while youre asleep we drive the ambulances we direct your call we are cooks and taxi drivers and we know everything about you we process your insurance claims and credit card charges we control every part of your life we are the middle children of history raised by television to believe that someday well be millionaires and movie stars and rock stars but we wont and we are just learning this fact tyler said so dont fuck with us
405874 okay so how are you going to tie all this together and show me something in thirty pages
405875 this is all good and well but where is this all going
405876 you can look at life ironically for years maybe decades there are people who seem to go through most of their lives seeing the funny side but in the end life always breaks you heart doesnt matter how brave you are or how much youve developed a sense of humour you still end up with your heart broken thats when you stop laughing in the end there is just the cold the silence and the loneliness in the end there is only death
405877 where can we buy enough food for them to eat
405878 two hundred days wages worth of food would not be enough for each of them to have a little bit

405884 they are used at dusty factories and other industrial sites as well as hospitals where they are used to prevent infections
405885 we provided the products to the committee in mid july and they are bringing them as a precaution
405886 the president of the united states of america can send troops into action abroad only by authorization of congress or if the united states of america is already under attack or serious threat the war powers act requires that the president notify congress within 48 hours of committing troops to military action and forbids troops from remaining for more than 60 days without an authorization of force or a declaration of war
405887 the president shall be commander in chief of the army and navy of the united states and of the militia of the several states when called into the actual service of the united states
405888 to declare war grant letters of marque and reprisal and make rules concerning captures on land and water

405890 to make rules for the government and regulation of the land and naval forces
405891 to provide for calling forth the militia to execute the laws of the union suppress insurrections and repel invasions
405892 to provide for organizing arming and disciplining the militia and for governing such part of them as may be employed in the service of the united states reserving to the states respectively the appointment of the officers and the authority of training the militia according to the discipline prescribed by congress
405893 provides that the president shall consult with congress before deploying us troops into

405919 a ts940 even when it was out of date it became a bit of a joke when it came out it was a 2000 radio im sure he wanted it at least as much as i want a 40d and the reason he never got it is because of me and my brothers
405920 people think i have a dream job but what they dont realize i might have two days to shoot one and half of which might be horrible weather and i have an anxious editor waiting at home with a file full of stock photos and a rolidex full of my competitors
405921 i saw a rather sinister group of individuals walking through regina on my way over to my meeting this morning lots of interest not that anyone knew what was going on i did however notice mothers holding their children more closely than usual as this lot went past
405922 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices
405923 if in order to get that passed we have to compromise in terms of a careful well thought out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage i dont want to be so rigid that we cant get something done
405924 its clear that members of both parties are following john mccains leadership toward an all of the above approach on energy that includes nuclear alternative energy and off shore drilling
405925 we hope barack obama will realize that his ongoing opposition to john mccains realistic energy solutions and additional off shore drilling is wrong
405926 the republicans and the oil companies have been really beating the drums on drilling and so we dont want gridlock we want to get something done
405927 if this practice is allowed to carry on and umno authorties did nothing to curb this i dont think i will get the necessary nominations
405928 places were the support for me is strong is now shaken as special attention was focused on these places
405929 although nominations at branch level are not official it reflects the grassroots support for certain leaders
405930 if more than 50 of the branches in a division nominate certain leaders it should be reflected in the nomination list submitted by the respective division he said
405931 the data would be used to gauge the actual sentiments on the grounds he added
405932 united 93 the shock absorbers are off the framing is epileptic and its a rare shot that lasts more than a millisecond
405933 the key elements of the risk benefit equation in the case of exelon are as follows the very modest efficacy of the drug is most apparent at higher doses which are also the doses at which the common and troublesome adverse events occur the lack of any readily apparent advantage and the presence of several readily apparent disadvantages when exelon is compared to donepezil the very high incidence of nausea 47 vomiting 31 and anorexia loss of appetite and their potentially serious consequences especially in this population the consequences of vomiting are potentially serious regardless of whether episodes are short lived and non recurrent or frequent
405934 i recommend that this application not be approved on the grounds that the risks of using the drug outweigh the possible benefits
405935 as with tacrine and donepezil there is no convincing evidence that rivastigmine markedly improves quality of life in patients with alzheimers disease or substantially alters progression of the disease
405936 we remain unconvinced of the value of currently available cholinesterase inhibitors in clinical practice
405937 it should again be noted that the beneficial effects of reminyl are small and similar to those of other cholinesterase inhibitors only a small minority of patients actually improve in relation to baseline and the efficacy of galantamine reminyl beyond six months of treatment is uncertain as randomized controlled studies longer than six months in duration have not been carried out there is also no evidence that galantamine has a disease modifying effect and at least some evidence that it may not
405938 galantamine produces modest improvements in measures of cognition and functioning in patients with mild to moderate alzheimers disease gastrointestinal symptoms have been the most common adverse effects whether galantamine offers any advantage over donepezil or rivastigmine remains to be established by comparative trials

405949 the child was already out of the water and was treated at the scene for minor grazes and the effects of being in cold water
405950 she was transferred to worcester royal hospital by ambulance with her parents who were at the scene for further assessment and treatment
405951 the man who bravely rescued the child believed to be in his late 20s had unfortunately suffered a suspected fractured ankle during the rescue and was stabilised at the scene
405952 he was also transferred to worcester royal hospital for further assessment and treatment
405953 the man who rescued the child must be praised for his actions he undoubtedly saved her from more serious or even fatal injuries
405954 it looked as though the girl had tripped we just heard a splash into the water and then suddenly this man seemed to come from nowhere vaulted the railings and jumped into the water
405955 it looked he had hurt his leg but he still grabbed onto the the girl because he was hurt he couldnt get her out of the water on his own but two other men came down and he handed her to them
405956 she didnt look to be badly hurt just shocked it looked like she had grazes on her face and some bruises
405957 it shook the whole house like an earthquake the van was right in the house
405958 i was extremely concerned when i heard the proposal being put forward by west midlands fire service relating to sedgley fire station
405959 i was assured that sedgley fire station would be operational again following the retraining of the firefighters
405960 i feel the people of sedgley have been badly let down and i believe the lives of the people of sedgley could be at risk if this closure goes ahead
405961 i think it would be irresponsible to shut the station and i cant see how crews would be able to get through
405962 i think it is important that the people of sedgley get the chance to have their say and i would urge people to contact them so i can pass their views on
405963 i think its a real shame i dont know whether its all down to the current climate and the fact that a recession could be on the way but its a terrible blow for wolverhampton
405964 what i would say to businesses is all is not lost it is a sad loss that the thing collapsed but we realise the economy is going through problems at the moment and we hope it gets better for everyone
405965 we have a team of 10 rail crime education managers that work across the uk in conjunction with community agencies

405970 just found out that her husband was having an affair
405971 the brutality and savagery shown by xing xings killers is something i have not come across before and beggars belief my sympathies are with her family today
405972 nothing will bring back their daughter but i hope they are able to draw some comfort from the fact that her killers have now been brought to justice
405973 tennis is a wonderful game and has been part of my life for the last 60 years

405983 the way you play football is to pass the ball better we gave the ball away 18 times in the first half and when you do that it means they have the ball for eight minutes

405989 wenn ergebnisse ausschlaggebend sein sollten dann sehe ich da auch kein problem
405990 bisher war ich deutlich der beste mercedes jahreswagenfahrer und wenn ergebnisse ausschlaggebend sein sollten dann sehe ich da auch kein problem ebenso wenig wie darin beide jobs zu machen das mache ich im augenblick ja auch und es st rt nicht meine konzentration auf die dtm

405993 aus dieser sicht vollbesch ftigung muss man sagen sind es gute werte und gute ergebnisse leicht merken wir in manchen bereichen eine konjunktureintr bung die sich aber im jahresverlauf derzeit noch nicht stark bemerkbar macht

406019 for it is not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats should take away sins
406020 and almost all things are by the law purged with blood and without shedding of blood is no remission
406021 in whom we have redemption through his blood the forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace
406022 and he is the propitiation for our sins and not for ours only but also for the sins of the whole world
406023 whom god hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past through the forbearance of god to declare i say at this time his righteousness that he might be just and the justifier of him which believeth in jesus
406024 for the grace of god that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men
406025 but we see jesus who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death crowned with glory and honour that he by the grace of god should taste death for every man
406026 therefore as by the offence of one judgment came upon all men to condemnation even so by the righteousness of one the free gift came upon all men unto justification of life
406027 the role of robert mugabe and the role of morgan tsvangirai in the envisaged co sharing government will have to be discussed by the negotiating parties i am not in any position of defining what his role would be
406028 what i would hope is that it will allow him mugabe a process of an honourable exit
406029 although of course i think he is ignorant or chooses to be in a denial stage as far as the violence is concerned
406030 that i cannot say because that is part of the negotiation process
406031 there have been sticking points some issues have been ironed out some issues are still outstanding we hope that as the negotiations proceed they will find a common compromise
406032 some people said it was unlikely that it wont happen
406033 the market is going to be soft for a couple of years
406034 while there is much uncertainty we expect weak economic growth and soft u s lodging demand to persist into 2009
406035 but the fact remains that the city and the state put money into the expanded convention center and you do not have enough rooms in town to fully utilize the center
406036 in order to book the convention center youve got to have the hotel rooms first in the long term it should increase lodging demand in the city because the city will be able to handle large groups
406037 we wanted a quiet presence of a building not flashy that would wear well over time
406038 the goal was to have this hotel feel uniquely baltimore
406039 its really nice to know when things like that happen that all your hard work is paying off
406040 its kind of hard to accept this but in some way i can enjoy being with my family for a little longer time

406044 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
406045 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
406046 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
406047 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
406048 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
406049 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
406050 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
406051 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
406052 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
406053 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
406054 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
406055 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
406056 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air

406082 el primero que cumpla los requisitos establecidos ser el equipo que ocupe la plaza n 14 y bajo ning n concepto se ampliar

406084 13 clubes que iban a conformar la leb bronce en su origen ni siquiera han sido consultados

406094 hoegh guldberg is on a winner here ignore the facts preach doom and get lots of money to continue you dodgy research
406095 corals are fascinating organisms whose survival is dependent on dinoflagellates that live inside the corals tissue
406096 the relationship between these dinoflagellates and corals has long been considered mutually beneficial with the dinoflagellates supplying the coral with food via photosynthesis in return for recycled nutrients and shelter over the last 20 years it has been made clear that there are many different types of dinoflagellates in corals and that the unions or symbiosis between a given coral and their dinoflagellates can be very specific

406101 if other marine species respond similarly and theres no evidence yet that they were in trouble
406102 the analogies are quite simple we observed a 25 percent reduction in fertilization success at reduced ph which is equivalent to a 25 percent reduction in the spawning stock of the species
406103 the current problem is being caused by the rate of increase of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere not the absolute level
406104 to put it simply the carbon dioxide is rising too quickly for the oceans natural buffering system to catch up
406105 we still have to win ballgames im going to give him time well see i talked to him about hitting third about what i required a third hitter to do without taking away his aggressiveness id like him to be a little more selective at the plate pick his pitch
406106 he has batted third most of his life and now well see
406107 we want the guys in the three four five spots to drive in runs as well as score runs cut down on the strikeouts we talked about the more accomplished hitter he could become like carlos lee to drive in runs and just an outstanding hitter like lance berkman
406108 ive hit two games no 3 in the big leagues but no matter what it is where im used to hitting
406109 with ken here there was no question who was hitting third and i dont make out the lineup im just ready to play every day i will say im used to it and thats where ive hit
406110 i made the best of it but hopefully this will let me get a little more comfortable and back to normal dusty told me i need to focus on quality at bats and swinging at good pitches sometimes i dont give myself a chance and itll come with experience
406111 it is going to be different now that kens gone its a new era he was the franchise since 2000 and now hes gone and were starting a new time with the reds and im ready for that
406112 im more comfortable in center than right but the plan from the beginning was for me to play right and i welcome that
406113 im sure there were some good things to take from this and i know there is a whole lot of bad things including the line score
406114 what doesn t kill you only makes you stronger unless they cut your arms off
406115 see theyre still attached you know what i ll wake up tomorrow get in here bust my butt and keep pushing forward one way or another i don t give a damn i m not going to let a couple of bad outings knock me down i m going forward no matter what it takes
406116 he is not hitting the corners he is over the heart of the plate those are low percentage spots if you are going to get hitters out at the big league level a lot of those balls were down the heart of the plate and they got a lot of hits again in a short period of time
406117 in the past the far right has taken over the cross of st george but the flag should be given back to the people
406118 those who are offended by the flag can stay offended because the fact of the matter is that by convention it is the cross of st george that flies above civic buildings a majority of the time
406119 the captain wear that c barry wore but i think they lost that particular c when barry quit wearing it
406120 and you guys the media have a lot to do with it
406121 you come up with the kid for griffey and with bruce almighty for jay bruce and that catches on whatever you want and whatever the organization wants
406122 but i think it is about time for me to step up and fill those shoes that griffey left do even better than ive done
406123 with griffey gone it is time for the team to step up and do what we have to do im sad hes gone he helped me made me what i am before he left he told me be yourself and thats what im going to do
406124 there arent a lot of guys you can always kid with and have him always be the same guy
406125 when he came into this room you knew what to expect
406126 the rumors are every year and then when the deadline passes and im not moved im happy i dont want to move during the season thats a huge hassle on everybody so im very relieved its over
406127 as for griffey on the day he was traded i asked him anything in the works he said nah and then it happened that day when he told me i thought he was lying like he always does
406128 from a selfish personal standpoint it is going to suck without him being around
406129 the first thing that came to my mind was wow ive been traded for ken griffey jr
406130 thats a guy i watched growing up one of my favorite players what an honor to be in the same trade as him
406131 theyve obviously done well being in first place without me to this point
406132 in search of winning a world series title that was important my kids are getting older and it wasnt the situation in seattle where i wanted to get closer to home it was a chance for me winning a title i think that was the biggest draw
406133 theres things that i can do to help this ballclub
406134 having a manager ozzie guillen who didnt hit very many home runs hes very keen on making sure you get the runner over and knock him in and thats the key to winning ball games ive been around for a little while so i understand the game

406142 the banking floor has a wonderful natural lighting provided by monumental triple hung divided lite wood windows
406143 the bank came in with samples of the materials and drawings of the proposed changes
406144 at that time they werent designated so it was more of a courtesy the bank was very much in favor of the designation here we had an example of a building owner that was welcoming the design and being a good citizen in taking care of their buildings its respected history and its place in the community
406145 were learning a lot about the history of the village and weve learned that respecting and recognizing the history of the village through its architectural resources is just a good form of planning
406146 the planning is really there to help maintain and build the villages pride in itself which helps businesses and brings in businesses and visitors and brings back your children to this place we call fairport so thats the part of the planning that is looking toward the future by recognizing the past

406177 there seems to be this code of silence or lack of trust of the police
406178 as long as im here on this island well be investigating
406179 if that was my child id do exactly what the parents are doing
406180 we were able to clarify at a most senior level there was absolutely no shift that had occurred
406181 we believe we are moving to a point where you will be in a position to report in an unfettered way
406182 there was firing on an indian post along loc in 12 brigade area of uri sector in baramulla district of kashmir valley yesterday

406184 on a chilly day she sat by the radiator and had her classbook in her hand
406185 she had that there if she wanted to smile or something she would put it over her face when smiling or chuckling so it wouldnt be obvious
406186 they had the name tags on and from their high school pictures she could remember where they sat in her class
406187 i said you dont think a high school teacher wont teach you grammar you have to know how to use who and whom and i made sure they knew i made sure they spelled and wrote not just read literature i pushed hard but i think they appreciated it
406188 i knew i wanted to be an english teacher when i was a little girl in our kitchen at home
406189 my mom was cooking my sister doing what she was doing and i was teaching
406190 if i didnt read the first few pages they would never get into it
406191 did you really read all of those books ms novelli
406192 if they were rambunctious or noisy id slam it down
406193 it made me look dictatorial or tough i wasnt any of that
406194 she had a wonderful sense of humor and was very considerate of the students
406195 she would listen to you if you had a family concern or if something was going on today we call them guidance counselors
406196 hai idea di quanto importante tu sia per me riesci a renderti conto di quanto ti amo
406197 if i can achieve for celtic what i have achieved for hibs then i feel i will have done well for them
406198 i enjoy being manager here because i like the people who support us
406199 celtic jerseys are not for second best they dont shrink to fit inferior players
406200 id far rather talk about players they are the people who make things happen
406201 have the first issue ready for the week after the scottish cup final and leave a blank space on page one for a picture of the boys with the cup
406202 i think it is important to win a match but i think what is even more important is the manner in which you win
406203 the most pleasure any manager can get is seeing everyday boys joining the club as youngsters and growing into men and giving themselves a better social standing than they could ever have dreamed of previously
406204 ach rangers are alright but they still havent invented blue grass
406205 is it alright if hes very cheeky that ah can skelp em
406206 if they were interested in what i had to say they would get here in time the door stays shut
406207 i think we could win everything in front of us i think this could be a season to remember
406208 jock if there were two players one catholic and one protestant who would you sign
406209 because i know that rangers would never sign the catholic
406210 surely there are enough celtic songs without introducing religion or politics or anything else
406211 i lost some friends when i made the move but if thats what matters to them then theyre not really friends at all
406212 this terrible tragedy must help to curb the bigotry and bitterness of old firm matches when human life is at stake this kind of hatred seems sordid and little fans of both sides will never forget this disaster
406213 it is up to us to everyone at celtic park to build up our own legends we dont want to live with history to be compared with legends from the past we must make new legends
406214 we all end up yesterdays men in this business yourre very quickly forgotten
406215 the best place to defend is in the opposition penalty box
406216 its not religion thats the problem its the lack of religion
406217 im happy where i am i like the people i work with i like the players and the directors of this club but most of all i like the fans and to see them happy makes me happy so im very happy here
406218 theres nothing wrong with losing your temper for the right reasons
406219 im sorry to leave but i just could not be a saleman
406220 if youre ever going to win the european cup then this is the day and this is the place but we dont just want to win this cup we want to do it playing good football to make neutrals glad weve won it glad to remember how we did it
406221 tell me the 9 oclock and 10 oclock mass are all ticket
406222 i am now going to tell him herrera how celtic will be the first team to bring the european cup back to britain but it will not help him in any manner shape or form we are going to attack as we have never attacked before cups are not won by individuals but by men in a team who put their club before personal prestige i am lucky i have the players who do just that for celtic
406223 we must play as if there are no more games no more tomorrows
406224 we dont just want to win the european cup we want to do it playing good football to make neutrals glad we won it pleased to remember how we did it
406225 coming here youve made history go out and play to you capability and enjoy yourself
406226 we did it by playing football pure beautiful inventive football
406227 there is not a prouder man on gods earth than me at this moment winning was important aye but it was the way that we have won that has filled me with satisfaction we did it by playing football pure beautiful inventive football there was not a negative thought in our heads inter played right into our hands its so sad to see such gifted players shackled by a system that restricts their freedom to think and to act our fans would never accept that sort of sterile approach our objective is always to try to win with style
406228 we hope that the next hands on the european cup are yours
406229 after all were a small country the finns and norwegians you dont get them saying were going to win the world cup
406230 we do have the greatest fans in the world but ive never seen a fan score a goal
406231 there should be a law against him he knows whats happening 20 minutes before anyone else
406232 i dont believe everything bill tells me about his players if they were that good theyd not only have won the european cup but the ryder cup the boat race and even the grand national
406233 i am proud to say that i knew jock stein as a manager as a colleague and as a friend he was the greatest manager in british football men like jock will live forever in the memory
406234 i always thought jock stein was the perfect international manager but you england dont have anyone like that you dont have jock steins youll never have a jock stein
406235 he would have been well within his rights to glorify himself in some way but that simply wasnt jocks style he was also a very intelligent man who played the press brilliantly i remember one day down at turnberry he invited me to join him at the press conference to which he turns up about 10 minutes early and plonks himself down on a chair outside the room along come the hacks and jock starts just loud enough for them to hear heres such and such coming big gambler this ones having it off with so and so he knew everything about them and they all knew that he knew
406236 jock do you want your share of the gate money or shall we just return the empties
406237 if he has useful players he trains them the right way and he encourages them to do what they are best at not to mention the other wee things you need in your game jock would then merge these things together its a form of socialism without the politics of course
406238 the greatest manager in the history of the game you tell me a manager anywhere in the world who did something comparable winning the european cup with a glasgow district xi
406239 the problem for us is that big jock and his players spoiled it for everyone who came after them
406240 hey son wit day yi want ma autogragh fur its they guys there you want to sign yer book

406247 the evidence is that these hips are being ordered and not being processed
406248 theyre being suspended until such time as a buyer is found
406249 i dont think it is within the spirit of the regulations actually i dont think it is within the regulations
406250 we dont condone flouting the law but i can certainly understand why they are doing it especially as the pack is completely useless to buyer and seller
406251 i have never yet had a buyer ask to see a home information pack on a property they ignore it it is usually when the solicitor asks to see if there is a pack there that we provide it
406252 the pack is of no interest to buyers and is considered to be a stealth tax by sellers
406253 it is incumbent on the government to ensure the regulations are policed
406254 when you have many young players you cannot keep them all the most important thing is that you develop them as a player and they have a big career
406255 at some stage you have to consider the quality of the player and what is in front of him
406256 there comes a moment when a player has to play to develop when you feel that you have to make a decision to let him go or keep him the fact that he is now a national team player proves it was the right decision
406257 i feel we deserve praise because we were not stupid and kept the player in the reserves
406258 over the past 10 years arsenal have been one of the top three clubs in developing young players

406267 i also want clarification in writing that peoples health and especially that of the children using the pool is not been affected by radiation

406280 i hired a campaign manager to win the servant towel award people like that dont deserve to win it
406281 however in hindsight i think it might have been better to have told him in front of john macarthur so that dad would just say grace to you
406282 he told me look we wont be remembering this at your thirtieth wedding anniversary

406295 ill be away from my desk invoking a john maneuver
406296 there are limits on what i will forge for you mr letoto

406302 being older and still single makes you more single more single than say katie mohler
406303 were talking about logic and about the law of non contradiction in worldviews and im pretty sure theres a law that says if theres food being given away and letoto is present then letoto is eating
406304 yeah the pee phrase kept coming out of order something about how he peed in worship it confused me

406349 you know what i want to see you pull off a jacket with boardshorts

406595 weve imported a dozen cuisines but not one set of manners to go with them the japanese for instance are swaddled with vast swathes of etiquette but were excused the lot
406596 just so you know the difference between etiquette and manners manners are english and inclusive etiquette is french and exclusive etiquette is an arcane list of arbitrary and pointless conventions that are laid down as pratfalls for the aspirational as an amusement for the unlovable its etiquette that points out to the girl next to you that shes drinking from the finger bowl its manners that insist you drink from yours to put her at ease

406603 kung malaki ang tae mo na parang tubo di kakayanin ng butthole mo yun malamang magsusugat nyahahaha pede mong gawing pamunas ang sariwang dahon ng bayabas ito ay mabisa to facilitate the healing wounds and cuts remember pag tinuli eh pinakuluang dahon ng bayabas din ang ginagamit na panghugas so same effect din yun sa sugat sa puwet mo
406604 what if kung malagkit naman ang tae mo at feeling mo magsasabitan ang mga yun sa hairs around your butthole the best solution diyan ay ang dahon ng niyog bakit kasi dual purpose yan ang gagawin mo tatanggalin ung dahon at iwan mo ung midrib yan ung ginagawang tingting gets save it for later use ung dahon na natanggal mo ang pamumunas mo pagkatapos ung tingting naman ang gagawin mong panungkit sa taeng nakasabit caution lang may kiliti sensation ito hahaha
406605 for big butts meron din dahon para sa kanila syempre wala ng iba kundi ang mala pamaypay na dahon ng anahaw wahehe pede mo itong upuan at igasgas ang puwet mo then solb ka na tulad ng dahon ng niyog pede mo rin gamitin ang midribs nito panungkit mas madami para sa mas malaki
406606 at meron din para sa dry ang skin aloe vera sagot jan hindi lang puwet mo ang lalambot pati buhok sa puwet mo puwede ng gamitin sa commercial coz you can feel the rain in your buttskin naks
406607 hmmm pede ka naman magdikdik ng dahon ng saluyot bulaklak ng gumamela o kaya okra di ba ang best jan pede mo itong paglaruan ganito gagawin mo lagyan ng sabon ang nadikdik na dahon bulaklak o bunga pagkatapos kumuha ng tingting gumawa ng paikot na pabilog sa dulo nito ipunas ang dikdik mixture sa butthole tapos itapat mo ang bilog na dulo ng tingting sabay utot ng malakas at may instant butthole bubbles ka na astig di ba

406620 they cannot accept me leaving him when i first left i went to a cousins home but every day they were delivering notes to my door saying i was a prostitute and deserved the same death as rand
406621 she was killed by animals every night when i go to bed i remember the face of rand calling for help while her father and brothers ended her life
406622 but they have sent a message saying that i am wrong for defending rand and that i should go back home and live like a blessed muslim woman
406623 if i had realised then what she would become i would have killed her the instant her mother delivered her
406624 i dont regret it i had the support of all my friends who are fathers like me and know what she did was unacceptable to any muslim that honours his religion
406625 i dont have a daughter now and i prefer to say that i never had one that girl humiliated me in front of my family and friends speaking with a foreign soldier she lost what is the most precious thing for any woman
406626 people from western countries might be shocked but our girls are not like their daughters that can sleep with any man they want and sometimes even get pregnant without marrying our girls should respect their religion their family and their bodies
406627 i have only two boys from now on that girl was a mistake in my life i know god is blessing me for what i did
406628 my sons are by my side and they were men enough to help me finish the life of someone who just brought shame to ours

406657 we need to update the computer to compensate for stellar drift the rides a little rough right now but once we work out exactly how to compensate for it itll be a lot more comfortable nobodys broken any bones so far anyway
406658 dont you idiots realize how simple it is to calculate the amendments somebody could be seriously injured this jobs got enough risks to it as it is
406659 there 5 thats all you need see that its implemented before my return trip youve got 40 minutes
406660 and if bowmans done what he should itll be a lot smoother on the way back
406661 i cant begin to imagine why you let it lapse for so long see that it doesnt happen again
406662 hold major carter here im going to pop this shoulder back in
406663 tealc what the hell happened i thought the planet was uninhabited were you running from hostiles
406664 we were unscathed as we entered the wormhole at a measured pace i suspect
406665 that captain bowman has made an error in compensating for stellar drift
406666 if he made a mistake or even worse did it deliberately im not going to responsible for my actions
406667 and i am confident that he will administer whatever punishment is appropriate if blame should be apportioned
406668 and if you need a blunt scalpel to carry out that procedure you just let me know
406669 shes regained consciousness theres nothing wrong with that thick skull of hers
406670 but she dislocated that shoulder again shes gonna be in a lot of pain for a while and im worried
406671 she may not get back full mobility in the joint theres only so many times you can put your body through that sort of trauma eventually it has to take its toll
406672 what about the tokra cant they help with a healing device
406673 but hammond says they cant get a hold of them havent been able to for weeks apparently
406674 if anyone can find the tokra its them ill get a hold of thor tell him to get his little grey butt onto it and jacobd be mad if he didnt help his daughter out
406675 sams going to need all the help she can get
406676 somethings happened hasnt it daniel says he doesnt know what it is but its sam isnt it
406677 sams okay i swear well she will be she had a bit of an accident on the way back shes hurt her shoulder again but shes okay just banged up we can take her home tomorrow as long as we make sure shes real careful
406678 shes going to be absolutely fine shell be in a lot of pain with her shoulder though were gonna try and find a way to fix that as soon as we can
406679 though try not to react to the bruises shes got a real shiner on her face itll only worry her more if you look scared
406680 and shes on a lot of painkillers so she may be a little out of it but shell feel better when she sees you
406681 sooner rather than later if we manage to get a hold of your dad
406682 the colonels getting the asgard on the case a few blasts of that healing device and youll be good as new

406697 its dead in the water not happening because the concert was a success there was hope of a tour but that was a lot of speculation it would be great if they would but as far as we know that is dead in the water
406698 all these cases that attract widespread publicity put huge pressure on the police and the prosecuting authorities to try to find the perpetrator and i sometimes feel that that pressure distorts the objectivity that would otherwise be present were the publicity to be absent
406699 in considering a case of this complexity the police and those responsible for the prosecution need to keep an open mind as far as possible as to who is responsible i think they did close their mind after the arrest of barry george
406700 we will be reflecting on todays verdict and considering how best to proceed
406701 any result like this is always difficult for family members because it re opens all the old wounds

406766 a very long break when we took a year off and hardly ever saw or spoke to each other
406767 we just turned up in nashville to record without any preconceptions
406768 it was just the process of getting back together and playing some music and just treating it as a pre production process
406769 i was surprised at how well the recordings were coming up itd been six months since wed played together as a band and even vocally after that length of time your voice tends to be not quite up to scratch
406770 but we were liking what we were hearing and realised this was good enough to use so we decided to cut every song weve written in the past four years put them down and wed probably have an album here
406771 he could see that there were three different songwriters and three different outlooks on everything
406772 so his approach was not to try and put in another opinion but to sit back and try and consolidate the opinions so there was no chopping or changing or tearing up things no re arranging the songs
406773 but when we sat down to record he was quite opinionated on the sort of instruments we played and where we played them but mainly he was focused on the sound of what we were playing
406774 part of the idea of going to nashville was because of our love of so many nashville made records over the years that had that special big and warm sound
406775 these guys are the masters of getting that sound it was important to us because weve walked away from completing all of our previous albums not extremely happy with the recorded sound
406776 the single sun dirt water has the best recorded sound that weve ever done
406777 ive never listened to any of the waifs records except this one now even my son goes to sleep with it
406778 it came at a time in our career where wed been working very hard for not much financial reward
406779 wed been working for 10 or 12 years playing our music but i was starting to think weve got to start earning some money i was getting pretty tired of the touring life and we really needed to start making some money out of this
406780 because logistically we live all over the world traditionally theres always been a bit of tension when were on tour when we became tired donna and i would be sniping at each other sister things
406781 josh and i were in a relationship that broke down so through all those years of touring there was that dynamic going on
406782 now we have a better relationship than we ever had before not just between josh and i but among all of us its a lot healthier now than it ever was
406783 i was in the bath id met my husband a few months earlier and we were falling in love
406784 i wrote the song as a letter to him just letting him know the things that were important to me and describing the road we were going to travel
406785 i dont really write any songs that im not personally part of
406786 but i think this is the best song ive written
406787 its the last song i wrote and i wrote it four years ago
406788 they never believed me but i really really had had enough
406789 i couldnt do it i was tired of the songs tired of doing the same thing for years after the last record i was sick of it i didnt have a life beyond that
406790 it was almost like the pregnancies put a stop on it
406791 so we decided we were taking a year off but in my mind i never really knew if i was going to do this again i never told these guys this
406792 we went on the road in the states for six weeks and it was the most fun wed had in years
406793 there was no tension we got on really well and we had these children running around who brought everyone in the band together
406794 we were never really prepared for the success of london still i dont know how you can be prepared for that but the people that we are it really shocked us
406795 we knew we wanted to do a record in the states because most of the records we had been listening to had been recorded there they had a particular sound about them they sounded very open and warm and smooth we hadnt captured that yet in making our records in australia
406796 elvis and roy orbison recorded there it doesnt matter what kind of music youre into you can go out in nashville on any night of the week and find something interesting
406797 its a lot more work to get us together and its a lot more work to factor in our families and their needs
406798 so were not going to work as much from now on

407119 it is now a fact and a public knowledge as admitted by owners of sulpicio lines that mv princess of the stars was acquired as a second hand passenger and cargo ship for 5 million
407120 the philippine has been accommodating japans passenger cargo and commercial fishing vessels since the marcos dictatorship under the treaty of amity commerce and navigation even if the seaworthiness and the performance background of these vessels are highly questionable the ratification of jpepa will further worsen this nearly half a century problem
407121 the gains the philippine government would derive like in the form of taxes and profit sharing would be minimal compared to what japan will get from jpepa as far as the fishing aspect of the agreement is concerned

407186 karadzic indicted for genocide and war crimes was under the us protection until 2000 when the cia intercepted his telephone conversation that clearly proved he personally chaired a meeting of his old political party
407187 im not sure there was a written document confirming so but i do have holbrookes admission of verbal guarantees given to karadzic from the highest level of the us
407188 during the year 2000 at the time of the november general elections in bosnia the cia learned that karadzic was still leading the sds the serbian democratic party founded by karadzic despite their deal that he was not to interfere in political life
407189 in 2000 there was a sds meeting in the eastern bosnian town of bijeljina chaired personally by karadzic he was providing instructions to members and the leadership who to be replaced and who to be appointed to which position
407190 in america they went crazy realizing karadzic was making a fool of them
407191 the americans and cia then withdrew the informal protection enjoyed by karadzic

407203 getting figures from theatres is the best way and with corporates coming in the system has become a bit more transparent
407204 be it the plot use of flashy colours like red modern lifestyles and nail biting suspense the movie was perhaps the best adaptation of hitchcock thrillers
407205 bollywood has borrowed liberally from filmmaker alfred hitchcock his stylised cinematography found its way into several thrillers in the decades spanning the fifties to the seventies
407206 chiefly because hitchcock is a master of the craft of cinema and in handling matters of human sexuality
407207 it is difficult to place hitchcocks movies in the context of a hindi sic indian lifestyle and the old world appeal of bollywood movies of the 50s 60s and the 70s
407208 anamika made this year is a remake of rebecca the appeal of the movie lies in its dramatisation
407209 the nature of sounds and music also took off from hitchcock the songs seemed to be emanating from another world and enveloping you the bollywood remakes of hitchcock movies also used the strong metaphors that hitchcock inserted into his films like drops of water on a womans face sweat nervousness all a symbolising latent frisson in intimate sequences of intrigue and passion
407210 movies influenced by rebecca portrayed husbands as threatening and ambiguous
407211 the security concerns are many and when we have 65 suicide attacks last year so the foreign players are obviously scared of coming to pakistan
407212 i really dont know what to say but the way things are the way foreign teams are constantly talking about the security it seems difficult that the tournament would be held in pakistan
407213 if the government gets involved it might help the pcbs cause
407214 it is all a ploy to reduce the blow for pakistan when they finally shift the event away from here to sri lanka if india takes a strong stand then the icc and the countries not wanting to send their teams to pakistan might come under pressure

407237 these findings give a great deal of hope for individuals with schizophrenia and their families loved ones and caregivers that were moving towards an under standing of the cause of the disease
407238 we looked at a relatively rare type of dna change where people have a substantial portion of a chromosome either missing or extra these are called copy number changes
407239 weve been working on schizophrenia for rather more years than we care to think and successes have not been dramatic
407240 in addition to rare variants we were able to convincingly show that common variants are involved in schizophrenia but we dont know how much of a role they play compared with rare variants
407241 the bourgeoisie wherever it has got the upper hand has put an end to all feudal patriarchal idyllic relations
407242 it has pitilessly torn asunder the motley fuedal ties that bound man to his natural superiors
407243 and has left remaining no other nexus between man and man than naked self interest than callous cash payment it has drowned the most heavenly ecstasies of religious fervour of chivalrous enthusiasm of philistine sentimentalism in the icy water of egotistical calculation
407244 it has resolved personal worth into exchange value and in place of the numberless indefeasible chartered freedoms has set up that single unconscionable freedom free trade
407245 in one word for exploitation veiled by religious and political illusions it has substituted naked shameless direct brutal exploration
407246 constant revolutionizing of production everlasting uncertainty and agitation distinguish the bourgeois epoch from all earlier ones

407248 industries no longer work up indigenous raw material but raw material drawn from the remotest zones industries whose products are consumed not only at home but in every quarter of the globe
407249 in place of the old wants satisfied by the productions of the country we find new wants requiring for their satisfaction the products of distant lands and climes
407250 in place of the old local and national seclusion and self sufficiency we have intercourse in every direction universal interdependence of nations and as in material so also in intellectual production the intellectual creations of individual nations become common property national one sidedness and narrow mindedness become more and more impossible and from the numerous national and local literatures there arises a world literature
407251 they criticize themselves constantly interrupt themselves continually in their own course come back to the apparently accomplished in order to begin it afresh deride with unmerciful thoroughness the inadequacies weaknesses and paltrinesses of their first attempts seem to throw down their adversary only in order that he may draw new strength from the earth and rise again more gigantic before them recoil even and anon from the indefinite prodigiousness of their own aims

407273 it is not what kwesi pratt and these people daring me to vote one way or the other and bear the consequence of an electoral process or verdict they can play on the pitch of the ndc camp in my constituency and we shall see the outcome of the election its pretty silly to me it is the tyranny of the tiny minority against the sensibilities and views of the very wide majority in the country
407274 am so upset by the silly pronouncement that i just cant come to terms with it
407275 a campaign against me or any of my colleagues obviously not that has nothing to do with me or for that matter any other person in parliament i will not lose my seat because of that sort of thing in any case we are all going to vote according to the partys stand the party is against the sale of gt to vodafone so we are looking at it that way but to say that they will campaign against me to lose my seat in my constituency that one i dont agree with them

407404 and now they cant even get their friends from the nam to come out in support of their interpretation of their program it actually reinforces just how isolated they are

407516 el campo profundo reclama tierra que no se destruya m s el medio ambiente agua y reclama pol ticas para frenar el xodo hacia las ciudades y todo esto no depende de las retenciones depende de pol ticas reales que ning n gobierno impulsa
407517 la faa no dice que sus afiliados con la complicidad del sistema pol tico y jur dico desalojan campesinos y sinceremos que esos productores no cosechan alimentos en beneficio del pueblo producen forrajes para la especulaci n en el mercado externo
407518 esas cuatro patronales no nos representan pero tampoco el gobierno que nos ha fallado nos abandon
407519 hay un intento del gobierno de satanizar a los secundarios

407522 junto con lo mencionado previamente es menester mencionar y explicitar el hecho que el acusado est siendo procesado por el mismo tribunal militar regional que dej impune a los asesinos de los hermanos alex lemun y mat as katrileo por lo cual es clara la tendencia del tribunal en cuesti n

407526 el avance de un proceso en condiciones tales que afectar a fatalmente las garant as constitucionales vinculadas con las formas del enjuiciamiento criminal por lo que a mi criterio resultar a tard o atender esos agravios en ocasi n del fallo final de la causa ya que aunque la sentencia fuese absolutoria el perjuicio que el apelante hubiera querido evitar ya se habr a soportado
407527 no concierta con el r gimen imperante el hecho de que un tema en el que se encuentre planteada una cuesti n federal no merezca por limitaciones de fuente local el conocimiento del rgano m ximo de una provincia y s que sea propio de la corte suprema de la naci n
407528 las provincias son libres para crear las instancias judiciales que estimen apropiadas pero no pueden vedar a ninguna de ellas y menos a las m s altas la aplicaci n preferente de la constituci n nacional

407635 in the previous two games diablo and his two brothers mephisto and baal were the three prime evils of a world called sanctuary where we start off in diablo iii its twenty years later and the brothers are gone theyve been vanquished essentially everyone was kind of geared for hell to actually invade at the end of lord of destruction the worldstone was destroyed it left a giant crater and everyone was expecting the hordes to come pouring out of it and nothing happened so deckard cain is one of our main characters from the first two games hes spent the last two decades trying to find out where the last two evils are what theyre doing and why the invasion didnt happen a lot of the rest of the story focuses on tyrael the angel of justice and whats happened to him since that event as he was actually the angel who destroyed the world

407712 brandon has really benefited going all the way back to training camp last year from all of the reps he was able to get at a young age
407713 i think now he probably chuckles at that experience because everything came so fast for him and he was thrown into a situation where he was not able to probably learn our offense in a progression like most young guys i think we are now seeing the benefits of it
407714 it was just like bullets coming and i was dodging and ducking
407715 i was a rookie coming in and had a lot thrown at me i handled it well and got out there it wasnt the best that i could give but this year i am more ready for it
407716 it was great for me to go out there and show everybody and myself that i could do it that i could get the job done
407717 it has brought a lot of momentum to this year and this camp and im just trying to keep it going
407718 he never played special teams until almost the end of last year
407719 i think hes definitely going to be a factor as we move forward as a core player there
407720 i felt like i wanted to do it so it could help me stay healthy and with my blocking
407721 i still have the burst when i put on the weight i run a lot more and just make sure that my speed is still up you know when you are out there if you are in shape or not and if the weight is slowing you down or not
407722 hes a guy that i think has made some progression physically in terms of his strength explosiveness and quickness
407723 hes also just operating a little bit more like a pro football player more like youd want him to be hes very professional in his approach
407724 i wasnt at the pass rush drill the other day against the linebackers but when you watch this kid hes got some quickness hes got a real good lower body so we think hes got a little bit of power in him even though youre not going to look at him and say hes the big massive individual
407725 last year i was a little rushed and was just getting out too soon
407726 i would get out quicker than the guards did on the screen so i had to slow down and be patient
407727 right now i am just going out and playing football and having fun

407759 estamos bem e o ideal seria a conquista desses nove pontos que nos restam mas sabemos que muito dif cil acho que temos que finalizar o turno entre 52 e 54 de aproveitamento
407760 a taxa de reflex o na tinta ser um pouco mais alta que a atual a tinta usada ser diferente ser similar quela que usada em linhas brancas em estradas que refletem muito usaremos aqueles ingredientes

407769 people talk about this turnaround and you can look at it either way but we have had five one point games
407770 people will say that a division 1 or 2 team shouldnt lose to a division 4 team but i really dont think people gave wicklow the credit they deserved
407771 middleweight boxers muscular athletic and skilful who are all comfortable on the ball
407772 at one stage apparently there was so much blood and guts being spilled at our training sessions that someone said they had to order in these special bandages sure what can you do only laugh
407773 its par for the course and only right because in sport youre judged on your ability to win in a competitive situation
407774 tackling the player with the ball using a long diagonal ball giving the simple pass that is easiest to win
407775 well its dogging it without high scores thats the big difference
407776 the same thing that caused us problems during the league not scoring enough was also the problem against wicklow but the lads have worked really hard on that
407777 fermanagh didnt get beat until the division 3 league final they took care of two of the top all ireland contenders derry theyre very mobile hold possession and move the ball quickly and theyre very motivated under a new manager

407802 we have got to address the problem we experienced last year by not having a leadership election and a proper debate about the future of the party
407803 gordon brown should welcome that it is not the old politics of john major saying back me or sack me it is saying here is my politics and my ideology if people have other views let them name themselves and stand and lets have that debate and that leadership election
407804 we could have a leadership election which is open friendly and democratic and involves the whole country

407821 no comprendemos c mo de juana ha podido salir de la c rcel
407822 entender que vivimos en un estado de derecho y que en democracia quien cumple la condena y las leyes queda en libertad
407823 es evidente que estamos ante un personaje que nunca se ha arrepentido de sus cr menes y que por mucho que pueda quedar en libertad porque ha cumplido la condena no deja de ser un asesino
407824 siempre ha tenido una actitud de desaf o al estado de derecho y a la democracia aunque ahora se acoja a los beneficios que le da precisamente vivir en un estado de derecho
407825 muy bien los sentimientos de dolor y de rabia que tienen las v ctimas ante la situaci n en la que un asesino quede en libertad
407826 est en posici n de celebrar cualquier asesinato de eta
407827 hay que cambiarla ma ana mismo no se puede esperar
407828 a todos los que salgan aunque hayan cumplido hay que seguir manteni ndoles
407829 una persona de los que yo me ir a a tomar un caf con l lo que se est montando alrededor de l y de otra serie de actuaciones en este pa s no es bueno
407830 veo que adem s se quiere legislar en este pa s se ha legislado demasiado con leyes con personas es decir en un momento determinado hay una situaci n vamos a modificar la ley y vamos a hacer no s qu me parece que es un error esas leyes no son buenas
407831 no es una buena noticia para las personas de bien
407832 para eb en el caso de de juana chaos no hay mayor desprecio que no tener aprecio por lo que no debemos convertirle en se a de identidad para el mundo violento
407833 el mejor regalo que se le puede hacer es convertirle en el centro de informaci n y darle un protagonismo que est buscando y que ha buscado siempre como cuando hizo la huelga de hambre
407834 a los que hablan continuamente de respeto a la ley que tambi n la respeten porque la justicia debe ser justicia nunca venganza
407835 cuanto antes reconozca el da o que ha causado pida disculpas y se reintegre en la sociedad para defender las libertades
407836 me gustar a que reflexionase que con la injusticia y la vulneraci n de derechos humanos nunca se avanza hacia ning n sitio me gustar a que despu s de reflexionar tomase la decisi n de llevar su actuaci n pol tica por cauces respetuosos con los derechos humanos
407837 sue o con que la llegada de fernando alonso sea posible para el pr ximo a o podemos so ar con ello

407839 ha bajado mucho la audiencia de la f rmula 1 en espa a
407840 no est nada mal para una poblaci n de 40 millones es un alto porcentaje
407841 tiene que estar claro qui n es el n mero uno del equipo y el rol que debe tener el segundo piloto en ferrari la poca de irvine con michael fue dif cil pero con barrichello el equipo lleg a las victorias y no s lo ganaba schumacher puesto que rubens tambi n lo lograba a menudo
407842 nunca hay igualdad siempre hay un motor mejor una estrategia mejor o un piloto mejor
407843 la verdad es que tuvimos grandes batallas contra l en 2006 grand simas
407844 el coche ser completamente nuevo se empezar de cero y eso puede hacer que alguien realice un buen trabajo e interprete la nueva normativa con acierto es seguro que los grandes ferrari y mclaren trabajar n bien pero otros pueden hacerlo tambi n y cambiar el orden de poder actual de la parrilla por qu no
407845 en a os sucesivos los coches y las soluciones se van copiando unos a otros y las diferencias se ir n acortando pero 2009 es fundamental
407846 lo que se necesita en un equipo es una buena organizaci n y con brawn tenemos al mejor tambi n tecnolog a buena fabricaci n y grandes presupuestos que tambi n tenemos me pregunt is que si considero a fernando el mejor del mundo veamos de entrada te garantiza tres d cimas por vuelta luego es un tipo honesto y comprometido sabe lo que es ganar t tulos mundiales con experiencia sobrada y que es un ganador nato en la pista s podr a decir que alonso es el mejor del mundo y espero que tengamos alguna posibilidad real de poder ficharle

407864 para mim pelo amor de deus foi uma tortura ver aquilo eu sou doente n o posso passar por estresse e hoje passei um dos piores momentos da minha vida

407872 a hist ria do mundo foi dominada pelos chineses a maior parte do tempo a china foi o pa s mais rico do mundo quase at o s culo xix se voltar a se tornar a maior economia do mundo no s culo xxi ter o sido apenas dois s culos com os ocidentais frente diante de um mar de s culos de dom nio chin s
407873 eles conduzem sua pol tica externa com a id ia de que melhor chegar a um consenso do que os pa ses se baterem para um ficar com tudo e outro com nada
407874 de modo geral o confucionismo marca o desenvolvimento da china uma linha que enfatiza que deve haver uma ordem no estado que seja harm nica com a ordem do universo no terreno social isso se expressa muito nas rela es de fam lia no respeito filial
407875 o confucionismo enfatiza mais a quest o do consenso n o como o liberalismo ocidental segundo o qual as opini es diferentes existem na sociedade devem se chocar e que ven a o melhor no confucionismo n o h a vis o de que um deve ganhar e outro perder deve haver longas discuss es at que se chegue a uma situa o de consenso que seja aceit vel por todos n o que os indiv duos se apaguem mas que as id ias sejam aceit veis para todos e como se chega a isso por meio de uma ordem de certa forma patriarcal os mais jovens obedecem aos mais velhos e dentro da fam lia o homem o dono da casa
407876 h quem considere que o comunismo enfatize justamente a rebeli o e a luta de classes outros enxergam que o comunismo como forma de poder na china recriou a figura do imperador em mao tse tung por exemplo claro que num outro contexto na realidade se voc tirar os r tulos de imperador e de chefe do partido comunista s o muito parecidas as formas como essas figuras atuam
407877 os membros do partido n o colocam suas posi es de forma antag nica e da sai um vencedor as decis es s o tomadas a partir de consensos
407878 os chineses t m muito medo do luan caos j houve v rios momentos de caos na hist ria chinesa com grandes fomes por exemplo a pr pria revolu o cultural foi um grande caos
407879 antes do comunismo e depois da queda do imp rio havia diversas correntes minorit rias de pensamento liberal a china centralizou o poder antes de cristo mas de tempos em tempos houve grandes rebeli es nessas pocas de rebeli o houve alguns elementos do que poderia ser chamado democracia
407880 os comunistas t m uma vis o de democracia diferente da democracia burguesa para eles a democracia n o se resume a elei es livres e multipartidarismo tem que haver tamb m o que eles chamam de democracia econ mica por essa vis o os meios de produ o n o podem estar em m os privadas porque do contr rio os detentores desses meios t m maior poder de influ ncia
407881 mas na china h elei es s o elei es indiretas como j houve aqui no brasil o regime socialista da china nunca foi t o centralizado quanto o da uni o sovi tica na urss havia o gosplan uma esp cie de minist rio do planejamento que determinava o que cada f brica iria produzir na china nunca se chegou a isso seu planejamento era mais indicativo do que diretivo

407912 karadzic indicted for genocide and war crimes was under the us protection until 2000 when the cia intercepted his telephone conversation that clearly proved he personally chaired a meeting of his old political party
407913 im not sure there was a written document confirming so but i do have holbrookes admission of verbal guarantees given to karadzic from the highest level of the us
407914 during the year 2000 at the time of the november general elections in bosnia the cia learned that karadzic was still leading the sds the serbian democratic party founded by karadzic despite their deal that he was not to interfere in political life
407915 in 2000 there was a sds meeting in the eastern bosnian town of bijeljina chaired personally by karadzic he was providing instructions to members and the leadership who to be replaced and who to be appointed to which position
407916 in america they went crazy realizing karadzic was making a fool of them

407922 im very happy to be coming home to be closer to my family

407926 you found a spell but didnt bother to read the whole thing or test it even before casting it on someone who was suppose to be your best friend when he was in no real danger cause i had his back
407927 and blondie here dont think its important enough to put a lot of effort into finding him cause he aint her undead fuck toy
407928 hey i just think that if the spell sent him somewhere safe then maybe its best if we leave him there for a while until things are a little less demony here its not like i plan on abandoning him or anything i just think we have bigger problems then one guy who isnt even that big a help and keeps getting in the way being sent someplace safe that is the keyword here safe the world however isnt safe at the moment and we need to take care of that before worrying about anything else
407929 it said someplace that feels safe where else would he go
407930 the number of places that are safe are beyond counting he could be in any number of places i daresay at this moment he could be at a payphone in england trying to figure out the international dialing instructions or on a beach in florida trying to wash ichor off himself
407931 i already checked and he wouldnt consider his house safe either the vampire version of willow has been there not to mention dru
407932 see he invited vampires in and he knows about all this stuff its best if he just stays out of it before he gets someone killed
407933 he didnt invite them in he wont even invite me in
407934 no its not that either none of the harris consider it a home so the normal threshold protections are really weak you usually only see that kind of effect on motel rooms and vacation rentals and only rarely on those
407935 the threshold is weakened if the people who live there dont consider it a home but thats rare most cases of a weak threshold are from places where they consider something a home but dont actually have legal ownership or arent planning on staying there long
407936 xander obviously doesnt consider it a home its just the place he sleeps at a weak threshold will allow vampires entrance as long as they have no hostile intentions which leaves most vampires out
407937 so neither drusilla nor the vampire version of miss rosenberg had hostile intentions towards the boy i find that rather difficult to believe
407938 they had no hostile intentions towards him their intentions didnt have to be benign just not hostile
407939 how do you know what their intentions were and how do you know both of them had been in his house
407940 because both times i had to untie him clean him up and help him get dressed
407941 that is enough we arent going to find anything out by pointless bickering angel could you please expand on what the situation was
407942 he was kinda tied to the bed and had some various injuries
407943 what a hypocrite he gets all mad about me and angel but hes sleeping with two crazy evil vamps
407944 wow buff i didnt know you were that kinky i think most people consider being tied down and raped a bit different than willing climbing on top of a corpse but hey whatever floats your boat
407945 guys cant get raped their thingies wouldnt get hard unless they wanted it
407946 yes buffy it is an automatic reflex quite beyond our control not to mention the mental powers of drusilla and quite possibly the vampiric willow means they could have made him see someone else in their place
407947 and considering the questionable sanity of the two vamps in question
407948 yes i usually pass by his place to make sure hes ok if he isnt with the group and something is going on
407949 and why would you do that i mean from the behavior the two of you exhibit towards one another id assumed you didnt like each other
407950 for one thing he saved buffy when i couldnt do anything
407951 angel that wasnt your fault who knew youd need to know cpr in the masters cave
407952 that was just one of the times when he saved you there was angelus jumping you in the cemetery when you were sick there was the time angelus came to the hospital and xander was there by himself and convinced him to leave without a fight im sure there were a couple of times i wasnt there that he saved you i also owe him a lot for acaltha
407953 im just saying that since i know your secret identity and you know nothing about me that youd probably spend a lot of time worrying and obsessing about it so why dont i stick around here where you can keep an eye on me
407954 and swim in your pool watch your tv the usual lazy houseguest setup while i wait for one of the jla or the people at home to figure out a way for me to get home
407955 get martian manhunter down here to look through my memories i know you like to go through complex scenarios and figure out what anyone will do in any given situation but lets skip all that and go with the simple mental probe deal so youll be able to sleep at night without wondering what im up to
407956 the demons that tortured me had fun lying to me about how angelus had succeeded in sending the entire earth to hell and explained how since my weakness was what allowed him his freedom i was responsible i would have earned an eternity in the pits for that and dont try and claim that you would have stopped angelus you let him run free and he killed dozens of people and the vampires he lead killed even more i spent a century in the pits for the crimes i freed him to commit and i got off easy if xander hadnt lied to you then you would have gone easy on him and then i would have spent an eternity roasting in the pit and for letting it happen you would have probably been chained up with me i owe him my soul and yours
407957 i dont think i can be sentenced to hell for not doing something otherwise wed all be in trouble for not curing cancer or stopping murders in other cities there is no end to what were not doing
407958 yes but you physically stopped other people from dealing with him which left him free to kill
407959 i was already gone and it hurts to think that you couldnt tell the difference between me and him
407960 the body may be the same but we sure as hell arent and since my soul was restored by willow she now bares the same guilt if he gets free again thats another reason i we need xander back because if angelus gets loose again i can count on him to do the right thing of course im also a bit worried hell jump the gun but thats still better than the alternative
407961 so has mr harris spoken to anyone about his ordeal
407962 he was raped at least twice and i was wondering if he had some friend he confided in that he talked to about it to get it off his chest he may have felt the need to unburden himself without mentioning they were vamps but he had to have talked to someone
407963 shed probably tell him he was askin for it and he was invitin it cause guys cant get raped and then gone on to tell him how useless he was
407964 i tried to talk about it to him once but he gave me a strange look and asked what i was talking about
407965 some master vampires have the gift of domination its a mental ability that allows them to alter memoires cause hallucinations implant commands and so forth drusilla and rosenberg could have easily made him forget they had ever visited him and may have implanted some commands did he exhibit any changes in behavior after the events in question
407966 how is that unusual having a vampire clone of miss rosenberg around is hardly safe and most people find it difficult if not impossible to kill a demon that wears a loved ones face
407967 x woulda staked her hes got a mad on for vamps and while i cant say i know him all that well i do know he hasnt passed up any chance to dust one that ive seen
407968 you summoned me dr fate and superman for a simple mind scan
407969 he asked to be scanned so i decided to add some unforeseen variables to the equation just in case it was a trap of some sort
407970 i mean here is an unknown guy who shows up knowing everyones secret identities and suggests a course of action that would put him within arms reach of the leagues strongest telepath itd be the perfect opportunity to work some mind controlling mojo and use him to take over the league
407971 and while were on the subject can you really be considered paranoid when you have a large number of dangerous assholes after you
407972 another good point but there has to be a limit
407973 if he had all your super powers he could relax a bit but as a normal human with several enemies that can match you in strength im going to have to say paranoia is a survival trait
407974 as you can see he is extremely knowledgeable about us as well as helpful it makes me uneasy im not used to it
407975 i cast several spells to neutralize magic and telepathy as well as a diagnostic spell that doubles as a truth spell
407976 i dislike magic it never seems to work right around me
407977 do you mean to cause harm to any of the league
407978 are you going to do anything that i would disapprove of
407979 tons if i spend the day telling dirty jokes to batgirl youll disapprove of me distracting her if i spend the day watching tv and vegging youll disapprove of me being lazy if i spend the day doing anything fun youll disapprove of it as frivolous and if i spend the day doing anything serious youll disapprove because youll wonder what im up to you are so anal retentive about things that if we stuck a lump of coal up your ass wed get a diamond
407980 dont blame me if you dont like the answers i pretty much call things as i see them and i figure youre mature enough to handle the truth
407981 fine i dont think youre mature enough to handle the truth but i thought youd at least have enough self control to fake it
407982 if i really wanted to upset you id tell you that youre parents are proud of what youve done but think you put way too much pressure on yourself and your mother thinks its about time for you to settle down and get married and thinks diana is the perfect girl because she has nice child bearing hips
407983 the same way i know clarks parents both sets are proud of him and what hes done and think he should marry lois already and give them some grandkids jorel would also like his son to work on expanding the bounds of science a bit sorry clark but youre dad is a bit of a geek and would like people to see you have brains to go with the brawn
407984 i grew up on the mouth of hell and have spent the majority of my high school career helping keep demons from opening the gates of hell ive monitored your dimension as a form of entertainment its kept me from going nuts and helped me keep my sense of humor when things have gotten dicey
407985 im not any kind of superhero im just a guy who does the best he can in a really bad situation to keep myself and my friends alive all of my friends are superheros with special powers or training im just the guy that tries to keep them sane and fetches the donuts
407986 he was our best friend since we were eight jessie and xander were like butch and sundance always getting into trouble and me trying to keep them out of it buffy saved me and jessie her first day here but he got recaptured and turned they were like brothers until darla angelus sire turned him he talked to me about it afterwards said it was half accident and half on purpose he just had to push hard and it was done he said jessie would never forgive him if he let a demon run around with his face killing people
407987 id have to say hed stake you for the same reasons then red
407988 and that goes doubly so for any vamp clones since hed still have you around to let him know he did the right thing
407989 i think its safe to say the vampire rosenberg did more than just repress his memories of certain events
407990 but i dont remember her messing with the minds of anyone while she was here
407991 she could require a certain amount of time alone and without interruption to make use of those abilities
407992 was she alone for any length of time with anyone else here
407993 i sorta ran into her here but i dont recall her doing any of the mind mojoing
407994 the fact that you dont recall anything means little as she could have erased the memories afterwards i think were going to have check you and xander when he returns for implanted suggestions or commands
407995 i just want to verify the information i always try to verify everything from at least two sources before accepting any data as a fact or a possible fact
407996 i dont suppose now would be a good time to mention ive been possessed several times would it
407997 a minute ago that would have been nice to know now i already know that you have multiple memories and thought patterns overlaying one another im surprised youre still sane
407998 what that youre still sane or that ive found the reason
407999 im copying his style of humor i never realized that personality trait was so versatile he has it as an emotional defense and offense as well as a tool to diffuse tense situations he also seems to use it and body language as a form of camouflage and a way to insert ideas into a group so theyll think theyre their own as youll recall i learned to deal with humanity by imprinting on another this is just an extension of that
408000 damn it i knew i should have had that copyrighted
408001 yes and im also stealing all the works you read by stephen king we dont have any of his books here and ill consider that fair payment for being forced to dig through endless reams of porn
408002 im a teenage male and you should feel honored that id share my porn sash with you
408003 and seriously stealing my sense of humor is completely out of bounds
408004 my peoples porn now imagine going through reams of that and youll understand how i feel
408005 you are still sane because two other people and i use the word loosely have gone through your brain and reinforced certain traits so you wouldnt go completely mad
408006 i dont remember anyone shuffling through my brain except buffy and that was pretty much just receiving broadcast thoughts
408007 i can only think of one person who could have played with the toys in my attic so im thinking im really not going to like the answer to this am i
408008 no i can pretty much guarantee you arent going to like it heres number one
408009 that was so very very wrong fun in parts true but that was mainly because of the joyce overlay
408010 pun not intended i meant because of who i thought it was although ill have to admit not having to breath has certain benefits shouldnt i be majorly traumatized by this and what else did she do
408011 im blunting any emotional trauma which due to your chauvinism would have been light anyway if it had been spike
408012 exactly it was just drusilla and she spent quite a bit of time in between reinforcing bits of your core personality with the hyena hyenas despite their reputation are pack animals with social patterns very much like man in action this means youre fiercely loyal to your pack even if they dont deserve it im working on reasserting your original mindset and blunting your hunting urges which she also reinforced it may have helped you deal with the insanity you call your life but its not really healthy in the long run
408013 ok im seeing that the loyalty may have been abused a bit but the hunting urge i may still need i mean its difficult enough to kill vamps as is
408014 im not touching the fighting instincts just the urge taking stupid risks because of an overblown since of loyalty and bloodlust or rather dust lust would actually lower the number of kills since youd die much earlier
408015 ok i can buy that who is number two on the mental mojoing countdown and what did they play with
408016 damn it its going to be a replay isnt it
408017 she reinforced your attraction to herself and implanted some subtle commands to encourage obedience nothing overpowering just a strong sense of guilt if you went against her will she also suppressed some of the soldiers memories that were giving you nightmares and reinforced your will and ability to keep calm under fire with the soldier persona anything youd like changed
408018 done she suppressed memories of being a field medic during the korean war
408019 thats strange i thought my soldier memories were from more recent times
408020 it seems to be a random sampling from various large scale engagements with modern wars making up the bulk of them there is actually a section from a roman legionnaire as well id say it was a rather chaotic mix
408021 joy just what i always wanted a nebulous collection of random memories of battles throughout time just to make sure there doesnt happen to be any head chopping involved and someone yelling there can be only one right
408022 not a one and just for that remark im stealing your highlander collection ill borrow some money from bruce and see about making the movies skipping the abortion of a sequel and re writing the third into something other than a commercial for the tv series
408023 how about doing the crow movies the first one was great but it went downhill after that
408024 unless you have demons or the undead walking around ill probably just play couch potato but i call dibs if you get any in

408028 are a rattly ship where theres no control over where these platforms are going
408029 the problem right now is there are too many open source players
408030 it doesnt make sense in a marketplace to have multiple vendors doing the same thing if you combine all that effort into one you should have a lot more effect
408031 more feasible for android to merge with limo than with symbian because the technology underpinnings are the same

408040 but seeing as we couldnt rule it out we notified the government of japan
408041 it was a very minute amount and there was never any danger to the reactor of the ship or to the crew of the ship or for that matter to the public
408042 were talking about an extremely minute amount of radiation its about half as much radiation as you would find in a 50 pound bag of fertilizer

408082 all these cases that attract widespread publicity put huge pressure on the police and the prosecuting authorities to try to find the perpetrator and i sometimes feel that that pressure distorts the objectivity that would otherwise be present were the publicity to be absent
408083 in considering a case of this complexity the police and those responsible for the prosecution need to keep an open mind as far as possible as to who is responsible i think they did close their mind after the arrest of barry george
408084 we will be reflecting on todays verdict and considering how best to proceed

408089 we have decided to not make those sketches public at this stage as it will hamper the probe
408090 it seems that the material for bombs came from outside the state but it is likely that they were assembled in ahmedabad since items like batteries and watches are found locally we believe that the assembly could have been done here

408117 there were representatives from 12 countries in the asean association of southeast asian nations who joined the event and most of them were investors in tourism they wanted to find out more about the investment prospects in cebus tourism sector

408285 validated portfolios in various european countries were examined language descriptors were scrutinized and the piloting process was discussed in detail
408286 in addition to the proficiency test a testing tool serving as both pre test and post test was used to contrast reading proficiency levels of the subjects before and after the piloting phase
408287 no reliability or validity analyses were carried out since the test was taken from a highly reliable source which makes use of validated tests to provide the language learners throughout europe with proficiency tests in 14 different languages for all language skills and areas except for speaking and spoken interaction

408291 everyone was excited to be involved as we could see how the idea could work visually but especially for me as i have been trying to quit myself on and off for ages

408299 the smoke is poison campaign breaks the advertising mould instead of using glamour and celebrity in a high budget attempt to try to sell the viewer on the dangers of cigarette smoke weve just allowed everyday people to tell it how it is
408300 this series of docu ads with their straightforward honest almost anti advertising approach are a first for the uk filming them has certainly made me and the rest of the crew think twice about the dangers of cigarette smoke we hope they save lives
408301 i would imagine there may be smokers that dont want to know whats in their cigarettes but there also hasnt been an effort to get this information out before some cigarette packets mention cancer causing chemicals in their warnings
408302 its certainly a circumstance we could never have foreseen and the ideas have been in the making over the last few months the polonium tv ad was one of the strongest and then everything changed with recent events and we just felt the timing was not right we didnt want to alarm people
408303 to air it on tv and radio across the country now wasnt the right thing to do it was a judgement taken with the department of health
408304 i was really shocked when i heard that formaldehyde is in cigarettes in our business we wear goggles a mask thick gloves and an apron to protect our health while we are embalming
408305 taking part in the filming made me wonder just what other nasty chemicals are in cigarette smoke ive been thinking about trying to quit for ages but this has made me decide to give up for good
408306 we know that smoking kills the department of health supports cancer research uks smoke is poison campaign
408307 we believe the more people know about the chemicals found in cigarette smoke and how harmful they can be the more of an incentive it is for people to quit and the less likely it is for people to start smoking in the first place
408308 smoking related illnesses cost the health system 1 7 billion each year awareness campaigns like this will help save peoples lives

408310 our smoke is poison campaign is designed to make people aware of what theyre taking into their lungs and bodies when they puff on a cigarette or when they are around others who smoke

408323 ive seen the effects of arsenic on the body where it has been used as a murder weapon and i was shocked to hear that its in cigarettes as well
408324 having had lung cancer i hate people smoking anywhere near me taking part in the making of these ads makes me feel more strongly that smokers shouldnt subject others to their deadly smoke
408325 women who smoke during pregnancy are much more likely to have a baby born prematurely who might be quite sick and need special care
408326 theyre much more likely to have hospital admissions themselves and there is also a risk of miscarriage
408327 the good news is that there is help and support available for mums who want to quit smoking and nobodys going to judge them or make them feel bad about themselves all the smoking cessation midwives across scotland are here to provide information so that women can make an informed choice
408328 i always felt guilty every time i lit up when pregnant but i still did it even although the midwives told me about the risks
408329 when i was 12 weeks pregnant with neve the midwife asked if i wanted to be put in touch with a smoking cessation adviser carol contacted me and it just went from there her support was tremendous
408330 i began to cut down but was still smoking until i was 28 weeks pregnant at that time neves kidneys were dilated and i knew that if i stopped she would get better so one day i threw my cigarettes at my partner and said you have them that was it
408331 its been fantastic the whole family has been healthier brieze used to get bad ear and chest infections but shes been fine since i gave up
408332 i dont think it was smoking that caused my miscarriage but obviously it added to it i also think stopping smoking played a part in the difference in the kids birth weights as finlay was 7lb brieze was 6lb 10oz but neve was 7lb 10oz
408333 i would tell any other pregnant woman to just go for it and give up its the best thing i have ever done

408336 with england going smokefree on 1st july there has never been a better time to stop smoking we have already exceeded our three year target to help 800 000 people quit by 2005 06 and still more and more people are successfully kicking the habit
408337 children are particularly affected by breathing the poisons in secondhand tobacco smoke because their bodies are still developing their bronchial tubes and lungs are smaller and immune systems less developed making them more vulnerable to the toxins in smoke despite smokers efforts to blow their smoke away or to not sit near children they are still causing harm people need to see secondhand smoke for the invisible killer that it is
408338 for people with asthma the effects of smoking can be deadly 82 per cent of people with this serious condition tell us that other peoples cigarette smoke triggers their asthma and many cannot go out to bars and clubs without the fear of a fatal asthma attack about 800 000 people with asthma in england are also smokers themselves iv increasing their risk of asthma symptoms asthma attacks and permanent damage to the airways

408353 comes out of frustrations that i experienced both as a diplomat and as a policy maker in the congress
408354 to put a lot of pressure on the leaders in a conflict to come to the table to sign agreements but we do nothing to really work directly with their mindsets
408355 there is no reason therefore to believe that the day after they have signed an agreement they would see their conflict or each other any differently than the day before they signed that agreement and so it is not surprising that within five years most societies that have signed agreements are back at war
408356 we do not think it is very useful to lecture people to preach to them about human rights or about democracy the challenge is to get people to begin to comprehend their interdependence to see each other as part of the same political universe so that they will not dehumanise their adversaries

408364 it will be fun to put some out and then watch to see if people stop to notice and whether kids react differently than adults and whether some people are shy about taking them i imagine that might happen but i hope people take them

408575 i want hillary to win because do you see any girls here
408576 he just cant be president because it would just be more of the same failed policies of the last eight years
408577 thats not going to happen and im not going to speculate on that
408578 the real test is not what happens in the campaign but what happens in the white house if you think the campaign is hard just wait until you get to the white house
408579 i really wanted you to be president you did a good job in the election thank you
408580 consumption of calories has gone up but that does not tell us why people are eating more some have argued that obesity has been produced by cheaper food but if fatness is a response to greater purchasing power why do we routinely observe that rich people are thinner than poor people

408590 we have a lot of challenges on uganda and we came have to share experiences with nigeria in the field of policy making where we have seen and heard that you have for instance an urban policy we would very much like to know how you came about forming that policy the steps you came trough so that we can also copy the relevant provisions we also learnt that you have the federal housing policy and we would like to learn from you in the same way
408591 when the military took over power in 1971 they had other priorities physical planning and urban development was not one of them so our towns degenerated our current president came to power in 1986 he has tried to improve on sanity in the country but he has many other priorities like the restoration of law and order provision of infrastructure improving the economy etc

408600 everything went my way and i will never forget this day i knew my test career could be over for a while if i didnt score runs its not the first time i have been under that pressure
408601 they kept telling me it was just around the corner
408602 we had an opportunity on saturday but didnt take it thats disappointing
408603 it is my first hundred for notts since i came back so for me it was a small milestone
408604 but there is still a lot of cricket to be played this season and i hope at the end of it we will finish on top
408605 i just want to cement my place in the team not necessarily as an opener
408606 if it means opening the batting then so be it but i would like a top four place
408607 i want to make it easy for the selectors to point the finger at me and pencil me into the team first not be on the borderline
408608 i want to make myself one of the first choices rather than a borderline pick and i can do that by scoring the runs because they mean even more in division one
408609 runs speak louder than words and i just have to make sure i keep putting the runs together
408610 as for england i am 24 and i have worked on things in my game and have the potential
408611 ive added more and more strings to my bow and strengths in my technique and now i have got to go on to the next level
408612 i quite enjoy little challenges and i hope there are a few more challenges to come
408613 vaughany said something very important to me just before i went out to bat and said dont be reckless but be aggressive and i quite enjoyed having that freedom from the skipper
408614 i was going out there and trying to take the bowlers on which is how i play my best cricket and so it was nice to go out there and try to score from ball one
408615 i wasnt going to change my way from ball one i said i was going to go out there and be aggressive i wanted to go out there and give it a good go
408616 i just wanted to continue in that manner whether i was in the 90s or we were six down and really forget about the situation and just watch the ball and hit it and it worked for me
408617 i havent scored the runs so far in test cricket this year and i was under a lot of pressure
408618 it wasnt pressure so much from the outside but pressure knowing that i had to contribute and feeling as if ive let the team down when i hadnt contributed and thats how its felt over the last few months
408619 it was very special it was one of those days where everything went my way and its certainly a day ill never forget because its been tough over the last couple of months
408620 it simply wasnt good enough and we have got that out of the way in the dressing room we have got a gift in the morning and thats the second new ball and we have to make it work
408621 the game is on a knife edge we asked the guys to forget about outcomes and we actually forgot about everything else we spoke about
408622 both the ecb and kent are bitterly disappointed at this stance
408623 kent had offered various solutions aimed at overcoming the objections of the organisers such as not to include players who had taken part in unauthorised cricket in their squad
408624 renault have stuck to the letter of the current regulations on frozen engines and weve been buggered others didnt do that and are far ahead while we suffer its not fair
408625 when the engine was frozen two or three years ago i think renault more or less stopped developing and carried on with the new regulations
408626 at the viry factory in paris there are less people working and just the maintenance of the engine build the engine and nothing more than that no research and no developing
408627 i was in another team last year and i know how much they improved the engine during the season and how many steps we introduced and it is the same for all the teams every three or four races there is a little step in the engine which gives you some horsepower
408628 for renault it has not been like that for the last two years there has been a lack of power probably in the last three years
408629 we have gained some performance on the engine side but always outside the boundaries of what cant be changed
408630 these boundaries have been tightened last year so since then we have only been working on exhausts on the air inlet above the filter and on oil and fuel but there are no big steps any more because we have been developing oil and fuel for a long time
408631 you have to listen to their opinion but you also have to listen to the opinion of all the other competitors
408632 rules are frozen on the engine but you are allowed to change components for reliability reasons and also if you demonstrate that you are implementing a more economic a cheaper component you can also ask permission
408633 the information gets circulated and all the teams have to express an opinion so if they want to say no they say no and having listened to all the competitors the fia can decide not to allow these modifications so i think its a very good process there are very clear limitations and very clear possibilities
408634 everything went my way and i will never forget this day i knew my test career could be over for a while if i didnt score runs its not the first time i have been under that pressure
408635 they kept telling me it was just around the corner
408636 we had an opportunity on saturday but didnt take it thats disappointing
408637 i didnt say its not working i said i didnt know how to do it
408638 you said la whos the one making so much noise just now because it cannot work huh am i the best or am i the best
408639 i am the best la am i good or what faster go google it

408700 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
408701 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
408702 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
408703 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
408704 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
408705 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years

408710 skyrocketing gas prices is the most important issue on the minds of my constituents in georgia and all over the country
408711 there are several issues that need to be addressed with respect to the issue of skyrocketing gas prices
408712 supply and demand dictates the price of everything in our economy weve got to have the capability of providing the kind of supply that is demanded by americans
408713 weve got to continue down the road of researching and developing more alternative fuels
408714 weve also got to implement conservation practices from an individual and household standpoint
408715 another common sense solution republicans have offered and ive supported is an immediate federal gas tax holiday
408716 if we can do something about the pain at the pump the obvious question is why arent we
408717 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
408718 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1

408727 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
408728 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
408729 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
408730 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
408731 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve

408733 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
408734 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
408735 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
408736 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
408737 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
408738 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
408739 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
408740 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
408741 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
408742 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
408743 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
408744 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america

408746 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
408747 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
408748 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
408749 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
408750 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
408751 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
408752 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
408753 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
408754 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
408755 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
408756 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
408757 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
408758 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
408759 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year

408763 ive been fascinated with astronomy for years and i was happy to finally complete my ph d last year and record my studies of the zodiacal light in this book
408764 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
408765 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
408766 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
408767 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
408768 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
408769 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
408770 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
408771 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
408772 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
408773 who are open to doing something on the production side
408774 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
408775 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
408776 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
408777 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
408778 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
408779 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
408780 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
408781 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
408782 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
408783 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
408784 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
408785 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
408786 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
408787 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
408788 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
408789 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
408790 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
408791 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
408792 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
408793 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
408794 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
408795 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
408796 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
408797 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
408798 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
408799 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
408800 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
408801 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
408802 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
408803 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
408804 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
408805 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
408806 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
408807 alle z une niederrei t und die versprengten st mme der unterhunde zusammenschwei t

408809 i will certainly be praying for you and your family often i cannot imagine how helpless you must feel but you are totally right god is the only one that can meet all their and your needs please do not feel like you have to be perfect or meet their needs because that is a responsibility that you should not take on and were not created to take on that responsibility
408810 coventry have not signed hans andersen as it stands we granted them permission to talk to the rider but not to sign him
408811 hans is a peterborough rider and he will not be joining another club until we give the okay
408812 i am still in negotiations with coventry to release hans and can confirm that we as a club want this resolved quickly so we can all move on
408813 once the terms are right for peterborough speedway we will allow hans to leave but i wont go into any further details of what they might be
408814 but hans will be paid his outstanding wages by wednesday
408815 i am overjoyed that ryan has agreed to come back to the club he is the ultimate mr peterborough and is a massive favourite with our fans
408816 ryan is anxious to come back to england to prove that he is still a top man in the sport i think he has unfinished business that he wants to do over here
408817 ryan is one of the greatest riders in the history of the club and is returning as captain to lead a charge into the top four
408818 jennifer and honey i would like to introduce you to my husband jeremy and the wife of his dean madeline withers
408819 we were just decompressing after our first exposure to gyrologic
408820 yea sort of a knock off of pilates but they would never have you believe that
408821 when you come right down to it its all about the money
408822 so jennifer tosh tells me she has found quite a friend in you
408823 shes great she moves great ive been really lucky to get to know her
408824 madeline i have to tell you jen and i went to the teahouse and loved it
408825 thats boulder for you always out of the ordinary im glad you enjoyed yourselves
408826 nope im here for the trials too then i go back east
408827 tosh yes but jen here and i go way back to the ekim days
408828 what brings you two to the boulderado on such a nice afternoon
408829 we were checking out the possibility of a professor staying here while he interviews for a position
408830 well you must want him on faculty if youre looking to put him up here
408831 let me go take care of that now you stay thanks for accompanying me this far
408832 were certainly trying hard to override it and we hope that we can but its certainly not likely
408833 the more days this is out there the more comfortable republicans get with their position theyre getting plenty of time to explain what they are for and whats wrong with the bill
408834 would result in taking a program meant to help poor children and turning it into one that covers children in households with incomes up to 83 000 a year
408835 every day theres going to be more uninsured kids in this country and because latino children in particular are much more likely to be uninsured they will be disproportionately affected
408836 the first truly open and comprehensive platform for mobile devices
408837 i dont think theres anything that would preclude us from working together how we cooperate thats the question
408838 are a rattly ship where theres no control over where these platforms are going
408839 the problem right now is there are too many open source players
408840 it doesnt make sense in a marketplace to have multiple vendors doing the same thing if you combine all that effort into one you should have a lot more effect
408841 more feasible for android to merge with limo than with symbian because the technology underpinnings are the same
408842 there are clear competitive reasons why nokia which owns all the intellectual property and will be the biggest contributor to the open source symbian foundation has no commercial incentive at all to work with google
408843 this is really nothing new weve seen linux consortiums come and go
408844 greetings everyone my name is guido farabutto i am the creator of the gyrologic method thank you for coming this presentation is meant to be an introduction and overview of my method of course you wont be able to fully appreciate it until you have experienced it in your body
408845 i created and developed this method after incurring an injury as a professional ballet dancer my method embraces the principles of dance gymnastics yoga swimming and tai chi but my work is not derived from any of these systems my work comes from many years of intense study and experimentation
408846 my work reprograms your body releasing all the trauma it has accumulated throughout its life it gives your body an new life a new beginning gyrologic has three key principles the first is puckering of the pelvis this puckering is more than just a squeeze of the muscles more than just engagement of the pelvic floor but involving the transverse and the obliques puckering allows you to simultaneously reach in both directions
408847 the second principle is the center line this is not an anatomical reference but an energetic line these energetic lines enter and exit our bodies freely these lines can be straight or curved in any direction
408848 the third principle of gyrologic is the bud beginning the bud is the source of all life the beginning of the energy that comes into our body and moves us through the physical plane it is a deepening connection to this bud beginning that frees blockages and releases sleeping energy within us
408849 with these three principles each session takes your spine through seven types of movement
408850 the gyrologic exercises follow this special sequence first bending forward then bending backward side arching left and right come next twisting left and right and moving in a circular pattern follows
408851 gyrologic is for every body it has unlimited depth of exploration for the most advanced athletes dancers and performers and it has universal application for the injured with any infirmity
408852 of course it is expensive it has to be expensive to insure its quality it has to be expensive to command respect anything for free cant be worth much
408853 getting certified with gyrologic takes a rigorous training program and a comprehensive license agreement is required
408854 i heard the license agreement is really strict who you can teach what you can teach who gets to even sit on the equipment
408855 without agreements and the lawyers to back them up gyrologic would get diluted and lose its control
408856 let me see if i understand all this you were a professional dancer got injured came up with this method all on your own it focuses on decompression of the spine idealized lines and some kind of x files source of energy
408857 your method has specific breathing for each exercise and the exercises are performed in a specific progressive pattern i do get what you are saying its all about contology oh i mean control it makes money to me

408879 oh yes thats a group of blind fire fighters they lost their sight saving our clubhouse from a fire last year so we always let them play for free anytime
408880 thats so sad i think i will say a special prayer for them tonight

408884 the use and misuse of presidential clemency power for executive branch officials
408885 in light of yesterdays announcement by the president that he was commuting the prison sentence for scooter libby it is imperative that congress look into presidential authority to grant clemency and how such power may be abused
408886 taken to its extreme the use of such authority could completely circumvent the law enforcement process and prevent credible efforts to investigate wrongdoing in the executive branch

408898 give us a written estimate and well get back to you
408899 i agree with the government that something needs to be done the recent increases are going to start hitting households just in time for the winter months and with millions of people already in fuel poverty this is only set to get worse
408900 last week edf hiked their gas prices by 22 per cent and their electricity by 17 per cent
408901 we expect the other big energy providers to follow suit and raise their prices too which is why our advice is to cap while you still can
408902 there are currently only a few fixed energy tariffs remaining in the market and these are disappearing fast
408903 comparison sites like fairinvestment co uk prove invaluable when it comes to comparing gas and electricity tariffs our service searches all the available rates in your area and then if you want to fix you can filter the results to display only capped energy prices
408904 the findings of the survey show intermediaries as realistic but not unduly disheartened
408905 we have gone beyond the stage of energy companies firing warning shots across the bows gas and utility bills are set to rocket unless you have taken out a capped rate tariff
408906 we urge anyone who has not taken one out to do so immediately these deals may not be the cheapest tariffs on the market now but in a few months time they will look as cheap as chips

408923 i appeal again to the iranian side no longer to play for time but to give us a usable answer to our offers stop dallying
408924 a clear signal for a mutual freeze we would freeze our sanctions efforts and iran the development of its centrifuges this is a clear offer that deserves a clear answer and soon
408925 it would be negligent not to use the current opportunity
408926 we would then have to further increase pressure via sanctions

408929 all the doggie pictures make me want to get out my blender
408930 this is the first time we have a full time professional squad
408931 the reasons for that are two fold the standard of national division one is improving every season and of course the rugby football union are talking about restructuring the elite game in england
408932 we have to maintain our position and we felt going full time would helps us do that
408933 we saw the influence of the influx of professional players when we finished seventh in the league we finished as the highest placed part time side in the division last season
408934 we have to have an ambition to get into the guinness premiership
408935 but that is easier said than done and in lots of ways its easier to stay in the premiership than actually get there
408936 we do have a unique london and welsh brand and apart from harlequins are the only london based side in english rugbys top two divisions
408937 wasps play out of high wycombe saracens are in watford and london irish are now in reading
408938 so we know there is room for more than one london based club in the guinness premiership we know we have so much to offer english rugby and of course welsh rugby
408939 all the players who come here tell us the standard of rugby is higher here than it is in the welsh premiership
408940 we have strong links with saracens and london wasps and players know they can put themselves in the shop window by playing here
408941 we certainly wont stand in their way if a contract with a guinness premiership club came their way
408942 we do suffer because people do look back to that time
408943 we all like to look back rather than to the future
408944 we know we do have a great brand and if we are all being honest the great sadness is that we didnt plan for the future back in the seventies and get our own ground
408945 we didnt make the most of the money we were generating then and we are still suffering because of that

408968 issue advocacy conveys information and educates an issue ads impact on an election if it exists at all will come only after the voters hear the information and choose uninvited by the ad to factor it into their voting decisions
408969 issue advocacy cannot be regulated by the fec and groups that engage in it cannot constitutionally be required to register as federal pacs
408970 the fecs enforcement actions arising out of the 2004 election were outrageously unconstitutional and we hope that this lawsuit will to put a stop to a repeat in 2008
408971 instead the fec plans to use its complicated pac enforcement policy developed in 2004 to punish groups for engaging in issue advocacy
408972 this is unconstitutional and we hope the federal courts will put an end to it
408973 this man is john the baptist he has been raised from the dead that is why mighty powers are at work in him
408974 give me here on a platter the head of john the baptist
408975 from this perspective one can recognize that the contemporary crisis of truth is rooted in a crisis of faith only through faith can we freely give our assent to gods testimony and acknowledge him as the transcendent guarantor of the truth he reveals again we see why fostering personal intimacy with jesus christ and communal witness to his loving truth is indispensable in catholic institutions of learning yet we all know and observe with concern the difficulty or reluctance many people have today in entrusting themselves to god it is a complex phenomenon and one which i ponder continually while we have sought diligently to engage the intellect of our young perhaps we have neglected the will subsequently we observe with distress the notion of freedom being distorted freedom is not an opting out it is an opting in a participation in being itself hence authentic freedom can never be attained by turning away from god such a choice would ultimately disregard the very truth we need in order to understand ourselves
408976 we observe today a timidity in the face of the category of the good and an aimless pursuit of novelty parading as the realization of freedom we witness an assumption that every experience is of equal worth and a reluctance to admit imperfection and mistakes and particularly disturbing is the reduction of the precious and delicate area of education in sexuality to management of risk bereft of any reference to the beauty of conjugal love
408977 to render the care of souls more efficacious community life for priests is strongly recommended especially for those attached to the same parish while this way of living encourages apostolic action it also affords an example of charity and unity to the faithful
408978 i have to prove myself here first and foremost and hopefully wales coach warren gatland will keep an eye on me

408982 their abduction the local authorities lack of action and an increase in similar abductions and forced conversions in recent months is creating a climate of terror and a culture of impunity which must be challenged

408984 its a case of replacing damaged stonework and re pointing and were very grateful to have received generous funding from various sources
408985 we have not set any targets about finishing in the table
408986 but what we are looking for is as the league goes on to be competitive in every game
408987 we realise we might be a bit behind other teams to start with
408988 but if we can contest games thats what we are aiming for
408989 we just have to wait to see how our players adjust and what the opposition is like to see if we can predict where we might finish
408990 the club has been working hard to get sfl status for 30 years or so and we are up for the challenge
408991 we are looking forward to seeing how we fare against cowdenbeath who will be very tough opponents for us

409014 it was a little bit uncomfortable for a few points

409016 i just had to try and stay tough and not give up
409017 thats a storybook ending right there manny getting traded here and coming up representing the winning run
409018 but brandon made some quality pitches and got the double play hes done his job pretty well all year
409019 i was just trying to see the ball and hit it he made a good pitch and got me out but tomorrows another day
409020 my mechanics have fallen into place over the last three or four games and im able to throw all of my pitches over for strikes now and stay away from the big inning
409021 throwing first pitch strikes i had some easy innings and it allowed me to stay out there
409022 hes got great stuff i mean you can see why theyre pretty excited about him
409023 i think he was throwing a little harder than the gun would suggest he had a real good curveball and it seemed like he could throw it all counts hes definitely something to be excited about
409024 i was a little nervous at first but when i got my first hit it settled me down i think i tried to do too much in my final at bat the crowd was unbelievable im glad im here

409027 giving voice to the struggles of the african working class from around the world
409028 in the face of all these attacks that are clearly being made on the african community why is it that you have not had the ability to not one time speak to the interests and even speak on behalf of the oppressed and exploited african community or black community in this country
409029 this is democracy at work and he asked a legitimate question so i want to give him an answer
409030 on each of these issues that you mentioned i have spoken out i have spoken out and i have spoken out forcefully i passed the first racial profiling legislation in illinois i passed some of the toughest death penalty reform legislation in illinois
409031 i note with interest today john mccains new tactic of associating with oversexed and or promiscuous young white women
409032 doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills
409033 hes not from central casting when it comes to candidates for president of the united states
409034 they clearly walked away from his statements and we are moving on
409035 today we are saying that rage may look better on the ps3 than the 360
409036 i think the blu ray strategy and some of the other things theyve done in terms how the ps3 is positioned as a home entertainment device shows that sony is placing their bet on the ps3 as a marathon runner not a sprint and microsoft was a little more focused on the short term goals

409067 the big screen tv worked for a home builder many years ago now builder incentives are 40 000 to 50 000 off landscaping in the front new appliances 1 5 points if you go through our mortgage company and an allowance if you use our decorator
409068 what happens with builders is if you came in six months ago and bought a home for 400 000 and i come in today and can buy that same home for 350 000 and your home is not built yet and you havent closed youre not going to close easy and were going to have a problem builders have to keep that price constant or going up
409069 so if you bought for 400 000 and they know im not going to buy for more than say 350 000 they will say things like if you go through our mortgage company well give you 30 000 off the sales price and a 20 000 allowance at our decorator so now when we talk i paid the same price as you and all of the housing and urban development settlement statements say the same thing
409070 a consumer today is very savvy they have lots of points of comparison for neighborhood home value some by the mls and some free data they are not impressed by all the extras a lot of the people who are leading the charge for incentives have not been in real estate long enough to know you cannot do a lot of incentives anymore
409071 i have heard that about 70 percent of all realtors in the marketplace today have never experienced a market that we are in right now
409072 they are used to putting a sign in the yard and having five offers on the table the next day
409073 in vallejo right now there is an inventory of well over 1 000 single family homes and maybe 10 closings per week while each week we add probably 20 new listings to the market
409074 everybodys hurting its like whos the lucky agent this week
409075 in order for a home to sell once it has to sell twice you have to sell it to the realtors and then the realtors sell it to their buyers
409076 were seeing more back to the split of more favorable 6 percent commissions but were also seeing in the confidential area of the mls bonuses of 5 000 or 10 000 to selling agents to try to lure them
409077 incentives will work in moderation as a tool but theyre not going to take the place of a right price
409078 it has to be priced right to start with then it has to show right otherwise its not going to sell
409079 we are in a cold ice bath with our best friends

409095 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices
409096 if in order to get that passed we have to compromise in terms of a careful well thought out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage i dont want to be so rigid that we cant get something done
409097 like all compromises it also includes steps that i havent always supported
409098 i remain skeptical that new offshore drilling will bring down gas prices in the short term or significantly reduce our oil dependence in the long term though i do welcome the establishment of a process that will allow us to make future drilling decisions based on science and fact
409099 represents a good faith effort at a new bipartisan beginning
409100 john mccains support of the moratorium on offshore drilling during his first presidential campaign was certainly laudable but his decision to completely change his position and tell a group of houston oil executives exactly what they wanted to hear today was the same washington politics that has prevented us from achieving energy independence for decades
409101 its another example of short term political posturing from washington not the long term leadership we need to solve our dependence on oil

409113 ini baru wacana karena sampai saat ini kami belum menerima sk dari pemerintah sehingga belum melakukan sosialisasi
409114 saya kira jika materi yang diujikan dalam unas lebih dari 3 bidang studi justru bisa membawa dampak positif dalam dunia pendidikan pasalnya selain tidak akan terjadi diskriminasi pelajaran sekolah bisa mengetahui sejauhmana kompetensi dasar lulusannya memang untuk mewujudkan hal itu bukan sesuatu yang mudah namun jika sosialisasi terkait dengan hal itu dilakukan sejak awal saya optimis berbagai persoalan yang muncul dalam pelaksanaan unas akan bisa diatasi
409115 memang jika materi yang diunaskan lebih dari 3 bidang studi mau tidak mau sekolah harus bekerja keras untuk memenuhi target yang sudah ditentukan tapi bukan berarti hal itu harus disikapi secara berlebihan di samping tidak akan menyelesaikan masalah saat ini yang penting dan perlu segera dilakukan adalah kepastian terkait dengan hal itu segera disosialisasikan ke sekolah

409137 i appeal again to the iranian side no longer to play for time but to give us a usable answer to our offers stop dallying
409138 a clear signal for a mutual freeze we would freeze our sanctions efforts and iran the development of its centrifuges this is a clear offer that deserves a clear answer and soon
409139 it would be negligent not to use the current opportunity
409140 we would then have to further increase pressure via sanctions

409147 mr schultz told me that he did not believe the city had obtained in the settlement a sufficient commitment from the nba to locate a new team in seattle at some point in the future
409148 i explained to him that such a promise could not be made because these were issues for future deliberations of committees of the nba board of governors and the board itself

409152 its obviously an honor to be picked to be on this team and im looking forward to working with some of the best kids in the state
409153 he deserves it hes worked hard at it and i know hes looking forward to the game
409154 i took it very seriously being the first player from our school to be picked to play in it it was a very big deal in our household with the connection my father had to football even football in vermont
409155 when i started playing football my dad told me about how he made the shrine team his senior year
409156 its always been something for me to strive to as well it means even more because of that special family connection as well as just being a part of the team
409157 it showed me what the game is really all about its much more than just new hampshire vs vermont its really affecting peoples lives it gave me even more inspiration to play
409158 weve already had a bunch of practices and it seems like everyone is jelling together
409159 coach has been throwing a lot at us but everyones working on their own little niche on the team and overall i think were coming together pretty well
409160 on a windy day it makes more power than we need and it turns our electric meter backward

409163 when youre buying a renewable energy system youre hedging future cost increases
409164 at the same time youre pre buying renewable energy for 30 40 years
409165 but if we create the situation where individuals can do this and make it easier for them then this will ultimately reduce our dependency on power produced by fossil fuel
409166 i think theres still a lot of misconceptions around wind turbines and a fair amount of public resistance to them
409167 a lot of people think of solar energy when they think of producing energy at home but this is just another alternative
409168 we had some concerns about it because theres an effort by the state to limit towns ability to exercise their zoning power
409169 the wind makes the blades spin around and makes the generator rotate inside a bunch of copper wire that makes electrons move and creates electricity

409172 though your riches increase do not set your heart on them

409174 but woe to you who are rich for you have already received your comfort
409175 do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth where moth and rust destroy and where thieves break in and steal but store up for yourselves treasures in heaven where moth and rust do not destroy and where thieves do not break in and steal for where your treasure is there your heart will be also
409176 be on your guard against all kinds of greed a mans life does not consist in the abundance of his possessions
409177 the kingdom of heaven is like treasure hidden in a field when a man found it he hid it again and then in his joy went and sold all he had and bought that field again the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant looking for fine pearls when he found one of great value he went away and sold everything he had and bought it
409178 people who want to get rich fall into temptation and a trap and into many foolish and harmful desires that plunge men into ruin and destruction
409179 keep your lives free from the love of money and be content with what you have
409180 the spirit of emptying lies at the very heart of christianity thus unwillingness to empty ones cupboard whether literal or spiritual is a serious impediment to the pilgrim heart finding its way to god for one thing god has much to offer us but if we are already full of ourselves or the things of this world then we have no room to receive
409181 simply let your yes be yes and your no no anything beyond this comes from the evil one
409182 as we practice simplicity the holy spirit trains us to cut busyness and hurry out of our lives by remaining focused on god and gods kingdom we refrain from participating in activities and owning possessions that are superfluous and do not further our union with god the result is singleness of heart so that we are deliberate and purposeful in everything we do and say and think
409183 to worship is to quicken the conscience by the holiness of god to feed the mind with the truth of god to purge the imagination by the beauty of god to open the heart to the love of god to devote the will to the purpose of god
409184 you shall worship the lord your god and him only shall you serve
409185 the essence of idolatry is the entertainment of thoughts about god that are unworthy of him
409186 woe is me for i am lost for i am a man of unclean lips and i dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips for my eyes have seen the king the lord of hosts
409187 love the lord your god with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength
409188 the first exercise of the discipline of worship is to develop the habit of faithfully assembling with other believers in meetings where the primary purpose is to worship god
409189 the lord is in his holy temple let all the earth keep silence before him
409190 the waters of worship should never stop flowing from our heart for god is always god and always worthy of worship
409191 they are like a heap of fresh and burning coals warming one another as a great strength and freshness and vigor if life flows into all
409192 los gobiernos que practican la tortura necesitan doctores los m dicos c mplices no deben permanecer impunes sabiendo que pueden violar la sociedad civil y la tica m dica
409193 the discipline of silence is the voluntary and temporary abstention from speaking so that certain spiritual goals might be sought sometimes silence is observed in order to read write pray and so on though there is no outward speaking there are internal dialogues with self and with god
409194 it is difficult to find silence in an age of technology and information silence challenges our cultural addiction to amusement words music advertising noise alarms and voices both silence and waiting make us uncomfortable they seem so unproductive we cant tell if we are doing anything in them so when we come upon silence we fill it
409195 we are so afraid of silence that we chase ourselves from one event to the next in order not to have to spend a moment alone with ourselves in order not to have to look at ourselves in the mirror
409196 i am here to be changed into whatever you like
409197 when i work i work hard when i play i play hard when i think i fall asleep
409198 i think the devil has made it his business to monopolize on three elements noise hurry crowds satan is quite aware of the problem of chaos
409199 withdrew from there in a boat to a lonely place apart
409200 but the lord is in his holy temple let all the earth be ailent before him
409201 my soul finds rest in god alone my salvation comes from him he alone is my rock and my salvation he is my fortress i will never be shaken
409202 the lord is good to those whose hope is in him to the one who seeks him it is good to wait quietly for the salvation of the lord it is good for a man to bear the yoke while he is young let him sit alone in silence for the lord has laid it on him
409203 come with me by yourselves to a quiet place and get some rest
409204 after the earthquake came a fire but the lord was not in the fire and after the fire came a gentle whisper
409205 everyone should be quick to listen slow to speak and slow to become angry
409206 it is a good discipline to wonder in each new situation if people wouldnt be better served by our silence than by our words
409207 best of any song is bird song in the quiet but first you must have the quiet
409208 its normal to have pressure after all these years i am used to it this is due to peoples expectations of me i hope i wont disappoint this time round
409209 we must hope for the best and put our support behind them
409210 no factor is more influential in shaping a persons moral and social behavior than regular bible reading
409211 i have hidden your word in my heart that i might not sin against you
409212 pay attention and listen to the sayings of the wise apply your heart to what i teach for it is pleasing when you keep them in your heart and have all of them ready on your lips so that your trust may be in the lord i teach you today even you
409213 all scripture is god breathed and is useful for teaching rebuking correcting and training in righteousness so that the man of god may be thoroughly equipped for every good work
409214 how can a young man keep his way pure by living according to your word i have hidden your word in my heart that i might not sin against you
409215 a christian is a perfectly free lord of all subject to none a christian is a perfectly dutiful servant of all servant to all
409216 the obsession to demand that things go the way we want them to go is one of the greatest bondages in human society today
409217 if any man would come after me let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me
409218 and being found in appearance as a man he humbled himself and became obedient to death even death on a cross
409219 if anyone would come after me he must deny himself and take up his cross and follow me
409220 if anyone wants to be first he must be the very last and the servant of all
409221 i have set you an example that you should do as i have done for you
409222 each of you should look not only to your own interests but also to the interests of others your attitude should be the same as that of christ jesus who being in very nature god did not consider equality with god something to be grasped but made himself nothing taking the very nature of a servant being made in human likeness
409223 to this you were called because christ suffered for you leaving you an example that you should follow in his steps
409224 he committed no sin and no deceit was found in his mouth
409225 do nothing out of selfish ambition or vain conceit but in humility consider others better than yourselves
409226 as the first words of the morning are of submission so are the last words of the night we surrender our body mind and spirit into the hands of god to do with us as he pleases through the long darkness
409227 to have no opinion of ourselves and to think always well and highly of others is great wisdom and perfection
409228 nellatto integrativo del 11 novembre 2004 documento sottoscritto dal ministro
409229 the confession of evil works is the first beginning of good works
409230 if we say we have no sin we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us if we confess our sins he who is faithful and just will forgive us our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness
409231 blessed is he whose transgressions are forgiven whose sins are covered blessed is the man whose sin the lord does not count against him and in whose spirit is no deceit
409232 until we all reach unity in the faith and in the knowledge of the son of god and become mature attaining to the whole measure of the fullness of christ
409233 no one who conceals transgressions will prosper but one who confesses and forsakes them will obtain mercy
409234 there is no stronger sin than sin that remains hidden secret sins are the most destructive force in the spiritual life they chain us into a life of duplicity and spiritual mediocrity if not spiritual bankruptcy however when we practice confession our sin is no longer hidden such transparency brings an incredible freedom what were once iron chains of bondage fall off as if they were made of paper
409235 there is one mediator between god and men the man christ jesus
409236 confess your sins to one another and pray for one another
409237 a man who confesses his sins in the presence of a brother knows that he is no longer alone with himself he experiences the presence of god in the reality of the other person as long as i am by myself in the confession of my sins everything remains in the dark but in the presence of a brother the sin has to be brought into the light
409238 when the people heard this they were cut to the heart and said to peter and the other apostles
409239 therefore let us leave the elementary teachings about christ and go on to maturity not laying again the foundation of repentance from acts that lead to death and of faith in god instruction about baptisms the laying on of hands the resurrection of the dead and eternal judgment
409240 if we confess our sins he is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness
409241 i write to you dear children because your sins have been forgiven on account of his name
409242 prayer catapults us onto the frontier of the spiritual life of all the spiritual disciplines prayer is the most central because it ushers us into perpetual communion with the father
409243 all who have walked with god have viewed prayer as the main business of their lives pray was no little habit tacked onto the periphery of their lives it was their lives
409244 god always meets us where we are and slowly moves us along into deeper things
409245 if i had cherished sin in my heart the lord would not have listened
409246 surely the arm of the lord is not too short to save nor his ear too dull to hear but your iniquities have separated you from your god your sins have hidden his face from you so that he will not hear
409247 son of man these men have set up idols in their hearts and put wicked stumbling blocks before their faces
409248 if a man shuts his ears to the cry of the poor he too will cry out and not be answered
409249 for the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil some people eager for money have wandered from the faith and pierced themselves with many griefs
409250 but when he asks he must believe and not doubt because he who doubts is like a wave of the sea blown and tossed by the wind
409251 for if you forgive men when they sin against you your heavenly father will also forgive you
409252 husbands in the same way be considerate as you live with your wives and treat them with respect as the weaker partner and as heirs with you of the gracious gift of life so that nothing will hinder your prayers
409253 god opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble
409254 when you ask you do not receive because you ask with wrong motives that you may spend what you get on your pleasures
409255 you then why do you judge your brother or why do you look down on your brother for we will all stand before gods judgement seat
409256 give thanks in all circumstances for this is gods will for you in christ jesus
409257 do not love the world or anything in the world
409258 you may ask me for anything in my name and i will do it
409259 this is the assurance we have in approaching god that if we ask anything according to his will he hears us
409260 no matter how weak or strong your prayer life is right now you can learn to grow even stronger
409261 reading a book about prayer listening to lectures and talking about it is very good but it wont teach you to pray you get nothing without exercise without practice i might listen for a year to a professor of music playing the most beautiful music but that wont teach me to play an instrument
409262 davids prayers were not his words only but his meditations as meditation is the best preparation for prayer so prayer is the best issue of meditation meditation and prayer go together
409263 pray that god may open a door for our message
409264 in a culture where the landscape is dotted with shrines to the golden arches and an assortment of pizza temples fasting seems out of place out of step with the times
409265 fasting is the most feared and misunderstood of all the spiritual disciplines were afraid that it will make us suffer dreadfully and give us a generally negative experience
409266 the constant propaganda fed us today convinces us that if we do not have three large meals each day with several snacks in between we are o the verge of starvation
409267 fasting is one of the disciplines of abstinence when you abstain from something you miss it and feel its absence
409268 although i do not think that fasting is mandatory for believers today i do believe the discipline is available to strengthen you spiritually and to help you overcome barriers that might keep you from living the victorious christian life
409269 fasting is not an end to itself it is a means by which we can worship the lord and submit ourselves in humility to him we dont make god love us any more than he already does if we fast or if we fast longer
409270 when ye fasted did ye at all fast unto me even to me
409271 fasting can be an expression of finding your greatest pleasure and enjoyment in life from god thats the case when disciplining yourself to fast means that you love god more than food that seeking him is more important to you than eating
409272 be careful or your hearts will be weighed down with dissipation drunkenness and the anxieties of life and that day will close on you unexpectedly like a trap
409273 fasting reveals the measure of foods mastery over us or television or computers or whatever we submit to again and again to conceal the weakness of our hunger for god
409274 by every word that proceeds from the mouth of god
409275 then ezra withdrew from before the house of god and went to the room of jehohanan son of eliashib while he was there he ate no food and rank no water because he continued to mourn over the unfaithfulness of the exiles
409276 yet when they were ill i put on sackcloth and humbled myself with fasting
409277 fasting is one of the best friends we can introduce to our prayer life
409278 three to seven days is a good time period and will probably have a substantial impact on the course of your life
409279 for instance i generally only let my wife know when i am going to fast so that she can pray for me she is usually careful not to eat in front of me or to cook anything really savory while i am fasting i suggest that you ask at least one other believer to be praying for you when you plan to fast because my own experience has taught me that it can be a powerful spiritual battleground
409280 as with any relationship our relationship with god must be cultivated the reason that we are spiritually dry is among other things because we do not spend quality time in prayer yet we sometimes feel too spiritually dry to pray and so it goes
409281 it is a solemn supplication or request to a superior authority in the case of prayer that superior authority is god
409282 earnest request in favor of another especially a prayer or petition to god in behalf of another
409283 giving thanks to god for 1 who he is and 2 for what he has done on our behalf
409284 warfare prayer is the kind of prayer in which we wage war against an enemy it is prayer that is undertaken to destroy our undermine the strength of the devil we engage in warfare prayer every time we pray for the souls of others
409285 god is the oxygen of our soul and we need to breathe him in all day long
409286 i find it very beneficial to my health to walk thus for meditation before breakfast and generally take out a new testament and i find that i can profitably spend my time in the open air i used to consider the time spent in walking a loss but now i find it very profitable not only to my body but also to my soul for i speak to my father about the things that he has brought before me in his precious word
409287 i determined to learn to pray so that my experience conformed to the words of jesus rather than try to make his words conform to my impoverished experience
409288 when i bring specific people in my church by name to god during times of intercession and petition instead of simply rattling off the various things that i know that he or she needs i take the time to wait on god asking him to tell me what to pray for concerning them
409289 our adversary majors in three things noise hurry and crowds
409290 one sad feature of our modern culture is that meditation has become identified more with nonchristian systems of thought than with biblical christianity yoga transcendental meditation relaxation therapy new age movement we must remember that meditation is both commanded by god and modeled by the godly in scripture
409291 meditation runs counter to our busy culture where speed reading first impressions and skimming are as deep as we go in meditation we gaze at something or someone long and longingly we seek the treasure and truth of what we see
409292 listening to gods word reflecting on gods works rehearsing gods deeds ruminating on gods law in each case there is stress upon changed behavior as a result of our encounter with the living god
409293 deep thinking on the truths and spiritual realities revealed in scripture for the purposes of understanding application and prayer meditation goes beyond hearing reading studying and even memorizing as a means of taking in gods word
409294 when we delight in gods word we think about it that is we meditate on it at times all throughout the day and night the result of such meditation is stability fruitfulness perseverance and prosperity
409295 whereas the study of scripture centers on exegesis the meditation of scripture centers on internalizing and personalizing the passage the written word becomes a living word addressed to you this is not a time for technical studies or analysis or even the gathering of material to share with others set aside all tendencies toward arrogance and with a humble heart receive the word addressed to you
409296 in meditation we are growing into what thomas a kempis calls a familiar friendship with jesus
409297 in your anger do not sin when you are on your beds search your hearts and be silent selah
409298 he makes me lie down in green pastures he leads me beside quiet waters he restores my soul he guides me in paths of righteousness for his names sake
409299 he maketh wars to cease unto the end of the earth he breaketh the bow and cutteth the spear in sunder he burneth the chariot in the fire be still and know that i am god i will be exalted among the heathen i will be exalted in the earth the lord of hosts is with us the god of jacob is our refuge selah
409300 simple physical exercises like stretching sitting comfortably and breathing deeply can help us pay attention listen deeply and even curb our distractability
409301 find a place that is quiet and free from interruption no telephone should be nearby if it is possible to find some place that looks out onto a lovely landscape so much the better
409302 verses that conspicuously relate to your concerns and personal needs are clearly targets for meditation
409303 open my eyes that i may see wonderful things in your law

409500 the council of the golf club and the members are delighted to have reached agreement with ni water in relation to work on the course connected with the belfast sewers project
409501 the prospect of an excavated trench was extremely unpalatable to all the members
409502 although there are some risks with the new proposal it is hoped that the tunnel can be created with minimal disruption to play and no damage to our long established fairways and greens

409513 i decided to accept the job for two reasons to raise awareness of breast cancer and to make it easier for other irish girls to get into the industry
409514 i know there are other girls who dream of getting into this line of work but are afraid of what their parents and family might say i thought it might make it a bit easier because im not a stereotype
409515 its easy for me to defend being a page 3 model because i personally dont think theres anything wrong with it if people say its horrible or demeaning then what does that say about their views on women and their bodies in general
409516 i dont think it objectifies women because that implies that the girls are helpless and have no control over it like theyre victims of the industry most page 3 girls have consciously decided to go into that line of work i accept that other women might not approve but if its not their picture then i dont know why it would bother them so much

409539 in pakistan terrorism and its sanctuaries are gaining a deeper grip as demonstrated by the tragic assassination of benazir bhutto

409541 while the people of afghanistan today are bearing the brunt of international terrorism on a daily basis it is with tremendous trepidation that we are watching the wild fire of terrorism spreading across the region

409626 it is true that there is bribery in the ca
409627 it should already be stopped the bribery should be exposed it should be the beginning of legal reforms in our system of justice
409628 the allegations will not do the judiciary any good but the investigation of the supreme court will
409629 your newspaper and i might be sued for libel but the notoriety is known
409630 i was a lawyer for meralco i would be biased
409631 we in bantay katarungan have been exposing and underscoring the need for reforms in our system of justice
409632 we have written to the judicial and bar council and from time to time the appointing power on the need for reforms in specific instances not only in the ca but in the other courts
409633 this may be an initial black eye for the court of appeals but if sabio just remained silent nothing will happen
409634 above all do not lose your desire to walk every day i walk myself into a state of well being and walk away from every illness i have walked myself into my best thoughts and i know of no thought so burdensome that one cannot walk away from it

409644 the banning of bibles and religious symbols by athletes in the olympic village by the chinese government is evidence that it has not progressed to the level of civility that is worthy of hosting the international olympic games
409645 we have heard from the ioc and there will be no restriction on athletes bringing the bible or any other religious book into the village for their personal use
409646 if they are allowing beatings of all these lawyers and there are many now in the glare of publicity that accompanies darfur and zimbabwe and burma what will they do when they dont have the olympics as a potential goal that they want to achieve
409647 by being listed they can raise capital and boost their strength further extending the reach of our propaganda policies
409648 workers were being asked to carry the entire economy on their backs
409649 there was no willingness on the part of employers to make any offer that would relieve the pressure of inflation rising energy and food costs on the working people who are increasingly finding it hard to cover the basics of life in ireland in 2008
409650 there was no attempt to deal with the other key issues of workers rights pensions and the plight of agency workers a cynic would argue these talks were a stalling tactic from the outset and this social partnership is clearly now one of inequality
409651 the talks have failed because the employers bodies fail to recognise that irish workers are suffering from huge inflationary pressures and are really struggling at the moment the irish congress of trade unions and government were committed to a flat rate increase for all employees which would protect low paid workers from dropping below the poverty line
409652 ibec put forward a proposal seeking an initial pay freeze for six months which from our point of view is unrealistic workers have already had what is essentially a pay freeze for the last year due to cost of living increases and now the employers bodies want workers to take what is really a pay cut for the next six months
409653 the chinese have done all that wada asked of them a year ago their system for testing their athletes is professional and has had made huge progress in the number of tests carried out im satisfied
409654 the consensus around the european parliament is that china is the key china is the puppet master of burma
409655 the olympics is the only real lever we have to make china act the civilized world must seriously consider shunning china by using the beijing olympics to send the clear message that such abuses of human rights are not acceptable
409656 the road is still long i hope you can now dry your eyes
409657 after all there is still the 2008 olympics although everyone feels bad at the moment theres nothing that can be done life goes on
409658 i think its a big challenge for us and i think its going to be a great experience trying to bring usa basketball back on top to try to help change whats going on with the usa basketball team and bring it back to dominance
409659 the provincial and city governments just want to make him shut up
409660 i think the people can put their hearts at ease
409661 it is inexcusable that the government failed to budget accurately for vat and contingency or make a proper estimate of security costs i fear that other good causes will pay for their financial incompetence
409662 cooperative partners and sponsors of the 2008 beijing olympics who want to advertise on the internet sponsor internet media columns or launch a marketing campaign linked with the olympic brand have to choose sohu
409663 table of values for each of the primary and secondary outcome measures for each arm of the clinical trial including the results of scientifically appropriate tests of the statistical significance
409664 plos supports the public disclosure of all clinical trial results as mandated for example by the fda amendments act 2007 prior disclosure of results on a public website such as clinicaltrials gov will not affect the decision to peer review or acceptance of papers in plos journals
409665 contributing toward the development of international standards for results disclosure
409666 the findings of all clinical trials must be made publicly available
409667 although some journal editors have acknowledged the changing climate around results registration and reporting they may have a conflict of interest in that they will probably want the key and potentially most exciting messages from a trial to appear first and perhaps exclusively in their publication
409668 posted in the same clinical trials registry in which the primary registration resides if the results are presented in the form of a brief structured
409669 the enduring lesson is that one must not succumb to blindly obeying authority but must look into himself for what is right or wrong
409670 all airlines are bringing in new equipment because these are more fuel efficient it really depends on the investments you build around the airlines hotels resorts restaurants must go hand in hand with airlines
409671 yes i am in a bad mood no it is nothing to do with you yes i will get over it understand good lets go on with the lesson

409681 the public has a lot at stake and the media has a responsibility always to be aware of the source of information and the conflicts those sources might have when they report the results of clinical research
409682 people who have a financial stake in the results of clinical research can well be biased in the way research is conducted in the way they report it and what they say about it when interviewed by the media
409683 working journalists can be overwhelmed by pr and they are often looking for experts who can make comments
409684 who are not involved directly with the research and have no potential conflicts of interest relevant to the research
409685 industry knows that buying doctors is an effective marketing tool far more effective than the dollars they spend on drug representatives this leads to less than optimal health care for patients

409722 while emerging christians gather around a narrative of dissatisfaction with status quo church life so i imagine american muslims finally repudiating
409723 yes i know its a too tall order not because there arent other american muslims dissatisfied with status quo mosque life in my experience there are many but because initially at least the numbers may be small
409724 the emerging church movement came about because a bunch of regular folks got off their duffs and did something thats inspiring the challenge for muslims like myself is to create rather than just critique and hopefully build a faith life we can live with

409754 you hear these stories but when you find out its somebody you know its totally mind boggling
409755 if the chinese industry faces any crisis it directly impacts us
409756 for the country india as a whole and for the industry its a major problem weve been given to understand by the dye manufacturers that the chinese dyes particularly the lower and the middle end are not available if they are available theyre very expensive resulting in the closing down of some small and medium size units
409757 consumers have been so accustomed to colour they will not be willing to give it up
409758 i dont think the beijing situation will have much effect on the fashion colour palette at least on the influential upper end
409759 it will be interesting to see what overall effect the olympics will have on chinese business particularly textiles
409760 there is more of a demand for higher wages so i dont see prices going down
409761 about 85 of the water used in textile processing is in wet processing predominantly dyeing and finishing about 75 of all the energy and 65 of chemicals needed to convert fibre into apparel is used in dyeing and finishing

409766 theres good reason for people to be angry about the way games are treated by our parliaments our media and our classification board i think gamers want to see leaders who have real respect for what they are passionate about both as a pastime engaged in by millions of australians from all walks of life and as a multi billion dollar industry which our governments should be attracting and nurturing

409771 right now we are feeling very good about the frequent flier miles committed to barack obama
409772 john mccain would basically have to fly to antarctica and back four times just to be in shouting distance of us
409773 with the miles already committed to him barack obama qualifies for a free trip to maui
409774 obama was flying to afghanistan iraq and germany racking up tons and tons of miles
409775 if john really needs to fly somewhere he can just take cindys jet
409776 i have said in the past and ill repeat again that the best reparations we can provide are good schools in the inner city and jobs for people who are unemployed
409777 lets not be naive sen obama is running for president of the united states and so he is in a constant battle to save his political life
409778 in light of the demographics of this country i dont think its realistic to expect him to do anything other than what hes done
409779 what steps should we take as a nation to alleviate the effects of racial exclusion and racial discrimination
409780 i fear that reparations would be an excuse for some to say weve paid our debt and to avoid the much harder work
409781 if we have a program for example of universal health care that will disproportionately affect people of color because theyre disproportionately uninsured
409782 if weve got an agenda that says every child in america should get should be able to go to college regardless of income that will disproportionately affect people of color because its oftentimes our children who cant afford to go to college
409783 people say he cant run and get elected if he says those kinds of things
409784 im like well does that mean were really not ready for a black president
409785 it shall be known that in 2008 the world will be blessed
409786 barack obama may be the one but is he ready to lead
409787 senator mccain can keep telling everyone how proud he is of these political stunts which even his republican friends and advisors have called childish but barack obama will continue talking about his plan to jumpstart our economy by giving working families 1 000 dollars of immediate relief
409788 if theres one thing he always delivers its a great speech
409789 but i hope youll listen carefully because his ideas are not always as impressive as his rhetoric
409790 excuse me young man this is going to be a question and answer session so you can ask a question later
409791 why is it that you have not had the ability to not one time speak to the interests and even speak on behalf of the oppressed and exploited african american community or black community in this country
409792 i think youre misinformed when you say not one time
409793 every issue that youve spoken about i actually did speak out of
409794 what i said was what i think everybody knows which is that i dont look like i came out of central casting when it comes to presidential candidates
409795 we are very pleased with our second quarter performance which was solid despite the weather challenges that we faced in june
409796 our operations were only minimally impacted by the historic flooding we experienced largely because our employees went beyond the call of duty to avoid disruption to our customers communications services
409797 adjusted ebitda for the quarter was 30 3 million compared with 32 2 million a year ago
409798 adjusted ebitda for the quarter was negatively impacted by a 1
409799 subsequent to quarter end we closed our acquisition of bishop communications corporation a local exchange carrier in minnesota we expect the bishop transaction to be cash flow accretive on a per share basis and are excited about the opportunity to grow our operation into a contiguous state as a result of the bishop transaction we are slightly modifying our previous guidance we expect capital expenditures for the year to be similar to 2007 levels and will be between 27 0 million and 29 0 million this is a 1 0 million increase over our prior guidance and is due to both capital expenditures at bishop communications as well as to capital expenditures related to the historic flooding we experienced we continue to expect cash interest expense to be between 29 0 million and 31 0 million but expect our expense will be toward the higher end of our range as a result of the additional interest costs on debt related to the acquisition of bishop
409800 for the first six months of this year capital expenditures were 13 0 million and our cash interest expense was 14 9 million
409801 gypsii makes full use of both the camera and gps functions of our devices and is the only application to provide a completely integrated set of lifestyle features for customers to use and enjoy
409802 with this deal ramar can bring these features to market faster and become the first handset company in china to deliver these features within a single user experience i am sure gypsii will become a key feature in future ramar products across the globe
409803 this relationship demonstrates our commitment to an embedded device strategy as the most effective way to drive the uptake of social networking via the mobile phone our partnership with ramar gives us another significant inroad into the lucrative market for mobile location services in the worlds largest mobile market were very confident that this will create new opportunities to build the gypsii brand both in china and on the global stage

409805 we connect people and content to places and networks like no other application on the market with gypsii your phone becomes your personal digital life recorder allowing you to share your life experience with others whether at work out socializing or at home all in real time
409806 what i said in front of a 98 percent conservative rural white audience in missouri is nothing that i havent said before
409807 what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me
409808 you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
409809 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck its divisive negative shameful and wrong
409810 im disappointed that senator obama would say the things hes saying
409811 what barack obama was saying is hes not exactly from central casting for presidential candidates
409812 you needed that job but they had to give it to a minority
409813 the hands that once picked cotton can now pick a president
409814 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices
409815 if in order to get that passed we have to compromise in terms of a careful well thought out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage i dont want to be so rigid that we cant get something done
409816 we need oil drilling and we need it now offshore he has consistently opposed it he has opposed nuclear power he has opposed reprocessing he has opposed storage
409817 the republicans and the oil companies have been really beating the drums on drilling
409818 and so we dont want gridlock we want to get something done
409819 it would repeal tax breaks for oil companies so that we can invest billions in fuel efficient cars help our automakers re tool and make a genuine commitment to renewable sources of energy like wind power solar power and the next generation of clean affordable biofuels
409820 like all compromises it also includes steps that i havent always supported
409821 i remain skeptical that new offshore drilling will bring down gas prices in the short term or significantly reduce our oil dependence in the long term though i do welcome the establishment of a process that will allow us to make future drilling decisions based on science and fact
409822 represents a good faith effort at a new bipartisan beginning
409823 do you think you are better off than you were four years ago or eight years ago if you arent better off can you afford another four years
409824 this rebate will be enough to offset the increased cost of gas for a working family over the next four months
409825 it will be enough to cover the entire increase in your heating bills or you could use the rebate for any of your other bills or even to pay down your own debt
409826 you do have to be a bit careful the police patrol comes every hour or 90 minutes but the light from the car is enough to warn you if they do catch you doing something they just give you a warning and say dont ever do it again
409827 the police might ask for your labour card you just have to make sure you have everything
409828 i didnt know these kind of things happened here they dont happen where we are from
409829 ketika para kapitalis merebut kuda kesayanganmu maka serahkanlah kuda itu tapi sampaikanlah pesan kepada mereka jangan katakan bagaimana mereka merebutnya dari kamu secara licik dengan berpura pura sebagai orang menderita karena kalau banyak orang yang tahu cara cara tersebut kita khawatir tak akan ada lagi orang berkuda yang mau peduli terhadap nasib orang orang yang teraniyaya dan terpinggirkan

409831 burke your life is really out of control you totally deserve your own reality tv show or at least a semi decent blog
409832 we are three very different doing very different things with our lives and we dont step on each others toes
409833 if we all wanted the same thing it wouldnt have worked because thats where all the drama wouldve started but were like the spice the sporty one we are on different roads and they dont intersect we dont spend time together every day girls cant do just that
409834 i was only 18 when i first moved in and ive grown up so much
409835 ive been thinking a lot about marriage and kids i dont care about going crazy and partying anymore im focusing on the real life things my future thats who i am now
409836 its the closest ive been able to come on television to what i do as a comic
409837 its like a sitcom but with real people playing the parts the show is me in the context of being around all the people that make me want to tell jokes its sort of like this constant riffing that i do with the people in my life
409838 i built my whole career without their help so i said the one time i need help with something you better help

409843 i came to vote because i wanted to see some changes in latvia
409844 i doubt the referendum will bring enough votes because it requires too many but we have hope
409845 referendums would create a deep crisis in latvia and therefore i shall not participate in the referendum and so shall ask also other people these amendments are judicially questionable and are undemocratic
409846 these constitutional amendments could create a huge crisis and the situation might be created when there is neither elected parliament nor president in latvia
409847 i will vote for the amendments present governance in latvia is not a true democracy but a dictatorship of a narrow circle of a political elite
409848 the august 2 referendum is about the change of generation in latvian politics

409854 will gain house seats again this year the only question is how many
409855 to get 41 you need 45 because youre always going to lose a few republicans
409856 a new president gets a honeymoon period for the first two years thats his best chance of passing sweeping legislation
409857 wiggle room ill show you wiggle room wiggle wiggle wah wiggle wiggle wah wiggle wiggle ooh wah ooh
409858 im coming as the president of a friend and im coming as a sportsman bush said in an interview this week with fuqing yang of cctv
409859 im going to go to the u s chinese basketball game i understand yao ming is back on the court and it will be an interesting challenge for the u s team
409860 pressure from politicians here in washington calling on him not to go to beijing
409861 well first of all im under pressure from politicians on a lot of fronts bush said
409862 i mean this isnt the only issue that i get pressured on and presidents need to make their decision based upon whats best not whats political
409863 and i think its best for u s chinas relations that i go i know its important for me to send a clear signal to the chinese people that we respect them i tell people that of course weve got differences with china on issues theyve got differences with us on issues
409864 but the best way to conduct our diplomacy and conduct our relations is out of mutual respect bush said
409865 and its much more likely a chinese leader will listen to my concerns if he knows i respect the people of china do we agree on everything of course not but do we agree to have good cordial relations and work hard to make our relationship unique and strong absolutely
409866 i explored around beijing on a bicycle it was a interesting time totally different city then than it is today
409867 i can remember going to a department store and nobody had seen a westerner and they were amazed when i would go and i would go with my mother and my sister and they were amazed it was like we were like from a different planet
409868 first of all theres very colorful and obviously theres a lot of automobiles it seems like more automobiles than bicycles and people are used to a relationship between the west and china its a common occurrence theres a lot of exchanges
409869 im going as the president who happens to be a sports fan bush said
409870 look theres a couple of signals and its very important to understand he said
409871 one is i dont think the olympics should be politicized i mean it is a sporting event of the greatest caliber
409872 secondly i am going out of respect for the people of china this is a big deal for the chinese people and thats why im going thirdly i will have and always have had very frank and candid discussions with the chinese government on a variety of issues
409873 it was not sentimental but it was a description of sentimentality
409874 it is about direct action outside the camp we will break the law or do whatever needs to take place to stop e on peacefully from profiting from climate change last year they made 4 2 billion in profit from creating climate change
409875 this decision on kingsnorth is a political tipping point because if we dont say no to unabated coal here how can we say anything to china and india no one will respect the uks opinion
409876 the decision on his release will be read before him that day it will be signed by the director of the prison
409877 we have got to address the problem we experienced last year by not having a leadership election and a proper debate about the future of the party
409878 gordon brown should welcome that it is not the old politics of john major saying back me or sack me it is saying here is my politics and my ideology if people have other views let them name themselves and stand and lets have that debate and that leadership election
409879 the aircraft landed safely and was inspected by the airport fire service and there was no action by leicestershire fire and rescue service
409880 the aircraft left east midlands after taking off it then came back in it landed safely
409881 tell her i am sorry i did not know what i was doing
409882 ill kill the remorseless bastard who killed my baby ill never recover from this my baby is in bits they cant even find her i need her back i just want to get my baby back where she belongs
409883 that monster has taken my girl he took her life and i want his she wasnt an angel but she didnt deserve that
409884 he confessed but he is not fully responsible for his acts because he was taking drugs non stop during the four days prior to the killing
409885 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
409886 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
409887 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
409888 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
409889 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
409890 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
409891 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
409892 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
409893 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
409894 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
409895 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
409896 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
409897 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
409898 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
409899 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
409900 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
409901 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
409902 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
409903 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
409904 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
409905 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
409906 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
409907 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
409908 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
409909 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
409910 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
409911 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
409912 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
409913 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
409914 vi kan inte vara kvar och dela ansvaret f r det som premi rministern har gjort
409915 this demonstrates a long term u s commitment to the people of our hemisphere it will further develop and promote cooperative relationships with friendly countries to ensure we continue economic development and the growth and promotion of democratic institutions
409916 we must work in a bipartisan manner to avoid any negative influence of nations that seek to increase false democracies and prop up existing dictatorships this is an important effort that will fund programs to improve education reduce poverty promote better healthcare and provide improved housing i commend members of the committee for approving this bill and urge senate leadership to bring the bill to the full senate for consideration
409917 this initiative aims to make the united states safer stronger and more prosperous by making our hemisphere more stable and more affluent
409918 our lack of engagement in latin america has created a vacuum that has allowed some to sell an anti american agenda which simply has no place in the region this type of commitment to the development of latin american nations and their institutions helps fill that vacuum and make our nation more secure a strong social and economic backbone is a foundation upon which democracies can prosper this will enable stable communities and a stable region
409919 goddamn man are we going to unload those bikes and ride or what the fuck im about to go the hell home or shit ill lock the hubs on the samurai and take it around the track
409920 i need you to come pick me up the cops got me stopped on randleman rd off of 40 they wont let me drive off because my license is suspended
409921 the cop wrote me a ticket for solicitation for prostitution which is pure fuckin bullshit cause ive been knowin that girl for years
409922 he also found my ounce in the center console and wrote me for that but hey man he didnt find all the roaches in the ashtray so lets go smoke those and well come back for the car later
409923 vi kan inte vara kvar och dela ansvaret f r det som premi rministern har gjort
409924 the space program is an essential cornerstone of floridas economy
409925 i understand that this is a challenging and uncertain time i believe we can and will transition smoothly into the constellation program and i look forward to working with the good people of nasa and all those involved in the space program as we begin to chart americas future in space flight
409926 they out to get me they out to get me
409927 well would you feel more comfortable spending the night in tor temporary observation room
409928 if i had my gun id shoot every last one of you motherfuckers
409929 where we going i cant go back to cp the last time i was there they tried to fuck me
409930 oh theyve got cable tv air conditioned cells all the nurses have big uh hearts
409931 motherfucker you tricked me im going to get you etc
409932 hey you told us you were going to fight us
409933 look we can do this one of two ways i can capstun you and drag you by your ankle chains into this prison with everyone watching you through the window looking like a punk or you can walk in here like a man
409934 the price of gasoline is one of the most critical issues facing floridians right now its adversely affecting families and businesses alike we need a comprehensive solution to address this crisis
409935 this bill will do a great deal to put our nation on a path to cleaner renewable energy alternatives while also addressing current needs americans want and deserve real solutions to lower fuel costs our bill is a step in that direction
409936 while this allows the development of offshore oil and natural gas exploration by states wishing to do so this measure protects floridas moratorium in the gulf of mexico
409937 i asked that this bill include protections for floridas wishes and those protections are included in this bill
409938 det har f rst rt mycket f r mig och min partner
409939 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
409940 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
409941 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
409942 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
409943 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
409944 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
409945 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
409946 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
409947 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
409948 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
409949 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
409950 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
409951 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
409952 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
409953 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
409954 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
409955 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
409956 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
409957 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
409958 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
409959 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
409960 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
409961 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
409962 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
409963 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
409964 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
409965 the simple fact of the matter is that nothing of this sort happened my relationship with my protection team was always cordial certainly entirely professional this kind of absurd behaviour never occurred
409966 i never heard myself called by the name scruffy in nine years
409967 i tried to tell him that having us around hadnt put scruffy off his stroke in the past
409968 i dont even want to dignify that with a response the police always had enormous respect for my privacy they understood it was very difficult for me to live in a house with four strangers it is an obscenity to suggest that i asked people to leave the room so that i could have sex with my girlfriend i will not have that said about me
409969 the prime minister has suggested that a joint working mechanism intelligence sharing between the cbi and state police is required
409970 people have been joining the cbi from other organisations but they do not have the requisite expertise to handle crime cases the standard of people joining from other organisations is declining
409971 i have received requests from my party colleague nationalist congress party leader k murlidharan leader of opposition oommen chandy and congress leaders ramesh chennithala and p c chacko that there should be a special allotment for the state during the festival season
409972 the government of kerala is not honouring its position but the people should not suffer during the festival season

409978 it is hard to do less than marvel at 15 performers playing with such precision that at times one has to look to see if more than one person is playing
409979 the reviews of previous concerts have ranged from extremely positive to outright raves the playing was inspired
