4130005 now for the most part analytic studies are continuous and not to be pursued by fits and starts or fragmentary efforts mathematics for instance intellectual philosophy amp c were all become insupportable to me i shrunk from them with a sense of powerless and infantine feebleness that gave me an anguish the greater from remembering the time when i grappled with them to my own hourly delight and for this further reason because i had devoted the labour of my whole life and had dedicated my intellect blossoms and fruits to the slow and elaborate toil of constructing one single work to which i had presumed to give the title of an unfinished work of spinozas viz de emendatione humani intellectus this was now lying locked up as by frost like any spanish bridge or aqueduct begun upon too great a scale for the resources of the architect and instead of surviving me as a monument of wishes at least and aspirations and a life of labour devoted to the exaltation of human nature in that way in which god had best fitted me to promote so great an object it was likely to stand a memorial to my children of hopes defeated of baffled efforts of materials uselessly accumulated of foundations laid that were never to support a superstructure of the grief and the ruin of the architect

4130012 retailbeleggers verstijven in neergaande markten ze kunnen niet veel meer doen dan aandelen kopen of putopties en dan maar hopen dat de koers hard naar beneden gaat dat is duur en bovendien expireert de optie na drie maanden waarna je je geld kwijt bent
4130013 particuliere beleggers kunnen niet short gaan zoals professionele partijen voor wie het niet uitmaakt of de beurs op of neer gaat
4130014 het aantal klanten was op een paar handen te tellen het was ongeveer een tiende van wat we nodig hadden

4130022 welcome this is what you can expect tonight these are the people youll be talking with this is the stuff thats good about suffolk university in general check out our caps program questions
4130023 seriously not a lot involved well except for the getting up in a room full of strangers and not breaking into inappropriate giggles and not completely blanking on what i was saying next and not fainting or running out of the room or hyperventilating
4130024 way more than i ever need to know but im glad youre enthusiastic
4130025 we feed them every couple of days a pink liquid with nutrients not too dissimilar to what the olympians might drink for energy it keeps the neurons alive and allows them to grow within twenty four hours they make connections within a week there is a brain like activity if you stimulate one electrode you get spontaneous firing we then use that basic operation by linking it up to the robot body
4130026 one of the things we could look to do is to put sound in and get sound out which essentially means communicating theres no reason why we cant do that and i see that as something what it will mean to the neuron culture by putting audio in and getting different audio out is that it would allow us to whistle to it and teach it in some way to respond back
4130027 simply from the habit of doing things repetitively the neuron connections strengthen and allow the robot to be able to do it more accurately in terms of teaching the cells to do more that is part of the research can we get it to improve by applying different voltage and chemicals and things
4130028 we are doing that now applying chemicals to part of the brain structure so that it stops growing and the neurons will die off and then see if the actions the robot has been doing are taken over so its like looking at what happens in a stroke
4130029 can the brain learn to do things it used to do how can it learn to do the things it used to do the key thing is as we understand things a bit more is to put it into different positions or a particular situation and teach it so that we can see how the memory of what to do in that situation is constructed in the brain by the connection

4130082 as a collective group we let ourselves down a little bit but theres no need to re invent the wheel we back our system and we back what weve got in place
4130083 theres no need to cry over spilt milk we had a bad night at the office and if that requires the caller to take responsibility then im happy to do that but we will bounce back and we will bounce back well

4130096 the joint business agreement will enable the airlines to reduce costs and attract new customers helping to mitigate pressure on fares from record fuel costs
4130097 this means that the airlines will have greater ability to invest in their products services and fleets employees and shareholders will also benefit from the agreement
4130098 there is no reason why fares should rise if this agreement is approved
4130099 make no mistake if this monster monopoly is approved it will be third time unlucky for consumers
4130100 it will still be bad for passengers bad for competition and bad for the uk and us aviation industry
4130101 under the joint business agreement the three airlines will cooperate commercially on flights between the united states mexico and canada and the european union switzerland and norway while continuing to operate as separate legal entities
4130102 warmly welcomed and strongly supports the application for anti trust immunity

4130114 the pilot program has proved to be successful because employee morale has gone to higher levels employees who are on the four day schedule tell us they accomplish much more during the early morning hours before the traditional workday gets started and they can finish more tasks in the late afternoon hours while avoiding rush hour traffic
4130115 many of the employees working four day weeks have already expressed an interest in continuing the schedule the school year will begin shortly so we felt it was important to allow employees with children to get their work and home schedules set before schools open

4130120 what we intend to do over the next 500 days is to take the iraqis from where they are to the next level
4130121 c4 systems communications as a whole are important and vital toward not only doing battlefield operations but also improving ministerial capacity and capability
4130122 you cannot just come in and overlay a futuristic template against an archaic system
4130123 we have to understand what types of things theyre capable of doing and what types of things theyre not
4130124 weve improved ministerial capacity and capability so they can do this on their own and we can move on
4130125 if you want a process by which the iraqis are going to be eventually able to self sustain themselves you cant just come in and give them a network
4130126 so when i look at what were providing in terms of education mentorship and training to senior iraqi leadership
4130127 i always have in the back of my mind this is something thats got to permeate down to those people who like this one individual dont have things like computers dont have things like the internet
4130128 military showers of appreciation assists active duty military families from all branches that are expecting new babies with various items they will need to care for their new baby
4130129 because many of these pregnant mothers have babies alone with new fathers deployed we pay special attention to pampering these spouses and supporting them positively during this time
4130130 this shower shed a little sunlight on a difficult time that many military spouses experience during constant deployments
4130131 many people do not realize the sacrifices the entire military family makes during a deployment it is important to the north star group that military families know they are appreciated and that they are not alone
4130132 everything from baby bottles to a bassinet the gifts helped us out a lot the entire event was just a very supportive caring atmosphere i really enjoyed it the baby shower also provided me an opportunity to meet and make new friends with other pregnant military moms
4130133 we will make every attempt to do something special for expecting families even if they miss the shower cut off dates
4130134 these quarterly showers are currently held at camp pendleton and twentynine palms california base locations with plans of expanding to bases in other states in the future all military servicemembers in california willing to travel to the shower from any military bases in the area are welcome to apply
4130135 we dont have any formal proposals before nascar or anything like that right now but that is what we presented today

4130138 we believe in the project and kansas has been fantastically successful for us its been a great speedway for us and a real important speedway in our portfolio
4130139 even though it would be another 1 5 mile oval track but each of those tracks have their own character and as they get older they even take on more character
4130140 it would put on a good show and it would be great for the sport
4130141 one day there will be archives of psychiatric abuses similar to the archives that now document holocaust atrocities this archives exists to provide psychiatric survivors with a place to preserve for future generations the unpublished autobiographies of their experiences the archives was founded in 1980 when ken donaldson author of insanity inside out and al siebert author of peaking out how my mind broke free from the delusions in psychiatry discovered that many psychiatric survivors have written manuscripts about their experiences but are rarely successful in getting their books published
4130142 michigan is one of my favorite tracks on the circuit
4130143 its big and wide and you can really pass there if you are able to get your car set up right you can do a lot of passing and have a whole lot of fun there
4130144 we were pretty good there in the spring race but came up short on the fuel mileage at the end it cost us a certain top five finish we should be able to take what we learned back there and have another strong run hopefully this time we wont get burned on the fuel mileage
4130145 we had a great car at pocono and a rocket ship at indy so this team is really building momentum

4130152 i dont see myself leaving the farm and working elsewhere i am happy here
4130153 the draft bill the trafficking in persons bill allows for all forms of human trafficking to be prosecuted including labour exploitation and not only sexual exploitation
4130154 prosecutions have proceeded on an ad hoc basis overtly demonstrable to the facts such as kidnapping indecent assault and rape which do not individually attract as heavy sentences as a specific trafficking in persons would impose
4130155 our infrastructure delivery programme is on track and our airports will be ready to host visitors during the 2010 fifa world cup and beyond

4130179 the war resisters support campaign is calling on supporters across canada to urgently continue to put pressure on the minority conservative government to immediately cease deportation proceedings against other us war resisters and to respect the will of canadians and their elected representatives by implementing the motion adopted by parliament on june 3rd
4130180 in june the canadian parliament had passed a motion that war resisters should be able to stay in canada it was a non binding motion but it expressed the will of parliament and the canadian people
4130181 ive had the opportunity to speak out against the war no offense to the soldiers over there i have respect for them as soldiers but it was a bogus war based on false pretenses and im happy to have not taken part in it

4130189 outside the cbsa offices near pearson international airport yesterday hinzman said he still believes he and other deserters did the right thing by coming to canada rather than fighting in iraq

4130198 in recent years the trend in ya fiction has been toward a proliferation of darker edgier fare aimed at a more mature audience
4130199 what we dont know from the essay is how easily kids are allowed to dodge the librarians best intentions entirely and simply go to the ya or adult books by themselves that would have been my own strategy as a sixth grader particularly if i had had a previous encounter with a librarian that made me feel snooped upon or deflected
4130200 bella and edward are no longer in high school theyre dealing with grown up family problems not teen problems when young readers were reading about people they could relate to in the earlier books they were willing to ignore the way so many characters roll their eyes chuckle and snore the improbabilities regarding plot and the scenes that went on way too long but bella becomes matronly in breaking dawn and edward seems as if he ought to be out playing golf

4130255 in talks about making cars cleaner and more fuel efficient with engineers here ive asked whether a small turbine turning at a constant rate wouldnt be an ideal way to power the generator of an electric motor driven car alas the noise high rpm and heat are still expensive problems and turbines small enough to serve such a purpose are prohibitively expensive compared to existing alternatives such as small diesels
4130256 perhaps the biggest drawback is in fuel economy even though the engine itself is relatively efficient it operates at a high rpm even while at idle
4130257 dont anybody mention the word turbine here we have no idea what caused this car to blow up spilled fuel maybe it has nothing to do with the turbine powered car visiting in town

4130261 the structures of the compounds made by electric discharge differ from those formed by uv photolysis so the hydrolysis time could be very different some of the photochemical products when uv light is used are hydrocarbons that do not react with water
4130262 was meant to mimic charged particle interactions which dr ferris admits is a process at work on titan
4130263 uv light radiation produces tholins that look more like titans haze
4130264 some if not most of the products we make also dont react with water
4130265 tholins formed at low pressure seem to look more like titans haze than those formed at higher pressures you can make tholins at low pressures using uv light you cannot make tholins at low pressure using plasma discharge and to make the amount of tholins we needed for the experiment we needed to use the discharge technique uv photolysis only produces small amounts

4130315 it is this higher level of consciousness that we come forward and greet dear one orem addressing you in this beginning phase as i address you collectively i bring you forward as one group but you are identified as your singular vibration and this we call forward directly to accompany we who are with you as a group in this dimension drawing you into our communication area this area in separating you from what is around you also helps to expand your awareness so that you hear the energy between the words and all the symbols that the words represent expand and many of you may perceive it as images and many of you may perceive it as music whatever way it comes to you is in accordance with your individual vibration so vibrating to the energy here you become immersed in a different state and with a different group of beings here teachers elders masters angels whatever you refer to them as they will be with you and if you merely refer to them as light or energy so it is and you will move in a distinct alignment with that which you are willing to receive and understand already because of your state of acceptance and presentation into the energy as the greatest gift that you will receive you were able to come to this state of attention focus power which now infills you there is purpose with this and we are moving you into purpose purpose is an expression of creation which as you unfold to receive creative love you find you have purpose for receiving love also has with it a givingness and how will you creatively give and what thoughts come to you within that creation again this will be connecting you into the field of vibration that is at one with your purpose here beginning to unfold now you will feel the separation of the vast number of people here as you all become intent on being with this purposeful presence that you have become the expansion and separation takes you further into a state of readiness and of being prepared preparation then will bring up in your mind of becoming or being ready to perform in some way here we would remind you to drop away from you any of your thoughts of what you would wish to be and again be filled with the energy that is here that enfolds you for your particular purpose here you are being being as a concept being as a wholeness being present to receive if this is considered within the part of your mind and awareness that is still functioning separately you may also think about the earth being in a state of readiness to receive on a conscious level and so as the vibration raises in the earth what will become of the individuals who are not in conformity with the greater concept of purpose and presence of a loving universe there will be a drawing upward just as you have a sense of being drawn upward and those who are willing to receive will be in the same state of receptivity as you are in this state much is being connected around you to a pattern that you are well aware exists within creation and it is regenerating within you the series of coded energy information that is necessary for you at this time it is necessary for your light form and it is necessary for your physicality in all ways and this code of vibration and information is carried through you irrespective of time and where you are located and it is also carried over into those timelines that exist with you but not so visible nevertheless they are part of your energy field and we have reconnected you with those aspects that you have been able to absorb able to recognise so here this energy stream of the greater expanded matrix of coded information is going into all of those creations of you there may be set up a system similar to a relay function and as this is activated there will be parts of you who are well aware of this action and what has taken place and the necessity of it for this part of you we refer to is consciousness and has come forward to greet you from another element of existence and there is an energy that this aspect of you can bring forth to reassure you that what you have chosen to accept will accelerate your expansion in consciousness to such an extent that you will feel parts of you are disappearing and ceasing to exist in the physical world that you have around you upon earth they are not ceasing to exist they have increased their vibration to exist in another state and that state we would remind you is what we call the chrystalline cities of light in that increased vibration if you are willing to fully understand and accept this then this aspect of you that has come forward can help you to be present in that higher state of vibration very similar to that which this part of you is existing in now the vibration also must go out to all other aspects of you to draw them into the same vibration that you have become in this way you are uplifting many because of the state of consciousness that surrounds you in these individual appearances of life times this is shown to you in a diagrammatic form but it is demonstrating that you are all one and you are upholding all aspects of your life drawing into this harmony of vibration if you perceive that as sound you would hear it as a vibration passing out through you and if you see it you may see the waves within the pattern of light or you may see it as a network or grid being connected and enlivened this is part of what the universe is you are empowered with this you may feel the burst of energy occurring within some of your cells as you as an individual respond to this energy even if the words are not comprehended the energy that you accept will perform its function and activity as it is intended to be this has much to do with the evolvement of your planetary system when a great number of you become conscious in this act of creation the vibration extends and increases and so the manifested ideal world will increase and these clear spaces of harmony will come forward around you you will see through the appearance of what is manifested in the world and has been drawn into denseness you will see through that into a relationship in the energy that is more suited to how you feel within you the clearer you become the stronger the new vibrationary world will be in this moment with us if you have a remembrance of yourself in some difficult situation this is the time to lovingly release the energy of that it is these energy systems that disturb the body element in many ways become the light and enter into communion with your light self and with this expanded network of consciousness and most of all your relationship to the highest aspect of you for that highest aspect has already realised the presence of the infinite creative life force we bring your conscious awareness back into the communication chamber here again as you connect in with this energy to focus you here all that is relevant for you that you have heard will stay with you and draw upon the energy information from the chrystalline energy essence here the words are meaningful in this sense as vibrations but if you receive these messages in another form without hearing the words the vibration is still contained within that presentation to you and you will hear very well the transmission you may have the sense that you have been hooked into another space and another part of you and another part of the unfolding universe as indeed it is all this will be working within you and you will have a greater outlook and a sense of new beginnings and activities that you will be moving into your attitude will have changed as a result of the encoded frequencies that expand you enhancing you with this now working in you and through you i am preparing to restore you to your energy systems and i accompany you directly back to your physical light form and here i address you individually once more and i must say to you that you will be led in a very physical way as part of this unfoldment to you to the groups who are extending new places of existence in structure on the earth plane knowing that they need the input of messengers and people who are more aware on a vibrationary level and who will have new ways of dealing with the existence of inter dimensional worlds that are making themselves known to a greater number of people this you may need to work with and adapt to and give time and space to within your present circumstances as you allow your higher loving acceptance to move into your present circumstances then you will see that more time space is being created for this greater relevant vibrationary work that you are connected into and so purpose becomes manifested and the earth plane is the plane of manifestation there will be the ongoing change and adjustment for when all is raised into a purer vibration this is continuing here dear one i depart know that you are enfolded in the loving creation i love and respect you orem out

4130319 believe in it more than anybody else i think i overcame every single one of my personal shortcomings by the sheer passion i brought to my work i dont know if youre born with this kind of passion or if you can learn it but i do know you need it if you love your work you will be out there every day trying to it the best you possibly can and pretty soon everybody around you will catch the passion from you like a fever
4130320 treat them as partners in turn they will treat you as a partner and together you will all perform beyond your wildest expectations remain a corporation and retain control if you like but behave as a servant leader in a partnership encourage your associates to hold a stake in the company offer discounted stock and grant them stock for their retirement its the single best thing we ever did
4130321 the more they know the more they will understand the more they understand the more they will care once they care there is no stopping them if you dont trust your associates to know what is going on they will know you dont really consider them partners information is power and the gain you get from empowering your associates more than offsets the risk of information your competitors
4130322 a paycheck and a stock option will buy one kind of loyalty but all of us like to be told how much somebody appreciates what we do for them we like to hear it often and especially when we have done something we are really proud of nothing else can quite substitute for a few well chosen well timed sincere words of praise they are absolutely free and worth a fortune
4130323 why should we take those cornballs at wal mart seriously
4130324 figure out ways to get them talking the folks on the front lines the ones who actually talk to the customer are the only ones who really know what is going on out there you did better find out what they know this really is what total quality is all about to push responsibility down in your organization and to force good ideas to bubble up within it you must listen to what your associates are trying to tell you
4130325 if you do they will come back over and over give them what they want and a little more let them know you appreciate them make good on all your mistakes and dont make excuses apologies stand behind everything you do the two most important words i ever wrote were on that first wal mart sign satisfaction guaranteed they are still up there and they have made all the difference
4130326 this is where you can always find the competitive advantage for 25 years running long before wal mart was known as the nations largest retailer we ranked number one in our industry for the lowest ratio of expenses to sales you can make a lot of different mistakes and still recover if you run an efficient operation or you can be brilliant and still go out of business if you are too difficult

4130330 every cable and satellite operator compresses network signals according to their bandwidth needs it can vary from market to market household to household
4130331 there are many variables that may affect a transmission signal the transmission to the satellites alone causes some distortion also viewers tv sets cable connections and locations vary widely
4130332 we are rolling out amc hd in some markets but it is not yet widely carried were hoping to expand carriage significantly throughout the year
4130333 the change could result in comic con an event thats rapidly expanded in recent years to include tv programming siphoning attention from the critics tour
4130334 every year san diego comic con ends with people griping that it has gotten to be too big and that something has to change but was this the year that lived up to the complaints
4130335 people always say that as if its a good thing
4130336 thats not to say were not getting phone calls from their agents saying theyre huge now and were respectful of that were not expecting anyone to do it because they owe us there are actors that have come to some prominence theyre helping us out because they want to do it
4130337 starting before the events of the miniseries our story focuses on familiar characters including cylon number one known as cavil stockwell resistance leader sam t anders trucco and chief galen tyrol douglas
4130338 in the beginning the cylons had a plan but it didnt account for one thing survivors during the chaotic aftermath of the destruction two powerful cylon agents struggle with plots and priorities on the human ships that got away and among the resistance fighters who were left behind
4130339 i remember when i first got the script where joans roommate came to the office and shes just been fired
4130340 and i remember going wait a minute i dont know how to play this scene joan is being really nice
4130341 i dont think a woman at that time would be office manager and running the whole place if she wasnt driven
4130342 and joan could go out and find a husband quite easily shes an attractive smart successful woman but shes not pursuing that shes doing things that are safe to a certain degree because she cant marry a man whos already married
4130343 she wants it all and yet like many women shes like im a catch im doing all this and what are these guys giving us i think shes a little disillusioned
4130344 as she talked about it you could tell that the memories were coming up in her and that her body was tensing up
4130345 you could tell that watching the show for her was certainly bringing up a lot
4130346 its the initial reading that really takes you by surprise then you just settle in
4130347 i have women coming up to me and saying i love your character
4130348 thats another side of her and i respect that in joan she says and does things that i would never allow myself to do sometimes i think theyre nuts and sometimes i admire the actions she takes
4130349 evil lords corrupted by wealth and power and armies of cyclopean guards aided by fierce battle stags all bent on keeping the galaxys life sustaining yeast from our heros grasp

4130352 dna evidence and all sorts of technology and here he is thrust into a world where theres a whole other kind of ethos to everything and so those stories i think will be sort of endless for us
4130353 you should lower your expectations then you will love it
4130354 i hope people know that everything i do is just about people
4130355 why does the female black widow spider eat the male after mating
4130356 you boys and girls in a state of suspended adolescence you sicken me
4130357 this is like bringing a banjo on stage after the stones play
4130358 it wont be a guest star it will be somebody who has graced your television screen on our program before
4130359 i dont think it should be seen as an artistic triumph i think it should be seen as someone who as ocd
4130360 its very hard to make things look dirty on tv we do it all the time and its extra effort
4130361 i like to make my own stuff as much as i can i dont like to page through magazines and say oh heres a corner of a room lets replicate that id rather look around and see materials from a bunch of different sources and then put that research aside and just think about stuff
4130362 occasionally i will misfire i did it just the other week
4130363 i had gone off in a direction that was too fancy for one of the sets it was simply a matter of having to paint it back down to a duller color and tear it up a little bit
4130364 right now we have a scene where need a particular kind of vehicle and whats written in a script i think didnt exist then
4130365 ill have a remembrance but ill have to go back and check research and say is this right or is this a unique thing i saw when i was young
4130366 im literally waiting for the first person to talk about how overrated it is
4130367 matt lays a lot of track like he did in season 1
4130368 and the payoffs come fast and furious as they did in season 1
4130369 you get to see what you dont get to see on most tv shows
4130370 you get to see them with these different faces and then finally you get to see them alone loneliness is part of the show because i think its part of the human condition
4130371 its sort of nefarious but its dignified theres no one going on maury povich and saying i slept with my mother and her sister secrets today are given no value because everything is exposed whereas then everything was secret and on three martinis too
4130372 a lot of the information that the audience gets right away no one else has
4130373 that was the suspense is this situation going to explode how could she not know does she know
4130374 to me the mystery and suspense on the show and almost everything on the show comes from the tension between the different people we are the different selves we are
4130375 an ambitious charismatic assistant district attorney who comes from one of miamis most politically powerful and beloved families
4130376 he and dexter set something in motion neither can pull back
4130377 hes going to own the code and become more of his own mad this season
4130378 itd be funny if i was called in for a csi case and all i did was help them solve a crime
4130379 the torchwood team has never been in this much jeopardy
4130380 executive producer michael green read the profanity spiked text messages from mcshane aloud to the crowd which responded with waves of laughter
4130381 the fact is there are echoes of what happened before with firefly so some people are worried
4130382 my response to that is first of all thanks im glad you care and also you can be worried the show could have all the support in the world from fox and still not be successful theres no guarantees in this business the fact is their support hasnt wavered but they did sort of view what id done as a little bit different from what id sold
4130383 i looked at the first pilot with a very cold eye an executives eye and said ok i know what they want that they dont have
4130384 i asked them do you want a new pilot earlier and they said no no no we just want to figure out how to make this work i said heres how youre going to make this work im going to write you a new one they were very grateful
4130385 no matter how free they feel coming and going from the dollhouse in essence they are completely tracked
4130386 we wanted a very nurturing environment and thats why we went with spa spa spa in the d cor
4130387 we wanted natural elements we wanted to do anything that would say this is not anything but a happy harmonious home dont ask any questions
4130388 coming back but may not have the ability to speak
4130389 oh is this too much hype will there be a backlash
4130390 for adrianne and jesse if you guys had to commit another crime and cover it up what would it be and could you get away with it again
4130391 i think we should start robbing stuff bonnie and clyde style
4130392 i hope landry is done with his criminal ways but i dont really know how to respond to that i would like to see just the fact that its still with him if thats subtle or whatever it is but i hope he doesnt kill anyone else that was rough
4130393 why would boston replace one pitcher in the rotation buchholz with another who is probably a run worse because they have a case of the stupids
4130394 as long as i can walk in a straight line its fine its the little twists and turns things you take for granted that kind of bite at you ive never had this so i dont know how its going to affect me
4130395 i think this is the kick start and hopefully the catalyst
4130396 things at sheffield wednesday didnt go to plan but we were back in training and working hard on monday and we showed at bury that were determined to put things right and kick on with the season
4130397 i think people have read into the start of the season a little bit too much were still ready to go in and attack the championship
4130398 its a tough game well massive in terms of the championship theyve brought some great players in during pre season
4130399 weve got to do more than compete on saturday weve got to look to win
4130400 there are new faces and attacking options in the team and youve just got to adapt and get used to working together and gel and i think were just about doing it now and there are good things to come
4130401 i think chris eagles will score many goals so i said to him let me have a couple for now
4130402 pre season went okay but now im into the season and ive got three in two
4130403 im lucky theyve been put in a position where i can finish
4130404 it comes with hard work i think youve got to do that first and do everything on the training field
4130405 there will be times when i dont score and therell be times when i will but i think more importantly its about working hard and being a good professional
4130406 i think thats more important than scoring goals and thats what i try to do
4130407 weve been working hard on shooting in training and finishing im just blessed to score and lucky really
4130408 ive just got to keep putting in the performances and the hard work and keep my professionalism
4130409 the lads work hard for me and i work hard for them and they put it in positions where really you cant miss

4130447 setahu saya di rtrw batam itu peternakan babi hanya ada di pulau bulan selain itu tak ada karena sesuai masukan dari departemen peternakan itu peternakan babi termasuk peternakan yang memiliki aturan khusus sekaligus harus tetap memperhatikan kondisi budaya masyarakat setempat

4130461 i was caught out of nowhere so i didnt really come up with the proper response at the time theres many other things that i felt like saying but why give it to a random guy with a camera so that he can make money
4130462 all i am trying to say is is that i was raised with a wonderful family surrounding me of course we have our ups and downs but all in all my mother taught us to appreciate what we have been given nor would she ever encourage or allow a 14 year old child to alter her body

4130487 we have had severe strikes at the airport and particularly the one on july 29 the strike resulted in damage to the runway lighting systems and other facilities related to the airport operation standby operation the vhf radio communications computer equipment both in the tower and airport building
4130488 we have managed over the last two weeks to bring back up the systems with the spares we had on hand and this restoration used up all the spares we have to replace major portions of cable and we have imported additional lights for replacement generators for the lights connectors as well as various other attachments to be able to get the fixed system back in place

4130491 since the spectrum pricing formula is auctioned to which the ministry of finance is fully agreed and the process in which the ministry of finance is fully involved we are consistent with the decision of the cabinet
4130492 it is therefore surprising that the ministry of finance has now decided to express its reservations on procedural aspects
4130493 as we promised 3g auction will take place within the scheduled time there will not be any deviation from the announced guidelines
4130494 the issue of guidelines without any consultations with the ministry of finance either within the forum of telecom commission or outside is inappropriate and contrary to the cabinet decision
4130495 in addition the chairman of the committee is member finance telecom commission any concern of ministry of finance can be considered by this committee and action taken thereof
4130496 the reserve price recommended by telecom regulator trai has been doubled and trais concurrence also obtained it is needless to say that there is no method of fixing reserve price for spectrum and the doubling of reserve price as indicated by trai is only the beginning of price discovery through auction
4130497 as far as time frame is concerned there will be no deviation from what we announced on august 1 2008

4130524 this is a baseless rumor and i dont know the genesis of it
4130525 the situation will remain the same as it has for all of our prime time broadcasts
4130526 the reason that were showing this in the normal prime time patterns on the west coast is because this is when the majority of people are available to watch

4130533 the data are higher than expected and should push treasury rates higher although with energy and other commodity prices having come down the markets may discount some of these data as old news
4130534 still the level is holding above 400 000 and it seems to reflect mostly labor market weakness

4130536 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4130537 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4130538 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4130539 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4130540 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4130541 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4130542 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

4130545 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
4130546 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
4130547 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
4130548 while energy prices appear likely to pullback in august it is not as clear to us that food prices will moderate given trends in ppi food and agricultural prices received
4130549 core cpi prices were also above expectations and have picked up noticeably in the last two months
4130550 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
4130551 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
4130552 one can forget about any talk about georgias territorial integrity because i believe it is impossible to persuade south ossetia and abkhazia to agree with the logic that they can be forced back into the georgian state
4130553 the fed is still facing substantial inflation risk despite the start of what might be a correction in commodity prices
4130554 soaring prices are clearly draining household spending power in real terms
4130555 fed officials cannot ignore these price increases but they have time to wait it out
4130556 we have rising conviction that inflation readings for august and now even september will be more favorable thanks to the sustained trend in retail gasoline and natural gas prices
4130557 moreover many food basics are posting declines in the wholesale market a trend which will soften food price gains for consumers
4130558 in environmentally relevant settings there are no indications for significant deca bde degradation
4130559 given the large amount of deca bde already in our sediments and likely to accumulate in sediments in the future due to leaching from landfills and electronic wastes it seems likely to me that such oddball congeners will be formed from bde 209 debromination

4130565 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
4130566 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
4130567 the government wants to balance artificial and natural family planning methods and how they will be carried in the advocacy in her state of the nation address the president asserted the importance of the natural family planning method but there is a mandate from her for doh and popcom to orient the local government units on how they will take charge of artificial family planning methods and contraceptives the natural family planning method is a supplement

4130576 there is no doubt about his integrity but it is undeniable that he is gentle yet very obstinate in trying to get what he wants

4130578 they still think the u s is the epicenter of the world economy
4130579 the u s is still very important but as far as commodity demand is concerned the u s isnt the main game in town china is the biggest consumer and increasingly india
4130580 according to our calculations the exchange rate development has contributed 12 30 per barrel to the decline in oil prices since mid july when the us dollar hit a low of 1 6 against the euro

4130582 we do call on russia to respect the territorial integrity of georgia
4130583 i am deeply troubled by a notion i see developing in russia and that is a notion that russia somehow has a say or some control over countries outside of its borders
4130584 in my judgment this is a very worrisome development it really indicates a soviet era mentality and i think it is something that all democratic countries should speak out strongly against and i hope russia will reconsider its actions

4130642 we conclude that a bill of rights and freedoms should not include directly enforceable duties
4130643 we recommend for inclusion amongst others the right to trial by jury the right to administrative justice and international human rights as yet not incorporated into uk law
4130644 we believe that there is a strong case for detailed rights for children and we recommend that the public should be consulted about including specific rights for other vulnerable groups
4130645 rights such as the right to adequate healthcare to education and to protection against the worst extremes of poverty touch the substance of peoples everyday lives and would help to correct the popular misconception that human rights are a charter for criminals and terrorists
4130646 a great deal of our work in this parliament has concerned the vulnerable and the marginalised older people in healthcare asylum seekers adults with learning disabilities and children in secure training centres for example no it has not
4130647 we have often pointed out serious shortcomings in the protection of the human rights of these vulnerable and marginalised people
4130648 whilst not diminishing the obligation on parliament to legislate effectively and in compliance with human rights principles strengthening the legal protection for the rights of such people should in our view be one of the principal purposes of any new bill of rights
4130649 we want to see a bill of rights that would set the bar for the universal standards to which everyone is entitled and fills the gaps in the protection of more vulnerable people such as the elderly children or people with learning disabilities
4130650 it should not be some sort of charter for correct behaviour that would see rights as a reward for fulfilling social responsibilities rather it should be aspirational setting out a shared vision for the future of our society
4130651 a uk bill of rights and freedoms would be a constitutional landmark
4130652 it would provide a framework both for protecting the liberty of the individual against the intrusion of state power and for protecting the little person against powerful interests

4130739 peace to you just as the father sent me i send you
4130740 unless i see the nail holes in his hands put my finger in the nail holes and stick my hand in his side i wont believe it
4130741 take your finger and examine my hands take your hand and stick it in my side dont be unbelieving believe
4130742 so you believe because youve seen with your own eyes even better blessings are in store for those who believe without seeing
4130743 throw the net off the right side of the boat and see what happens
4130744 simon son of john do you love me more than these
4130745 master you know everything there is to know youve got to know that i love you
4130746 feed my sheep slide 52 do you love me 18 im telling you the very truth now when you were young you dressed yourself and went wherever you wished but when you get old youll have to stretch out your hands while someone else dresses you and takes you where you dont want to go
4130747 if i want him to live until i come again whats that to you you follow me
4130748 if i want him to live until i come again whats that to you
4130749 must wait for what the father promised the promise you heard from me
4130750 master are you going to restore the kingdom to israel now is this the time
4130751 you dont get to know the time timing is the fathers business 8 what youll get is the holy spirit and when the holy spirit comes on you you will be able to be my witnesses in jerusalem all over judea and samaria even to the ends of the world
4130752 you galileans why do you just stand here looking up at an empty sky this very jesus who was taken up from among you to heaven will come as certainly and mysteriously as he left
4130753 friends long ago the holy spirit spoke through david regarding judas who became the guide to those who arrested jesus
4130754 and also what was written later let someone else take over his post slide 70 replacing judas 21 judas must now be replaced the replacement must come from the company of men who stayed together with us 22 from the time jesus was baptized by john up to the day of his ascension designated along with us as a witness to his resurrection
4130755 you o god know every one of us inside and out slide 72 replacing judas make plain which of these two men you choose 25 to take the place in this ministry and leadership that judas threw away in order to go his own way
4130756 you look at kids they take their shoes off and run around all the time maybe his feet were hurting that day well educate him a little bit more and tell him about keeping his shoes on till he gets inside we dont like things to happen but they happen what can you do other than try to educate them
4130757 it would take a serious unexpected setback for him to be unavailable for the cowboys game
4130758 spurious and unfounded employment tribunal claim without referring the matter to the national executive committee
4130759 conspired with his partner to give her an unfair advantage
4130760 careful to ensure that he had nothing to do with the application for consideration of or grant of dpf legal assistance to either officer
4130761 the allegations are extremely serious they allege that mr keating has abused his position and the trust placed in him by dpf members in order to favour his partner over another dpf member in blatant disregard for the very protocol which he himself set up
4130762 the allegations therefore go to the heart of his personal and professional reputation short of charges of financial impropriety it is hard to imagine a more direct attack on his integrity
4130763 the old view of elite media vs mass media is fading fastt
4130764 people are more and more likely to be seen reading both grazia and the economist
4130765 with global concerns from the credit crunch to climate change becoming ever more pressing we hope people will continue to turn to us for our independent voice and our focus on the issues people and places that really matter
4130766 i have been roughed up they dragged me pulled me and knocked me to the ground now they are filming me
4130767 i am a british journalist i have all the olympic accreditation i need
4130768 i have no opinion on tibet i am a journalist
4130769 we are aware of the incident and have spoken directly to john ray
4130770 we have expressed our strong concern to the chinese authorities and we are pleased that he has been released
4130771 given our pleasing performance in the first half year we consider it justifiable to raise our pre tax profit forecast for the group to over one billion euros
4130772 would severely curtail the freedom of the media to cover the conflict by effectively giving soldiers a free hand to kill without being sure that they were not firing on journalists
4130773 im extremely disappointed that this report condones a disproportionate use of deadly force in a situation the army itself admitted had not been analysed clearly
4130774 they would appear to take the view that any raising of a camera into position could garner a deadly response
4130775 these findings mean that a journalist with a camera is at risk of coming under fire and theres not that much that can be done thats unacceptable its difficult to believe that the idf took the necessary precautions to avoid causing harm to civilians as it is obliged to do under international law
4130776 the tank crew was unable to determine the nature of the object mounted on the tripod and positively identify it as an anti tank missile a mortar or a television camera

4130780 i thought starting my company in buffalo would be great because buffalo is a great city and i know the arts would love it here because it doesnt have a lot of dance companies it has very good dance companies but it is not inundated with dance companies
4130781 they are really becoming a a part of the city in just one year they have really set up their lives here
4130782 they all love buffalo and are all very much a part of buffalos culture and buffalos daily existence
4130783 in the fall we are starting a very unique long term collaboration with the university at buffalos department of theater and dance and lehrerdance
4130784 we will be touring around the world starting next year and we bring that to buffalo and we carry the buffalo name with us everywhere we go
4130785 our style is very unique because it is all just my choreography
4130786 all my dancers are varied and every dance is different than the next
4130787 i get fathers of dance students who hate going to see dance but love seeing our shows because they are extremely athletic and entertaining
4130788 then i get dancers from ballet companies that love it because it is extremely technical and artistic so we pride ourselves on spanning the whole spectrum and attracting a wide audience base
4130789 its our first show this close to buffalo so im really curious to see what the general demographic of the audience will be
4130790 the one thing we have going for us as a new company is that we are touring a lot the show people will see
4130791 what was reagans defining speech mr gorbachev tear down that wall

4130795 mccain immediately made a statement of support for a free nation with an elected government
4130796 yes i imagine hell wow people with his rhetorical ability problem is obamas speeches really dont hold up very well over time their lack of substance causes them to evaporate
4130797 can you really remember one line one substantive point from his world changing speech on race
4130798 im unconvinced america wants a rock star without a resume for president
4130799 theres an athlete pool out there we can tap into to be successful we have struggled for decades to figure out a formula
4130800 look at baseball basketball american football the u s knows how to build a sport
4130801 it was always my fathers dream to have handball become big in the u s
4130802 maybe ill become a trainer in the u s one day
4130803 i always try to talk my way out of kissing scenes do they really need to kiss in this part
4130804 im still happy to have a team theyre going to get better i believe that
4130805 winning is not your first priority just following a team when they win whats the point
4130806 i already knew you wanted a southwest chicken salad glass of water
4130807 you cant understand how a woman seeing a man who has been separated from his wife for months can cause such a scandal its awful i cant tell you you wonder when its all going to stop
4130808 i think barrys trying to have his cake and eat it too
4130809 we never said we were back together anyway thats just what everyone else thought
4130810 it is hard enough being 14 years old and you have enough insecurities to begin with then add being in the public eye
4130811 at least 80 000 meters a week nearly 50 miles
4130812 i dont have a strict diet its all about cramming in as many calories into my system as i possibly can
4130813 i still see him all the time at least once a week
4130814 kelli and casey have been a couple on and off for a few years
4130815 in true costa style he got out of the vehicle after doing a lap to avoid us and tried to intimidate the firefighters
4130816 he was met with boos and much frank and open debate regarding the nsw wages policy and the threat to close fire stations and sack firefighters he was quite aggressive and the firefighters present were just as up front with him it was quite a spectacle
4130817 at one point he made a statement saying nsw firefighters are the best paid firefighters in the country
4130818 my 10 year old daughter then said for all to hear standing right next to him excuse me sir im only 10 years old and even i know that is a lie
4130819 costa then tried to say that that was a good line that daddy had taught her he was then booed again
4130820 were always ready to talk to workers were more than happy to talk to them about their wage claims
4130821 so many chemists went to the wall because of pan
4130822 the only way they would have been compensated would have been that 55 million stop and think of that
4130823 im not aware of any other case in this country where the government has accepted a claim against it for abuse of public office and paid such a large amount to a private individual
4130824 we do sample airworthiness bulletins when we do maintenance audits but we can only sample them
4130825 qantas would have at any time in excess of 2000 airworthiness bulletins current for its fleet
4130826 so there is no way we can audit every ad airworthiness directive they currently have
4130827 obviously some part of the translation of the boeing service bulletin into the material the engineers were using that bit was left out
4130828 he said adding that how the rectification was missed and at what point it happened was what casa was looking at
4130829 there has been too much cost cutting and not enough attention to quality
4130830 for the older 737s qantas chose to do some modifications and continue to do inspections and for the younger ones including these aicraft they chose to do all the work so they didnt have to do all the work
4130831 thats why some of them some were not caught up in this and were okay and approved but the others had the modifications done that got rid of the inspections that included the clips but which were unfortunately did not include the clips
4130832 no they checked them all and did non destructive testing on them and found nothing
4130833 firstly we are reporting better as to what is going on with people presenting
4130834 but alcohol products are more readily available and marketed to young people and three young people are risk takers they think they are invincible
4130835 the statistics have increased over the last decade in staggering proportions but i dont know there is anything we can say with certainty as to why
4130836 increased availability of alcohol is a major contributor but not the only contributor
4130837 as parents we have dropped the ball in this country our kids absorb our drinking habits this is where it is coming from it is our kids seeing the way we drink
4130838 were aware of that contact made and we have spoken to both david batten and jared golla in relation to recent communications they had received
4130839 i can confirm that i have instructed my solicitors to file unfair dismissal and unlawful termination proceedings with the australian industrial commission in relation to my termination by iguana joes waterfront bar on the 18th of july 2008
4130840 the matter is now in the hands of the australian industrial relations commission and i dont want to make any further comment
4130841 they female gangs are hanging out in the streets attacking at random and are not being moved on
4130842 there is a pack mentality some of them attackers are as young as 12
4130843 their numbers are too overwhelming for police a lot of them are getting away with it they are often in mobs and hard to identify they rely on that anonymity to avoid being caught
4130844 the state government must do its bit to stamp the practice out
4130845 this should include an inquiry into bullying empowering teachers and principals to discipline students at least 700 more school counsellors and co ordination between schools and local police
4130846 if people are giving them to bosses and obtaining sick pay they could be committing a crime
4130847 we havent seen anything as well organised as this before
4130848 companies that enforce medical certificate policy can have a lower absentee rate than those who dont
4130849 but what we are hearing from companies is the policy is failing its not enough of a deterrent
4130850 it is the case that he has endeavoured to obtain some assistance from those who gave him religious guidance to try to behave in a way other than his paedophilic tendencies would indicate
4130851 tragically for his children he had failed on a number of occasions in that regard
4130852 hes a person who has an insight into the nature of the offending and the consequences of it
4130853 he used lollies and other intelligent means to manipulate a very little girl and boy
4130854 if these kinds of operations continue against us in the tribal areas we will continue this
4130855 a token of ones style and substance as a blogger
4130856 as required for any additional students be they for regular education or special education
4130857 the cost of maintaining and training and retaining staff on an annual basis is increasing so that school districts are faced with going back to their communities to ask for additional dollars to maintain and retain the high quality staff that they have that are delivering the high quality programs the community is used to
4130858 thats what operating dollars are for technology textbooks teachers and along with teachers you could add every support position we have
4130859 we have some statistics that show based on the ohio department of education analysis of how we spend our dollars that a high percentage of our dollar goes directly into the classroom i believe its in the 72 percent range which puts us in the top 10 in the entire state with there being 614 school districts in ohio its a pretty good place to be
4130860 i think that solidifies our priorities for how we spend our money
4130861 people costs continue to go up and thats what you use operating dollars for if you do not have those operating dollars you need to reduce your budgets and once again youre back to if 90 percent of your budget is people youre going to reduce people and people serve people in our industry which reduces services to kids
4130862 its the 10th consecutive year in a row to have the highest report card thats been in existence and theres only 16 other school districts in ohio who can say that we think were in good company and we think we return to the community a high return on the investment theyve already made in our school district and on our kids
4130863 fuel is sort of the buzz word across the region
4130864 will be made with the interest of student safety in mind
4130865 it means chaos it means getting to work really hard and get good at stuff that i like like dance and english i like writing i get to make friends and have a good time
4130866 getting back in the routine getting the building prepared and everything cleaned out getting the rooms cleaned getting all the germs from last year out getting everything ready for the new students coming back

4130886 im not opposed to drilling what ive been opposed to is the bush cheney focus solely on oil ive been opposed to the bush cheney line that we can drill our way out of this challenge
4130887 my opposition to schaffers energy plan is based on the fact that its a drill drill drill approach
4130888 we need a much broader approach a much more comprehensive approach that understands that the future includes renewables conservation these amazing fuel efficient cars

4130899 inflation is certainly above expectations here but i think weve probably seen for the near term anyway the worse of the inflation readings

4130958 two australian men and a lady were helping the injured and they asked me to talk to the one who was still alive and help calm him down
4130959 he was obviously in shock his face was very pale and i encouraged him to lie down
4130960 but there were only two still alive and the other one was in the back of the van in a very bad way the australian asked me to tell him to stay calm and not move and he too was in shock
4130961 it was very traumatic i was concerned about my boy it was very tiring and we were a bit shocked too so we came home
4130962 i borrowed a top from one of the guys matt targett that was three sizes too big for me and pants from cate campbell who has legs three sizes bigger than me
4130963 it feels pretty amazing to be a part of the team to start with
4130964 ive been given a great opportunity and i just wanted to do the best i could to be a part of it with the other girls and were all from queensland too so that makes it more special
4130965 being able to prove i was the best in the world was what these olympics were all about

4130981 pude hacer una carrera dentro del todo regular con m s buenos resultados que malos llegu a mi techo tengo 30 a os se ha cumplido una etapa en mi vida ahora a pensar en otra cosa
4130982 voy a tener tiempo para hacer muchas cosas ya lo ver no voy tomar una decisi n sin evaluar bien lo que quiero hacer de mi vida
4130983 uno debe tener las cosas en claro yo dije que ten a pocas chances de llegar a una semifinal y hay gente que me critic por eso pero es la realidad no era que no me ten a fe o expectativas pero esto es por tiempo y uno no depende de uno mismo hay grandes nadadores
4130984 el tiempo que me hab a propuesto en los 100 metros era 49 segundos clavados y entraron a la semi con 48s05 100 entonces en vez de haber quedado 35 hubiera finalizado 28
4130985 estoy contento de haber terminado una participaci n dentro del todo regular yo soy muy autocr tico y trato de buscar siempre m s hay que analizar por qu no se dio
4130986 mi mejor nivel lo tuve cuando a los 23 o 24 y hoy por hoy en el fin de mi carrera siento que he llegado a un nivel que quiz s mejorar una o dos cent simas es cuesti n de estar iluminado un d a y no cometer ning n tipo de errores como en estas pruebas de velocidad
4130987 se habla demasiado por los no tan buenos resultados que se est n obteniendo y se les echa la culpa a los deportistas y eso no deber a ser as
4130988 los atletas tienen la mejor intenci n y luchan a morir siempre como cada argentino que le toca representar al pa s le ponen una mochila muy pesada a cada deportista que le va mal y que no se merecen

4130992 once i get everyone in the same room its great
4130993 i had a student come in and want to learn an old blue oyster cult song i asked him where he heard it he said guitar hero
4130994 it says a lot about that kind of music people get tired of b s
4130995 im fortunate were all still alive and able to do this
4130996 our focus on investment in product development is starting to pay off with significant customer wins in multiple segments
4130997 despite difficult economic conditions we continued to grow revenue and improve profitability
4130998 is ok with the pope as long as it isnt reported by the liberal press
4130999 ragheads are boy bumpers as clearly as they are women haters
4131000 the motivation wasnt necessarily that we wanted to join greenpeace
4131001 theoretically we could get the methane from anywhere even from cow manure
4131002 to launch something from the ground through the very thick atmosphere and get out to suborbital space you have to do a huge blast you have to detonate a bomb basically
4131003 these customers will be the same people who dont hesitate to buy a top of line jaguar to use that analogy we dont even look at the emissions of a porsche or a bentley because they are just dwarfed by the emissions from the big automakers
4131004 we were going to do this last year but we couldnt and we had people complain that they couldnt retrace the route
4131005 his only start at five years six furlongs in 1 12 at saratoga the fastest time ever made in the east
4131006 the presidents decrees on the black sea fleet will of course be implemented on the territory of ukraine
4131007 the defence ministry and the general staff are among those state bodies responsible for this task
4131008 we have discussed this proposal in the permanent council and there is no decision yet but i can say that there is no objection in principle on this
4131009 talabani received surgery on one of the blood vessels in his heart it was a successful operation
4131010 the physicians informed him that he may leave the hospital today or tomorrow and he will go to washington
4131011 we have information that american military transport aviation say they are delivering a certain humanitarian cargo to tbilisi airport though they said we had bombed the airport two days ago
4131012 lets ask them will they invite you the media to check whether it is humanitarian or not what is in it the cargo in reality it is of major concern to russians
4131013 the last 24 hours we are just watching the situation there are still snipers out there certain groups have gotten through and the provocations are continuing
4131014 perhaps now it is against a different background but there are always these leftover problems
4131015 a military force that has not been warmed up you can tell it to stop and it will stop but these troops you might say are still carrying out the previous mission there are still a lot of problems
4131016 but we will settle things with everyone and right now establishing peace is the main issue
4131017 aside from an ecological disaster it wouldnt result in anything
4131018 it is our principle that oil pipelines do not interest us
4131019 why would anyone bomb oil pipelines we did not bomb them
4131020 we have one general commander for the black sea fleet it is the president of russia and all commands from outside are illegitimate to us
4131021 we are no longer fighting believe me we have a different problem now poti is one of those and the geography is probably going to change we switched into the capacity of peacekeepers
4131022 as far as poti and other places are concerned lets agree with you that if it the place is inside the peacekeeping zone of responsibility then it is legitimate for intelligence information and special groups to be there
4131023 we cant sit and do nothing we need to proceed with intelligence operations and react adequately this is our task including during a time of peace
4131024 it was not easy for the georgian side to accept defeat the fighting was very intense at the end with both sides using heavy weapons
4131025 this is the main cause for a large number of casualties you know it cost a great amount of blood to take berlin
4131026 we are planning it it depends on many factors i cant give you the date we have stopped building up troops
4131027 socialized and low cost housing loan restructuring act of 2008
4131028 roof over our heads is a basic necessity and a basic human right the primary purpose of providing socialized housing and low cost housing is to give our people even the poorest of the poor a decent place to live we should not deny them that right
4131029 this is a major part of the presidents social alleviate program
4131030 our countrymen are suffering because of the global food and energy crisis that has taken its toll on the local economy
4131031 it will also be beneficial to the housing agencies and government financing institutions as not only will they be able to continue their collection of amortization but will give them relief from the difficulty of evicting delinquent occupants and from the tedious and costly foreclosure procedures that average from p50 000 to p136 000
4131032 this measure will undoubtedly save many of our countrymen who face the grim prospect of losing their respective houses from joining the long list of the homeless
4131033 what hes concerned about is a preemptive strikes by the governors office on the work of the legislature
4131034 i think that the lack of clarity from the court decisions may mean that its time for a second crack for the judicial branch maybe we ought to invite the question before the courts whether this particularly amendatory veto for example does go beyond the scope of that authority provided in the constitution for that reason i would suggest that an aye vote may help us answer this question that has been so contentious between the two branches ever since 1971
4131035 ive truly relished working with my longtime partner tom cruise to revitalize united artists and i am proud of all that weve accomplished in the past two years reinvigorating the brand and developing such a strong slate of films as much as ive enjoyed my time as an executive i have longed to return to my true love which is making movies so thats what ive decided to do i still believe in our vision for ua and i am confident that mgm ceo harry sloan and our colleagues at mgm will see that vision through to reality
4131036 fiona is a very good friend and a great lawyer so thats why i decided to go with her
4131037 the divorce occurred two months ago and it was all very amicable and non confrontational
4131038 she has folded herself into edith piaf so perfectly you cannot see the join
4131039 she might be smaller than et but her voice is like her subjects vast and bitter and irresistible
4131040 she brings the number bravo pour le clown to a climax by careering around the stage and charging at the audience like a wild animal it is a tremendous performance
4131041 in doing so she begs comparison with yet another piaf oscar winning marion cotillard in the recent movie la vie en rose

4131062 were refocusing and retesting this week to verify theyre in the condition we want them to be in then were all set to go
4131063 we want people to make sure they pay attention to what lanes they need to go into and that if they are an ez pass customer and in an express lane to make sure the pass is mounted because theyre not going to know where the read zone is
4131064 no way im going to make it ill just let the waves take me down

4131075 while faith and its effects can be found throughout pop culture rarely does a film address it so directly and in such an engaging way as in henry poole is here we believe that its treatment of faith will generate dialogue especially among the young adults that theology on tap touches through its many events

4131085 the plan was to perhaps take him on loan for six months and see how he did but no decision has been made yet we will look at the situation again after the game against rangers at the weekend
4131086 he has a ten hour flight to get here and probably wont be here until friday so wont be playing against rangers

4131091 youve got to turn the corner somewhere so hopefully this is where it starts

4131112 i am pulling that together with 2 700 e mails that i have between jeane and i to attempt a cogent narrative of the events that led up to her unfortunate demise
4131113 she also left me a substantial amount of recorded material that will supplement the written information
4131114 we are still in the process of transcribing all of that
4131115 there are reams of stuff nobody knows but me at this point in time
4131116 jeane was very clear with me that if she was ever found dead of an apparent suicide i was to make sure that all the evidence was publicly disseminated so that it could be independently evaluated

4131119 while i dont mean to cause jeanes family additional grief an attorneys first duty is to his client and jeane was very clear with me that if she was ever found dead of an apparent suicide i was to make sure that all the evidence was publicly disseminated so that it could be independently evaluated

4131121 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
4131122 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
4131123 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
4131124 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
4131125 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
4131126 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
4131127 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas

4131136 eu achie que ela era uma prostitua mas era minha nora
4131137 15 e vendo a jud teve a por uma prostituta porque ela tinha coberto o seu rosto 16 e dirigiu se a ela no caminho e disse vem pe o te deixa me possuir te porquanto n o sabia que era sua nora e ela disse que dar s para que possuas a mim

4131140 4 16 levanta te vento norte e vem tu vento sul assopra no meu jardim para que destilem os seus aromas ah entre o meu amado no jardim e coma os seus frutos excelentes
4131141 7 7 a tua estatura semelhante palmeira e os teus seios s o semelhantes aos cachos de uvas 8 dizia eu subirei palmeira pegarei em seus ramos e ent o os teus seios ser o como os cachos na vide e o cheiro da tua respira o como o das ma s
4131142 8 10 eu sou um muro e os meus seios s o como as suas torres ent o eu era aos seus olhos como aquela que acha paz
4131143 o meu amado p s a sua m o pela fresta da porta e as minhas entranhas estremeceram por amor dele

4131145 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
4131146 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
4131147 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
4131148 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
4131149 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
4131150 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
4131151 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
4131152 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
4131153 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
4131154 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
4131155 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
4131156 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
4131157 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
4131158 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
4131159 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
4131160 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
4131161 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
4131162 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
4131163 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
4131164 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
4131165 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
4131166 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
4131167 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
4131168 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
4131169 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
4131170 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
4131171 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
4131172 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
4131173 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
4131174 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
4131175 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
4131176 who are open to doing something on the production side
4131177 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
4131178 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
4131179 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
4131180 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
4131181 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
4131182 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
4131183 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
4131184 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
4131185 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
4131186 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
4131187 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
4131188 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
4131189 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
4131190 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
4131191 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
4131192 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
4131193 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
4131194 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
4131195 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
4131196 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
4131197 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
4131198 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4131199 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
4131200 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
4131201 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
4131202 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
4131203 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
4131204 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
4131205 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
4131206 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
4131207 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
4131208 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
4131209 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
4131210 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
4131211 ive seen them in cases from new york city to small towns whoever can afford to get the equipment and plant it on a car and of course its easy to do you can sneak up on a car and plant it at any time
4131212 we dont really want to give any info on how we use it as an investigative tool to help the bad guys it is an investigative tool for us and it is a very new investigative tool
4131213 but i dont think thats something detectives would be too happy to put out there like that they do have different techniques they like to use on suspects but they dont really want people to know
4131214 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
4131215 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
4131216 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
4131217 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
4131218 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
4131219 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
4131220 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4131221 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
4131222 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
4131223 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
4131224 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
4131225 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
4131226 the criminals know there is something to gain for example kidnapping for ransom
4131227 they try not to carry papers and pens if you are literate you must work with an ngo
4131228 for example they dont take our own cars they travel in ordinary cars looking like ordinary people
4131229 there have not been any attacks on our staff but we feel that if we go outside the city we might be attacked by taliban kidnappers or other armed groups
4131230 ultimately violence against those who are trying to help afghans rebuild their lives will only caused greater suffering for the afghan people
4131231 the white population is older and very much centered around the who are well past their high fertility years
4131232 the future of america is epitomized by the young people today they are basically the melting pot we are going to see in the future
4131233 were real remorseful they said they never had any intentions of harming anybody
4131234 we would have preferred to hit a u s frigate but no problem because they are all infidels
4131235 for michelle rhee or anyone to ask that is like judas and 30 pieces of silver
4131236 the last time we won our first game we finished seventh in the league our highest place
4131237 we have to put in the same kind of performance we did against aberdeen every week that is the hard thing keeping it going
4131238 it was the perfect start for us i was not really thinking about the 300 appearances and the goal was a bonus
4131239 it came at a good time which settled us down a bit we have been pipped at the post a few times by aberdeen so it was always going to be a bit of a nervous finish
4131240 it was obvious we wanted it more last saturday and we got our rewards in the end it did not matter who we were playing it was paramount we got off to a good start and we managed to
4131241 i think we can understand what happened with the housing market going the way it is
4131242 i had a really close look and didnt recognise any building that i know from
4131243 so i got on google and found a picture of the downtown area of
4131244 its still a real shock i have still been focusing on all the races that i have had and now to finish i feel a bit sad that its over rice said
4131245 its something i have been looking forward to my whole life coming here and i never could have imagined to have a meet like this i never came into the meet thinking of world records and olympic medals
4131246 it was really about the challenge and the experience and walking away with three golds and three world records was just amazing
4131247 coming into that final we knew that we had as good a chance as everyone else rice said
4131248 we put together a great group of four girls there and we all worked well with each other and pulled through some great results
4131249 it was such a great way for me to finish the meet and i am just so glad to be able to share it with the girls
4131250 it was disappointing when we got disqualified but since then i have really wanted to do well again in the 4x200m and its great to be doing it at the olympics mackenzie said
4131251 i was pretty nervous because we were in front and i just had to stay calm and think about what i had to do and just bring it home for the girls
4131252 bronte and i have been part of the team together this year and we really wanted to get a medal and its become so much better with a gold medal and a world record
4131253 i was given a really big opportunity to swim in the final team with these three girls palmer said
4131254 this was my first swim at my first olympics and it felt pretty amazing
4131255 we came in here with specific strategy for that relay team thompson said
4131256 the things i thought were so important because of the effort i put into them have turned out to be of small value and the things i never thought about the things i was never able to either to measure or to expect were the things that mattered
4131257 in our previous contract it ended in one year this will give us a five year evergreen clause that will ensure job security
4131258 we are going to keep doing exactly what we have been doing

4131262 pavlik its like deja vu i was asked the same about mikkel kessler who i think is a better fighter than kelly pavlik by the way and ive beaten him
4131263 now all of a sudden theres a guy whos had one or two decent wins and they call me out its always going to be the case how long can you go on for
4131264 the choice between pavlik and roy jones was easy to make remember that pavlik was my first choice after jeff lacey and he declined the fight now hes calling me out

4131266 it was mainly his physical talent and real competitiveness that stood out
4131267 a number of things make him the swimmer he is but i think it is largely psychological he can relax and focus on what he is doing when under pressure and actually this sort of environment makes him perform better
4131268 thats why i rejoice whenever they shoot a cop in philadelphia cause i hate them

4131298 w ashingtons bloody fingerprints are all over the invasion of south ossetia
4131299 the further the situation unfolds the more the world will understand that georgia would never be able to do all this without america in essence the americans have prepared the force which destroys everything in south ossetia attacks civilians and hospitals
4131300 4 2 of gdp more than a quarter of all georgian public income to military hardware
4131301 georgia could have used the years of saakashvilis presidency in different ways to build up the economy to develop the infrastructure to solve social issues both in south ossetia abkhazia and the whole state instead the georgian leadership with president saakashvili undertook consistent steps to increase its military budget from us 30 million to 1 billion georgia was preparing for a military action
4131302 in addition to the spy drones israel has also been supplying georgia with infantry weapons and electronics for artillery systems and has helped upgrade soviet designed su 25 ground attack jets assembled in georgia according to koba liklikadze an independent military expert in tbilisi former israeli generals also serve as advisers to the georgian military
4131303 the conflict has been sparked by the race for control over the pipelines carrying oil and gas out of the caspian region the russians may just bear with the pro us georgian president mikhail saakashvilis ambition to bring his country into nato but they draw a heavy line against his plans and those of western oil companies including israeli firms to route the oil routes from azerbaijan and the gas lines from turkmenistan which transit georgia through turkey instead of hooking them up to russian pipelines jerusalem owns a strong interest in caspian oil and gas pipelines reach the turkish terminal port of ceyhan rather than the russian network intense negotiations are afoot between israel turkey georgia turkmenistan and azarbaijan for pipelines to reach turkey and thence to israels oil terminal at ashkelon and on to its red sea port of eilat from there supertankers can carry the gas and oil to the far east through the indian ocean
4131304 as far as natural resources are concerned russias hand is very strong it holds 6 6 percent of the worlds proven oil reserves and 26 percent of the worlds gas reserves in addition it currently accounts for 12 percent of world oil and 21 of recent world gas production in may 2007 russia was the worlds largest oil and gas producer as for national champions putin has strengthened and prepared gazprom the state controlled gas company transneft oil pipeline monopoly and rosneft the state owned oil giant that is why in 2006 gazprom retained full ownership in the giant shtokman gas field 7 and took a controlling stake in the sakhalin 2 natural gas project in june 2007 it took back bps kovytka gas field and now is behind totals kharyaga oil and gas field

4131311 were killed by their own georgian partners in the peacekeeping forces there is a russian battalion an ossetian battalion and a georgian battalion and all of a sudden the georgians georgian peacekeepers begin shooting their russian colleagues this is of course a war crime i do not rule out that the hague and strasbourg courts and institutions in other cities will be involved in investigating these crimes and this inhuman drama that has been played out
4131312 the actions of georgia have led to deaths among them are russian peacekeepers the situation reached the point that georgian peacekeepers have been shooting at russian peacekeepers now women children and old people are dying in south ossetia most of them are citizens of the russian federation as the president of the russian federation i am obligated to protect lives and the dignity of russian citizens wherever they are those responsible for the deaths of our citizens will be punished
4131313 i shall have to tell you a tale what happens when a little boy and his grandfather are plunged into darkness on a stormy rain swept summer evening they cant watch television its too dark to read and its too early to go to sleep grandfather has an idea he decides to tell thomas and ringo thomas cat a story from when grandfather was a boy its hard for thomas to imagine a time when his grandfather was as young as he is he tries to imagine it and to imagine the time in which his grandfather grew up grandfather

4131348 apesar da ambienta o em washington na realidade o filme conta a hist ria de pessoas incrivelmente cretinas que fazem coisas extremamente est pidas relacionadas com sexo e outras coisas o que torna tudo mais interessante que n o se tratam de pol ticos

4131427 its not about all white collar stuff anymore its blue collar get in get dirty
4131428 i think the key to it is the fact that these are jobs that ive covered and have been very successful in covering in cable either through series or specials
4131429 so the first season is literally thom beers this is your life kind of series
4131430 what i liked about it and the genus of it comes from one thing and that is that you have no idea how many emails and phone calls and letters i get from fans across the country who are saying i love
4131431 so the point was that i got so many people saying i can do that i can do this i can do this and i realized why dont we open this up and just take ordinary people but people that obviously we cast around the country who have a certain skill level and who are interesting and have an interesting back story and we allow them to go out and be literally rookies be first timers on a series of jobs and thats where it came from
4131432 and all of a sudden man they all spark to life they had a look in their eye there was passion in there and all of a sudden man it was like game on it was really cool as if they shed their kind of strangely corporate mortal coil and all of a sudden they all became wild men and women it was like this is cool
4131433 in every show we brought on professionals that actually do this for a living it was if you were a first day employee these are the people that do it day in and day out theyll teach the job for you and theyll judge by your performance youll be judged by your own personal performance
4131434 so it was great because it took us out of the mix the producers and allowed real bosses to make decisions on who was good and who was bad

4131436 they all said that and you could see it they could train anyone and thats the point they could train anyone a green horn but you got to have heart and watching it i totally believe it now
4131437 none of them quit ever i never saw an ounce of quit
4131438 i saw a lot of exhaustion they all wanted to do right by the job they were all looking for the atta boys they were all looking for the im doing a good job stuff

4131440 the joint business agreement will enable the airlines to reduce costs and attract new customers helping to mitigate pressure on fares from record fuel costs
4131441 this means that the airlines will have greater ability to invest in their products services and fleets employees and shareholders will also benefit from the agreement
4131442 there is no reason why fares should rise if this agreement is approved
4131443 make no mistake if this monster monopoly is approved it will be third time unlucky for consumers
4131444 it will still be bad for passengers bad for competition and bad for the uk and us aviation industry

4131449 but just when africa thought that military rulers were about to become an extinct species on the continent the coup in mauritania has reminded us that it will take a long time for true democracy to be firmly entrenched on the continent

4131521 whoever innovates something in this matter of ours islam that is not part of it will have it rejected
4131522 the best of speech is the book of allaah and the best of guidance is the guidance of muhammad peace and blessings of allaah be upon him the most evil of things are those which are newly invented and every innovation bidah is a going astray
4131523 and in whatsoever you differ the decision thereof is with allaah he is the ruling judge
4131524 but no by your lord they can have no faith until they make you o muhammad judge in all disputes between them and find in themselves no resistance against your decisions and accept them with full submission
4131525 laylat al nusf min shabaan the middle of shabaan was venerated by the taabieen among the people of al shaam such as khaalid ibn midaan makhool luqmaan ibn aamir and others who used to strive in worship on this night
4131526 whoever does any action that is not a part of this matter of ours islam will have it rejected
4131527 ibn waddaah narrated that zayd ibn aslam said we never met anyone among our shaykhs and fuqahaa who paid any attention to laylat al nusf min shabaan or who paid any attention to the hadeeth of makhool or who thought that this night was any more special than other nights it was said to ibn abi maleekah that ziyaad al numayri was saying that the reward of laylat al nusf min shabaan was like the reward of laylat al qadr he said if i heard him say that and i had a stick in my hand i would hit him ziyaad was a story teller
4131528 the hadeeth o ali whoever prays one hundred rakahs on laylat al nusf min shabaan reciting in each rakah the opening of the book soorat al faatihah and qul huwa allaahu ahad ten times allaah will meet all his needs this is mawdoo fabricated i
4131529 when it is the night of the middle of shabaan spend that night in prayer and fast that day
4131530 one hundred rakahs in the middle of shabaan reciting soorat al ikhaas ten times in each this is mawdoo fabricated and all its narrators in its three isnaads are majhool unknown and daeef weak he said and twelve rakahs reciting al ikhlaas thirty times in each this is mawdoo and fourteen rakahs this is mawdoo a group of fuqahaa were deceived by this hadeeth such as the author of al ihyaa and others as were some of the mufassireen the prayer of this night the middle of shabaan was described in different ways all of which are false and fabricated
4131531 the hadeeth about the prayer during the night of the middle of shabaan is fabricated and is falsely attributed to the messenger of allaah peace and blessings of allaah be upon him
4131532 the prayer that is known as salaat which is twelve rakahs between maghrib and ishaa on the night of the first friday in rajab and the prayer of laylat al nusf min shabaan of one hundred rakahs these two prayers are reprehensible bidahs no one should be deceived by the fact that they are mentioned in the books qoot al quloob and ihyaa uloom al deen or by the hadeeth which is mentioned in these two books all of that is false nor should they be deceived by the fact that some of the imaams were confused about this matter and wrote a few pages stating that these prayers are mustahabb for they were mistaken in that
4131533 whoever innovates something in this matter of ours islam that is not part of it will have it rejected
4131534 the messenger of allaah peace and blessings of allaah be upon him said do not single out the night of jumuah for praying qiyaam and do not single out the day of jumuah for fasting unless is it part of the ongoing regular fast of any one of you
4131535 whoever prays qiyaam in ramadaan out of faith and seeking reward allaah will forgive him his previous sins
4131536 whoever spends the night of laylat al qadr in prayer out of faith and seeking reward allaah will forgive him his previous sins
4131537 the best of matters are those which follow the guided way of the salaf and the most evil of matters are those which are newly innovated

4131546 est claro que me gusta que entren los tiros pero no es lo que m s me preocupa me preocupan mis sensaciones me preocupa ser til al equipo creo que los puntos y el tiro son una faceta importante para un equipo y que si a veces no est s acertado concentras tus energ as en otras cosas
4131547 a lo mejor he llamado un poco m s la atenci n porque han entrado un par de tiros pero en los dos primeros partidos casi no he anotado y creo que he ayudado al equipo cada d a estoy preparado y en una cancha de baloncesto hay muchas cosas que hacer adem s de meter puntos
4131548 los rivales tambi n juegan y a todo el mundo le gustar a empezar el partido sacar veinte y aguantar as los cuarenta minutos pero no es f cil
4131549 ellos alemania son muy buen equipo y a las nueve de la ma ana es inc modo jugar para todos tampoco es para tirar cohetes pero estamos contentos de lo que hemos hecho en el encuentro
4131550 en estos momentos contamos con un plantel muy parecido al de la temporada anterior con s lo tres incorporaciones hemos fichado tres jugadores como llorente ibagaza y edmilson que considero tres grandes refuerzos que nos pueden aportar muchas cosas
4131551 a medida que se acerca el inicio del campeonato es bueno
4131552 jugar con el sevilla o c diz y bilbao son buenas mediciones y aunque sabemos que son amistosos siempre es un trofeo que motiva y gusta ganar y por ello va a ser muy complicado
4131553 por lo que hemos podido seguir trabajando a un buen ritmo y a buen nivel
4131554 hacer dos equipos diferentes y dar opciones para que todo el mundo tenga minutos y pueda seguir trabajando de cara al inicio de la campa a
4131555 si el jugador no se encuentra seguro es una tonter a arriesgarlo hay m s partidos amistosos y si no se ve con seguridad para jugar este jugar los siguientes
4131556 ser un partido especial como lo fue el del a o pasado siempre es bonito jugar contra el real madrid y estar a muy bien empezar la temporada ganando la supercopa
4131557 intentaremos tener el bal n porque ellos sufren sin bal n y ojal que sea importante el factor mestalla y podamos sacar buen resultado para mantenerlo en el bernab u
4131558 porque nunca es bueno prescindir de un jugador como silva que da cach y nivel al equipo estamos contentos de que siga y ojal le salga bien esta temporada por el bien del equipo

4131560 ha creado muy buen ambiente y todo el mundo est con muchas ganas de hacer algo importante
4131561 eso que ha sucedido no es una mala noticia para nosotros nosotros lo hemos hecho con todo el cari o pero hay quien quiere hablar de esto hemos venido a china y alguien ha querido verlo desde el lado negativo quienes lo ven as son los que deben pensar que es lo qu pasa
4131562 nosotros lo hicimos con cari o y no pensando en ofender a nadie somos uno de los pa ses m s multiculturales del mundo quiz alguien tenga alg n problema con nosotros pero nosotros no tenemos ning n problema con nadie
4131563 no s si en inglaterra o en estados unidos hay gente que tiene problemas con alg n grupo pedimos disculpas a la gente asi tica con el coraz n eso es lo primero pero nosotros lo hicimos sin ninguna mala intenci n lo que quer amos era acercarnos a ellos
4131564 nuestro patrocinador es li ning hemos venido aqu y creo que no es apropiado hacer o decir algo malo de un pa s que nos acoge un mes no tiene sentido as que el que quiera hablar de esto que lo haga porque nosotros queremos hablar de baloncesto

4131576 the structures of the compounds made by electric discharge differ from those formed by uv photolysis so the hydrolysis time could be very different some of the photochemical products when uv light is used are hydrocarbons that do not react with water

4131578 uv light radiation produces tholins that look more like titans haze
4131579 some if not most of the products we make also dont react with water
4131580 tholins formed at low pressure seem to look more like titans haze than those formed at higher pressures you can make tholins at low pressures using uv light you cannot make tholins at low pressure using plasma discharge and to make the amount of tholins we needed for the experiment we needed to use the discharge technique uv photolysis only produces small amounts

4131589 with tens of thousands of new blogs beginning every day it is rare that one comes along that is very different from the rest
4131590 purgatorio marc heinrichs blog is only a few months old and today he got more hits than i did
4131591 marc we usually read your post daily for some great laughs
4131592 if youve never visited purgatorio its time the guys got a sense of humor that wont stop
4131593 i just added purgatorio to my blogroll for good reason marc heinrich is a witty christian hedonist from minnesota surprisingly who blogs entirely through the medium of pictures more importantly he also likes radiohead go check it out its not the usual fare in biblio blogging and its worth your time express enough interest and maybe hell invite you to stay at his house
4131594 marc you are an instigator arent you that is one reason why purgatorio is great
4131595 usually pot shot takers arent ecumenical enough for my taste or funny enough but this site is exceptionally funny and not so mean spirited
4131596 there are very few christian bloggers that are consistently able to write funny posts marc heinrich is not one of them he is able to be consistently funny while writing almost nothing and that is why his blog is one of my favorites
4131597 im chocking over here i will just come right out and say it what i visited and that blob site is garbage my soul within me is burning are you guys serious cmon what is this blog im disgusted
4131598 my favorite place for funny or weird photos that say more about people than words can
4131599 one of the truly unique efforts in the christian blogosphere

4131601 i really should rule 40 this blog but these kinds of posts cant be found elsewhere
4131602 id like to point out that marc is somewhat delusional from searching the internet for images that he thinks are related its kinda like the episode of voyager where seven links her alcove into the ships sensor logs and becomes hyper paranoid about the intentions of the crew and ultimately pits janeway against chakotay even though both conspiracy theories cannot be true

4131638 it was not many years ago however when the evaluation of soviet teachers was based on the performance of their students though this practice has been abolished its residue remained national teachers day aside teachers do not receive much respect from students or parents
4131639 i preferred to teach from the curriculum to mingle with the texts of their lives their daily fare rather than to use my own material

4131647 to understand cpu related issues the difference between emulation and virtualization with emulation all operations are executed in software by an emulator a software emulator allows programs to run on a computer system other than the one for which they were originally written the emulator does this by emulating or reproducing the original computers behavior by accepting the same data or inputs and achieving the same results emulation provides portability and is often used to run software designed for one platform across several different platforms with virtualization the underlying physical resources are used whenever possible and the virtualization layer executes instructions only as needed to make the virtual machines operate as if they were running directly on a physical machine virtualization emphasizes performance and runs directly on the processor whenever possible

4131655 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4131656 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4131657 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4131658 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

4131660 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
4131661 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
4131662 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
4131663 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
4131664 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
4131665 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
4131666 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

4131783 a strategic diversion has been created for russia the south ossetia capital has been shelled and a large georgian tank force has been heading towards the border american marines a thousand of them have recently been in georgia training the georgian military forces russia has stated that it will not sit by and allow the georgians to attack south ossetia this could get bad and remember it is just a strategic diversion but one that could have horrific effects
4131784 cases of possible threats by russia directed at georgia with the intention of taking control over the baku ceyhan pipeline
4131785 russia actively tends to isolate the central asian region from direct access to world economy especially to energy supplies if georgia government is destabilized western access to baku caspian sea and further will be limited
4131786 ever since the continents started interacting politically some five hundred years ago eurasia has been the center of world power the key to controlling eurasia says brzezinski is controlling the central asian republics
4131787 brzezinski russias invasion of georgia is reminiscent of stalins attack on finland
4131788 the russians deliberately provoked the fighting in south ossetia and timed it for the olympics this is a long standing russian effort to get rid of president saakashvili
4131789 and i want to stress im not a warmonger and i dont want a new cold war any more than dimitri does the russians wish to re establish a historic area of hegemony that includes ukraine and it is no accident that the other former soviet republics are watching this and extraordinarily upset as putin progresses with an attempt to re create a kind of a hegemonic space
4131790 the unipolar world refers to a world in which there is one master one sovereign one center of authority one center of force one center of decision making at the end of the day this is pernicious not only for all those within this system but also for the sovereign itself because it destroys itself from within what is even more important is that the model itself is flawed because at its basis there is and can be no moral foundations for modern civilization
4131791 unilateral and frequently illegitimate actions have not resolved any problems moreover they have caused new human tragedies and created new centers of tension judge for yourselves wars as well as local and regional conflicts have not diminished more are dying than before significantly more significantly more today we are witnessing an almost uncontained hyper use of force military force in international relations force that is plunging the world into an abyss of permanent conflicts we are seeing a greater and greater disdain for the basic principles of international law and independent legal norms are as a matter of fact coming increasingly closer to one states legal system one state and of course first and foremost the united states has overstepped its national borders in every way this is visible in the economic political cultural and educational policies it imposes on other nations well who likes this who is happy about this in international relations we increasingly see the desire to resolve a given question according to so called issues of political expediency based on the current political climate and of course this is extremely dangerous it results in the fact that no one feels safe i want to emphasize this no one feels safe because no one can feel that international law is like a stone wall that will protect them of course such a policy stimulates an arms race i am convinced that we have reached that decisive moment when we must seriously think about the architecture of global security
4131792 the offer reflects a significant premium and a strong value for unitholders as well as providing an excellent liquidity opportunity that the board of trustees fully and enthusiastically supports

4131815 he pinned my back against the wall he had his hands against the wall
4131816 he started touching me in my breast my groin area he put his hand down there when he touched my buttock i pushed him with everything i had he didnt move like a brick wall he got mad he asked me why i was shaking he said we can do it real quick i have my penis real hard when he rubbed himself against me i could feel it i pushed him and he took it out he was stroking it he was going to kiss me

4131843 if they know the true strength of their foe they might panic and flee
4131844 i will not be there to help it is better they do not know until it is too late to run away mezhan must hold
4131845 it seems the knowledge of linion is not so great
4131846 there is a score thousand out there at least and perhaps many more twice what they said we confronted enough to defeat a full legion and not merely two companies i think
4131847 but weve beaten them before remember that time on the outpost line thirty of them five of us we came out fine didnt we
4131848 but these are not bandits watch their motion see how they march in close rank and with unbroken cadence
4131849 this is no rabble what little i have heard of orcs says they fight as a mob not an army cutting at each other in their hunger to get at the enemy
4131850 then either these are not usual orcs or we have been sadly misinformed about their nature
4131851 does it matter we shall defeat them either way in ranks or as a mob
4131852 we shall bar the gates and man the walls and if they seek admission to mezhan they will pay a very heavy price in blood i see no engines of war at this distance perhaps they have come ill prepared for a siege
4131853 but they are enough to pile their dead at the base of our walls and climb over thusly
4131854 for we still have some time before they arrive and if i am not mistaken when they do we shall have enough fear to last us our lifetime
4131855 i am the hand of darkness i bring you terms of surrender for my master pities you you have seen the majesty of my host you know in your hearts that you cannot stand against it no matter how bravely you fight resistance would be foolish
4131856 thus i bring you a chance to save yourselves the terms are generous indeed my master is merciful you shall surrender the gates of the city and the roads about it you shall pledge blood allegiance to our master and fight at our sides for this all shall be saved even your captains no man woman or child will be slain within the walls of your city
4131857 we do not seek to conquer we ask merely that you aid us to right past wrongs
4131858 i am tulir captain in chief of the city i have been granted authority to speak for the defenders and here is your reply it is simple we refuse your terms utterly totally and finally we shall never surrender we shall not trust to pretty words delivered by a foul mouth we shall not lose our honour to gain our lives if you seek the gate and crossroads of mezhan then here they are come and take them if you can but be wary if your kind has any women then they will be distraught and will rend their hair for few of you will ever see your homes again and those that do will be missing their limbs we are men not curs and we will fight
4131859 all your talk is of honour it seems but there is no honour in death and death will be your pay for such defiance now my terms are not so lenient i offer quarter to the women and children of mezhan the men must pay for your insolence but this is my final offer do not refuse me if you do no quarter will be given the worst excesses of your wars of men pale to what my hordes will do the gutters of your streets will run red with blood and the orcs will feast on the sweet flesh of your children would you condemn them to such an end tulir
4131860 we may fall but perhaps this will be a beginning if what we have heard is true the enemy will not stop until all angos is beneath his boot we cannot surrender and leave the road open for him no we must fight we must bloody this foe and teach him to fear the swords of men
4131861 it is puzzling to men who use the light of day to press home their assaults but these are creatures of the night i think and i doubt they will assault us while it is still bright
4131862 the sun threatens to weaken us as much as the enemy
4131863 while the enemy may prefer to attack at night if he sees the walls deserted i am sure he will overcome his qualms and come at us with his full force perhaps that is his plan if so he is cunning indeed
4131864 that is not the end of his tricks i think
4131865 he has not even sent skirmishers westwards around the city he has left that entire side unwatched and undefended
4131866 he hopes that some of the men will notice that and if their hearts are weak flee in that direction he knows that even a cat if cornered fights with fury and thus he leaves us a path of escape but i doubt not that if we did so he would cut us apart on the flat
4131867 he has strength enough to invest us and still send enough northwards to assault linion even now his captains might be discussing how many they can spare for each attack
4131868 i cannot see any livestock with the enemy perhaps they are hidden but he is not so far away as that and in this heat surely orcs and trolls must drink deep of water i think our enemy cannot stand a long siege any more than we can unless he has reserves we cannot descry indeed he might stand it even less given that we have deep wells and much stored provender
4131869 an army of a score thousands is not easy to keep fed and watered
4131870 which makes this pause all the more puzzling were i their commander i would not wait long to attack
4131871 and head north towards linion where the land is more fertile and there are many more rivers and streams
4131872 but we have no wizards or witches amongst us we must trust to our experience and instincts
4131873 he has no weakness in battle that we can see but surely he is far from his farmlands and he has crossed dry lands to come to mezhan and he does not know these parts if we wait until night then send out our cavalry we may be able to surprise him we have a hundred riders and that should be enough we look for water food oil timber in such a strike torches are better than spears we wreak havoc in his camp then leave before he has stumbled from bed it is the last thing he will expect it will shock him surprise him throw him into confusion it may buy us days weeks even months if enough damage is done
4131874 if it fails we lose what strength of cavalry we have and even if it succeeds it may goad him into a swift attack rather than delay him as you said perhaps we can endure a siege better than him is it to our advantage to prick him into assault
4131875 but you yourself said we had a greater goal the defence of linion destroying his supplies will aid linion and perhaps we might even destroy enough of his supplies to force him to retreat to his stockpiles
4131876 it is a risky gambit but you are right what choice do we have you have more experience in such things my friend lead this raid but strike swiftly and do not linger our foe is very mighty and once awoken i doubt you could endure him
4131877 watch for the fires they will be the pyres of the enemy
4131878 remember that your life may depend on it if we meet strong resistance if the enemy discovers us too early we must retreat immediately do not hesitate our goal is the enemys supplies not his fighting men kill less but burn more
4131879 i tarried too long and now a hundred men lie dead on the field i have failed angos tulir i have failed my charges men seldom follow a captain who has led their comrades to the slaughter perhaps it would be better if you granted some other the leadership of my company and let me serve as merely a man at arms
4131880 yes you have failed but the answer to such is not to abandon your duty
4131881 how else can you make amends for your failings you are my wisest advisor friend you are my equal in all things the men will still follow you they know you and they know you did not willingly lead men to death you are not one such as they have heard of a general who throws away blood like water thinking only of his own glory
4131882 i am not sure of anything now yet what captaincy is truly needed here there is no room for strategy and tactics all we must do is wait and watch
4131883 do not fall into self pity food must be checked and water too the guards must be kept under watch for treachery and desertion is likely if our vigilance is let up come my friend strengthen yourself for the battle to come let go of the dead mezhan will need you the empire will need you will you answer its call
4131884 it is a shame we cannot send a messenger to linion
4131885 we might send a rider south into the storm hills to find a way past their vigilance and turn north but there would be little hope
4131886 linion knows it will be attacked if it is not ready now it will not be ready in time
4131887 the enemy will be in confusion for some time as they carry out this manoeuvre
4131888 and for that i am grateful but even if two thirds of the enemy left we should still face odds of five to our one
4131889 whereas bringing concealed weapons into the church sends a message that is at odds with what the church wants to communicate and violates the religious character of religious property and whereas the work of the church does not involve or require weapons now be it resolved that the delegates to the 2008 session of the north georgia annual conference oppose any attempts by the state legislature to allow anyone other than law enforcement officers to carry concealed weapons in houses of worship and be it further resolved that we invite members of other churches and faiths in georgia to join us in this effort

4131904 we were surprised how many times we found employers dress codes did not permit the wearing of comfortable footwear
4131905 heels may look glamorous on the catwalks and on hollywood stars but theyre not appropriate day today work wear these dress codes apart from being blatantly sexist can lead to health problems
4131906 feet bear the brunt of working life and instead of worrying about what staff look like employers should focus on the effect the wrong shoes and prolonged standing can have
4131907 all this rain is global warming do some research and you will find out and stop making glib comments
4131908 context a name i prefer to environment because it sound less like a separate thing from ourselves is the hardest thing to perceive because it includes us our ways of thinking the fish cant see the water it is the source of change of unexpectedness the real generator of newness design of evolution aims purposes requirements functions these are words for how we see what is needed but when we name them we tend to exclude the main part the least predictable ourselves our minds and how they change once we experience something it is ourselves not our words that are the real purpose of designing the biggest mistake is to take the product alone as the aim its always secondary always a means to process to what were doing now or will be doing later dont comprise the process get it right the best kinds of evolution we know natural linguistic hand crafted are planless but highly responsive to change of context with astonishingly coherent results the first step to attempting something similar in design in continuous designing is i think now to acknowledge publicly from the start that when we design our knowledge is of necessity incomplete and to design the design process to reflect that modesty that expectation of learning what the problem is as we try to solve it discarding first thoughts to make the meta process sensitive to what is learnt in the highly informative process of designing
4131909 the message is that russia has perhaps not accepted that it is time to move on from the cold war and it is time to move to a new era in which relations between states are on the basis of equality and sovereignty and economic integration
4131910 we will use u s aircraft as well as naval forces
4131911 rally the free world in the defense of a free georgia
4131912 the united states stands with the democratically elected government of georgia and insists that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia be respected
4131913 one can forget about any talk about georgias territorial integrity because i believe it is impossible to persuade south ossetia and abkhazia to agree with the logic that they can be forced back into the georgian state
4131914 i have to say that the reports are not encouraging about russias respect for this cease fire
4131915 this is not 1968 and the invasion of czechoslovakia where russia can threaten its neighbors occupy a capital overthrow a government and get away with it
4131916 the board wanted to do what we felt was fair and equitable

4131948 there are allegations that some influential people white collared poachers secretly supply guns and bullets to local people to poach elephants and other wild animals and it has been difficult to arrest them because of their influence and power can the us government help out in our conversation with government officials here at the provincial and national levels we shall stress how this is important for cameroon it is part of the larger effort we and other donor countries are trying to make in the fight against corruption which is really a disease eating up the spine of cameroon it has to stop the government has to have a way to identify why corruption and step up efforts to punish those found guilty of it i also realized that in the case of poaching we are in a race against the clock it may not be sufficient to say this is going to take a generation to improve because there might not be any elephants if something is not done

4131978 in any geographic area its a natural phenomenon for oil to peak at some point
4131979 the peak oil theory looks at the u s experience and believes the world will peak also
4131980 as demand increases prices increase and when prices increase companies develop and produce more oil which can slow the peak were getting better at finding oil and more efficient at drilling it
4131981 i dont believe in the cataclysm if you have a sharp drop in production and prices increase you will get major substitutions in the demand for oil
4131982 the problem with the transportation sector is that oil supplies 97 percent of its energy and theres no viable substitute unless the price of oil gets high enough its knocking at that door now and were starting to see tangible indicators of a switch
4131983 americans are competing with asia and the rest of the world not just for fuel but for materials and food as well thats the world were in

4131987 the large overall monthly gain was once again attributable to gasoline prices which jumped 4 1 per cent in the month

4132004 ninety percent of everything is crap science fiction author ted sturgeon once said thats certainly true of the crud passing for software in apples new app store
4132005 this makes me worry about software development in general mobile computing platforms are the future primary pcs for much of the world
4132006 the app store is beautiful comprehensive by fiat and well designed for the first time you can actually get an overview of all the applications available for a computing platform and easily acquire them its an idea that a lot of other people have had before but apple has done it with more polish and ease of use
4132007 but what do we get about 10 percent of the apps are great ninety percent smell like old sturgeon
4132008 uh they should have a name for these kinds of articles
4132009 of course its not as if apple encourages app developers to think outside the box

4132038 we believe that the main function of the tree is to facilitate the flow of water from the ground and into the atmosphere
4132039 to achieve that function the tree is ideally designed to not only maximize the flow of water but in order to be successful in the real world it must also be able to withstand the stresses of the wind it is exquisitely designed to do just that
4132040 the tree is a physical flow architecture that has evolved to meet two main objectives maximum mechanical strength against wind and maximum access for water coming from the ground through the tree and into the atmosphere
4132041 in the larger sense the forest itself is a flow system with the same mechanical properties and functions as the individual tree facilitating the flow of water across the globe
4132042 winds come in many speeds but their ultimate effect is cutting off trunks branches and leaves so whatever is too long or sticks out too much is shaved off
4132043 so the pattern of the tree is the result of the never ending assault by the wind

4132057 we took a look at a number of crm platforms
4132058 we are an sap company anyway so it was fairly natural when we were last looking at platforms that we looked at sap crm what really sold us was the user interface and the fact that sap had finally gotten to the point where their product was maturing it was among the best of breed and fit with our back end sap erp system
4132059 the layout and back end management is all facilitated through the new web interface and we realized right off the bat that our csrs and our salespeople would be much more likely to adopt the process and the applications if we could make that an easy transition we were thinking adoption all along in that regard
4132060 when we decided to implement the software we knew we would have to have a telephony solution
4132061 we werent aware until the time we committed to interaction center that sap had purchased wicom almost simultaneously we were implementing new pcs for all of our people we switched to hp laptops and desktops with vista so we were right on the cutting edge

4132070 youll miss those eyes in the back of your head
4132071 foul man your mission is failed your time in this realm is ended i am handril the guardian of the last flame i will be your doom you shall find non existence in this room and bring no tidings back to your dark master
4132072 not back to your realm nor back to your master but to emptiness i cast you from this plane and all planes
4132073 and then you will at least die honourably renouncing your treason
4132074 speak man who is this ruler what do you know of him what is his intent
4132075 oh you will find out soon enough duke unfortunately that will give you little joy for you will die then
4132076 talk and you will save your other knee when will he come here how many spears can he muster
4132077 you have no idea of the power you face duke none it was not treason to ally with him it was wisdom i will not betray him now for even death is no escape from his cruelties were i to prove unfaithful you will gain no knowledge from me
4132078 my opponent is not still the effort to defeat him was more than i had thought they are stronger already
4132079 never have i felt such fear as when it stood in my room i believe i am beginning to understand your plots wizard
4132080 such as that pursued me from the fortress in the east it is a creature of shadows a soul of evil and malice a dark walker it is immune to earthly blades had i not come duke you would now be dead and the lake district would be as good as lost my gamble has paid but it came to the very last throw of the dice
4132081 i have ensured the safety of this city in the days to come when i escaped from the east arderth i knew the power had agents in linion i could not have let them remain undiscovered waiting for the assault when they might have opened the posterns or done some other treachery i needed to discover them to force them from their hiding places that i have done within these walls at least we are safe we are still surrounded by many perils but treachery is no longer one of them
4132082 some of them such as eredon were so touched by evil as to be clear in my vision but others were merely lesser servants i could not detect them so easily eredon was the greatest of them so i left him for last figuring i could find him no matter whence he went that almost proved a great mistake
4132083 i showed myself to be a threat to their schemes they sought me out after that to kill me to ensure than nobody would believe my stories there were perhaps half a dozen of them afterwards i hastened here as fast as i could figuring he might confront you i did not think that one of the evil ones would accompany him indeed it is to my shame that i was not even aware of its presence until i came close to your chambers they have some new art some mist of shadows that conceals them from easy detection i saw your guards dead outside your door they did not even have time to draw their swords i knew that knocking on the door would just not do after all they had warded it and it would not have opened any other way
4132084 why could you not talk openly of this war why needed i to pretend that all was well
4132085 had you spoken openly of war and sent orders to prepare for battle they would have figured it best to lie hidden
4132086 i knew they would come for me and i expected they would also try and tempt you with wealth and power always they seek the easiest route yet perhaps evil will has hindered evil deeds for they have hindered themselves most of all had they ignored me caring not whether i convinced you they might have stayed unknown until the vital moment but they did not wish to risk that their wisdom was less than mine
4132087 but are you sure you have destroyed the entire nest of vipers
4132088 i can sense no hint of darkness within the walls of linion not even a hint but i have been wrong before still we cannot do anything but act openly and swiftly now we must do what we can save what might be saved and act without hesitation
4132089 total war without restraint without quarter we must call upon our last reserves of strength send out outriders to all the corners of the duchy send word to the eastern border for the scouts to withdraw if they stay upon the marches they will be destroyed assemble your troops in your strongest fortresses and await battle
4132090 but messengers have already been sent thence what is needed now is the power to defy this enemy and only i have that i deem i will not yield this duchy unfought
4132091 in a week a blow will fall upon this land
4132092 it will be heavier than any you or any man alive has witnessed it will be an assault of countless numbers driven forward by madness
4132093 it may come down to a test of my powers
4132094 but the empire is not one district nor one city it is a mighty realm each day we hold the enemy here is another day for dolgrath to prepare
4132095 i have served under many captains and few have ever sent men to battle with such dour words
4132096 i merely say what i see perhaps we will all die perhaps not it is beyond the ken of men or wizards to determine the manner and timing of their passing yet one thing is certain we shall ride to battle and the fates will determine our end do not lose hope arderth for that is the strength of the enemy he has many soldiers but the chief of his captains are fear and despair and that is why i must remain
4132097 i will not bandy words this day war is upon us the lake districts may fall within a few short weeks
4132098 are you soldiers or squabbling children we need wisdom not shouting
4132099 some of you may remember the debate at the feast
4132100 i can tell you that those words of omen have been proven true there is a new power in the east which will soon launch an attack on our borders i do not know all but i do know that it is no power of man no bandit king or chieftain of swarthy barbarians it is some evil spirit that seeks to consume us
4132101 we must fight of course but such knowledge is a scanty larder from which to build a meal what forces will we confront
4132102 if the wizard were here he could tell you in greater detail but i will do what i can
4132103 the greater part of the force will be composed of orcs but there may be other creatures strange creatures trolls from the northern wastes dark walkers without earthly flesh even have i heard rumour of a dragon in alliance with this enemy
4132104 long has it been since any man set his blade in such foes
4132105 i have caught glimpses of orcs in the mountains but never more than that
4132106 thus i see there are two tasks first we must find out the strength of this enemy and his strategy second we must devise a plan to destroy him
4132107 the scouts on the eastern marches have standing orders to report any movement if the enemy has advanced already then the scouts will be upon the road
4132108 orders were given last night for the withdrawal of those scouts
4132109 because handril fears those outposts are already known to our enemy and will be smothered in the first assault if the enemy has not already infiltrated some forces past them he felt they would be a vain sacrifice when their numbers would be of better account here
4132110 that order might be countermanded if need be but i would rather not defy the wizard when he is not present
4132111 if the wizard is right then the enemy knows our fixed positions but if we send a small company of scouts picked men on swift horses from linion they might approach the gap on unknown paths they must be well trained men who can make quick survey of the enemys numbers and disposition and return swiftly
4132112 and they will have some idea of the import of their mission the eastmarch scouts will have little
4132113 you know every road and byroad and what route would be best
4132114 if the enemy is as skilled as you say if he has knowledge of our forces and if he is vigiliant then i would go from linion to barak and then south along the edge of the spear mountains that is a path not easily surveilled
4132115 it would take perhaps five days to reach the gap by that route if the riders rested little and their horses were strong and there was fodder and water enough
4132116 we can countermand the orders given the scouts and bid them remain but send back any news or we can send our a force from the men of linion who will be hidden it will likely take as much time to send out new orders as it will for any scouts we send to reach the gap
4132117 it seems to me all depends upon the timing of the assault
4132118 if this enemy is already moving across the red wastes then by the time any scouts from linion reached the gap he would likely be through and the scouts would see little but his baggage train
4132119 but he told me a little of what he knows i doubt the enemy will attack so swiftly we are not so rushed that we cannot spend five days i think there is time enough for either course it all comes down to this do we believe the wizard when he says the outposts are but death traps the enemy may well have sent outriders forward and if that is the truth then no news will come from those men but we still need information
4132120 it seems to me that his words have been wise even when we have not understood their purpose
4132121 i will ride to the east and bring word of this force
4132122 what right have you to choose your duty i am your duke
4132123 he touched me i have seen the enemy it was but a moment but now it is with me each minute of the day i can feel it within my very bones an icy chill it is death it is dying it is evil it is pain it is suffering it is all that is wrong in this world i am driven lord i cannot rest and wait i must do something to defy it
4132124 lord i swore an oath on this sword to protect the empire at the cost of my life let me do my duty
4132125 withrin assemble your best men for this journey how many i leave to your wisdom but not too many i would not make it too great a target take whatever horses you wish from the royal stables even if it be my own
4132126 take care of the boy there is something wild in his spirit i fear he will do something foolish if you do not keep an eye on him
4132127 how will we fight we must still make some plans now before the scouts return any plan is better than none and if we get better information we can always change those plans
4132128 we must protect linion but we cannot abandon every village to the enemy
4132129 you say the enemy will come across from the red wastes that means he will advance near voslas and if he takes the direct route cross the beshleb towards mezhan there he might strike north to linion or go west along the royal road
4132130 we do not know his numbers we know ours right now we should struggle to put two thousand men into the field within a week if the muster goes well we shall have four thousand there are another hundred scouts on the eastmarch three hundred horse we have store enough in our armouries to equip some of the citizenry if need be
4132131 few enough if he comes in any strength or if he strikes in several directions
4132132 and even if we held there he could come around its northern edge where it peters out into marshes and perhaps he will not even come that way but rather turn north and come over the izmedero
4132133 well then it seems there is only one real choice linion and mezhan are the two most important points of the duchy with mezhan held he will not be able to push on westwards if he ignores mezhan and strikes northwards then we can attack his supply lines even orcs must eat the enemy will be faced with a problem that is not easily solved unless they are so strong they can advance on two fronts at once
4132134 and for that knowledge we must wait for the scouts to return
4132135 the wizard has told me enough to know we cannot march out to meet this enemy risking all on a single blow we must slow him force him to spread out and grind him down
4132136 the walls of mezhan are low and there are a few small forts in the storm hills themselves
4132137 i doubt they could withstand a determined assault were it pressed with any skill
4132138 we should use it as a second muster send messengers out that any levies passing through it should wait there
4132139 now the question must be where to place the horse i am inclined to concentrate them at mezhan where they could harry any raid down the royal road or any move northwards against linion
4132140 the land around mezhan is suited to horse in three directions indeed
4132141 yet i do not know whether we should gamble them on what is likely to be the lesser battlefield many a time a charge of heavy horse has decided the day and i would have them here duke alongside you
4132142 a compromise then a hundred horse at mezhan and the remainder here that should be enough for them to at least keep an eye on the highway
4132143 a simple plan we shall fight on two fronts half here half at mezhan we shall fight from behind strong walls we shall hold them and we shall win now it is time for you to see to your duties go and get your men ready
4132144 when we were in limbo right before former superintendent dr tim ricker was leaving and right before former interim superintendent dr jerry chambers was going to take over there was a motion on the table for this to take place to have the cfo report directly to the board as an extra level of financial accountability
4132145 in ohio i believe the whole state is required to have the cfo report to the board illinois does it too
4132146 i think its something that future boards should definitely consider superintendent terry noble has already taken responsibility for any numbers that have been presented to us anyway so i think it would be something we should do obviously the board can do whatever they want i would prefer that if we were going to implement these recommendations that the next time were in a transition period with the cfo thats something that a future board do
4132147 and quite frankly i think we do have that relationship now because im not op posed at all to our cfo reporting regularly to you and fielding questions from you
4132148 we do that now so in a sense were doing that i think what karl is referring to is an actual job description that says that i dont supervise the cfo and the board does
4132149 in april 2006 castillo received army documentation of his service which referred to the second alien number similar to a social security number for immigrants

4132155 when chris approached us with his affinity for our product and the idea of creating his own line of caps we saw this as an opportunity to work hand in hand with one of the most renowned entertainers in the business
4132156 everyone knows me as a singer dancer actor this gives me a chance to showcase my creative fashion sense as well i look forward to building a long term relationship with new era

4132159 they expressly authorize the fbi to engage in intelligence collection inside the united states
4132160 ive gotten a lot of questions the last few weeks asking if obama is the antichrist
4132161 i tell everyone that i dont think the antichrist will come out of politics especially american politics
4132162 i can see by the language he uses why people think he could be the antichrist
4132163 but from my reading of scripture he doesnt meet the criteria there is no indication in the bible that the antichrist will be an american
4132164 if even the people who created the character nicolae carpathia dont see the comparisons as warranted then perhaps this is overblown
4132165 prohibition from child care services of persons convicted of certain offenses
4132166 next week the apa may adopt a new report on the link between abortion and health problems such as depression
4132167 new research from norway reconfirms what women across america already know all too well abortion doesnt end your problems it creates new ones the apa needs to ignore political pressure and report the truth about abortions painful aftermath
4132168 abortion is not just a life terminating experience for the baby its a life altering one for the mother
4132169 the apa cannot continue to ignore study after study and pretend that eliminating a child from your life is consequence free it will be interesting to see if a pro abortion bias will continue to trump science and womens realities when the psychologists meet next week
4132170 if signed into law ab 2567 will mean an official day commemorating homosexuality bisexuality and transsexuality in california government schools
4132171 this will harm children as young kindergarten every may 22 ab 2567 will positively portray to children homosexual experimentation homosexual marriages sex change operations and anything else thats in the closet governor schwarzenegger should say no to this very inappropriate bill which has nothing to do with academic excellence
4132172 ab 2567 will further motivate parents to remove their children from the immoral public school system
4132173 were encouraging parents to visit rescueyourc hild org to learn how to save their children while they still can with public schools becoming sexual indoctrination centers homeschooling and church schools are no longer parental options theyre parental imperatives
4132174 is unquestionably the u s s most influential and highest profile churchman he is a natural leader a pathological schmoozer insatiably curious and often the smartest person in the room like graham he projects an authenticity that has helped him forge an exquisite set of political connections in the white house on both sides of the legislative aisle and abroad and he is both leading and riding the newest wave of change in the evangelical community an expansion beyond social conservatism to causes such as battling poverty opposing torture and combating global warming the movement has loosened the hold of religious right leaders on ordinary evangelicals and created an opportunity for warren who has lent his prominent voice to many of the new concerns
4132175 whats good for everybody not just whats good for me whos the best for the nation right now
4132176 i dont believe we should ignore the debate over traditional
4132177 a living faith calls us as well to care for the most vulnerable members of society the poor the hungry the stranger seeking shelter and the child waiting to be born all are in need of our compassion and protection faith shows us that the weak and defenseless are not a problem but rather a priority and a chance for us to live out the message of the gospels that message can reach into any place however dark even in solitary confinement when everything else has been taken away nothing can separate us from the love of our creator
4132178 a new time poll of white evangelical voters finds that 70 support john mccain
4132179 27 of his evangelical backers say they are not enthusiastic about him nearly two thirds of them also say they could vote for a candidate whose position on abortion differed from theirs 72 would vote for a candidate who disagrees with them on iraq
4132180 in private conversations associates say clinton remains skeptical that obama can win in the fall thats a sentiment some other democrats believe is not just a prediction but a wish because it would prove her right about his weaknesses as a general election candidate and possibly pave the way for her to run again in 2012 clinton is also annoyed that obama has yet to deliver on his end of an informal bargain reached as part of their truce that each would raise 500 000 for the other
4132181 hillary has done her part in that regard obama has not
4132182 as the odds that she will be obamas running mate have faded there are signs that clintons backers could demand one last show of respect before obama claims the nomination in denver clinton has been giving tacit encouragement to suggestions that her name be placed in nomination at the convention
4132183 obama would be wise to challenge mccain to town hall debates
4132184 barack obama needs to move the conversation toward the substantive differences he has with mccain and the differences mccain doesnt have with president bush the best way to do that is through a major narrative changing event obama would be wise to change course now challenge mccain to town hall debates on the sunday nights after each convention one before a military audience another with hard pressed rust belt workers hed be wise to make this a campaign about issues instead of ads as soon as possible it is true that debates often turn on one liners and flubs but more often they turn on sustained vivid demonstrations of character
4132185 the new mccain will play rough if he thinks it will help him win
4132186 the new mccain is tight and focused the candidate who once invited all comers onto the back of his bus now hangs a curtain on his campaign plane to prevent reporters from even catching a glimpse instead of charm and candor he serves up fastballs instead of risk taking he seeks control its a whole new mccain despite his backslapping reputation mccain will play rough if he thinks it will help him win
4132187 we were letting the press get in our heads now were going to say what the message is
4132188 in which players try to toss ping pong balls across a table into cups of beer and drink if theirs are hit is becoming so popular that it is now in the midst of a backlash for many parents and college officials beer pong has become synonymous with binge drinking despite current efforts to get the game taken seriously as a sport the point of most beer pong games remains to intoxicate your opponent
4132189 yeah i smoke pot not to the extent that my characters do
4132190 yeah i smoke pot not to the extent that my characters often do just because i have jobs and my characters dont
4132191 ive noticed a lot more guys who kind of look like me out in the world like theres more slightly heavyset jewish guys who have dark glasses and let their hair grow out a little bit me and jonah hill have started that trend
4132192 since their 11 am beijing time arrests on august 7 we have been unable to contact any of the group including my husband or support persons for over 14 hours now this is a bit disconcerting that no one can reach them
4132193 from blue ridge to atlanta from macon to valdosta thousands of unemployed georgians are pouring into our career centers the georgia department of labor is committed to doing everything possible to assist them during these difficult economic times we ask for their patience and cooperation as we work together to overcome these unprecedented challenges
4132194 a founding principle of focus on the family and a driving belief of dr dobsons is that all human life is sacred and that life begins at the single cell stage of human development
4132195 amendment 48 articulates this belief and challenges us to declare the inestimable worth of all members of the human family the foundational message of amendment 48 is clear all human life has value colorado voters should support amendment 48 and vote for it in november
4132196 we are incredibly thankful for the support of focus on the family which has been a leading voice for human life issues for many years
4132197 as we look forward to novembers vote we know that support such as theirs is vital we appreciate and need the continued help of every focus on the family supporter across the u s to advance our foundational message and promote the value of each human life

4132213 its not age per se that when you get to 80 its all over with
4132214 its driven by more proximate factors such as if you become obese or youre smoking too much or you contract diabetes medications can depress sexual interest the aging process itself is not a major factor driving these results
4132215 if sexual health goes to hell it may be a canary in the mine shaft it may be a sign of health problems
4132216 anxiety is very clearly a big factor in sexual dysfunction for women and depression in men
4132217 and men can become very depressed because of sexual dysfunction
4132218 a warning was sent to our colleague amparo medina a shoebox containing a dead rat and the message death to pro lifers with a longer letter placed at her door threatening to kill her
4132219 remember that accidents exist remember that accidental deaths happen daily in our country do not continue your anti woman and homophobic campaign death to traitors death to those who oppose the nation death or revolution
4132220 these attempts at intimidation go beyond death threats to cruelty and blasphemy anyone who doubts the criminal diabolical nature of the international abortion lobby needs look no further
4132221 these threats just confirm what we have always known about the promoters of abortion they are violent and deadly
4132222 we categorically condemn any threats of violence against our affiliate and we stand with the valiant priests and bishops in ecuador who are bravely defending the right to life against systematic campaigns and intrusion from foreign influences trying to impose western pro abortion values on latin america
4132223 all drugs should be legalised in my opinion drug use should be treated in the same way as alcohol and nicoteine which are both deadly drugs sold on shopping shelves and taxed to the hilt by every government
4132224 they even killed female goats because their private parts were not covered and their tails were pointed upward which they said was haram
4132225 they regarded the cucumber as male and tomato as female women were not allowed to buy cucumbers only men
4132226 i saw them slaughter a nine year old boy like a sheep because his family didnt pledge allegiance to them

4132230 the u s is still very important but as far as commodity demand is concerned the u s isnt the main game in town china is the biggest consumer and increasingly india
4132231 according to our calculations the exchange rate development has contributed 12 30 per barrel to the decline in oil prices since mid july when the us dollar hit a low of 1 6 against the euro

4132238 for deeds must still be done upon the stair if evil is to be stopped
4132239 but you might still aid me arderth wait behind the door with a force of strong men well armed for when i come within the citadel i shall be in need of aid and a swift closing of the door when the time comes tarry not
4132240 foul creatures of darkness be gone for i am handril wizard guardian of the hidden light mighty am i but merciful also i give you quarter begone from this city and do not return go to your master and tell him you met handril and knew terror he will show you more forgiveness than i i am the last keeper of the fire it shall not go out ever
4132241 and we do not fear you old you are and withered as is the way of men no matter how mighty but you are young to us who see time in centuries your brief life is over the light has already gone out soon all shall be dark night is falling fool
4132242 but know this wraith you shall not pass this threshold twice here we will make our stand and against this strong place shall you shatter like waves on rocks
4132243 yet after centuries it is the water that is victorious not the rock nothing is so mighty that it cannot be worn away over time
4132244 then i hope we have provender enough to last the years
4132245 do not test my humour this army i lead dwarfs your force yet it is but a finger of the hand that will smite you perhaps you might stay in your hole a while like rats but it will fall sooner rather than later and with it will die the hopes of man
4132246 the hopes of man are not contained in a fortress of stone
4132247 but i hear your words let us fight now then rather than wait for death our position is desperate i will not linger
4132248 i am not so old and withered as you think i might prove a test even for you
4132249 you think yourself aged and wise you are not i have existed for millenia of your time and i have not withered with the passing of years countless are the enemies i have destroyed men orcs trolls beasts and demons of shape and power beyond your ken i have slain cities wizard i have turned seas red with blood i have endured agonies for years that would kill you in moments weapons have i wielded that would possess you were you merely to touch them i will squash you like a fly and with no more thought
4132250 no time for rest now but he was stronger than i thought i was tested beyond even what i thought my limits were perhaps i should have just killed him ahh
4132251 his mind was black darker and more evil than you could know it was the greatest part of the struggle to stop it spilling out into the room you would all have been driven mad with fear
4132252 still i saw much of what i wished to know this one was high in the favour of our enemy and knew much of the designs of his master
4132253 water or beer would be better and food also i need sustenance my body is like a fire that has burned too low it needs new wood
4132254 of like kind to but far more powerful than that which confronted you in your chambers had our enemy hierarchy and tables of orders he might be your equal arderth a duke amongst demons be flattered at that for he was sent here specifically to destroy me if what i took from his mind is the truth he was the reason for their delay he has been but newly summoned to this realm his master wished to bring great strength against this upstart wizard and i suspect the effort to bring him here has cost his master much for little reward
4132255 his kind cannot he has fallen from existence it is a more complete process he has not returned to his realm as i thought might happen he is gone yet what you say is true in a way your blade was proof against him but i knew that already or i would never have risked this gambit
4132256 this sword is beyond my ken duke i know of no earthly weapons that can stand against such things even the least of his companions is proof against steel for me to wield my blade against such foes i must expend much of my own power wreathing it with magical fire and potency if you were to wield the exact same sword against them it would merely shatter as did laridils this puzzle must be solved the blade must be studied whatever secret it holds may be valuable
4132257 we should need to be swift students indeed we are trapped within this citadel with fifteen thousand foes beyond the walls and here we wait three hundreds of men at the most and even were we to defeat the dark walker that remains how would we slay his servants anghul has shown no virtue against lesser flesh
4132258 in dolgrath there are still men of wisdom and smiths of great skill
4132259 the blade must be taken there and studied it has some virtue some craft in the forging perhaps that is proof against demons and we need a weapon against the dark
4132260 i cannot defeat all the dark ones minions two have proven enough there are no other wizards left there is no other hope if we do nothing the world of men dies here in this citadel
4132261 it is his sword he must take it to dolgrath
4132262 we have already spoken of this before i knew of the sword now it has taken on greater urgency
4132263 before when we spoke i saw the wisdom of the choice but my heart speaks differently now when all about is fallen i will not abandon my people i will fight and die that seems to me the only fit way for my passing someone else must take the sword
4132264 you are a fool and no wise ruler of men
4132265 oft have i counselled you to forget these fine words of honour for here is the hope of men and you would throw it away
4132266 what use is there to hold the world of men if all that is good about it nobility bravery loyalty and honour is thrown away i cannot abandon my duty
4132267 you have worn it long your knowledge may be needed and authority has not been granted you to determine the fate of the empire sacrifices must be made for the greater good your loyalty is to the emperor not the lake district i command you arderth to go to dolgrath an office of nobility i have higher than yours though loath am i to use such authority
4132268 but not willingly and i will take you with me wizard you are the wisest of men if the blade contains some secret then you will discover it before others
4132269 for a moment i hoped my labours were finished and i might die here at rest but now i see they have not i must somehow find the strength for that journey
4132270 you will need time to make good your escape my lord
4132271 i shall lead the last stand if it meets your will i know of gundolfins stratagem we must hope that he had time to release the horsemen before the enemy gained the city surely you can break free in these last hours of night the orcs think only of pillage and trolls cannot ride
4132272 they wait near the mound of shadows i bid them ride out earlier
4132273 it seems ill to me that a young man should die so an old one might escape
4132274 laridil must ride with us i have foreseen his tale does not end here trapped beneath stone he is a man of the wide plains that is where his fate lies and where he must go
4132275 six only shall go and three are chosen the others must be hardy riders skilled and night eyed and enduring
4132276 but there are already riders out there who could escort you
4132277 you have heard what we must do good soldiers of linion we must flee it is a great pain to me to abandon you for that is what it is i will not soften my words nor lie to coat my sin with sweet rhetoric i have failed you as your protector now i must ask you to die for me i ask you to forgive me and understand this quest the sword i wield can destroy these creatures but we know not why it must be studied so that we can understand its powers and perhaps craft other weapons effective against this evil we must go to dolgrath and that is a long and trying journey pursuit will follow us every mile the few hours you buy here might prove the difference between success and failure
4132278 we have served you for a long time we love you and that love will never die for you have given us a great gift with this duty you have granted us the chance to do such deeds of valour as to be sung for centuries to come we three hundreds shall fight like three thousands and sell every inch of ground dearly fly now beloved duke and bring forth hope for the future we shall remember you to the end and do not forget us and our sacrifice let our names touch your lips at night and thus we shall never truly die eternal life will be ours even when our bodies have long turned to dust now do not tarry take the tunnel and do not fear the enemy they shall not follow too closely
4132279 soon we shall have no shelter we shall be upon the plain and any eye that looks will mark us we must find the horses quickly they will be nearby haste is our friend we must be away before the orcs know we have left
4132280 listen to the words of your duke the eyes of our enemy look within the walls of the city not upon the empty plain hope still lives but be wary the greatest of our enemys weapons is fear and here on the open plain under the dark sky of night it will be very potent do not let it rule your thoughts and turn you to madness or cowardice
4132281 my destiny is not to die pursued by orcs in the hours before dawn even as they rape the city of my youth
4132282 three hundreds of cavalry should be here and scarce one in thirty remains what has happened here
4132283 we are but fifteen my lord the last of the cavalry of linion we live only as tribute to our cowardice and for that we are ashamed early in the battle indeed before the gates were shattered we issued forth from the westgate under cover some a hundred perhaps were mustered at the gate itself but the rest of us rode further out to this place near the mound of shadows we wondered why but gundolfin would tell us no more
4132284 we were told merely to wait until the time came many amongst us counselled that we pause not but ride against the enemy and win the day and we could not fathom why we were in such a place still we fifteen knew our duty and we called such advice foolhardy for surely some task had been set aside for us but the others said we had been forgotten they called us cowards and told us to wait here for their victory if we would and then they rode to the south with intent to fall upon the flank of the enemy even as he entered the city
4132285 yet you who hold yourselves cowards might do some good how many horses have you do you have spares
4132286 we have no spares perhaps some are riderless near the southgate but who would be so foolhardy as to seek there
4132287 six of you have the chance to redeem yourselves from any accusations of cowardice we need your horses we have a great need of haste and were we to double up we could not make enough speed our escape must suceed or hope fails but the six who are chosen might do a great deed march to that hillock yonder and look within there a chamber lies enter the tunnel and go back to linion there amidst the ruins of your city you might find glory enough and a fitting end
4132288 ride swift as you can past the camp of the enemy then turn three east three north and three south lead them away for a day or two then look for shelter mezhan may still stand if it does not then perhaps you might go to wydriff do not come west do not lead them on our trail now be gone

4132309 you see him being intensely self critical king really and truly believed that he was there to be of service to others this was not a man with any egomaniacal joy of being a famous person or being a leader
4132310 explore how best to carry on our investigation of king to produce the desired results without embarrassment to the bureau
4132311 a complete analysis of the avenues of approach aimed at neutralizing king as an effective negro leader
4132312 i am amazed that the pope gave an audience to such a degenerate
4132313 king could well qualify for the top alley cat prize
4132314 you are a colossal fraud and an evil vicious one at that
4132315 the american public will know you for what you are an evil abnormal beast
4132316 king there is only one thing left for you to do
4132317 you know what it is you better take it before your filthy abnormal fraudulent self is bared to the nation
4132318 when you have a wiretap on someone you pick up all sorts of dreck but in terms of the political history that ironically the fbi has created for us its a wonderful resource
4132319 i fear that your order to the scouts to pull back was sent too late friends of mine tell me that a horde of black has already swept out of the storm hills coming behind the outpost line from the south cutting off most hope of escape there was no warning at all
4132320 this is merely a probe a first gesture a large force could not have been supported in the storm hills they are rough and pathless
4132321 to those who brought me this information numbers are quite meaningless indeed it is sheer luck that we even have this warning
4132322 i merely bid them watch for certain signs and inform me when they came their duty is done
4132323 but i would not be blind and deaf going into war i figured that a small company skilled and careful approaching by unknown routes might do well
4132324 withrin captain of scouts leads them and with him rides laridil of the guard i deemed such a suitable number small enough to lie hidden yet large enough to fight if need be
4132325 the enemy will have to be crafty indeed to catch such men
4132326 we missed your presence at the council of war handril
4132327 we shall divide our forces in two and hold at mezhan and linion
4132328 if you fight two battles you may lose both of them
4132329 but we have a great land and few enough men to defend it what would you have me do wizard hold all our forces at linion and then watch as the enemy plundered the district and advanced west along the royal road you said we needed to delay him to buy time for dolgrath that i will do or should we ride forth and risk all in one battle
4132330 i would have you choose a place and hold there with all your strength
4132331 still it is too late now i was not at your council my advice is unnecessary
4132332 indeed tell him of all the defences of the district he knows little enough
4132333 the lake district has no full legion of the imperial army
4132334 dolgrath deems such unnecessary they keep their troops in kherokir and on the border with the wild men in linion is a permanent palace guard one hundred foot and fifteen cavalry there are two hundred scouts also permanent recruited from the herdsmen and other country dwellers half are kept in the field the other half at their homes we have four companies of foot and one of cavalry but they are not kept fully manned for reasons of economy
4132335 the footmen yes but the cavalry numbers but three hundred
4132336 it will take at least four days to fill them to full strength and then we shall have forty one hundreds of footmen and five hundreds of horse but of the latter only three hundreds will be field cavalry
4132337 the third company of foot is stationed in mezhan but the others are stationed in linion the second company will march south from linion immediately the others will stay here
4132338 hithrum is the captain of the first company laridil is the captain of the fourth tulir commands the second and dongalin the third
4132339 hithrum is seeing to the defences of the gate laridil has departed to the east
4132340 now in what manner will you fight it has been long since i saw imperials in battle indeed it has been long since i saw war
4132341 the light infantry bear two dalbods javelins and a longer sword
4132342 it is not many we are not used to fighting from city walls
4132343 i have often thought of fitting my men with more bows for the borders but there are no suitable trees in this district
4132344 show me to your armouries and i will see what i can do
4132345 i know it is far from pleasant but we have our duty
4132346 let us redouble our efforts and reach it by nightfall
4132347 then again it is night and we are close to the dangers of the mountains when you live in the shadow of a menace you do not easily forget it
4132348 we are here on the dukes bidding let us pass
4132349 i was woken myself and sent to fetch you to his chambers
4132350 i have no wish for pointless talk when i might be sleeping
4132351 tell the lord mayor that we cannot come and we shall leave early on the morrow we have a great need for urgency and cannot tarry for pleasantries
4132352 that in stories of lore and in the hearts of many people the rising sun is a sign of hope yet it comes from the east as does our enemy
4132353 the road is thirty miles south of here if my reckoning is right there the enemy probably lies and if not yet then soon we must be quiet and we must be stealthy arderth needs word of the enemy not dead heroes on the steppes be careful do not draw attention to yourself from now on we ride in the hills and keep a constant watch let vigilance be our cry
4132354 when i heard about systems that offered intelligent bandwidth management resulting in superior application performance and an extraordinarily high return on investment i was more than a little skeptical
4132355 the frame relay network served our needs quite well for quite a while
4132356 but as we grew and added a redundant data center the network became too complex and costly
4132357 were it left to me to decide whether we should have a government without newspapers or newspapers without a government i should not hesitate a moment to prefer the latter but i should mean that every man should receive those papers and be capable of reading them
4132358 grandpa built the business so weve always done it his way
4132359 that black goo in the vehicles had to go someplace

4132373 the enemy uses all his power to lead the christian and above all the minister to neglect prayer
4132374 i have three ideas and the first is to go on pilgrimage
4132375 if you do not control your tongue you will never be a pilgrim wherever you travel but control your tongue here and you will be a pilgrim without traveling
4132376 my second idea is to fast for two days at a time
4132377 even if you bend your neck to the ground your fast will not be accepted
4132378 unless you first deal with your sins by living among men you will not be able to deal with yourself when you live alone
4132379 they female gangs are hanging out in the streets attacking at random and are not being moved on
4132380 there is a pack mentality some of them attackers are as young as 12
4132381 their numbers are too overwhelming for police a lot of them are getting away with it they are often in mobs and hard to identify they rely on that anonymity to avoid being caught
4132382 the state government must do its bit to stamp the practice out
4132383 this should include an inquiry into bullying empowering teachers and principals to discipline students at least 700 more school counsellors and co ordination between schools and local police
4132384 in true costa style he got out of the vehicle after doing a lap to avoid us and tried to intimidate the firefighters
4132385 he was met with boos and much frank and open debate regarding the nsw wages policy and the threat to close fire stations and sack firefighters he was quite aggressive and the firefighters present were just as up front with him it was quite a spectacle
4132386 at one point he made a statement saying nsw firefighters are the best paid firefighters in the country
4132387 my 10 year old daughter then said for all to hear standing right next to him excuse me sir im only 10 years old and even i know that is a lie

4132435 firstly we are reporting better as to what is going on with people presenting
4132436 but alcohol products are more readily available and marketed to young people and three young people are risk takers they think they are invincible
4132437 the statistics have increased over the last decade in staggering proportions but i dont know there is anything we can say with certainty as to why
4132438 increased availability of alcohol is a major contributor but not the only contributor
4132439 as parents we have dropped the ball in this country our kids absorb our drinking habits this is where it is coming from it is our kids seeing the way we drink
4132440 its a different kind of student body than weve known during the 50s and 60s and 70s when a lot of our education policies were shaped

4132467 presi dalle occupazioni quotidiane rischiamo infatti di ritenere che sia qui in questo mondo nel quale siamo solo di passaggio lo scopo ultimo dellumana esistenza invece il paradiso la vera meta del nostro pellegrinaggio terreno quanto diverse sarebbero le nostre giornate se ad animarle fosse questa prospettiva cos stato per i santi le loro esistenze testimoniano che quando si vive con il cuore costantemente rivolto al cielo le realt terrene sono vissute nel loro giusto valore perch ad illuminarle la verit eterna dellamore divino

4132469 davanti a questo potere la fede la chiesa appariva come una donna inerme senza possibilit di sopravvivere tanto meno di vincere chi poteva opporsi a questo potere onnipresente che sembrava in grado di fare tutto e tuttavia sappiamo che alla fine ha vinto la donna inerme ha vinto non legoismo non lodio ha vinto lamore di dio e limpero romano si aperto alla fede cristiana

4132474 bank repossessions or reos continued to be the fastest growing segment of foreclosure activity in july posting a 184 percent year over year increase compared to a 53 percent year over year increase in default notices and an 11 percent year over year increase in auction notices
4132475 the sharp rise in reos combined with slow sales has resulted in a bloated inventory of bank owned properties for sale
4132476 this was a large scale operation that required a substantial amount of strategic and logistical planning
4132477 the fact that everything progressed so smoothly is testament to the high degree of planning and the professionalism of the staff involved
4132478 this move represents the final phase of one of the governments largest capital projects and the dawning of a new era in the provision of secure custody in the isle of man
4132479 transferring an entire prison population does not happen anywhere else so we had no established guidelines to work to
4132480 we had to put the planning in place ourselves and it has required a huge effort on behalf of the staff many of whom volunteered to come in on their day off to assist
4132481 it will take time to settle into a new environment but jurby prison is a facility the isle of man can be proud of
4132482 how can i call my two nephews over there right now ones a first lieutenant in the marine corps in anbar province another one in the persian gulf and tell them im running against a guy that will cut your throat that will cut the bottom out of your funding
4132483 what kind of person would use that kind of language about someone like harry teague tinsleys democratic opponent who has been well known and well respected in the district for decades
4132484 i dont know mr tinsley maybe the same way you can talk about how you can conjure up the image of your own kin getting their throats cut just to score points in a political campaign
4132485 to its credit the crowd booed so vigorously the rest of mr tinsleys exploitation of his nephews could not be heard
4132486 i will vote to de authorize funding for the war and implement a plan for immediate withdrawal
4132487 zoom from the little dfnm blog in out of the way new mexico to the nations tv screens in less than 24 hours there really is nowhere to hide in this election cycle
4132488 it extends for many many miles i could see nothing beneath it but it is close we must be even more careful now
4132489 but whether it is ten thousands or fifty thousands i cannot tell at this distance we need a more accurate count
4132490 i need a volunteer i do not need all of you to go on past this point that would make too large a target but i need another pair of eyes both to keep watch and to keep guard
4132491 and you are inexperienced i have been given the duty of keeping you safe
4132492 still your eyes are keen and your mind is quick
4132493 the others will remain here and rest until we return
4132494 if we are pursued split into two groups one will travel north to barak across the same paths we have taken the other will go west towards damril aiming for the northern shore there is little cover in that direction but you will make your best speed in such lands
4132495 we might have been killed thanks to your foolishness shouting when the enemy was so near
4132496 i did not have time to finish my count that means they have seven spears to our one let us hope that is their only host
4132497 he casts a great fear before him disabling his prey
4132498 a roof of brambles is one thing but rock is another
4132499 we do not know whence this path leads and if orcs find our trail and follow us within we might easily find ourselves trapped between them and a stony wall
4132500 we cannot fight this dragon if we stay outside we shall die sooner or later
4132501 i think the orcs were at least a half hours ride from us when they began their pursuit
4132502 there might be faster riders or other creatures with them
4132503 it would not be wise for us to be taken at unawares
4132504 we will wait a while here until dark at least and then look to make our way back to freedom much rests on our returning with this knowledge at night we stand a good chance the moon will be far from full tonight even if we are seen we shall be more surefooted for we know this land and they do not and do not forget begon that you are a veteran of angos you have faced foes before and defeated them keep your heart up
4132505 i doubt not that he is night eyed beyond the measure of any common beast still i doubt that he will stay here long a great army is on the march and he is the most fell of all their weapons likely or not there are greater demands on him than to pursue a handful of men into the mountains
4132506 but we cannot judge the actions of this enemy by what we know of the captains of men perhaps he has no greater task than the security of his armys flanks then he might not prove so swift to disengage from the hunt
4132507 and need not worry but i think we must merely wait out the dragon then as you say we can make our escape even if we meet them we might still make good by charging through them when they are disordered and unready once on the steppes if the dragon is gone there is nothing to fear i doubt not that these horses would run like the very steeds of the mighty ones to escape if we could reach a village or farm we might find replacements and ride without pause
4132508 but if the orcs comes upon us before night then what
4132509 and that is to meet them in battle ride up the gully at a gallop and look to break them with the first shock of our assault then we must find another place to hide
4132510 it would be hard to track anything in these hard lands but the orcs have skills different to those of men we must wait and see what fate tells
4132511 water ran down it once and this was the outflow it must have an opening at the other end
4132512 and if they keep going as they are they will find us within the hour
4132513 the sun will not set for at least three hours
4132514 it would mean leaving this place and crossing open ground
4132515 we came this way for ease of footing and it is likely that the orcs will too
4132516 and we did not move stealthily i doubt not that we left at least a few marks that a trained tracker might follow
4132517 then we must trust to the strength of our sword arms
4132518 i fancy we could put a few of them down swiftly enough a battle on the run strike but do not wait to see what the tale of your blow is we must keep moving no matter what
4132519 and then likely die anyway if the dragon is still around
4132520 no we must wait a little longer and hope that beast has other tasks
4132521 do not be despondent old man it will not come to battle i think all we must do is ensure that they do not come down the same path i have a plan
4132522 i think we are safe now let us wait for night
4132523 now then tell us what you saw and do not stint
4132524 marching west along the road one in ten a troll and the rest orcs there was a dragon with that force black and fierce it slew the others of our party
4132525 i felt not their touch nothing that does not live marched with that army they are free of that stain at least though they are still deeply evil
4132526 no army that great has been seen in medozem since before my birth
4132527 was this knowledge worth the lives of three men then
4132528 but what does it tell us that we did not already know
4132529 his numbers that is true and that he is heading westwards along the royal road but he could easily have turned north west from the place where we saw him and be aiming straight for linion rather than mezhan
4132530 his vanguard was well to the west of the gap of fire
4132531 and they showed no sign of leaving the royal road to steer northwards
4132532 would he have turned away as soon as he came through the gap if such were his intent
4132533 or would he turn at some later time can we trust this intelligence to mean that his goal is mezhan first
4132534 i am sure that if his intent were to assail linion first he would turn northwards as soon as he was past the gap of fire working his way along the spear mountains then turning west
4132535 orcs are a warrior race but an orc is no match for a man in battle old lore tells us how they perished in the thousands in the wars of ancient days trolls are a stiffer opponent but we are the imperial army we do not give way to any no matter how mighty they may be
4132536 he is still flesh and blood and his skin while tough as armour can be pierced by our weapons
4132537 my heart is lightened by the thought that no dark walkers march with this horde it is them i feared most in battle
4132538 i cannot be sure there were no dark walkers they may lay hidden and come forth only at night
4132539 dark walkers might ride with the host under canvas and on wains the fact you did not sense them at all suggests to me that there are none with the army that of course does not mean the enemy does not count them amongst his soldiery only that he wishes not to deploy them with his main force yet
4132540 when word of his numbers is known despair will follow and in a long siege who knows what might happen treason or treachery or base cowardice it seems to me now that perhaps we should march out and give battle under a bright sun on the open field
4132541 does the rock rush to sea to challenge the waves in their very stronghold does the tree challenge the wind and cast its branches against the gale we shall not cast away our strength fighting a battle we cannot win my duke you do not understand this war this is not about glory nor honour but survival we must bunker down behind walls of stone and iron and let our enemy waste his strength upon them only then can we hope for victory or perhaps only brief relief
4132542 and though i be no coward i should be loath to lead a force against it on the field it is too great i have one question will dolgrath send aid
4132543 messengers have been sent but any help would take months to arrive even if the emperor decided immediately
4132544 and even then it might not be enough all the legions of angos would need to be assembled together to drive this force back
4132545 take these three to comfortable beds and ensure they have rest wake them for nothing short of an open attack on this city
4132546 some magic mortar perhaps that sprinkled on the enemy turns them to stone still this is an ill jest thirty thousands and here we sit like rats in a hole with our pitiful four thousands trusting to walls and dikes
4132547 but it seems to me better to live no matter how than to march forth and die a glorious death and leave twenty thousand orcs to march down the royal road upon an unwary angos we cannot think merely of ourselves arderth and though you may tire of life i certainly do not
4132548 so you think we should slaughter ten thousand of them then
4132549 that would be no ill tale but remember wizard that angos is not unwary messengers have been sent even if we fall angos will come
4132550 i have had ill news this past night it seems that no dark walkers march with the host of the enemy but that does not mean we need not fear them word has reached me of cloaked riders travelling to the west in small groups they avoid towns and villages already they have passed mezhan hunting
4132551 create a monster monopoly that would push up ticket prices and substantially reduce competition on the busiest air corridor in the world
4132552 unacceptably dominant with nearly half of all of the slots at heathrow leaving competitors powerless to take them on
4132553 an important step towards ensuring we can compete effectively with rival alliances and manage through the challenges of record fuel prices and growing economic concerns
4132554 providing consumers with easier journeys to more destinations with better aligned schedules and frequencies
4132555 play under the same rules we are taking a very important step towards consolidation which is necessary in todays aviation industry
4132556 not sure about the legal definition of popular demand but this might actually apply
4132557 dont collect them all and dont ask for a specific one they will be sent out according to a random number generator by our blindfolded mail order crew
4132558 i think the fear is that somehow large corporations will censor their content their points of view right
4132559 i think the bigger concern for them should be if you have government dictating content policy which by the way would have a big first amendment problem
4132560 the bears are optimistic that he could be back practicing by midseason but if theyre really struggling and going nowhere at the halfway point they very well could decide to keep him off the field all season
4132561 but if either josh beekman or anthony oakley do well enough at left guard while hes still out it wouldnt be a shock if they just let metcalf go considering how unimpressive hes been in his time with the team
4132562 if you were a dragon in a flower bed what would you be doing
4132563 he has worked hard to establish an identity as an oriole but he did tell me it felt good h to close the scoring
4132564 i had a sense of what this meant to him
4132565 he has worked hard to establish an identity as an oriole but he did tell me it felt good
4132566 each time out he is making a statement establishing himself as a legitimate top of the order starter in either league i think hes still got some upside
4132567 they have great athletes when they go through more experiences like this youre going to see a rise
4132568 we will be gathering our friends to help secure and ship humanitarian relief
4132569 thirty years is pretty good and the show is still popular
4132570 larry and i will have a bowl of mueslix and a small shot of prune juice and be in bed by 9 oclock
4132571 well let people file by the bed and watch us go to sleep i think we can hang with the best of them until midnight
4132572 i fished all over the lake using crankbaits and caught 12 to 15 fish
4132573 r u sad that your kid will never make you that proud
4132574 does it make you sad that your kid will never do anything to make you that proud
4132575 more americans age 50 are trying to leave their cars behind but face obstacles as soon as they walk out the door climb on their bikes or head for the bus
4132576 we totally support whatever her name is who was standing right behind the girl who was talking even though she blew her routine and made us lose the olympics
4132577 while we set an all time record for shipments in the quarter the level of orders received was even stronger
4132578 man you straight i hate a fake homo claiming men for the promo you aint touched a dick except when youre solo
4132579 i buried his body and considered my choices still in my foolishness i refused to believe the full import of all i had seen the tale was clear as day but in my fear i hoped still that it was not as bad if he was travelling west i thought he must have come from the east there are no orc lairs elsewhere that i know of so i travelled eastwards quickly pressing unkath hard until i passed through the foothills of the spear mountains and towards the gap of fire as i travelled i saw several bands of orcs clustering in the mountains but i did not investigate and seek out their cities the spear mountains are harsh and trackless and i knew that what i sought lay not there and that time was running short i passed through the gap of fire where your scouts keep their sleepless vigil and into the eastern wastes even as i left the borders of this land the sense of danger waxed i left the path or what there is of one and headed east
4132580 arderth have you ever gone beyond your borders into the east
4132581 the last outposts are a hundred yards from the border itself on firmer ground we do not approach the eastern wastes any closer the land drops away and the footing is treacherous for both man and beast and none know how far the wastes extend
4132582 they are passed in a day if done swiftly and if you know the path
4132583 i spent some days travelling around those lands surveying it and mapping it
4132584 far to the east lies a single great mountain rising out of the plains sharply like a great spearhead dominating the land about it for many long leagues
4132585 there were several great camps around the mountain teeming with orcs and evil men and it was difficult to approach yet the orcs were not vigilant trusting to their own security in such a hiding place i found a way past their surveillance for wizards have many skills
4132586 then when i came closer my fears were confirmed a power has returned to this realm a power of menace and evil the ruined fortress of man has been rebuilt stronger and more terrible than before i saw it in the twilight black and jagged against the sky like the teeth of some great beast long ago it was painted white but it has been corrupted since then and now it is dark as midnight its walls were manned by many orcs and there were trolls too fell and deadly from the northern mountains even i wizard of many journeys had never seen one before and knew them only from books of lore they seldom leave their mountain fastnesses and that is good for they are more than the equal of any man in battle and as i crept closer i saw a great platform and atop that a dragon for all the world like a bird sunning itself in the last rays of daylight
4132587 fell indeed i would be lying if i said i was without fear when the strength of that place was revealed to me yet i knew these were mere servants something far more dangerous lay within the fortress itself i could sense it like a faint smell or sound at the corners of my awareness but closer i needed to come that i did disguised as one of the orcs and i touched the very stones of that place almost i cried out aloud so defiled were they by long years of evil cold they were and filthy but strong stronger than should have been then i encountered it i felt it brushed against it
4132588 i was lucky it did not suspect spies so close to its fortress and its defences were not erected in a few moments i learned much of its conscious thought yet then i made a great mistake for in my greed i sought more knowledge yearning to discover the innermost desires of the creature and its ambitions suddenly it was aware of me its mind snapped shut like a steel gate and i was cast out there was pain white hot and blinding but worse was the fact that now it knew where i was
4132589 i expected immediate pursuit and i cast off my disguise and returned to unkath
4132590 two figures cloaked in sable issued forth from the fortress on steeds of midnight black
4132591 it was a dark night as i galloped away trusting to unkaths skills for a long time i sensed them close behind but then the strength of my steed told and i opened up a greater gap i did not trust to sleep knowing they would not but rode on through the sunrise the next day i slowed for unkath was weary but i used all my cunning and knowledge to set them a difficult trail and soon they were far distant i made my way back across the eastern wastes cautiously for there were still roving bands of orcs and i wondered whether a message might have been sent from grath othod when i reached the outpost line i paused figuring the enemy would not pursue me this far and rested before i went to sleep i sent you a message
4132592 that would be just over a week ago then i fell into a deep slumber i had not slept for perhaps a week and could scarcely walk i had been harmed by contact with the dark one also i figured it best to regain my composure before i appeared at the ducal palace
4132593 i cannot gauge the full intent of the enemy but some things seem to me quite certain
4132594 you will be attacked and attacked soon duke not today or tomorrow had that been the case i would not have paused even a moment at the border but come on myself instead of sending a letter but soon nonetheless i doubt the enemy sought to launch his assault so swiftly but he will worry about me he will know who i am and wonder what i know and he will wonder if i have told others he will seek to stop my knowledge reaching a wider audience
4132595 why would he attack us if it is you he seeks to silence would not assassins be more sure
4132596 i doubt not that there are assassins pursuing me even as we speak
4132597 but he will not trust solely to them he will seek to make sure of my death he will be full of doubts now his muster is far from complete that much i gleaned from his mind yet he will figure he has sufficient spears to conquer the lake district
4132598 all his thoughts are bent to the conquest of angos dolgrath burns like a beacon in his mind
4132599 you should go handril you know more of this than any
4132600 i must rest before undertaking such a great journey i am getting on in years now and recent exertions have tired me nor could i go hidden send men you can trust and send them in plain garb not the uniform of linion there are signs of this evil all across the empire and i doubt not that the dark one has many servants along the royal road
4132601 but neither is the dark one and that may prove a boon unlooked for his blow will fall without hesitation but often the rushed blow is the weaker and that will be to your advantage seek to your swords men of the lakes for they will be your salvation in days to come
4132602 i will cancel the feast and have messages sent to the barracks swiftly
4132603 we have too few soldiers if this enemy comes in any strength
4132604 we must not spread alarm too swiftly send word but only in general terms see that the stores are in good order and that it is known where men are perhaps have the defences of the town surveyed but not yet repaired
4132605 how can i enjoy the feast when this news hangs over me
4132606 were we to recall all our forces the roads would be clogged within hours with refugees there would be tumult in the streets
4132607 i am a soldier and i know war the sooner we reach our full strength the better our chances of victory a force hurriedly thrown into the field is much weaker than its numbers might suggest
4132608 the enemy will not strike in the next few days duke
4132609 i do not understand but i will bow to your wisdom the feast will go on still i worry
4132610 terrible times are upon us duke you can trust few people but i am one of them send for the messengers tell them to go to dolgrath with this
4132611 and if any ask you whether war will come call that rumour the mere errantry of a foolish wizard
4132612 it has been a while since i ate i hope there will be wine also
4132613 this is a most magnificent feast the soup is divine the wine strong and rich
4132614 yet let us not talk of frivolities like women there is word in the town that the wizard had brought bad news indeed terrible news they say he has warned of war to come that he panicked the soldiers at the gate
4132615 i cuffed the cur i said if war is coming then arderth our great and noble duke will tell us but the cur said he merely repeated what others said and i wondered perhaps whether there was some truth to them if war is coming my lord then why has there been no word from the palace such news is very important to us my valuable cargoes could be lost i need not mention what such a blow could mean to my fortunes
4132616 i too have heard those rumours and i was at the gates to hear the wizards words i have spoken with handril since then and i suspect they are merely fears that are oft born in the borderlands where the eastern wastes lie close and civilisation seems far off
4132617 why then would the wizard counsel us to sharpen our blades in case we encounter a piece of meat tougher than any we have encountered
4132618 as a merchant i have a right to know what passes in the world it is the dukes duty to protect our lives and livelihood
4132619 balblen your fish are safer now than they were when they swam in the lakes
4132620 there is no war who would attack us kherokir wydriff the swarthy men
4132621 we have no enemies i am duke here and although we pay the greatest respect to handril he is not the duke nor is he so mighty that he might bring war upon us
4132622 and there has not been war in these lands for many years there may be raiding bands as sometimes cross briefly into the borderlands but we have soldiers in the field for that very purpose
4132623 for it was with his arrival that these rumours of war were first heard
4132624 i have said that before and it is my word and none other that decides whether we prepare for war but if you would hear what the wizard has said then i shall let him speak then you can decide for yourself
4132625 as you know my name is handril and i am a wizard i am old and wise and have seen many things i warn you today that there are war drums beating in the east beyond the red wastes there is a power rising a new power a power bent on conquest and domination
4132626 you suspect there is a power rising to the east that there are war drums beating foolishness and silliness i fear war as much as any man but the words of the wizard have no truth to them my fief lies near the red wastes and i have seen much of the world besides and i can tell you this there is nothing past our eastern borders but wasteland and maybe a few scattered tribes of barbarians who have left their homelands in the southern deserts there is no great power there and especially none that could threaten the empire
4132627 there is a power rising and no it is not a kingdom of men or such it is a great evil spirit it is gathering the orcs and trolls of the mountains together it threatens our very existence already their numbers dwarf ours and they swell each day
4132628 do not take this as an insult or as casting aspersions on your powers but perhaps what you fear is merely the product of long years of vigilance on our behalf long years of worry and fear and for which we are eternally grateful yet do they not say that a man when his limb is cut off will still feel it then may not a sentinel who constantly watches for bandits see bandits where none exist we do not claim you are lying but perhaps merely confused
4132629 let us consider what we know and what we have heard we have little knowledge of the east we assume it is empty wastelands and a few savages we know that far to the south east there are living lands but we figure they halt at some northward point perhaps there is a power to the east perhaps there is some kingdom but to assume it means us harm let us consider what this country might offer if it existed many valuable things spices and jewels can only be found in distant lands they must be shipped through livonon and kherokir and we pay exhorbitant duties if there were a kingdom to the east then another trade route would be open it could easily be the enrichment of our district and if so why meet them with spear and axe when bread and salt is a better welcome
4132630 there may well be some kingdom in the east that has long been separated from us by long distance and difficult terrain perhaps they have sent some men to the west scouting and so rumours of invasion have started for would not scouts be armed and thus be easily mistaken for the vanguard of an army yes your thoughts seem wise to me in any case we shall soon know when other messengers come from the border we must not rush to war
4132631 it seems ill luck to discuss such horrible things at table perhaps we should instead turn the conversation to other more agreeable matters so that we might aid our digestion
4132632 it takes a womans grace to remind us of our duties we shall talk no more of war and death today it is a celebratory feast after all not a council of battle never before has my reign been marked by such an august visitor let us celebrate
4132633 my name is laridil i am captain of the fourth company of the regiment of linion who guard the palace of linion i am deeply pleased to meet you
4132634 for although it may seem strange you are a hero to me i have followed your life as well as i could picking up scraps of knowledge in taverns and barracks across the whole district it is because
4132635 i have been enamoured of a strange thing all my life i am deeply interested in magic and wizardry i have been so since i first saw illusionists at the fair when i was but a youth i pray you will not regard it as an imposition for me to converse with you about such a topic
4132636 nay laridil i should not regard it as an imposition
4132637 i have practised the art all my life and seldom conversed about its workings i should be a poor craftsman to pass up such a chance what desire you to know
4132638 is it an acquired skill are men born with the gift or can it be learned like mastery of the sword
4132639 it is hard to explain perhaps an analogy would do could a man without hands learn to use a sword or could a man without legs learn to ride a horse the wizard must first have the ability within himself and then learn how to use it just as a man who can grasp a sword must learn how to wield it
4132640 but how know you when someone has such ability can it be sensed or seen there are rumours you seek an apprentice to take up your mantle how would you select such a person
4132641 the essence of magic cannot be hidden from the senses of those expert in it
4132642 i can hear their voices in another realm if i am close enough
4132643 and have felt only the faintest whispers there are some seers and their like who can hear the voices of the other place but they cannot speak in that realm some tried anyway and broke their minds and bodies in the attempt
4132644 then if someone at this table had the gift you would know it
4132645 but the table is silent none in this city speaks the language of magic none could serve as my apprentice
4132646 i have seen hundreds of men and women entranced by the romance of the art but lacking the ability why should i delude them why should i tempt them to explore forbidden and dangerous paths those who try merely end up damaged as i said and i would not have that on my conscience
4132647 would you enter my world just once knowing you could never return
4132648 but then to leave it and never return perhaps the pain of parting can oft be softened through memory of the past
4132649 you understand little you have never truly loved a woman and to you all the joys of life are but fleeting moments think deeply upon this issue you can walk the fields of wonder but it will be but a brief moment and then you will return to this world all will seem cheap and tawdry then it is no light price would you touch what you have long desired and then give it up again and never go back for it is within my power to give true seekers a glimpse of their deepest desire choose carefully young soldier
4132650 i would wizard i would see my goal and then return to my life and be satisfied
4132651 indeed i would volunteer myself for such a journey were i not so sickly
4132652 forgive this intrusion but it is most urgent i beg a short meeting with you in your chambers this evening
4132653 i am tired from a long day and would rather retire to bed
4132654 give me a half hour to change my clothes and see to some work
4132655 i shall have a visitor soon his name is eredon i shall see him only briefly so please knock on my door ten minutes after he enters
4132656 if he comes accompanied please ensure his companion stays outside i do not have the time or the energy to deal with more than one person now
4132657 i hope you will forgive your humble servant for possibly overstepping his bounds in inviting an acquaintance hence yet what i will tell you has much to do with my companion and i am sure you will find him agreeable company
4132658 while it is unexpected i shall hold my judgement until i have heard what you have to say
4132659 i wish to speak about the matters we discussed before at the feast i may be a mere ore merchant duke but perhaps i know more about these matters than even you
4132660 the wizard spoke of war of powers to the east rising looking this way in hunger the senile fool
4132661 he was half right there is indeed a power rising in the east but it is not new my companion here is one of their representatives
4132662 it was too early had it been revealed who knows what might have happened panic or a mad rush to the east
4132663 but let us not argue on such things it was felt that it was too early for you to be informed but now that the wizard has spread his rumours and half truths the tale should be told to you at least
4132664 you will do as you wish but first hear me out
4132665 there is a power rising to the east very rich are they and mighty are their armies but they do not desire war that is merely the raving of a demented man it is sad that one once so great should have descended to such depths now
4132666 this power wants only to establish friendly ties with the lake district
4132667 already many of the tribes of the east have signed treaties and agreements much trade now flows between them enriching both sides savages who had never seen a diamond now walk around bedecked with a thousand jewels other gifts also this power offers that could not be gained elsewhere you stand to gain much not merely for your duchy but also for yourself i could offer you great rewards arderth
4132668 my authority ends at the border i have no authority to treat with foreign powers dolgrath must approve any agreement
4132669 my friends in the east do not wish to treat with dolgrath directly they have as it were some past grievances with the emperor not the empire you understand but the capital and all it stands for
4132670 tell me duke how heavily is the lake district taxed
4132671 but we have rich fields and the mines of barak hold good lodes
4132672 how much of the sweat of your peasants becomes gold and jewels on the fat fingers of some lazy dolgrath nobleman
4132673 and how many men must you send to dolgrath each year for the armies
4132674 how many do you retain here to protect your own realm
4132675 for every one who stays here two go to dolgrath
4132676 but that is no great burden we are in a time of peace i have enough for my needs and those who go to dolgrath train to a higher standard than i could give them here and when their duty is finished they return here to live anyway
4132677 but when those men return to whom does their loyalty belong
4132678 to the duke who took them from a life of toil in the fields or to the emperor
4132679 you know what it is to have authority you know what it is to demand obedience you know what it is to have power real power now lord a duchy is a fine thing but always you are subject to the whims of whatever fool sits upon the iron throne a kingdom that is better than a duchy
4132680 though your words are cautious and well weighed you wish me to sign a treaty with your friends from the east in the hope of personal gain why should i do it why should i leave the empire that raised me for some stranger
4132681 the land to the east is barren yours is not there would be new markets great markets for your fish and grain and all you could provide there would be markets for your ore especially the black iron of barak
4132682 already we have prepared a list of items for trade
4132683 but commerce is not the end of our hopes think of what might be yours if you chose this path you could keep your soldiers and not send them to be wasted in dolgrath a new kingdom rich and fertile a kingdom without want without need a kingdom flush with gold and silver a kingdom of happy people well fed and healthy a kingdom who would worship their king arderth the blessed
4132684 for we would provide protection our army would man your borders if you wished dolgrath could not simply destroy your freedom for you would have powerful friends and with your new wealth you could find many allies
4132685 i am offering you a chance you will never have again
4132686 the chance to build a new kingdom independent of the dictates of dolgrath arderth the blessed i call you but in centuries to come what names you might have arderth the first arderth the brave arderth the pioneer you talked of treason but they will not call you traitor they will call you hero
4132687 guarantee the supplies of food and ore at a fixed price it will still give healthy profits and there is one other thing in times of conflict if we are attacked then your forces will fight alongside us my master has great respect for you lord and your fighting men
4132688 rather that in times of great danger when our very existence is threatened you would fight with us we would be brothers in arms protecting only that which is ours by right
4132689 you said your forces would protect us from dolgrath were we to follow you yet now you say you need our help which is it are you strong enough to defy dolgrath or are you not
4132690 it is not merely you that has been offered such an agreement
4132691 others have had little hesitation in agreeing terms all have benefitted
4132692 so this new power has arranged military alliances with many realms already has it
4132693 you told me earlier your friends have only good intentions then why does it need so many allies i might almost suspect that this power does have plans of conquest but seeks others to do the dying
4132694 my duke perhaps you should not talk of things you do not understand
4132695 we seek merely your agreement that in difficult times the men of the lake district will stand shoulder to shoulder with us
4132696 those who do not stand at our shoulder will be standing before us
4132697 threats in my own palace you forget yourself merchant and you have forgotten another thing or merely hidden it you have not stated the name of the ruler of this new realm or even what it is called would it not be wise for me to know that before we continue with this conversation i like to know the names of my friends and future allies
4132698 the true name of this realm and its ruler can be left for another time
4132699 when you agree you will be invited to visit his realm then all questions will be answered and you will be blessed above all other men but until then the title of ruler of the east will suffice
4132700 such is but a small sign of the wealth that can be yours if you will only agree
4132701 and i suppose that soon he shall add ruler of the west and ruler of the south to his titles
4132702 or perhaps ruler of the north where he might bid the rocks and ice do his will do you take me for a fool i will have none of your offers none of your schemes i am the emperors man i fought for him and i will fight for him again i will die for him if need be i will never bow my knee to you or your kind
4132703 this is bad news because we need european growth to prevent a global economic slowing but the economies in two major european economies are clearly slowing germanys gdp fell 0 5 in the first quarter and frances fell 0 3 in the second quarter so given their make up in the euro zone europe has experienced a pronounced slowing
4132704 on trade the strong euro has hurt exports but the majority of the decline is due to the slow u s economy
4132705 also european consumers like american consumers are feeling the pinch of reduced disposable income due to high energy and food prices
4132706 the oil induced slowdown has hit europe i would be really surprised if europe gdp stayed above 2 0 for 2008
4132707 it looks like retail purchasing power has declined too much for that to occur
4132708 what weve got to find out is whether in fact it was a safe workplace
4132709 thats one of the issues that we need to find out
4132710 weve been to the afl players association weve asked them to go check the ground and at this stage we dont have a final result on that
4132711 id lost to him eight nine 10 50 times i dont know how many but i had the feeling it could be my day today
4132712 he didnt play a good first game and that put me up straight away i played loose and free and i always fancy my chances on the 5 4 game
4132713 when he got that net cord i started wondering if it would turn around and he would come back playing like the best player in the world but i know i can beat the best in the world on my day and today i proved it
4132714 with livecommunity six groups has solved the problem of producer consumer interaction
4132715 next08 ha just saw me on a huge monitor twittering along way cool they are showing the next08 hashtag hope it will be on all rooms
4132716 a well used tool by webmasters looking to increase the interactive features of their site and get to know their visitors better
4132717 we can see that there is real progress in chechnya but also a potential that things might change for the worse at any moment
4132718 is momenteel nog niet beschikbaar maar zal beschikbaar zijn of is momenteel nog niet beschikbaar
4132719 the last time we won our first game we finished seventh in the league our highest place
4132720 we have to put in the same kind of performance we did against aberdeen every week that is the hard thing keeping it going
4132721 it was the perfect start for us i was not really thinking about the 300 appearances and the goal was a bonus
4132722 it came at a good time which settled us down a bit we have been pipped at the post a few times by aberdeen so it was always going to be a bit of a nervous finish
4132723 it was obvious we wanted it more last saturday and we got our rewards in the end it did not matter who we were playing it was paramount we got off to a good start and we managed to
4132724 pavlik its like deja vu i was asked the same about mikkel kessler who i think is a better fighter than kelly pavlik by the way and ive beaten him
4132725 now all of a sudden theres a guy whos had one or two decent wins and they call me out its always going to be the case how long can you go on for
4132726 the choice between pavlik and roy jones was easy to make remember that pavlik was my first choice after jeff lacey and he declined the fight now hes calling me out
4132727 the lads have only been in the country for a day but the way they have gone about their business is great i think they performed well last night
4132728 the plan was to perhaps take him on loan for six months and see how he did but no decision has been made yet we will look at the situation again after the game against rangers at the weekend
4132729 he has a ten hour flight to get here and probably wont be here until friday so wont be playing against rangers
4132730 dph said i love kitty cupcake i would promise not to eat her too
4132731 i dont think that the appearance of a conflict of interests means there is a conflict
4132732 fact is theres been some buzz but it hasnt reached the places it would normally
4132733 well some fool game good money out of the window daresay its in the family look at your uncle emil wake up emil
4132734 edus lost more at the tables than you ever had a chance to spit at
4132735 well she forked it out how much did you say it was
4132736 hes always such bad luck im sure they swindle him
4132737 well yes mama i think the money lenders take him in its hardly conceivable otherwise no one could stake so much in cold blood
4132738 what would the poor boy want to borrow money for
4132739 im going to cut him off who does the fool think he is a goy
4132740 hugging silence sometimes bubbling to the surface in a splash of talk
4132741 so unnecesary large ones so many people eating together the after dinner faces it is so unbecoming to the women
4132742 and i wanted to say i dont see how you can forgive me for tonight
4132743 my dear it was not brahms this afternoon it was schumann i know because i was there
4132744 darling then youre able to say that you saw me
4132745 please please my dear be careful oh i beg you
4132746 i might a little to please you to throw something to the gods
4132747 and were you supposed to have changed into this dress in the cab
4132748 should you even talk so much about going alone in cabs
4132749 my name is handril and i am the last of the wizards i come to request your hospitality my journey has been long and weary and i have endured heavy duties i would take rest and sustenance within your walls and wash the dust of the road from my feet
4132750 i welcome you handril last of wizards beloved of men wanderer storyteller counsellor all that is ours shall be yours come within the walls of the city and be given all the privileges of your station
4132751 soldiers of linion you pay me respect today standing here under the sun in full armour i am honoured to receive such a welcome you look like good men at least and your gear seems to be in good repair
4132752 but looks can be deceiving i will give you some wizardly counsel then as part payment of the hardships you have endured in this heat see that your spears are kept sharp for though a bright shining spear is a fine welcome for a wizard a keen one is better when there are greater deeds afoot
4132753 did you see his eyes like looking into the sun it was almost tripped over when i saw them
4132754 a fine mess that would have made you falling out of the ranks
4132755 you said they were like the sun not the sea
4132756 and when have you ever seen the sea theres none for hundreds of miles
4132757 but anyway maybe they were more like the sun shining off the sea
4132758 i was more worried about his words why should we keep our spears sharp therell be fighting before long mark my words he almost said it he did and everybody knows wizards are soothsayers his arrival doesnt mean any good at all at all not good no
4132759 me mam always told me you cant take nothing a wizard says straight theyre different to us above us
4132760 youd have to be deaf and stupid not to understand those words dur and even you arent that thick ill wager a week of night duty that well be in for action before long and ill be seeing that my armours in good nick and the rest of my gear as well youd be wise to do the same dur id hate to see your ugly face lying in the dirt dead
4132761 its summer and who ever fought in the lake district during summer itd be madness half your men would fall down on the march if the barbarians come over the border again itll not be before november or december at least itll be cool enough then
4132762 think what you want dur i trust the wizard more than i trust your predictions and ill be darned if i die because my mails got a loose link
4132763 i doubt they have ever seen a wizard before i have a certain novelty value
4132764 i have been awake since before dawn preparing for your coming
4132765 i have had quite a day and standing in the midday sun of the lake districts is not as restful as it may appear
4132766 i have long believed it is more wearisome to stand in the sun than to run in the cool and in the east the sun is very strong indeed
4132767 i have made up a room close to the white hall for you if you wish to rest before the feast
4132768 there is water wine and food within if you need anything else there will be a page outside in the corridor
4132769 however if i might delay you i should like a few words i am puzzled by your speech at the gate they seemed not words of greeting to me few speak of sharp spears when they wish to be friendly my men are alarmed i think and that is not good
4132770 a wizards words are his own to choose and his counsel his own to keep
4132771 but i would share some of my counsel with you i desire a brief audience before our meal
4132772 i can be spared from affairs of state for a little while
4132773 he has borne me through great travails in recent times and i would have him well treated
4132774 i can only hope my own lodgings are as fine
4132775 he does not always listen to me so make sure he gets plenty of oats and good clean water
4132776 i had them seldom in the field it seems the very height of luxury to have some but a few feet from my own bedchamber
4132777 and if i might be so bold as to command a duke in his own palace i would have you do the same for what i have to say if i trust you is no matter of ribaldry or jest it will demand your wits wine is no great boon to wisdom that i know from long experience
4132778 i had thought perhaps that your trip hence was not solely motivated by a desire for hospitality
4132779 your letter came from the east not the west and that is odd there is nothing to the east and it came with little warning we had no prior intelligence of your wanderings in these lands
4132780 nor if your desires were for good food and fine minstrels would this city be your first choice we are rich but we are not dolgrath why then have you come what brings handril last of wizards to linion
4132781 but before i speak freely i would ask you some questions i know much of this world but i do not know you speak
4132782 i became a general of the empire commanding the second corps at the battle of urunzem two full legions my charge on the right wing turned the tide of battle and saved the life of the emperor who was foolish then and who had come too far forward upon the field with the carnage still bloody about us he sent for me i came in mail spattered in gore stinking of death and sweat and the emperor bless his name gave me ducal rank granting me the fief of the lake district saying its duke was dead and that it was a place where a vigorous man might make his name
4132783 that was no mean gift no half acre ennobled by a false name
4132784 it is a great gift from the narmath in the west to the spear mountains in the east and from the storm hills to the south to the very banline in the north hundreds upon hundreds of miles from end to end linion as you know is the greatest of its cities but mezhan is no village and barak is a large mining town
4132785 but it has proven a wise one i am a just ruler if nothing else and i am blessed by good black soil and much water i have seen the treasury and the populace grow it is perhaps the richest of all the districts of the empire bar the lands of dolgrath itself and it is growing all the time
4132786 indeed so swift has been recent growth that there are pressures to expand the borders that presents problems to the south is wydriff and that is occupied to the east are the red wastes to the west beyond the narmath is the province of narion and that is poor land besides having its own inhabitants
4132787 you speak of the lands that lie across the banline
4132788 those who live near the ban fear it most for some odd terror clings to it like a shadow of mist
4132789 those who press most for settlement past the ban are newcomers from the south who have seen not the ban and know not its power and silent menace but there are more of them every day and if there are no lands elsewhere then whence else can they go
4132790 not just their content that was good but it could have been an act but also the spirit behind them for my purposes how you speak is as important as what you speak voice is a powerful tool duke learn to master it and you will learn to master men but i digress i trust you now and i can speak more freely
4132791 you know duke that i am a wanderer in these lands i am the last of the wizards as you have said that sets upon me certain duties for the greatest part of my life since my master died i have travelled far and wide seeking amongst all the peoples of the world an apprentice to take over my burden when it proves too much for me someone who feels the currents of the hidden realm as i do that quest has taken me from the great sea to the eastern deserts and into the jungles of the winterless south but that is not my only task
4132792 i am also a collector of information an explorer of strange lands a seeker after danger
4132793 that duty has grown more urgent in recent times for the past year i have felt a growing sense of disquiet and danger unlike any i had experience before when you have lived as long as i have new feelings are rare and best examined soon this new foreboding dominated even my dreams and i deemed it a great threat and needing discovery signs of it i saw everywhere and for a while i knew not whence it came but as i travelled i solved more of the mystery until i knew that the source of this evil lay in the distant east beyond the borders of your duchy duke that discovery chilled my veins i cannot tell the full story now for time is short but to the members of my order it has long been the east where our greatest fears reside for centuries nay millenia we have kept close watch upon it but with the failing of our line that vigilance ceased i cannot be everywhere at once
4132794 thus a month ago i came to these lands unaccompanied and unheralded
4132795 it was a single orc travelling west to the north of lake sevost in full gear of war
4132796 the company of the star chapter one an important visitor part one
4132797 for war you need three things 1 money 2 money 3 money
4132798 if you want to try and whitewash your fathers beliefs you can
4132799 he really didnt need frank davis to guide him in that direction
4132800 everyone wants a limo but you can only supply so many
4132801 gt cnn amp cbs edit out threat to presidents life a focus on beauty precision and the inspiration of olympic spirit videos obama campaign completely confused over russian invasion of georgia
4132802 insists that the sovereign and territorial integrity of georgia be respected
4132803 one can forget about any talk about georgias territorial integrity because i believe it is impossible to persuade south ossetia and abkhazia to agree with the logic that they can be forced back into the georgian state

4132808 inability to perform the duties of his or her office efficiently
4132809 national legislation must establish an independent authority to regulate broadcasting in the public interest and to ensure fairness and a diversity of views broadly representing south african society
4132810 we have two thousand trained footmen and from the better citizenry weve found another four hundred who can at least swing a sword thats twenty four hundreds no mean force
4132811 if those bakers and farriers are forced to fight i doubt their worth will prove high
4132812 protecting their homes will be all the training they need
4132813 now horse we have three hundred heavy horse and another fifty scouts recruited from the countryside we have another hundred horses as well but no riders from them
4132814 they know the land well they will do good work on the approaches
4132815 they will die in a minute if theyre caught up in the battle
4132816 we keep four hundred men on the walls at all time fifty knights near the southgate in case the enemy makes a cavalry raid we expect a full days warning from withrin once we get that we will put eight hundred on the walls and another two hundred directly behind the southgate in the plaza six hundred will stay here in the citadel and well spread the rest out about the city to stop looting and fires still men will need to sleep but well cross that bridge when we come to it
4132817 we must keep a channel between the citadel and southgate open at all times
4132818 we must hold the walls as long as we can but not at the expense of losing the entire city even if they gain the gates if we can retreat to the citadel we shall still have some hope
4132819 if the enemys numbers are as great as we suspect then we cannot risk it on raids beyond the walls also there are few streets broad enough within the city to allow us to charge down them
4132820 my recommendation is that they be kept as a final reserve if the city is lost three hundred heavy horse is a strong enough force to gain the safety of open lands they might be able to escort you and some others on the long road to dolgrath i at least have not forgotten that this is but one battle in a greater war duke
4132821 but only at the very last need i will not abandon my people unless there is no other choice
4132822 i will make what plans i can if the time comes they will be ready for you
4132823 half a day behind us if that we got away only by riding swifter than the very hounds of hell they are more cunning than they seem
4132824 there will be time enough for your tale later but now you must rest my physician will soon be with you
4132825 you must see to your defences immediately we saw the enemy my lord and they are many twenty thousands at least we counted them carefully then they saw us but we escaped for we knew they could not outrun us over open country where we know every gully and field
4132826 we had ridden only a few minutes when we were attacked orc riders suddenly appeared sweeping around us on both sides somehow they had got behind us during our reconaissance using the lie of the land to stay hidden they had avoided our outriders we had no warning we were but ten and they fifty they fired at us from horseback and we must thank the fates that their aim was so poor i was the only one hit and even then it was not fatal we rode through them with our swords some fell good men lie on the road to linion
4132827 we could not stop i did what i could to staunch the wound and strapped it tightly we rode on as fast as we could the horses are blown half to death i think the orcs tried to follow but in a race like that they could not keep up still it is but a brief respite within a day we shall lie under siege
4132828 but there are no fragments of the arrow left within it i will apply this salve and then bind it you will not die of it but you will be in discomfort for a while you will not be able to ride
4132829 we saw no great engines but ladders or even ballistae could easily be hidden in such a large force there were wains enough
4132830 we saw no dragons or dark riders but with so many orcs they will not need any greater aid
4132831 they will probably try to storm the city off the march
4132832 withrin you may rest here unless the good doctor wishes you to go somewhere else and you physician when you have finished with him see to your stocks of medicines we shall have much need of your skills in the days ahead if you have need of anything get it you are under my authority but hurry there will be no shipments of herbs for many days to come
4132833 now you are here i feel more sure of victory
4132834 only orcs and trolls march through the night towards us it seems the enemy deems us such a minor inconvenience that he sees no need to use his greater weapons that is very lucky we have little that would be proof against dragons or demons
4132835 but not all i know speaks well for us the enemy thinks only of death and blood there is no pity no scrap of mercy in any of them there will be no quarter no parley this will be a battle fought with tooth and claw when sword breaks
4132836 they are making for the gate you archers hold your fire
4132837 you will need all your shafts in a moment await my word
4132838 but they will renew their assault ere the dawn is old we must make further preparations to weather this storm but you duke should return to your bed and seek what rest you can i will keep vigil here on the walls
4132839 now go and fetch your duke tell his attendants that handril requests his presence
4132840 we should have taken the ram within the walls wizard
4132841 now it will be borne up again and used against the gate already it is splintered i doubt it can withstand a second blow
4132842 but in no wise could the ram have been brought within the walls that i guessed was the intent of the enemy he never intended his first blow to succeed rather he knew the ram would fail and hoped we would open the gates to take it in many captains would have done so captains skilled in the wars of men yet i am more cunning than he deemed
4132843 for i saw his design i noted squadrons of horse milling about near the front ranks doing little but wait had we opened our gates i have no doubt they would have ridden down upon us with all haste and stormed the gap
4132844 yet that stratagem has failed he will seek victory through cruder means this time they will man the ram again and make of our gate a mess of firewood and scrap
4132845 it was a pretty innocuous sort of event so its bad luck for him
4132846 you dont wish that on any player and obviously hes been a part of the program to date but its an opportunity for the other two blokes
4132847 they are different players but it is a team game
4132848 from our perspective there are a lot of new guys in this team and there is definitely a different feeling amongst the crew we go over there with high expectations of doing well
4132849 i dont ask too much from anybody its not like im asking for special favours
4132850 the club in general has been very understanding and very supportive throughout i cant ask for anything more
4132851 i dont know the full story and i dont want to get into it to be honest he williams went about it in his way i wouldnt have done it that way we definitely miss him on the field
4132852 him being there is overwhelming for us and the opposition
4132853 he oozes enthusiasm hes a freak with the ball superb in both defence and attack
4132854 we are not punching bags and we wont be taking any backward steps he said
4132855 we showed against st george that if thats the way the game goes we will adapt to it
4132856 theyre a team you have to pressure and we have to get up in their faces but within the guidelines omeley said
4132857 we dont want to lose it like st george did
4132858 we havent had any problems with the referees no more or no less than any other club he said
4132859 its just a bit of an excuse to try and justify what theyre doing
4132860 but weve got brett white michael crocker jeff lima dallas johnson those guys arent going to take a backward step to anyone
4132861 while the stakes are high and you expect players to play with passion we certainly wont be allowing players any licence to commit mayhem on the field
4132862 some of the guys are married and some of them have partners and children if the situation isnt clear cut well have to think about it again
4132863 and if players choose not to go i hope it doesnt cause division
4132864 i read the other day that michael clarke said cricket doesnt need division between the western nations and subcontinent and the australian cricket team doesnt need it
4132865 very high threat of terrorist attack sectarian violence and the unpredictable security situation
4132866 good luck to him we havent lost many test matches since 2005 so if form is anything to go by weve probably got them
4132867 ive been training for this for a while and im looking forward to it
4132868 hopefully we can both play well but i want us to win
4132869 that was nice but most of the time i try not to think about who im throwing to
4132870 ive thrown against guys like derek jeter who is worth 110 million and a rodd alex rodriguez a player on a 250 million 10 year deal but it doesnt matter to me the way i see it im going after everybody the same way
4132871 wherever i go theyre always asking me about australia and its great to think about home and talk about home
4132872 in a way it still feels like only yesterday that i was playing baseball for the workers club at laybutt reserve in blacktown
4132873 i keep up with whats happening i know my wests tigers have got a big game coming up against parramatta on monday night
4132874 my dream was to play in the major leagues when i first arrived in america 12 years ago
4132875 now my goal is to become one of the top level players the money will sort itself out
4132876 i am going to date and have a great time
4132877 if tom williams knocked at my door i would certainly answer it
4132878 i really hope nikki has a great games and enjoys herself during her down time but i am not allowed to knock
4132879 i am going to date and have a great time
4132880 if tom williams knocked at my door i would certainly answer it
4132881 i didnt think id ever talk about another horse in the same breath as kingston town but then weekend hussler came along
4132882 he is not there yet he still has a way to go but hes a very exciting horse
4132883 there is no soreness and he pulled up pretty good
4132884 we will keep working along and all going well we will get there to the liston
4132885 we havent had a horse since kingston town who could win over all distances at the top level
4132886 there has been some great champions since the king like might and power octagonal lonhro sunline northerly makybe diva and others but you could sort of categorise them by distances
4132887 with weekend hussler you cant categorise him yet because he hasnt raced beyond 1600m
4132888 he is the first horse since kingston town that we thought could win a feature weight for age sprint first up then go right through the spring unbeaten and contest a melbourne cup at 3200m
4132889 we should go down there will the fighting be fiercest
4132890 hearken to me battle comes keep in close order no matter what and in time with your rank mates do not allow the enemy to break our formation keep your shield high these trolls are tall
4132891 rely on your comrades if you do not fail neither will they stand firm stand together you are men not dogs
4132892 if we come to close combat then use your swords i doubt these beasts have swift hands
4132893 they can die they bleed just like us strike them and they will fall
4132894 we have nowhere to retreat we have our backs to the wall we stand and we fight
4132895 this enemy seems oddly clumsy why did he not reinforce the success of that trollish phalanx laridil could not have stopped them all you said he is wise and crafty beyond the ken of men but his attacks have been halter and now when he should press his assault he has withdrawn to rest that is foolishness his force is mighty and much of it unblooded
4132896 but i suspect the enemy is testing our defences forget not that it is long since he matched wits with men he knows not what weapons we might wield or how we might fight and forget not that one of his minions was slain within these walls perhaps he seeks to see if we hold some relic of immense magic which we will too hastily use in our defence and thus reveal ourselves indeed it may be me that is the reason he attacks so cautiously
4132897 the enemy knows me better than he knows you duke
4132898 he knows i am a wizard no doubt he has ill memories of my kind from the last time he came to this place perhaps he fears that i might possess some deadly skill that could slaughter his army to an orc thus he keeps his forces at arms length sending only probes in the hope that i will expose myself and be slain
4132899 unfortunately i do not have any secret weapon or spell of power that might defeat such an army had i then we might stand a chance
4132900 there never was any real hope of victory arderth just a fools hope
4132901 still what choice had we surrender collaboration better that we fight here and perhaps fate will smile on us for have we not already beaten back two attacks and given the enemy a bloody nose at the least that was more than i hoped for at the first perhaps that is why he has paused
4132902 had i known the truth of your thoughts i might have given different counsel
4132903 you told us to stay here to hold and delay the enemy perhaps it would have been better to leave the cities abandon the fortresses and go westwards withdrawing over open country here we shall not last two more days they will grind us down through weight of numbers but on the steppes we might have outrun them
4132904 do you truly think you would survive longer in the country
4132905 they have many cavalry and orcs are hardier than men over long distances they would have run you down on the very first night surrounded you and killed you you would have died lonely on the plains taking a mere handful of them with you and what of the citizens of the city would you have put all the lake district on the move
4132906 here at least we might fight and kill many before they finally overwhelm us
4132907 here we might survive a few days longer that is little enough time but it may prove vital and then when all is lost in the moment of greatest desperation when the orcs pillage and loot the city then some must leave the city and bring news to dolgrath yet we must distract them first if we are to avoid their eyes
4132908 i hear it but i do not know whether i agree with it nor am i sure i understand it or whether you tell the full truth who might escape then
4132909 it is not your place to die here i will go with you but my duty here is not yet complete others also must go who carry skills that should not be lost on the field here
4132910 you would have me abandon my fief at the last
4132911 greater good might you do by telling the emperor of what you have seen than rotting in a mound here or being eaten by the orcs
4132912 and we will not abandon the city yet for there is one other reason to remain we must teach the dark one to fear the valour and steel of men
4132913 you said perhaps the enemy holds back because he suspects we have some weapon in reserve there is another possibility perhaps the enemy himself holds back some weapon one that has not yet arrived and he seeks to use it against us and is willing to wait to do so
4132914 i am only sure of one thing the next blow will come at night there are currents moving across the steppes thoughts of war the enemy will come when the sun sinks and the spirits of men drop with it that is when we must be most wary lest the sun rise tomorrow not on a living city but on a tomb bearing the name of linion and now i must go and rest i think i myself shall come to trial this night
4132915 their king will not show himself yet yet one has come who will sorely test my skill nonetheless
4132916 and do not tarry you have only a few moments gather all the men you can find who have not been overcome by fear lock them behind strong doors do not waste your time on the others for they have been broken by the enemy and will be no use to us
4132917 keep your sword safe i know not what virtue has been laid upon it but it seems proof against dark walkers now begone
4132918 but first i must delay these things a few moments more already they recover from the shock of my light and it will not work a second time
4132919 you get 35 possessions and three goals from gary ablett and our key player and our best player had a really bad day
4132920 his form was fantastic last week and we heard paul roos say it was the most important game hes played which is a fantastic effort for someone who has won two brownlows
4132921 hes certainly a threat and theres plenty of homework to be done on adam goodes
4132922 its a big game between geelong and sydney weve got a history of great games going back to the final a couple of years ago when they went on to win the flag
4132923 its a nice tune up for the finals sydney are in fourth at the moment so it could be a preview for a qualifying final in a months time
4132924 its a showpiece game for the afl and we wont be taking our foot off the accelerator at all
4132925 we are on a hot streak and youve got to cash your cheques when theyre due

4132939 we face a tough market in the year ahead but we are well placed to withstand these conditions with a proven business model clear strategy and sound property skills
4132940 we are budgeting for a nominal increase in eps in financial year 2009 but it is going to be tough and we are assuming that market conditions do not deteriorate further

4132948 the purchase of pmi in australia and asia is in line with qbes strategy of diversification
4132949 the acquisitions have been structured to allow us to meet or exceed our minimum profit requirements even in the event of extremely adverse economic conditions over the next three years
4132950 weve seen no signs of improved consumer sentiment at all
4132951 we see consumers weighed down by interest rates and petrol prices now getting their superannuation information and seeing a destruction in their superannuation portfolio

4132956 all of these things are coming together in a confluence of events thats creating tremendous pressure on the industry

4132972 this is another classic example of ted over reaching and stirring up factional trouble where none existed
4132973 it annoys me ted is even thinking about this stuff when he should be focused on bringing down the brumby government
4132974 this is a problem across both factions so why is ted kicking it along

4132976 were looking at people who have got severe psychological problems
4132977 theres research that people who inflict cruelty on animals then move on and become involved in violence against people
4132978 people like martin bryant the tasmanian mass killer and ted bundy the us serial killer had previous history of cruelty to animals
4132979 so you have to look at whoevers done this in the same vein that they have the propensity to move on and commit atrocious crimes against people as well

4133008 meanwhile the powers that be in the state who had all along been waiting in the wings pondering a devious action against the entertainment industry pounced on this error and capitalised on it to draw the curtains on acting while the video scandal happened only in 2007 the decision to destroy the industry had been in the works for close to a decade indeed since the advent of sharia by self appointed puritans having dealt a deadly blow on kaniwood the directorate now set its eyes on literature it was said that the dg had even vowed to shut the doors to the book stores in the city

4133010 it got to a stage where unless a hausa film has girls with tight dresses singing and dancing suggestively it will not sell and filmmakers have been defending this by insisting that they are in the business to make money not art one of them one of the biggest among them even told us bluntly to hell with hausa culture i am a filmmaker and i want to make money if you people want a cultural film do it with your own money this marketing mantra led to more song and dance routines with girls dressed in tight clothes shaking their bodies suggestively even if the story does not warrant a dance

4133025 it appears many horse racing industry participants were not concerned with whether or not funds used to engage in betting were legitimately attained
4133026 participants typically took the position that persons subject to criminal charges and likely to be betting with illicitly attained funds were innocent until proven guilty and welcome to continue betting
4133027 accordingly a large number of persons associated with the racing industry including bookmakers trainers jockeys commission agents and racetrack identities have come to the attention of police as having improper associations with known criminals
4133028 i have been told and i accept that a body of intelligence has been obtained throughout the general course of purana investigations which impacts directly upon the integrity of the racing industry in this state

4133067 you are correct in that the trenching is for the connections from the internet to the central bpl equipment and the connections to the three electric circuits that take off from the martins store substation these circuits distribute electric energy north along route 151 south along route 151 and southeast along route 6 to woods mill and beyond once the preliminary work at the substation is complete installation crews will follow the electric circuits out from the substation installing bpl equipment as they go this equipment will be hung about every 2 3 mile along the distribution lines and next to each customers electric transformer either pole top or pad mount bpl will become available to different customers on different days and will depend on two factors the distance from the substation and to the customers home and how many customers have enrolled for bpl along the way from the substation an ibec service representative will contact each bpl customer when service has been made available at their home to guide them through the bpl modem activation process there has been robust enrollment over the past four weeks ibec has updated their deployment maps and is focused on getting underway once the field deployment has begun it will be easy to track the progress of the installation crews as the proceed along the circuits
4133068 the importance of the internet for rural education employment and health care cannot be overstated and is underscored by the fact that the internet has only be in use by the average person for less than 15 years
4133069 the process begins at martins store substation where installation crews connect the internet to the bpl system at the head end of three electric circuits one circuit travels along route 151 south another circuit travels along route 151 north the third circuit follows route 6 to route 29 at woods mill then splits to follow route 29 north and south one of these circuits deliveries energy to your home or business installation crews will follow each circuit attaching bpl equipment about every 1 2 mile along the circuits and at the premises of the customers who have pre enrolled for bpl service the bpl equipment controls the radio frequency signal that carries the bpl data from the substation to your home or business one crew should be able to cover about 5 miles per day and the crew will work each line section until deployment is complete

4133079 they voted me one of the top five olympians in all time some of them are dead but they invited the other ones to go to the olympics but not me yes i am a bit upset about it
4133080 i won seven events if they had the 50 meter freestyle back then which they do now i probably would have won that too
4133081 hes a world record holder in all these events so he is dominating the events just like i did he reminds me of myself
4133082 mark was a very talented swimmer and very dominant in his time
4133083 the difference with michael is that he has a much more challenging program i think the competition throughout the world is more challenging
4133084 in 68 mark had tremendous pressure because he had talked a lot about how he was going surpass don schollander the first swimmer to win four golds at one olympics and he didnt fare very well under the pressure then in 72 he obviously was magnificent michael has been magnificent really since his first olympics when he was the youngest guy on the team
4133085 im sure he can afford a ticket if he wants to be here it would have been nice for him to be here and witness it i really feel he contributed a lot to swimming but its time to turn the reins over to somebody else youve got to move on with life get a life after swimming

4133130 accountant is not defined or protected by law and that thousands of small business and individuals believing that they have engaged qualified accountants are at risk from harmful and costly business advice from unqualified unregulated possibly uninsured advisers
4133131 legal protection of title is viewed as essential in professions where there is a substantial degree of public interest
4133132 solicitors are all protected so why not accountants the people that have the power to protect this title arent in this camp government has argued in the past that to protect the term accountant would be anti competitive they argue that it could force unqualified accountants who provide a competent and efficient service to their clients out of business and that it could restrict choice for businesses as to who they work with particularly those in the sme sector however there is a glimmer of light at the end of this particular tunnel the challenge which the dept for business enterprise and regulator reform have set the accountancy bodies in the uk is demonstrate that the case for protecting the title is in the public interest not the professions interest if we can it will listen
4133133 the ccab is involved in a survey that is considering whether the term accountant should be a protected profession backed by legal recognition the ccab made up of the acca and the five other uk accountancy institutes believe the move would protect clients from people calling themselves accountants who have weak my capitals or no qualifications
4133134 unqualified accountants are the biggest source of competition the attendees were happy for the unqualifieds to pick up the bottom end of the market but some are losing clients to unqualifieds and want greater action by acca

4133149 tests back then caught other people using things so how can anyone say that we might have been using things that couldnt be tested for
4133150 wang and other chinese were tested by the iaaf in china sometime in 1993
4133151 humanity never stops developing progressing conditions get better all the time
4133152 uhhhh i dont know about that obviously they all go at some point for the most part
4133153 theres always maybe speculation when someone has an incredible performance and i just think that until someone has proof or evidence of any type of wrongdoing records are records and they stand as they stand
4133154 theres been testing in place for years so if nothing is proven to question that record then there shouldnt be speculation about its validity
4133155 my friends joke that i was an alien with special powers
4133156 like barack obama mark warner is not afraid to challenge the status quo to bring people together and get things moving
4133157 its that kind of spirit and innovation that resulted in his selection as keynote speaker on a night when we will be discussing how to renew americas promise
4133158 mark warner is the future of the democratic party and putting him on tuesday night with hillary clinton is exactly right move for obama

4133174 these cards are a great choice for people who want to reflect their concern for the planet at the same time they are sending a message to someone they care about
4133175 they are smaller than an average sized card and they have a distinctly different look the cards are designed to be recyclable as well
4133176 we want people to feel good about the cards they are sending whether theyre connecting with someone over a shared passion for the environment or simply choosing a just right message to send

4133180 ik vraag me weleens af waarom ik geen postzegels kan verzamelen en waarom ik geen amourettes kan collectioneren en geen wijsheid zo vraag ik me ook wel eens af waarom ik zou moeten berichten over po zie of literatuurfestivals die de dichters uit epibreren noch mij ooit hebben uitgenodigd maar wel bijkans smeken om op het nu slapende rottend staal vermeld te worden ik spreek hier over bijvoorbeeld saint amour crossing border en de utrechtse nacht van de po zie voor wat hoort wat zou je zeggen zo deelde in esfehan een indiase professor me mee dat men aan de universiteit van new delhi overweegt een leerstoel nederlands op te zetten maar daar moet nederland natuurlijk wel wat tegenover stellen en een amerikaans dichter vertelde me al jaren geleden dat hij ons aan optredens in the states zou kunnen helpen maar dan moet je mij eerst een optreden in nederland bezorgen daarom stel ik voor dat alle festivalorganisaties die nog nooit een contrabas of rottend staalredacteur geboekt hebben eerst eens wat van die lieden boeken via sss zodat wij net als een aantal van onze collegas van b v de volkskrant nrc handelsblad trouw en vrij nederland daarna vol lof over onze nieuwe broodheren kunnen berichten

4133191 just a few years ago we saw buyers choosing larger homes a little further out from the city because they could afford more square footage and didnt mind the commute
4133192 now that gas and oil prices have gone through the roof buyers are reprioritizing

4133201 we still have a few games left to try to win the competition
4133202 compared with the caribbean the ball is doing a lot more out here and it means i just have to adjust my game a bit
4133203 we have seen dramatic achievement gains across the commonwealth in the past six years proving that the states targeted investment in proven academic programs and the hard work of our educators is paying off
4133204 but we also have a significant challenge ahead of us with struggling students in every school district including large numbers in under funded school districts and in our high schools
4133205 we are narrowing the achievement gap between groups of students while simultaneously raising the academic bar for all students
4133206 as a result we now have about 48 000 more african american and latino students on grade level in reading and math than we did just six years ago
4133207 the general assembly deserves enormous credit for enacting a new school funding law that sets the historic goal of ensuring that all school districts have adequate resources from the state over the next six years
4133208 this years achievement data shows the urgency of living up to our commitment for increased resources
4133209 clearly we need to do more to improve the high school experience and ensure those students stay engaged and challenged through graduation
4133210 we simply cannot afford to be content with the status quo
4133211 the state and its schools must deepen their commitment to reform in all areas
4133212 yes were happy to acknowledge gbs improved showing in the pool just as were happy to acknowledge the wonderful performances of the chinese koreans and japanese swimmers and divers who all sit above or equal to the gb swimming team in the medal tally
4133213 if coastlines really were an indicator of beach volleyball prowess then greece 13 676km should be comfortably ahead of brazil 7 491km
4133214 canada 202 080km would of course be heading for gold though i guess ambient temperature might be an additional factor
4133215 blimey have they changed the rules i thought they were supposed to shoot at paper targets not at each other
4133216 the term the mexican wave has been on this blog a few times instead of just the wave as it is called in canada the us and some other places is there another kind of audience wave
4133217 so far for me anyway its made like the british olympic team on the gold position on the podium and appeared only the once
4133218 i notice that the top nations in those games are barely registering on the olympics tally canada amp south africa are noticeably absent so far india is struggling with one gold australia and gb are not doing that spectacularly either is it because the standard in commonwealth sport is so abysmally poor
4133219 this morning japanese tv treated us to a look at the office where yesterdays japanese gold medalist ueno san in the 70kg womens judo works
4133220 it seems to me that swimming has far too many medals
4133221 if you check out the list of past winners of the 100m 200m and 400m at freestyle medley and butterfly the same names come up again and again solution get rid of the 200m in all events and the individual butterfly completely and since well all have a bit more time on our hands stick back in a non swimming event that we are really good at the 1km cycling then the world well my house will be at peace again
4133222 today has been a general and memorable discourse about the usefulness of medals table
4133223 so in this theme my suggestion and secret wish for the whole world to really remember these game in the true olympic spirit and not for the number of gold medals is that instead of the usual
4133224 wouldnt it be an altogether fairer system to organise the medals table by awarding say 3 points for a gold 2 for a silver and 1 for a bronze and then ranking countries according to the total number of points why should a country which has won one solitary gold medal and nothing else be placed above a country which has won for example 10 silver and 10 bronze medals
4133225 remove phelps from the equation and the americans are having a shocker in this olympics so far
4133226 once all the boats and cycles come home over the weekend its not inconceivable that we might catch them
4133227 i recently moved to the chips and it would appear rain capital of europe brussels
4133228 at my work people are carrying on as if the olympics isnt happening with nary a mention in the first week is this because the belgians are poop at everything or are they going to come into their own in the next few weeks
4133229 archery would be so much more exciting if they had beer bellied cockneys shouting out the score like in darts
4133230 the archery would be monumentally more interesting and exciting if all the competitors were deposited in a forest and the last three standing could then have a shoot off against each others for the medals remember the olympic motto highest fastest strongest and bloodiest
4133231 fair enough it is a concern that we are not medalling as we have done in the past at major championships but we need to nurture the talent and develop our athletes mental strength which were i believe we lack
4133232 what will a statement coming from one of our senior olympic official do for team morale
4133233 she unloads that spent cartridge and puts in another one
4133234 with all this asian domination of the archery one wonders why kevin costner never bothered entering for the usa
4133235 i remember seeing him in a film once about some blokes rushing around a forest with barely a gadget between them and he seemed to manage landing one pointed stick on top of another quite regularly he even managed a few trick shots eyes closed on horseback from a flaming tree hut etc which if included would liven proceedings up considerably dont you think
4133236 for those of us reading your commentary on the fly at work and unable to watch on tv elsewhere can you please explain what skeet shooting is
4133237 just got back from my 80 minute cab ride there and back trip to the kayaking where i sat in the rain for two hours only to be told the race would be postponed can anyone explain how wet it has to be to be too wet for kayaking
4133238 i have sympathy with the swede though i read the article only to find that swedish wrestler ara abrahamian threw down his 84kg greco roman bronze medal in protest i know these fellas should be pretty strong but thats a bloody big medal to be lugging about
4133239 so the swedish wrestler is lamenting that its all politics
4133240 i would think it more likely to be postponed due to possibility of lightning striking carbon fibre paddles
4133241 id rather pull out than take a possible fry up penalty i think the fry ups are better left to mr phelps
4133242 prior to the emms robertson match was a thrilling korea v china mens singles which may yet have a bearing on the current mixed doubles game
4133243 it was full of controversy mascots falling over and being unable to get up and the korean lee hyunil to come from behind in the first game despite a terrible umpiring reversal that can only be put down to local pressure to quieten the partisan crowd and crush his opponent in the second hyunil demonstrated genuine mental and physical class in his win and as a result you could see the whole korean badminton camp was lifted by his heroics having seen their boy win i think the koreans will feed off that and beat the uk pair too
4133244 i do find the whole team gb thing quite dispiriting
4133245 i enjoyed euro 2008 much more because england didnt qualify can we go for the same approach to london 2012 so we can actually enjoy sporting excellence rather than being hammered relentlessly with the news that a team gb boxer has made it into the last 16
4133246 the olympics always get going slowly for britain because our stronger events are always in the second half of the games if the london organisers have any say over which order the events are scheduled surely we should schedule our strongest event early so that we can get off to a flier and get people excited it would be a disaster if the nation is sitting around in 4 years time waiting for the swimming and greco wrestling to finish before it can start flag waving
4133247 this for me is probably the weaker of the 200m backstroke heats
4133248 glad to hear that for becky adlington there was as you say no opprobrium
4133249 the taking of any performance enhancing drugs is something we should all condemn
4133250 is this reality or are you trapped in some kind of oboers nightmare where random sports hove into view then disappear again for no reason
4133251 the mention of barry davies was the clincher for me surely he went over the reichenbach falls in a final struggle with john motson some time ago
4133252 i am privileged to be appointed to this new position under the ifinix banner and look forward to building ifinix futures ifinix futures is a stand alone company with an asset base of over 300 000 a three year history of profitability with audited financials and net capital requirements governed by the national futures association our vision is to develop ifinix futures into a major player in the burgeoning futures and commodities marketplace which does over 2 trillion dollars in volume daily approximately 10 times greater than that of nyse in order to accomplish the goals set forth by the company we are immediately bringing on board an experienced seasoned team of futures traders with commodities and futures becoming a thriving force in todays economy i believe that ifinix futures has the potential to eclipse all other aspects of the companys development to date

4133255 the increase in production coupled with the extraordinarily high prices was more than we anticipated during the second quarter of 2008 universal energy corp s share of production was approximately 23 58 million cubic feet of gas and 262 barrels of oil with production having started in july 2008 for caviar 1 and caviar 4 production for fiscal 2008 is shaping up nicely

4133257 airlines everywhere are struggling with the current price of oil
4133258 but the solution to their problems should not lie in an anti competitive agreement which will inevitably lead to less competition and higher fares
4133259 there is a lot of rhetoric out there but if people look at the facts the u s london market is one of the most contested markets in the world the facts simply dont bear out the rhetoric that somehow we are creating a monopoly

4133269 should airlines have a section of the plane reserved for parents with babies and smaller children

4133297 unfortunately they just lifted the call and ab 1806 failed passage on a vote of 18 21
4133298 reconsideration was granted but it does not look like we will be able to get the votes to get the bill off the senate floor
4133299 we tried to lobby the members to get the last few votes but unfortunately the fact that the bill went on call gave the opposition more time to lobby members to move into the no column
4133300 we were counting on this bill as a funding mechanism for hundreds of projects needed to recover salmon
4133301 in spite of our successful efforts to move the bill through the assembly and two senate committees in the end we were outgunned by the intense lobbying of the water contractors and the administration the bill is dead for this year
4133302 we are excited about establishing certium and believe this new structure will improve our ability to deliver diversified risk controlled options that can be aligned with our clients preference for risk

4133333 the most important part of these activities was the face to face interaction
4133334 this is the first time google has got involved with any sort of one to one activity so the interaction needed to be relevant to the audience and the brand
4133335 the demonstrations really seem to have been the key to this

4133360 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
4133361 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
4133362 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
4133363 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
4133364 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4133365 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4133366 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4133367 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4133368 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4133369 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4133370 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4133371 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
4133372 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

4133381 services that are respectful of and responsive to the cultural and linguistic needs of the patient
4133382 cultural competence is defined as a set of congruent behaviors attitudes and policies that come together in a system agency or among professionals and enables that system agency or those professionals to work effectively in cross cultural situations
4133383 cultural competence is in essence a bureaucratic weapon cultural competence or rather your presumed lack thereof is what you will be clobbered with if you are imprudent enough to challenge or merely to have qualms about affirmative action diversity and multiculturalism as those principles are now espoused by their most fervent academic advocates
4133384 understanding of the complexities of race power gender class sexual orientation and privilege in american society
4133385 mr swan has revealed opinions that have caused me great concern in the areas of race gender sexual orientation and privilege
4133386 the facultys ideological imbalance has allowed three factors a new accreditation policy changes in how students are evaluated and curricular orientation around a theme of social justice to impose a de facto political litmus test on the next cohort of public school teachers
4133387 unit assessments must also reflect the dispositions identified in its conceptual framework and in professional and state standards for example if the unit has described its vision for teacher preparation as teachers as agents of change and has indicated that a commitment to social justice is one disposition it expects of teachers who can become agents of change then it is expected that unit assessments include some measure of a candidates commitment to social justice
4133388 more global than national and concerned with ideals such as world peace social justice respect for diversity and preservation of the environment
4133389 education is our prime vehicle for creating the just society
4133390 we are preparing citizens to lead productive lives in a democratic society characterized by social justice
4133391 entails actively challenging the status quo one table noted the need to incorporate institutionalized notions of power privilege and oppression into the definition thus for many cultural competence is transformative and political
4133392 revise rules to achieve high cultural standards including possible revocation of licensure for culturally incompetent behavior
4133393 a quiet effort by state officials to require that all newly certified oregon teachers be culturally competent looks to be dead on arrival in the republican controlled house despite firm support from education advocates
4133394 t he teachers standards and practices commission and the oregon department of education are backtracking saying they really didnt mean it then why is it in the definition and the five year plan and on the commissions web site
4133395 board of education president dean juntunen made an appeal monday for homeschoolers to enroll their children in the ontonagon area school district juntunen explained that due to a loss of student population this year and inadequate state funding we will be using up our financial cushion

4133441 it seems a lot of people have waited a long time to tell a game developer the answer to this question
4133442 this was expected but whereas many pirates who debate the issue online are often abusive and aggressive on the topic most of the drm complaints were reasonable and well put
4133443 people dont like drm we knew that but the extent to which drm is turning away people who have no other complaints is possibly misunderstood if you wanted to change one thing to get more pirates to buy games scrapping drm is it these gamers are the low hanging fruit of this whole debate
4133444 ive read enough otherwise honest people complain about drm to see that its probably hurting more than it helps i had planned on using the same system for kudos 2 but ive changed my mind on that i have also removed it from democracy 2 today i now use no drm at all

4133733 we left 12 men on base we had all kinds of chances to win the game and we couldnt get it done i dont have to say nothing to them on a night like this i dont have to say a word
4133734 however we will have a pretty dramatic turnover of staff
4133735 and the reason for that is that metro employees had an option to go with united neighborhood or to stay with the metro health department and almost all of them have chosen to stay with metro health
4133736 and so as part of the strategic planning the department looked to see whether there were community partners that are willing and able to provide services to the homeless and if those organizations would be a better match
4133737 united neighborhood health services was that community partner and the organization was very interested in applying for the federal grant that the downtown clinic traditionally gets
4133738 for instance it would be wonderful to make some major building changes here and add space
4133739 if we had a benefactor who wanted to spend 1 million to expand the building that would be great that wouldnt happen with government funding
4133740 housing and wrap around services have to go hand in hand
4133741 one of the places where we house several clients requires a background check and therefore some consumers are not eligible for that facility
4133742 and many of our clients do not have income to apply with individual property owners who may not run background checks
4133743 so safe affordable permanent housing continues to be an issue
4133744 many times people have spent so many years living outside that they really have no idea how to cook anything they dont know how to keep things clean they dont know the rules
4133745 sometimes when they first get into housing it takes daily trips to teach them life skills in addition to the coordination of all needed services
4133746 some agencies have on site staff others bring staff in at certain points in time
4133747 this database system will allow our citys service providers to better serve the homeless by accurately identifying the homeless in nashville and more importantly identifying what they need to get back on their feet
4133748 certainly i wish we could do more but in tight financial times an investment like this which will maximize the resources already in hand makes all the more sense
4133749 thanks to the mayors support of our proposal to designate a person who does nothing else other than hmis a new hmis systems administrator has been hired
4133750 her mandate is to oversee a user friendly system that can eventually provide us the data and information to successfully monitor every single case start to finish
4133751 a homeless person comes in for services we record those services we can better analyze gaps in services to figure out what people need and how to better serve them
4133752 i hope eventually in the next five years we would be able to lessen the hardship that homelessness causes
4133753 and eventually hopefully we can get to a point where it doesnt exist but we have to take it one step at a time
4133754 even though theyre homeless theyre still individuals and theyre still people
4133755 sometimes ill do both to see if things match up
4133756 is a very nice cemetery and they have agreed to work with us until such time that metro government can secure land for a burial site
4133757 they have a right to be buried as a veteran so if that is information that needs to be checked then that needs to be done
4133758 we have had on occasion clergy who know an individual and wish to say some words at the gravesite
4133759 might say a few words before the casket is actually lowered into the ground
4133760 ensuring that there is respect and dignity for the individual being buried
4133761 but there is really nothing that provides that clear cut picture of whether an individual is homeless
4133762 i d s because there is nothing you can do without them
4133763 i often meet people who want to help but dont know how to get involved project homeless connect offers them that opportunity
4133764 in the cities that are participating in project homeless connect across our country it begins with the political will of the mayor
4133765 whats interesting about may is that this was during the time of the federal stimulus package
4133766 people were still receiving their stimulus checks and many had just gotten their tax refunds and we still had that many calls its unbelievable
4133767 sometimes were able to help our customers negotiate with their landlords
4133768 for the majority of people who receive rooftop help if they dont get this they end up homeless
4133769 were finding so many people in so much need in this community and its gratifying that congregations are coming together and are able to work together on this common problem
4133770 on the other hand we only have 28 congregations at this point and we have over 600 congregations in nashville
4133771 a dog keeps away possums coons rats and other critters that might carry rabies or diseases into a homeless camp
4133772 i wouldnt go to the shelter even in cold weather because i couldnt take rodeo with me we stuck together through everything
4133773 she does everything on a volunteer basis and she doesnt want any recognition for the good shes doing
4133774 what is more she pays for all the procedures out of her own pocket
4133775 i dare say that if youve got over 5 000 homeless individuals in your system youve got to know there are way more
4133776 we are actually reviewing iphones from a hsbc group perspective and when i say that i mean globally
4133777 a decision on a piece of hardware like that would potentially be deployed conservatively to 200 000 people
4133778 you know its a big decision especially when you have an existing fleet out there
4133779 but its definitely something we are considering from a hsbc group perspective
4133780 we always explore the potential application of new technologies and this is no different
4133781 no i dont i think the iphone would change some underlying infrastructure considerations from an enterprise perspective but apple have been pretty smart with the design

4133785 unnecessarily evil reclaiming the morality of abortion and the overdue change to the democratic platform
4133786 the democratic party strongly and unequivocally supports roe v wade and a womans right to choose a safe and legal abortion regardless of ability to pay and we oppose any and all efforts to weaken or undermine that right

4133822 one can forget about any talk about georgias territorial integrity because i believe it is impossible to persuade south ossetia and abkhazia to agree with the logic that they can be forced back into the georgian state
4133823 het lijkt erop dat jean marie dedecker de brusselse vlamingen als pasmunt wil gebruiken in de interinstitutionele dialoog en dit nog voor de onderhandelingen goed en wel zijn begonnen

4133826 because the soldiers dont pay a dime our waiver of the fees amounts to a discount to the military not a discount to soldiers
4133827 soldiers should not have to pay a penny of it
4133828 dont forget opposition by the mighty bicycle pedestrian and livable streets lobbies
4133829 and in regards to breaking the law i mean the smpd not the cyclists if the police dept doesnt
4133830 there really need to be statutes on the books that state precisely why and how level of

4133832 in the warm up i felt rubbish i did a couple of sprints and felt amazing so i thought it was going to be brilliant then i dived in and felt awful again i dont have any excuses
4133833 happiness does not heal but happiness protects against falling ill
4133834 the idea that there is a state called happiness and that we can dependably figure out what it feels like and how to measure it is extremely subversive
4133835 deep economy the wealth of communities and the durable future
4133836 it allows economists to start thinking about life in richer terms to stop asking what did you buy and to start asking is your life good
4133837 for the time being we know that happiness fosters physical health but not precisely how
4133838 chronic unhappiness activates the fight flight response which is known to involve harmful effects in the long run such as higher blood pressure and a lower immune response
4133839 if we feel unhealthy we go to a medical general practitioner

4133843 the industry has changed and sir richard should focus on his business and move with the times
4133844 we now have open skies and every airline in europe and every airline in the united states is free to fly from anywhere in europe to anywhere in the united states and that includes heathrow so its a very changed environment now
4133845 i dont see this as a matter of survival but as two strong companies coming together
4133846 the fire protection features had not been completed yet we dont know how the fire started fire and police officials will determine that over the course of the week the open type of construction it was like a lumber yard essentially
4133847 i see a bunch of flames from the construction site its all plywood at that point and the whole thing you know within minutes of me standing there and watching it just went completely up in flames
4133848 it looked like probably the largest fire ive ever seen in my life
4133849 i would tell you that this is more than a shocking afternoon for me
4133850 i like looked out my window and i saw the whole thing was engulfed in flames and basically i just grabbed my dog and i ran down the stairs i didnt think at all i mean with the amount of fire trucks that were here i thought everything was going to be ok i did not think that my building was going to catch on fire thats why i brought nothing nothing not even a wallet
4133851 sheer horror that i have nothing but whats on my back ive never experienced anything like this before
4133852 we lost everything i mean our bed our couch everything that we had together i mean weve only been there for three months but everything is gone
4133853 i took my car and got it away from the building went across the railroad tracks to the other side and watched my building eventually get burned up
4133854 rosie actually saw the smoke out the window and sort of started tapping on it so i looked out and saw flames sort of higher than the buildings and ran down stairs with her grab my purse
4133855 shes always been the baby and now the baby was having a baby
4133856 the matter with mayor kilpatrick is dragging down the business and the hopes of the city
4133857 we strongly urge the mayor to step aside and address his problems

4133862 every time someone visited a facebook beacon activated affiliates website and performed a pre defined action that action triggered a script that set the beacon program into action the beacon script contacted facebook notifying facebook of the event or action taking place at the facebook beacon activated affiliates website
4133863 the beacon program was not designed to obtain any consent and indeed did not obtain any consent prior to the communication of identifying transactional information to facebook by the time any user was notified that facebook was at a minimum an observing party to the transaction and that facebook was asking for an approval to publicly broadcast identifying information regarding the event personally identifying information had already been communicated to facebook
4133864 the beacon program sent information regarding specific user transactions on facebook beacon activated affiliates websites to facebook regardless of whether the user was a facebook member or not thus no consent was sought nor was any consent obtained from persons who utilize the facebook beacon activated affiliates website who were not facebook members thus non facebook persons who utilized the facebook beacon activated affiliate websites were not told that their transaction and indeed every transaction they engaged in upon the website was being communicated to a third party facebook with whom they had norelationship whatsoever
4133865 what made the beacon program distinguishable from other forms of website interaction was the way in which a website that was not open in a users browser in this case facebook com had become actively involved in the exchange between a user and a third party website beacon utilized cookies to obtain information from the users computer
4133866 if the user was not a facebook member facebook still obtained the notification from the facebook beacon activated affiliate facebook then undertook the same action of theoretically generating a pop up on the facebook beacon activated affiliate website however the iframe was slightly modified it was a ghost iframe so called because the information was rendered transparent and the viewer did not see anything but the same data was still sent to facebook and facebook still responded and interacted with the facebook beacon activated affiliates website with respect to the users transaction
4133867 the proffer to obtain that consent made to the user was wholly inadequate uninformed misleading untimely and deceptive it was
4133868 consent it was uninformed because the pop up did not explain or specify how which or through what means the information concerning the transaction at the facebook beacon activated affiliate website would be broadcast both to facebook and to the facebook users friends list it was misleading because it implied that the user was given some control over information to be communicated when in fact no such control was offered or available to the user it was untimely because by the time the pop up asked for consent to communicate transactional information the transactional information had already been communicated it was deceptive because in almost every instance the information sharing was contrary to the stated privacy policies of the facebook website and every other facebook beacon activated affiliate that had signed up for the program
4133869 he looked serene i raised his eyelids and it was clear from his pupils that he had a massive brain injury we lifted him from the cockpit and laid him on the ground as we did he sighed and although i am totally agnostic i felt his soul depart at that moment
4133870 the white population is older and very much centered around the aging baby boomers who are well past their high fertility years
4133871 the future of america is epitomized by the young people today they are basically the melting pot we are going to see in the future
4133872 people are upset when you live next to a person with a huge trailer in their driveway i think thats something we should look at
4133873 as long as its not one of those mickey mouse tugboats i dont have a feeling about it
4133874 it is strange that handicapped persons are getting reservation in teaching jobs but they are not given such preferential treatment in non teaching jobs
4133875 once you are aware of the full record in this case i am certain that you will agree that this young man should not be in prison
4133876 made it very clear that he would not plead to an assault charge of any kind
4133877 we would have certainly negotiated something else if they would have been willing to admit some responsibility but they never were
4133878 it would kind of be an insult to the system to not have at least an assault conviction out of this
4133879 mike was hit three times in the chest before he reacted he left the scene of the party
4133880 i dont know what else mike could have done to avoid the situation
4133881 what the defendant failed to do however was to retreat from the house or walk away and call the police about the disturbance
4133882 because of his failure to take these steps the court cannot find that the self defense justification is available to permit the striking of jake
4133883 hes frustrated and hes bored because he cant understand why hes there for defending himself

4133888 the fire protection features had not been completed yet we dont know how the fire started fire and police officials will determine that over the course of the week the open type of construction it was like a lumber yard essentially

4133909 law of attraction cant distinguish between past present or imagined events and it doesnt keep score

4133918 this year saw the purchase of a lot of new gear studio cameras video switcher graphics generator and weather presentation and ajas fs1 converter is the glue that keeps all of that working together
4133919 we get feeds from a variety of sources satellite network and everything else you can think of and the fs1 can handle it all
4133920 we instantly started referring to the fs1 as our can opener because it does everything
4133921 the fs1 allows us to do just about anything we can up convert down convert add wings and even translate in closed caption which is huge sometimes well get incoming feeds that are not in hd and when they go out on air they either have to be in hd or be closed captioned the fs1 allows us to cross convert the captioning up to hd and from hd down to sd its all built into the same box and all for one price
4133922 the wiring is relatively simple we were able to mount them on a studio rack cable them up and lock them to our in house sync generator with no problems whats more ajas customer service is incredibly responsive and the few questions we did have were all answered within a couple of hours the fs1 is a reasonably priced box offering all around usefulness such as embedded audio analog and decoding that in other systems would require multiple boxes and thats a very big deal
4133923 with 158 breeds registered by the akc each with its own unique temperament coat type size energy level and appearance we felt the obamas interest in getting a dog was an opportunity to underscore the many factors that go into deciding whether to acquire a dog and into determining what characteristics match your lifestyle so that a successful match can be made
4133924 every family is unique but for the obamas who have a daughter with allergies a hypoallergenic breed with a very consistent and predictable coat is crucial this factor informed our choices first and foremost but we also chose dogs that have affable temperaments
4133925 its no surprise that presidents and other politicians love their dogs dogs give unconditional love and can even help reduce stress levels
4133926 and from an image standpoint nothing humanizes a candidate more than seeing him lovingly dote on his pet
4133927 the fbis disclosure that its agents secretly sought and obtained the phone records of american newspaper reporters confirms once again that there are insufficient safeguards on the agencys use of national security letters and other intrusive surveillance tools there arent enough controls inside the agency and there arent enough checks from outside the agency especially dangerous is the fbis power to impose gag orders on those ordered to disclose information these gag orders which are often unnecessary and almost always overbroad invite abuse
4133928 there continues to be reluctance on the part of both patients and treating physicians to accept the toxicity of platinum based therapy given the associated small gain in survival so active therapies with improved toxicity profiles are clearly needed

4133950 many pet owners are unaware of the serious danger leptospirosis poses to dogs or that any dog that spends time outdoors could be susceptible
4133951 i encourage all dog owners to speak with their veterinarian about this disease as it can be prevented through vaccination
4133952 as the risks of leptospirosis continue to increase so does the need for education especially among dog owners who may not be aware leptospirosis is not only a threat to their dog but to their family as well

4133954 gambling was a major issue that year in alabama and nationally then gov don siegelman was campaigning again on bringing a lottery to alabama the alabama legislature was considering proposals to operate video gambling machines at the states dog tracks the poarch creek indians were expanding their gaming operations in alabama and congress was debating ways to crack down on internet gambling
4133955 definitely want riley to shut down the poarch creek operation including his announcing that anyone caught gambling there cant qualify for a state contract or something like that
4133956 consistently opposed gambling before he decided to run and as such anyone who would suggest his long standing opposition to gambling is tied to anything other than personal conviction would be mistaken
4133957 to prevent the poarch creek indians from building casinos in alabama
4133958 we already knew reed was a hypocrite claiming to be anti gambling while working on behalf of tribal casinos so it shouldnt be such a surprise that he is willing to hold a fundraiser for the man he blames for his loss in the georgia lieutenant governors race
4133959 ipass is the established market leader for global enterprise mobility and was our obvious choice when looking for a partner in this field
4133960 enterprises need to cater for the requirements of a very heterogeneous group of mobile workers and for ipass to be able to offer various access technologies including a choice of mobile broadband networks in japan will help meet these requirements we are looking forward to working with ipass and equipping its customers with high speed mobile broadband communications provided by our mvno service with two distinctive mobile networks in japan
4133961 this partnership with iij one of japans leading mvnos will further solidify the mobile broadband presence of ipass in the critical japanese market
4133962 some of the worlds largest companies count on ipass to keep their users connected regardless of their location with multiple nationwide mobile broadband services and over 27 000 wi fi hotspots in asia alone we can offer business users a unique combination of coverage simplicity and affordability
4133963 the economic benefits it will bring to halton and the surrounding area are almost four times greater than the cost of the project
4133964 wind and other renewables are becoming an integral part of the diverse power generation mix necessary to meet our customers electricity needs
4133965 adding these renewable generation resources along with our plans for new baseload generation using clean coal and other technologies positions us to continue to meet our customers needs while also reducing our carbon footprint
4133966 the agreement with beech ridge energy brings our long term renewable energy purchase commitments up to 422 megawatts in the year since we established our 1 000 megawatt goal
4133967 we have additional requests for proposals out for up to 600 megawatts of renewable energy so we are well on the way to meeting that goal
4133968 when you add our wind capabilities that were in place prior to the establishment of the goal 310 megawatts of wind generation in texas owned by aep and 367 megawatts of long term wind energy purchase agreements in texas and oklahoma its clear that our energy portfolio now includes a significant amount of renewable energy
4133969 this is our third long term agreement for wind energy but its the first with a wind farm located in the states served by appalachian power
4133970 the agreement to purchase power from a wind generation facility located in west virginia is an important development for the state and for our company it aligns with a commitment to renewable energy made by west virginia gov joe manchin in a speech last week and with legislation signed by virginia gov tim kaine last year
4133971 we all talk to people who talk to people and there are people close to the obama campaign in the course of conversations who made clear to me that there was very high level discussions the obama people expect powell to endorse him

4134018 some of the plans they are making will have a major impact on the lives of thousands of people who live in the area
4134019 im involved because as one of the churches here in the delta were very concerned about our members and the whole community
4134020 i think the peripheral canal will be a disaster for the delta long term and im going to fight them
4134021 im presenting that as the view that i think other people should hold
4134022 theyre trying to put out a rational plan that doesnt hurt agriculture and restores some of the fish habitat weve lost i dont see anything wrong in that
4134023 weve got people in the delta who farm they fish they play and they need to be included

4134034 its something ive never experienced swimming two different races in the same day especially coming off such a big final
4134035 but i think i coped well got through the heats well and got a lot more in store for tomorrow
4134036 but if you dont believe youre going to swim fast and you can do it just dont come out and swim because youre not going to give yourself a chance
4134037 you cant hold back in the semis especially the 50
4134038 its probably going to be 0 1 between the top eight its going to be ridiculously fast
4134039 the last couple of weeks weve had a string of shootings and theyve all involved bulldogs in one way or another theyve either been targets of a rival gang or theyve initiated these shootings the last one unfortunately a person was killed

4134062 quando la carta mi tagli il dito lo alzai per esaminare il danno dalla ferita invisibile colava una minuscola goccia di sangue poi accadde tutto molto velocemente edward si lanci verso di me scagliandomi dallaltra parte del tavolo ero caduta vicino al pianoforte gettando le braccia in avanti per proteggermi in mezzo alle schegge di vetro affilate dal polso al gomito ormai il dolore minvadeva acuto e bruciante confusa e disorientata cercai di non badare al rosso vivo del sangue che mi colava dal braccio e incrociai gli sguardi eccitati di sei vampiri improvvisamente famelici
4134063 nel silenzio assoluto unintuizione improvvisa rimise ogni dettaglio al suo posto cera qualcosa di cui edward non aveva voluto parlarmi qualcosa che jacob non mi avrebbe tenuta nascosta qualcosa che aveva attirato i cullen e i lupi nella foresta e li aveva fatti avvicinare pericolosamente tuttavia stavo aspettando proprio quel momento lo temevo ed ero pronta ad affrontarlo malgrado desiderassi con tutta me stessa che non arrivasse mai ma i miei guai non potevano aver fine vero

4134080 en nu ben ik alweer bezig met de dagelijkse bezigheden zoals boodschappen doen ik heb de bus gereden die de fietsers begeleidde met de tassen en de voorraden de tocht was voor mij een grote uitdaging ik wilde dit altijd al een keer doen
4134081 we reden tussen 90 en 110 kilometer per dag op vlak terrein was dat goed te doen
4134082 in polen had je nog campings maar die lagen niet langs de route in rusland waren er helemaal geen campings meer maar we hadden het grote geluk dat we contacten hadden via de ipa de internationale politieorganisatie die mensen hebben heel veel voor ons gedaan zo hadden we politiebegeleiding door heel rusland tot aan de grens met mongoli
4134083 we hadden een voorraad maar dat was vooral drinkwater een tank van 200 liter met zuiveringssysteem in de woestijn van mongoli was het vijftig graden voor vijf fietsers was het traject daar te zwaar zij zijn met de trein naar de grens met china gereden de rest is doorgefietst maar had minstens acht liter water per dag nodig
4134084 dat viel reuze mee we hadden zes lekke banden verder na een valpartij een kapot schakelmechanisme maar de fietsen hebben het prima gedaan
4134085 heel apart we mochten van de chinese autoriteiten peking eigenlijk niet met de auto in er zijn vijf ringwegen rond die enorme stad met hulp van de ambassade en politiecontacten konden we met de auto tot de tweede ring komen de fietsers zijn helemaal naar de ambassade gereden daar zijn ze onthaald door onder anderen prins willem alexander

4134119 the united states took a series of steps that emboldened georgia sending advisers to build up the georgian military including an exercise last month with more than 1 000 american troops pressing hard to bring georgia into the nato orbit
4134120 it is curious but not surprising how the bush administration and its allies have now found renewed respect for international law in the caucasus but not when it comes to 1 the united states invading afghanistan and iraq while threatening to attack iran 2 israel invading lebanon and palestine attacking syria and threatening to attack iran 3 ethiopia invading somalia 4 colombia attacking ecuador etc from an international law perspective the real issue here is whether during her trip to tbilisi a month ago u s secretary of state rice gave the proverbial green light to georgia to attack south ossetia and thus deliberately provoke an overreaction by russia and how does this fit in with the u s u k naval armada currently steaming for the persian gulf and possible military confrontation with iran over its right to engage in nuclear enrichment under the nuclear non proliferation treaty
4134121 i am above all astounded by the mainstream medias failure to take proper note of the pipeline geopolitics that infuses the russian moves with their global significance
4134122 at the same time it pales in significance if compared to analogous u s behavior especially the 2003 unprovoked and unlawful aggression against iraq at this point what is needed in georgia is for the russians to withdraw and for the un to establish a peacekeeping presence in south ossetia and abkhasia capable of protecting the human rights and autonomy of these two societal entities until some sort of internationally monitored referendum can serve as the basis for self determination in both places to revive cold war rhetoric of the free world in relation to georgia as bush did in his statement on the crisis is one more instance of monumental irresponsibility by the president and orwellian in its implication that georgia was a democracy respectful of human rights

4134126 a critical part of cirms success relies on creating a broad foundation of scientists and clinicians who are committed to stem cell research and who are committed to delivering stem cell therapies to patients without californias funding the gap in federal funding would eliminate an entire generation of new clinicians and scientists
4134127 the average age for a physician scientist to receive their first grant from the national institutes of health is now 43 years old who would dedicate their life to a field where they could not have a chance to prove the value of their ideas until they were 43
4134128 we expect these awards to play a significant role in changing the career trajectory of funded researchers encouraging talented young investigators to pursue careers in stem cell research

4134159 the uk made a decision some time back to not enter the euro and for parts of this decade that decision looked to be paying off as it was held up as a shining example of a economic powerhouse in europe however things are starting to go a bit wrong lately the economy is slowing uk consumers are mired in debt the housing bubble which is now starting to burst rivals and on some measurements is actually worse than the us situation and inflation is rife on the last point recent inflation figures put the retail price index at 5 higher than the bank interest rates this is the first time since the early eighties that has happened in addition its unlikely the boe bank of england is in a position to rise rates to combat inflation which would also strengthen the pound due to the impact this would have on borrowers and the wider economy

4134203 la votaci n de este domingo fue el mayor desaf o que ha enfrentado la gesti n de morales
4134204 para ser confirmado en su cargo el presidente necesita un m nimo del 53 7 de los sufragios el porcentaje que logr en las elecciones de 2005 mientras que los prefectos deben obtener la mitad m s uno de los votos
4134205 tambi n fueron confirmados en sus puestos cinco de los ocho prefectos que se sometieron a la votaci n mientras tres deber n abandonar sus labores
4134206 el pueblo chiquitano ejerci su derecho ciudadano y fue a votar masivamente en el refer ndum ahora tenemos como un desaf o grande la aprobaci n y puesta en vigencia de la nueva constituci n pol tica del estado donde se reconocen varias de nuestras demandas y que de una vez se respeten nuestros derechos como pueblos ind genas
4134207 este domingo 10 de agosto durante el refer ndum revocatorio en el cant n de santa rosa de la roca municipio de san ignacio de velasco nuestros hermanos y hermanas que asistieron a votar y participar como delegados para vigilar la transparencia de la consulta fueron insultados y expulsados del lugar de votaci n por los miembros del comit c vico
4134208 un grupo de c vicos que apoyan al prefecto de santa cruz comenzaron a amedrentar a nuestros compa eros y compa eras ind genas para que voten a favor del prefecto e incluso los amenazaron para que muestren la papeleta de votaci n para saber por qui n votaban
4134209 vamos a denunciar este hecho a todo el pa s y ante la organizaci n estados americanos oea para que sepan que en la chiquitania cada vez hay menos democracia pues por pensar diferente o defender los derechos empiezan a perseguir y amenazar a nuestros hermanos ind genas
4134210 nosotros creemos que esta situaci n de persecuci n va a continuar y por eso tenemos que denunciar lo que pasa y exigir a las autoridades que hagan cumplir la ley nosotros lo nico que hacemos es ejercer nuestros derechos reconocidos por la constituci n y la leyes de bolivia
4134211 que nuevamente el estado de chile a trav s de su pol tica de represi n hace caso omiso de los derechos y garant as carcelarias justamente ganadas por nuestros weichafe en su categor a de presos pol ticos quienes han liderado importantes procesos de lucha de nuestro pueblo y que hoy en d a se encuentran injustamente encarcelados

4134213 entre 2006 y 2008 registramos diez allanamientos del tipo que vivimos durante la dictadura 1973 1990 con helic pteros con fuerzas combinadas con violencia al interior de las casas golpeando a la gente rompiendo enseres dom sticos puertas
4134214 se ha instalado un contingente de carabineros al interior de predios forestales resguardando el patrimonio privado
4134215 al escuchar por las noches los frecuentes disparos que realizan los polic as en el camino p blico del sector el cual atraviesa las propias comunidades
4134216 esta violencia puede hacernos perder el raciocinio y de ah las consecuencias pueden ser fatales
4134217 hay un uso excesivo de la facultad de los fiscales que han ordenado el ingreso de funcionarios de fuerzas especiales y del grupo de operaciones especiales
4134218 de mantenerse esta l gica lo m s probable es que vamos a cosechar desgracias
4134219 en nuestro pa s han sido declarados enemigos los j venes que expresan su descontento por la ausencia de perspectivas de futuro los estudiantes que se oponen a la mercantilizaci n de la educaci n los trabajadores sindicalizados que luchan por condiciones laborales dignas y los mapuches que exigen la restituci n de sus tierras ancestrales
4134220 aceptaron la herencia del sistema pinochetista al comienzo por fuerza mayor pero se dieron cuenta que es m s f cil gobernar dentro de un sistema casi dictatorial que dentro de un sistema democr tico donde los gobernantes tienen que justificar sus acciones
4134221 no podemos comparar y lo digo yo que viv muy de cerca recibiendo testimonios durante la dictadura hoy hay un estado de derecho que funciona hay canales para presentar denuncias la gente puede interponer acciones en los tribunales
4134222 el esp ritu del gobierno no es reprimir las manifestaciones sino dejar espacio para la participacion de la ciudadan a y se han dado m ltiples permisos para actividades en la calle
4134223 esper bamos otra actitud del gobierno porque consider bamos a la presidenta bachelet como una militante de los derechos humanos
4134224 pensamos que el aumento de la represi n va paralelo a ese aumento de la organizaci n popular que lleva a que los movimientos sociales empiecen a luchar por sus derechos
4134225 me da mucha rabia que una manifestaci n de 50 personas portando s lo carteles sea disuelta por 200 carabineros en tres minutos
4134226 la argentina depende fundamentalmente del campo y de lo que sucede en el campo
4134227 esta situaci n viene d ndose hace mucho tiempo atr s y se les ha notificado y dado tiempo para realizar los cambios correspondientes pero ellos s lo han respondido con promesas incumplidas es por eso que anunciamos que estamos dispuestos a recuperar nuestra escuela y se hace el llamado a todas las instituciones mapuche presente en el wall mapu ha colaborar en este proceso
4134228 somos capaces porque somos dignos y orgullosos de cuidar y defender la tierra en qu vivimos no le robamos ni le quitamos nada a nadie para existir en nuestra comunidad pero quienes est n robando son las empresas extranjeras que con nuestros recursos naturales se est n llevando grandes utilidades
4134229 todav a estoy presa pero siento que de alguna manera se est abriendo la justicia y espero que se cumpla lo que tiene que ser lo real la libertad tiene que llegar porque aqu no hay nada que tenga que ver con esos asaltos y la verdad sigo pensando que hay todo un sistema extra o que todav a no logro entender
4134230 no es el camino de justicia que debe haber en chile
4134231 fuck what you think only what i think catherine thinks and my family thinks matters

4134234 no queremos que sea una firma m s de la que muchos han firmado sino que nos preocuparemos d a a d a hora tras hora de que este convenio pueda llegar a su etapa final lo que se recupere aqu no es para hacerlo picadillo de cebolla sino que ser algo hist rico para el pueblo mapuche
4134235 hemos recuperado la totalidad del espacio que ocupaba la fuerza a rea y estamos con la parte t cnica con nuestros asesores que es el observatorio de derechos de pueblos ind genas y con los ejecutivos del gobierno regional para avanzar metro a metro y ac no poemos hablar de bicentenario sino de reinvindicaci n y reconocimiento de nuestros territorios
4134236 la culminaci n de un proceso de conversaci n de dialogo que hemos desarrollado y que ha tenido muchas vivisitudes en el camino los anuncios de la presidenta el 1 de abril son los caminos para dar respuestas a las necesidades que tienen nuestros pueblos
4134237 que quisieramos iniciar con todas las comunidades de nuestro pa s la presidenta bachelet nos ha se alado que este es el camino y las comunidades de maquehue nos enorgullesen porque han entendido y hecho efectiva esta invitaci n estos hechos que parecen peque os van marcando nuestra historia este convenio contiene una serie de iniciativas de inversi n donde nos comprometemos la administraci n p blica los servicios a cumplir los anuncios de la presidenta de este nuevo pacto por el re conocer en este convenio se conjugan valores de participaci n de respeto de sensibilidad social y de compensaci n con los pueblos originarios de la deuda hist rica que tenemos como sociedad
4134238 hoy en las palabras de la propia intendenta el t rmino compensacion fue utilizada y el propio convenio habla de la demanda de recuperaci n territorial

4134243 nuestras investigaciones han establecido que el personal de seguridad de barrick ingres a las aldeas locales usando rifles de alta potencia tipo m16 y dispararon contra los pobladores inofensivos
4134244 la gente ha hecho quitar todos de sus huertas y jardines ahora est viviendo al lado de la descarga de residuos de la mina y buscan el oro ya que no tiene ninguna otra manera de ganarse la vida
4134245 esta situaci n est alcanzando su punto de crisis y barrick gold no est tomando ninguna acci n responsable la soluci n es clara las situaciones econ micas y sociales de la gente local rodeadas por la basura y la contaminaci n atmosf rica son atroces

4134250 our findings so far do not in any way confirm the russian statistics
4134251 the torching of houses in these villages is in some ways a result of the massive russia propaganda machine which constantly repeats claims of genocide and exaggerates the casualties
4134252 by day five of a conflict one expects that there is some kind of list of the dead and injured but here there is no information nothing
4134253 i think it is a bit far fetched to always try to seek out a relationship
4134254 we are actually reviewing iphones from a hsbc group perspective and when i say that i mean globally
4134255 a decision on a piece of hardware like that would potentially be deployed conservatively to 200 000 people
4134256 you know its a big decision especially when you have an existing fleet out there
4134257 but its definitely something we are considering from a hsbc group perspective
4134258 we always explore the potential application of new technologies and this is no different
4134259 no i dont i think the iphone would change some underlying infrastructure considerations from an enterprise perspective but apple have been pretty smart with the design

4134263 would you rather offend the waiter or the cook by being picky or would you rather offend your heart
4134264 i dont know why more places dont do cold soup
4134265 and such a good idea when people are not looking for a heavy meal
4134266 but if you use cold soup as part of a dish it sets them at ease

4134268 the estimated co2 emissions of the average immigrant legal or illegal in the united states are 18 percent less than those of the average native born american however immigrants in the united states produce an estimated four times more co2 in the united states as they would have in their countries of origin
4134269 he has a 10 hour flight to get here and probably wont be here until friday so wont be playing against rangers
4134270 we feed them every couple of days a pink liquid with nutrients not too dissimilar to what the olympians might drink for energy it keeps the neurons alive and allows them to grow within twenty four hours they make connections within a week there is a brain like activity if you stimulate one electrode you get spontaneous firing we then use that basic operation by linking it up to the robot body
4134271 one of the things we could look to do is to put sound in and get sound out which essentially means communicating theres no reason why we cant do that and i see that as something what it will mean to the neuron culture by putting audio in and getting different audio out is that it would allow us to whistle to it and teach it in some way to respond back
4134272 simply from the habit of doing things repetitively the neuron connections strengthen and allow the robot to be able to do it more accurately in terms of teaching the cells to do more that is part of the research can we get it to improve by applying different voltage and chemicals and things
4134273 we are doing that now applying chemicals to part of the brain structure so that it stops growing and the neurons will die off and then see if the actions the robot has been doing are taken over so its like looking at what happens in a stroke
4134274 can the brain learn to do things it used to do how can it learn to do the things it used to do the key thing is as we understand things a bit more is to put it into different positions or a particular situation and teach it so that we can see how the memory of what to do in that situation is constructed in the brain by the connection
4134275 there is no danger we are going to change the way we play our football it is the only way we can play and we dont know any other way
4134276 we have not played in any games since i have come here where we have set up in what i think to be a negative defensive way
4134277 we have a group of players here that are proper footballers and that is what we will continue
4134278 this is only the first of four decisions that has to be made before a drink is purchased on sunday
4134279 first we have to decide whether or not to let the public make the decision second the voters will have to decide if they want to pass the referendum or not third the business owners will have to decide whether or not to purchase a permit and fourth the individual patron will have to decide to purchase a drink
4134280 whats the benefit to the city if were talking about two restaurants
4134281 there isnt a lot to choose from to eat on sunday
4134282 with us trying to build downtown around town square and the museum were going to have to do this to stay competitive with florence and georgetown a lot of people go to georgetown on sunday just so they can have a drink with their meal
4134283 if florence passes it the only option will be to go out of the city we need to keep that money from leaking out of town and entice people to spend the money in lake city
4134284 youre asking people to go to two restraints on sunday
4134285 if were going to do it we need to get some revenue from it and not just do it to be doing it
4134286 as the old saying goes it might put some of your bootleggers out of business
4134287 if people are going to drink on sunday theyre going to drink on sunday
4134288 ive gotten calls on this and the biggest concern seems to be the message this sends to our youth
4134289 the idea of keeping the sabbath holy has fallen through the cracks and is no longer being done
4134290 if they agree with us theyll approve it if not they wont
4134291 i dont want to sound like im selling our sunday for money but you do pass the offering plate in church
4134292 i looked at the pros and cons and looked at the businesses in lake city and weighed the economy verses the sabbath day and i just couldnt bring myself to vote for it
4134293 id lost to him eight nine 10 50 times i dont know how many but i had the feeling it could be my day

4134347 we had a high school exchange student from germany for three weeks and wanted to show her as much as possible

4134540 we may be nearing the bottom of the property market its not certain when the turn will come but at least we will have bottomed out
4134541 this is momentous for both the economy and the man in the street
4134542 an additional rate hike would have potentially tipped the balance
4134543 our property prices should remain static for the next year
4134544 all we are saying at this stage is that the police helicopter was out moments after the explosion the less we say about our operations the better
4134545 those guys realised they were finished some of them stuffed money into their shirts obviously trying to get away with something
4134546 the suspects suddenly stopped and tried to run away from the bakkie all six were arrested

4134551 we at lts saw a global need for a better more efficient and cost effective system for tracing food contamination worldwide
4134552 from tainted crops to counterfeit pharmaceuticals lives are lost each year not to mention billions of dollars in revenue stratatrace is the most flexible and affordable food safety tool available to brand owners giving them outstanding return on their investment
4134553 the flexibility and adaptability of stratatrace is one of its strongest features
4134554 our labels use a variety of methods from microtaggants and microtext to different forms of bar codes to create a labeling platform that is custom designed for the job at hand
4134555 with stratatrace we can trace a tainted product almost immediately back to the field where it was grown even to the row on which it was grown theoretically we can even identify who picked it
4134556 dit was mijn laatste wedstrijd ik wilde het goud deze prestatie beschouw ik als olympisch falen
4134557 do not enable pim on any additional interfaces to accomplish this
4134558 weve had this accelerated inflation weve had inflation rising above 5 for the last few months and it could have been a case that was going to last quite a bit longer into 2009 if these commodity prices continue to fall then we may see less of an impact going forward
4134559 i think that for the next few months were still going to see food price inflation at the retail level at an accelerated rate but it could be as we head into 2009 that we wont see as much inflation as before so not that food prices will come back down but that well stop seeing these increases that everyone has been experiencing over the last six months
4134560 this is an exciting book with a new approach to use of the mri scanner it bridges the gap between clinical research and general neuro radiological practice it is accessible to the clinical radiologist and yet thorough in its treatment of the underlying physics and of the science of measurement it is likely to become a classic
4134561 paul tofts has succeeded brilliantly in capturing the essence of what needs to become the future of radiology in particular and medicine in general quantitative measurements of disease

4134567 the russian troops are destroying the city of gori they are mining the city they are destroying everything in poti port they are destroying the newly built roads in western georgia
4134568 we are trying to agree on the deployment of georgian police into gori
4134569 but there is mutual suspicion there are south ossetian separatists trying to intervene the situation is tense the ceasefire is quite fragile
4134570 good afternoon i am very happy to be here with you
4134571 it is a privilege for me to represent the us in bulgaria
4134572 from now on we have many important tasks to accomplish such as safeguarding regional security and promoting the mutual understanding between our two nations
4134573 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4134574 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4134575 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4134576 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4134577 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4134578 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4134579 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4134580 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
4134581 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
4134582 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
4134583 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
4134584 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

4134588 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
4134589 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

4134593 senator clinton understands and appreciates that there are supporters who remain passionate but she has repeatedly urged her supporters to vote for senator obama
4134594 i think some of her supporters have been less than gracious
4134595 ensure that the voices of everyone who participated in this historic process are respected
4134596 the only way a democratic party will have the credibility to elect a democrat in november is if the party uses a legitimate process to choose its nominee

4134603 we have an extraordinary situation in northern ireland firstly we have five sinn fein mps who do not turn up at all so the concerns of their constituents about the rising cost of living the levels of taxation etc are never heard most ludicrously of all sinn fein receive financial assistance to carry out the very parliamentary duties they fail to discharge of the other 13 mps 11 of them are also mlas five of them are ministers in the executive how in this situation can northern irelands voice be properly heard at westminster when our mps are present in london for at best two days a week some of the most important issues in peoples day to day lives fuel duty vehicle excise duty aviation duty pensions and the lisbon treaty are dealt with at westminster even allowing for the fact that many of the executive ministers have not done much work given the current impasse should we not have full time ministers at stormont and full time mps at westminster
4134604 we cannot afford to take a wait and see attitude toward the market

4134628 omg this is fate can you help me i need to put on a sari in a few hours
4134629 three months have passed since cyclone nargis and an accompanying tidal surge swept across myanmars fertile irrawaddy delta region claiming nearly 140 000 lives and devastating the livelihoods of many more people all told some 2 4 million people were seriously affected by nargis ranking it among the worst cyclones in asia in the past 15 years and the worst in myanmars history i recently completed my second trip to myanmar where i was again sobered by the immensity of the tragedy but was also cautiously hopeful about relief efforts in may government reluctance to allow international aid workers into the affected region sparked a storm of international criticism we have made a lot of progress since then touring the delta by helicopter i could see that many houses had been repaired one way or another there was agricultural activity in the fields and commercial activity on the waterways schools are in session in tents if not permanent classrooms and hundreds of international aid staffers are now working in the delta the promises about access made to u n secretary general ban ki moon when he saw myanmars head of state senior gen than shwe in late may have essentially been kept
4134630 without question the international response has helped save lives and reduce suffering while it is impossible to be sure all survivors have been reached i am confident that the overwhelming majority have received help even if many still need a good deal more crucially a much feared second wave of deaths from starvation or disease has not happened no small achievement given that 75 percent of hospitals and clinics in the affected areas were destroyed the peoples resilience has been remarkable as was the degree of help and solidarity from individual citizens and organizations in myanmar
4134631 first no nation rich or poor can go it alone when confronted by a natural disaster of the magnitude of a cyclone nargis it would have been much better not least for the survivors if the government of myanmar had recognized the value of an international presence from the start i encourage myanmars leaders to continue down the path of cooperation including in response to other humanitarian challenges based on the universal principle of the impartial provision of aid
4134632 second we must stay focused on the goal assisting people in crisis from the first the aid operation in myanmar as is true everywhere we work had to be about helping vulnerable people in need not about politics in this post iraq age i am concerned that humanitarians are often pressured to choose between the hammer of forced intervention and the anvil of perceived inaction was there a realistic alternative to the approach of persistent negotiation and dialogue that we pursued i do not believe so nor have i met anyone engaged in the operations who believes that a different approach would have brought more aid to more people more quickly
4134633 this is not to say that there can never be a role for humanitarian intervention even in natural disasters but it must be the last resort when all else has been tried and the only alternative is death and suffering on a mass scale
4134634 third nargis showed us a new model of humanitarian partnership adding the special position and capabilities of the association of southeast asian nations to those of the united nations in working effectively with the government this may prove the most important and i hope enduring lesson of the cyclone response with implications for how we respond anywhere in the future aseans leadership was vital in building trust with the government and saving lives in recent years asean members have significantly stepped up participation in the humanitarian arena given that eight of the 10 worst natural disasters last year occurred in asia this represents a lifesaving investment where the united nations is helping to build local capacity
4134635 fourth nargis demonstrated once again the importance of disaster risk reduction and preparedness simple low cost measures local evacuation plans shelters community early warning systems have saved tens of thousands of lives in neighboring bangladesh when it has been faced with similarly devastating cyclones we need to help the people of myanmar strengthen their resilience and reduce their vulnerability building back better to minimize future disaster risks is a top priority in coming years we can expect to see more and more intense weather related natural disasters as the effects of climate change become more pronounced we must be better prepared and must cooperate as neighbors and an international community in meeting this challenge the need for effective global humanitarian partnerships has never been more apparent or more necessary
4134636 duh i mean why arent you dropping me off at the curb

4134707 so i gave him the baltimore sun sports pages even if he just read the pictures and captions
4134708 this woman says to me your son will never be able to focus on anything
4134709 michael used to run around like a little crazy person mooching food off people
4134710 he could get through homework without moving around so much

4134733 this suggests that the iphone calls home once in a while to find out what applications it should turn off at the moment no apps have been blacklisted but by all appearances this has been added to disable applications that the user has already downloaded and paid for if apple so chooses to shut them down
4134734 with a little dns spoofing ive managed to feed my own list into the iphone and effectively kill any application that attempts to use the gps including google maps it looks like tasers are only set to stun right now but that may just be because i havent found the knob to vaporize the app
4134735 but we would be irresponsible not to have a lever like that to pull

4134738 how a device performs in individual situations depends on circumstances like where you are in the 3g coverage how close you are to a cell site things like terrain and buildings all come into play
4134739 im not denying that people are having a less than satisfactory experience but overall the phone is doing great
4134740 the 3g coverage of t mobile is as good as the competition there can therefore not lie we suspect that it is a hardware software specific issue of the iphone itself
4134741 we believe that these issues are typical of an immature chipset and radio protocol stack where we are almost certain infineon is the 3g supplier

4134746 no actions were selected what are you trying to do
4134747 access to the pacific atlantic and eastern gulf regions would not have a significant impact on domestic crude oil and natural gas production or prices before 2030 leasing would begin no sooner than 2012 and production would not be expected to start before 2017
4134748 will push for help from our european partners on the oil front
4134749 the united states has an opportunity to help increase the supply of oil on the market therefore taking pressure off gasoline for our hard working americans and that ive proposed to the congress that they open up anwr and open up the continental shelf and give this country a chance to help us through this difficult period
4134750 analysis of crude oil production in the arctic national wildlife refuge
4134751 the opening of the anwr 1002 area to oil and natural gas development is projected to increase domestic crude oil production starting in 2018
4134752 this analysis assumes that enactment of the legislation in 2008 would result in first production from the anwr area in 10 years i e 2018
4134753 124 spills with a total volume of roughly 17 700 barrels of total petroleum products
4134754 when katrina a cat 5 hurricane hit the gulf coast not one drop of oil was spilled off of those rigs out in the gulf of mexico
4134755 w e didnt have one drop of oil spilt when we had the biggest hurricane in you know recent history hurricane katrina
4134756 earlier this week on this program though you defended offshore drilling and said quote we withstood hurricanes rita and katrina and did not spill a drop in fact the u s mineral management service said that katrina and rita caused 124 offshore spills for a total of more than 743 000 gallons of oil and refined products spilled so nancy do you want to take back what you said
4134757 right well i actually do i was misinformed and my embarrassment aside the point is still that we had a remarkable performance
4134758 joint study by nasa and the smithsonian institution examining several decades worth of data found that more oil seeps into the ocean naturally than from accidents involving tankers and offshore drilling natural seepage from underwater oil deposits leaks an average of 62 million gallons a year offshore drilling on the other hand accounted for only 15 million gallons the smallest source of oil leaking into the oceans
4134759 almost 40 years later after the santa barbara spill the national academy of sciences says mother nature spills more oil into the environment than exxon shell b p and chevron combined 63 percent of all oil in u s coastal waters comes from natural seepage from cracks in the earth 32 percent from consumers in their boats and runoff from cities 4 percent from oil tankers and just 1 percent from offshore platforms
4134760 comparison of the impacts of seeps and spills based solely on volume would be misleading the evidence is clear that far from being invisible against a background of seeps major spills can have far greater and qualitatively different impacts on the environment than do seeps
4134761 natural seeps and spills differ in that seep rates do not on average exceed the marine environments capacity to digest the oil whereas spills may exceed its capacity major spills overwhelm natures mechanisms for processing the oil in the short term the consequences include severe oiling of shorelines and mortality to organisms that are ill prepared to live in an oil soaked environment
4134762 drilling is underway 60 miles off florida the drilling is being done by china in cooperation with cuba which is drilling closer to south florida than u s companies are
4134763 it is our understanding that although cuba has leased out exploration blocks 60 miles off the coast of southern florida which is closer than american firms are allowed to operate in that area no chinese firm is drilling there
4134764 jorge pinon a senior energy fellow at the university of miami specializing in latin america said cuba has awarded offshore oil leases or concessionary blocs in its offshore waters to six oil companies none of them chinese and soon may announce an agreement with brazils state oil company petrobras
4134765 but no one is currently drilling in any of those concessions
4134766 w eve got china you know joining with cuba theyre drilling 60 miles off our shores of florida
4134767 suggested if we all inflated our tires that we would solve the problem

4134773 you can improve your gas mileage by around 3 3 percent by keeping your tires inflated to the proper pressure under inflated tires can lower gas mileage by 0 4 percent for every 1 psi drop in pressure of all four tires
4134774 each barrel of oil yields about 26 gallons of gas criticized for record profits companies like chevron say every dollar coming out is going right back in to the quest for more
4134775 announced a 12 percent increase in its quarterly dividend on common stock
4134776 the oil companies insist theyre trying to find new oil that might help bring down gas prices but the money they spend on exploration is nothing compared with what they spend on stock buybacks and dividends
4134777 the five biggest international oil companies plowed about 55 percent of the cash they made from their businesses into stock buybacks and dividends last year according to rice universitys james a baker iii institute for public policy
4134778 i n the first quarter of this year exxon conocophillips and chevron were all among the top 10 companies for share buybacks in the s amp p 500
4134779 s tock buybacks are common throughout corporate america not just for big oil they shrink the amount of stock on the open market essentially increasing its value and giving individual shareholders a bigger stake in the company
4134780 a brilliant proposal that finally gives the public something back the certain removal of four offshore oil platforms the decommissioning of a notorious industrial plant and the reversion of rural land subjugated into oil development back into the public trust as parkland
4134781 only 001 percent of the oil produced has been spilled
4134782 every year oily road runoff from a city of 5 million could contain as much oil as one large tanker spill

4134786 easter europeean societies under the thumb of russia and their national communist parties were subjected to forty years of totalitarian rule continual propaganda and a rigidly controlled mass media but the people in these countries ditched the communists with hardly a second thought when they discovered that the red army wouldnt be invading them
4134787 these models perpetrate the notion that women should define themselves as sex objects to be gazed at and lusted after by men and not as active forceful individuals
4134788 it may be legal to purchase cigarettes but is it moral for copywriters to use their literary and artistic skills to convince people to purchase such dangerous products
4134789 often have families to support and the may feel that they cannot put their jobs or the welfare of their families at risk
4134790 several commercial print on demand publishers such as iuniverse and xlibris enable authors to publish a book for as little as 500 or 600

4134795 the higher inventories are good news for second quarter gdp which could be close to 3 when revised
4134796 t he pace of expansion has been subdued and i would expect that to continue not just because of credit conditions
4134797 i expect the expansion to remain modest certainly into next year because i think it will take some time for the headwinds to dissipate they are not going to dissipate in my judgment that rapidly
4134798 a lot of the frameworks and walls built because of the old financial world we grew up in will come down
4134799 people think theyre diversifying by investing in a country and it leads to inadequate diversification
4134800 because the country of origin or incorporation is not the primary influence on the stock price
4134801 well be thinking in terms of global markets all the time
4134802 if you have young people in india africa or latin america borrowing from the wealthy
4134803 investment banks are no longer able to avoid prudential regulation since bear stearns was just hugely regulated and primary dealers that are investment banks now have access to the discount window feds borrowing mechanism
4134804 so instead of having 50 different ways to do a credit default swap you could actually buy one on an exchange
4134805 you will find the actively managed mutual fund industry shrinking pretty dramatically
4134806 and individuals will become more capable of managing their own financial affairs
4134807 a lot of people cant access the full range of products in a market
4134808 people will click on an icon and visualize their financial future in terms of all scenarios
4134809 the idea that you just buy medical insurance on the one hand and invest in financial securities on the other will vanish

4134818 were aware of that contact made and we have spoken to both david batten and jared golla in relation to recent communications they had received
4134819 i can confirm that i have instructed my solicitors to file unfair dismissal and unlawful termination proceedings with the australian industrial commission in relation to my termination by iguana joes waterfront bar on the 18th of july 2008

4134822 it was a savage beating he was struck numerous times to the head and face
4134823 we do sample airworthiness bulletins when we do maintenance audits but we can only sample them
4134824 qantas would have at any time in excess of 2000 airworthiness bulletins current for its fleet
4134825 so there is no way we can audit every ad airworthiness directive they currently have
4134826 obviously some part of the translation of the boeing service bulletin into the material the engineers were using that bit was left out
4134827 he said adding that how the rectification was missed and at what point it happened was what casa was looking at
4134828 there has been too much cost cutting and not enough attention to quality
4134829 for the older 737s qantas chose to do some modifications and continue to do inspections and for the younger ones including these aicraft they chose to do all the work so they didnt have to do all the work
4134830 thats why some of them some were not caught up in this and were okay and approved but the others had the modifications done that got rid of the inspections that included the clips but which were unfortunately did not include the clips
4134831 no they checked them all and did non destructive testing on them and found nothing
4134832 det lukker ikke hullet i forhold til dommen men det kan medvirke til at dommen ikke bliver misbrugt
4134833 it is the case that he has endeavoured to obtain some assistance from those who gave him religious guidance to try to behave in a way other than his paedophilic tendencies would indicate
4134834 tragically for his children he had failed on a number of occasions in that regard
4134835 hes a person who has an insight into the nature of the offending and the consequences of it
4134836 he used lollies and other intelligent means to manipulate a very little girl and boy
4134837 in true costa style he got out of the vehicle after doing a lap to avoid us and tried to intimidate the firefighters
4134838 he was met with boos and much frank and open debate regarding the nsw wages policy and the threat to close fire stations and sack firefighters he was quite aggressive and the firefighters present were just as up front with him it was quite a spectacle
4134839 at one point he made a statement saying nsw firefighters are the best paid firefighters in the country
4134840 my 10 year old daughter then said for all to hear standing right next to him excuse me sir im only 10 years old and even i know that is a lie
4134841 costa then tried to say that that was a good line that daddy had taught her he was then booed again

4134849 an injection above expectations or well above last years build or the five year average could bring natural gas prices lower because it means the industry is better prepared for higher gas consumption during the winter season

4134869 we took a look at a number of crm platforms
4134870 we are an sap company anyway so it was fairly natural when we were last looking at platforms that we looked at sap crm what really sold us was the user interface and the fact that sap had finally gotten to the point where their product was maturing it was among the best of breed and fit with our back end sap erp system
4134871 the layout and back end management is all facilitated through the new web interface and we realized right off the bat that our csrs and our salespeople would be much more likely to adopt the process and the applications if we could make that an easy transition we were thinking adoption all along in that regard

4134908 saya dipanggil sebagai ketua komisi v dan panitia anggaran untuk mengklarifikasi terkait dengan pelaksanaan anggaran yang berkaitan dengan kasus bulyan royan dan saya jelaskan semuanya
4134909 saya telah memberikan klarifikasi bahwa penyusunan anggaran tidak ada kaitan dengan kasus bulyan royan sebab anggaran ini kita bahas bersama sama dan sudah ditetapkan sesuai dengan mekanisme yang ada terkiat dengan kasus suap itu kita tidak pernah tahu dan tiba tiba saja ada penangkapan itu
4134910 tetapi belakangan ada kasus itu kita sama sekali tidak dan tidak berkaitan dengan kasus ini intinya kami harapkan rekan rekan wartawan jangan salah kutiplah
4134911 komisi v tidak keterkaitan kasus secara bulyan royan dan saya selaku ketua komisi tidak pernah tahu dan tidak pernah dilaporkan oleh saudar bulyan
4134912 ini baru indikasi ya secara lembaga sebenarnya tidak ada keterkaitan dalam kasus ini tetapi kita menduga ada keterlibatan secara personal dari anggota di dalamnya hal inilah yang tengah kita kejar sebab kita memerlukan bukti bukti yang akurat tidak hanya dari pengakuan saja

4134920 did you really just ask me that she is a 14 year old girl and you are a pedophile
4134921 its not right what does it say about america what does it say about the president of the united states if you guys allow her to be in office after all of this what does it say about all of you what does it say this is bull crap i was up here robbed of my rights my dignity how would you feel if it happened to you how would you feel
4134922 ironically one of the things that reduces your enthusiasm to really go the extra mile in making games is the thought that thousands of ungrateful gits will swipe the whole thing on day one for nothing
4134923 its very demoralising but actually talking to the pirates has revealed a huge group of people who really appreciate genuinely good games
4134924 some of the criticisms of my games hit home i get the impression that if i make kudos 2 not just lots better than the original but hugely overwhelmingly massively better well polished designed and balanced that a lot of would be pirates will actually buy it
4134925 ive gone from being demoralised by pirates to actually being inspired by them and im working harder than ever before on making my games fun and polished
4134926 if you wanted to change one thing to get more pirates to buy games scrapping drm is it
4134927 for the record id love to get my games on steam
4134928 vendormate leads the emerging vendor credentialing and information management space in healthcare alone the company has more than 400 customer hospitals my vision is to build it into an unmatched brand across a number of vertical markets

4134930 the creation of this role reflects the dramatic growth weve enjoyed and sets the stage for further expansion
4134931 of course we have our ups and downs but all in all my mother taught us to appreciate what we have been given nor would she ever encourage or allow a 14 year old child to alter her body
4134932 it is hard enough being 14 years old and you have enough insecurities to begin with then add being in the public eye
4134933 its really amazing my son is starting kindergarten this year and every day were either doing swim lessons or karate
4134934 and my daughter is in pre k really its like im on vacation because we get to do all those fun kid things everyday so far its been a great summer
4134935 it really got to a point for me where i just wanted to always make so many changes to my old site that i figured id just start a blog i love it because i get so much feedback
4134936 i can talk about things that are happening at clubs right up to my thoughts on gay marriage its been a good way to mix the personal with the professional to show that i have more dimension than just another dj
4134937 as a person sex is important but its not what defines me
4134938 so i thought let me tackle it from another angle and then i realized that there was a niche just waiting to be filled
4134939 this is a place where you can share more than just parts of your body
4134940 its not about teaching an old dog or an old bear new tricks

4134945 the prospect of someone coming in with no id and registering and voting is contrary to every sort of protection that legislators and lawmakers have built into this system for decades

4134949 the new systems were certainly a welcome improvement over the manual system in previous elections
4134950 we found that the problem mainly is not the machine
4134951 beis were observed indicating their support for particular candidates and violating voters rights to cast their ballot in secret
4134952 the transportation of voters from provinces outside the armm to polling places were observed as well as vote buying
4134953 some beis were observed taking the paper audit trail from voters and looked at which candidates they had chosen
4134954 vote buying is related to the secrecy you dont protect
4134955 everyone thinks that if we automate the elections then all our problems will go away however if you look at the experience of the united states and other countries who have automated their elections the old problems still persist and new problems crop up

4134962 the return to education after such a long absence became an exhilarating rollercoaster ride of sublime highs and depressing lows
4134963 education is so often just regarded as a preserve of the young the way to get a foothold on a career path a means to an end we have been fortunate to enjoy it for its own sake even though there are many benefits from embarking on it later in life it stimulates the brain gives a purpose and discipline to life and makes one more aware of and open to the constant flow of new ideas and interpretation in our subject areas
4134964 when first commencing the foundation degree course i was a little apprehensive that i was the only voluntary teaching assistant in my class
4134965 but strategic planning and the wonderful support of my husband and especially my mother who provided a childminding service enabled me to concentrate and focus on my studies as well as studying late at night and in my lunch break at work
4134966 the success of our higher education provision is outstanding we never imagined when we began piloting this method of study back in 1999 that we would develop provision to such an extent i am pleased to say we were wrong our he provision has soared and our graduates are now reaping the benefits
4134967 we are proud of the achievements of all our students and we wish them all a successful future i would also like to publicly acknowledge the work of the staff in the university centre who provide the valuable support and guidance which has contributed to the students success
4134968 there are fewer uncertainties you ride your own race and somehow its less aggressive you cant affect anyone elses race and they cant affect yours you go into a time trial and you wish the other riders well and you just concentrate on doing the best you can

4134978 this is jason signing autographs and posing for pics before the concert in philadelphia it wasnt very crowded so i followed him from behind the crowd and took some video for the dreadheads there were a lot of archie fans down that way and jason was singing archies new song crush
4134979 oh by the way when jason walked by us signing autographs he was singing crush i was laughing and started to sing along with him it was funny i told david about it and he said jason does that a lot and he is so weird i think i recorded him saying that
4134980 the white population is older and very much centered around the aging baby boomers who are well past their high fertility years
4134981 the future of america is epitomized by the young people today they are basically the melting pot we are going to see in the future
4134982 one can forget about any talk about georgias territorial integrity because i believe it is impossible to persuade south ossetia and abkhazia to agree with the logic that they can be forced back into the georgian state
4134983 our position on georgias territorial integrity is not going to change no matter what anybody says
4134984 and so i would consider that to be bluster from the foreign minister of russia we will ignore it
4134985 we dont want them here what we need is friendship and good relations with the russian people
4134986 we let her stay here and now shes blaming everything on us
4134987 however i learned a lot about advertising and wish i had been older and more experienced so that i could have handled the situation as it was a most interesting position

4134997 while voip services are being embraced by consumers worldwide businesses have been comparatively slower in their adoption due to various roadblocks this is about to change though as technical issues are resolved
4134998 these kinds of developments will boost the overall voip business services segment for years to come
4134999 while these data suggest the development of more favorable patterns of alcohol consumption over the latter part of the 20th century they also show that at the same time the cumulative incidence of alcohol use disorders has not shown a decrease and continuing efforts at preventing them are warranted
4135000 i see absolutely no reason for that and its silly
4135001 two judges have already found hes violated conditions of his bond
4135002 this is the first time a judge has stood up for him
4135003 ive said all along this has got to be resolved
4135004 this has been very very difficult for the city and for the state and its obvious why we need a resolution
4135005 if the fund loses say at the most by 50 percent then 7 5 percent of the total funds will be lost but it will earn at least 9 percent on the 85 percent that it will be forced to invest on debt instruments
4135006 since 9 percent of 85 percent is 7 65 percent of the amount invested it will cover the possible loss of 7 5 percent
4135007 if you ask me if theres an electricity crunch in kenya id say there is and there isnt
4135008 we are just about meeting our current electricity demand there are no power cuts no load shedding as such the gap between demand and supply is negligible
4135009 but in terms of financing and covering the cost of electricity generation it is not only kenya but also tanzania and uganda that are facing a crunch
4135010 we have no coal so far no gas and no oil the rift valley is rich in geo thermal energy and in time a bigger chunk of the countrys power will come from this source
4135011 its adverse impact on agriculture is well known but fortunately kenyas geothermal plants will be located in semi desert areas of the valley where there is no farming land to be affected
4135012 we dont fully know the potential of our geothermal sources it could be anywhere between 2000 to 7000 megawatts but it is the way forward for kenya
4135013 kenya will have to start thinking out of the box and tap unconventional sources of energy to speed up its economic growth
4135014 the urban rural disparity is glaring the country may be meeting its industrial and urban energy demands but that covers only 15 20 percent of the population in the rural areas people still consume charcoal and wood which makes up about 80 percent of all energy used in the country
4135015 at about 1100 mw the current supply cannot industrialize kenya nor drive it to achieve its development goals fast enough
4135016 it is usually growth in the economy which drives the demand for electricity and energy and not the other way around as is generally believed
4135017 electricity is only one ingredient in the cost of production the other ingredients are capital markets for the goods produced and an enabling environment raw materials and technology and lastly the energy input
4135018 above all the absolutely essential ingredient of economic production is the people and their working culture the real force behind industrial and economic growth is the people we need our own people to run and manage industry ourselves
4135019 the cost of transmission and distribution to kenyas rural areas is also prohibitive villages here are not compact residential areas houses and people are scattered on farms of varying sizes and there is no village system
4135020 though well have to keep looking to donor agencies like the world bank for financing the problem will not go away unless kenya becomes self reliant promotes a culture of local investment and develops and exploits its own resources
4135021 stemming the flow of evincible ignorance we must try to understand for the sake of understanding

4135023 heaven is my throne and earth is my footstool where is the house that you will build me and where is place of my rest for all those things my hand has made and all those things exist says the lord
4135024 but on this one will who i look on him who is poor and of a contrite spirit and who trembles at my word
4135025 though the lord is on high yet he regards the lowly but the proud he knows from afar
4135026 lord you are good to the soul which seeks you
4135027 i have been crucified with christ such that i no longer live but christ lives in me
4135028 im name thank you for meeting with me and participating in this process of gathering information from collegues across the organization these interviews are part of an intense effort to discover our internal best practices in key strategic business areas
4135029 en lange disuccies zijn juist vaak het werktuig van de manipulator akkoord we hebben het er over gehad ik snap wat je bedoelt en je wilt dus dat ik niet meer zo tegen je doe maar de volgende keer dat het probleem zich voordoet is jullie hele gesprek vergeten en begint het weer van voor af aan
4135030 i dont think that anything is going to change but i do think it is important to be heard and this is our way of doing it
4135031 senator clinton understands and appreciates that there are supporters who remain passionate but she has repeatedly urged her supporters to vote for senator obama
4135032 i think some of her supporters have been less than gracious
4135033 ensure that the voices of everyone who participated in this historic process are respected
4135034 the only way a democratic party will have the credibility to elect a democrat in november is if the party uses a legitimate process to choose its nominee
4135035 we are not per se a clinton support group we are a democratic party get your act together support group
4135036 i have been voting democratic for 18 years i only voted for democrats from dog catcher to president and everything in between
4135037 i will be voting for someone other than barack obama come november
4135038 its far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price
4135039 i just need to put myself out there more in the first 50 and ill be ok
4135040 discovery is the place at tiff to find this years most exciting debuts in cinema
4135041 this is your one stop shop for new filmmaking talent
4135042 marked a distinctive moment in american independent filmmmaking yet two decades later the film is not as widely available as other classic u s indies all that changed when the film debuted last night for free on
4135043 great not having made a film in so long im keen to have the existent ones available all ways possible
4135044 i remember all the people kind of not liking the film or not thinking it was commercial in the first screenings people see anything thats kind of strange in what its doing and its very natural to kind of doubt its ability to survive in the marketplace
4135045 as a completed film metropolitan was rejected everywhere even by sundance
4135046 thanks to sundance programmer tony safford the film finally got into the festival after which despite a great reception it still remained bereft of distribution if it hadnt been for ira deutchman as our producers rep lindsay law who bought the film for american playhouse allowing us to pay our lab bill sara risher and bob shaye of new line and supporters in the press such as roger ebert and vincent canby all of them the film never would have come out
4135047 thanks to the criterion edition and some supporters at the cable channels the film seems to have gotten a new audience
4135048 as it was old fashioned and passe when made intentionally the film doesnt seem to have lost much with the passage of time
4135049 i am far more ambivalent about the role of wealth in the city no longer having any
4135050 an early 60s jamaican story which has the advantage of characters and themes far more sympathetic sociologically than the poisonous preppies i write as one of the earlier triptych whoever backs it is going to be very rich
4135051 now independent film is again at the low ebb of a cycle which is probably a very good time to put new ventures in the works
4135052 its painful to hear the formulas enunciated casting budget and marketing mantras by which judgment intelligent effort and showmanship are to be replaced

4135060 although im not a marketing major i have a bit of a trusted reputation after 18 years self promoting id like to inform you i had no say in this marketing campaign but if i did things would be different since it is obvious that this poster is boring odd and has zero to do with the movie i performed in
4135061 granted one poster stinking up the joint isnt the end of the world yet it sends the wrong message about our movie and i just wanted you to know that i feel the pain i really love the film and i know from past missteps marketing wise that the wrong poster sends the wrong audience into the theatre

4135069 i believe in the power of poetry which gives me reasons to look ahead and identify a glint of light poetry can be a real bastard it distorts it has the power to transform the unreal into the real and the real into the imaginary it has the power to build a world that is at odds with the world in which we live i see poetry as spiritual medicine i have no other tool with which to find meaning for my life or for the life of my nation i built with words a homeland for my nation and for myself
4135070 o those who pass between fleeting words carry your names and be gone rid our time of your hours and be gone steal what you will from the blueness of the sea and the sand of memory take what pictures you will so that you understand that which you never will how a stone from our land builds the ceiling of our sky from you steel and fire from us our flesh from you yet another tank from us stones from you teargas from us rain as bitter dust go where you wish but do not pass between us like flying insects pile your illusions in a deserted pit and be gone and we have what you lack a bleeding homeland of a bleeding people
4135071 it is time for you to be gone live wherever you like but do not live among us it is time for you to be gone die wherever you like but do not die among us

4135076 for that reason we screen calls from the 203 area code
4135077 i dont like people who are rude to our waiters
4135078 i wonder how much extra ill get from the tooth fairy for pulling it myself i usually get 1 00 for teeth other people have to help me pull so ill probably get extra for pulling it myself
4135079 yessss you get an extra quarter for pulling the tooth yourself
4135080 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
4135081 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
4135082 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
4135083 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4135084 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
4135085 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
4135086 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
4135087 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4135088 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4135089 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
4135090 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
4135091 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
4135092 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
4135093 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
4135094 this is real tax relief that working louisianans will notice in their paychecks starting january 2009 the elimination of the stelly tax increase means over three hundred million dollars in lower taxes next year more than a billion dollars in tax relief over the next five years and more money in the hands of families who will do a better job spending their money than the government would this is another example of just how much you can get done if you dont care who gets the credit
4135095 why did they build so many ruined castles and abbeys in england
4135096 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
4135097 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
4135098 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
4135099 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
4135100 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
4135101 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
4135102 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
4135103 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
4135104 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
4135105 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
4135106 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
4135107 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
4135108 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
4135109 theres always that frustration of not winning the championship youll have to carry that label my father carried it for a long time mack brown carried for a long time ill have to carry it
4135110 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
4135111 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4135112 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
4135113 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
4135114 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
4135115 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
4135116 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
4135117 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
4135118 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
4135119 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
4135120 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
4135121 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
4135122 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4135123 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4135124 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4135125 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
4135126 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
4135127 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
4135128 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
4135129 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
4135130 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
4135131 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
4135132 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4135133 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
4135134 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
4135135 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
4135136 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
4135137 this is base mana cost not total modified by int cost
4135138 wir m ssen die tatsache st rker ber cksichtigen dass sex im fortgeschrittenen alter eine m glichkeit bleibt

4135140 it will very uncomfortable and that you will dread the shot and the drilling while imagining the smoke billowing from your mouth as the doctor hits a nerve
4135141 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
4135142 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
4135143 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4135144 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4135145 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
4135146 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
4135147 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4135148 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4135149 if we dont get an unexpected shock that pushes commodity prices back up this might be the worst inflation news that well get for a while
4135150 it is certainly above expectations here but i think weve probably seen for the near term anyway the worst of the inflation readings
4135151 in my research of multinational companies 17 of manufacturers are moving investments out of china
4135152 consumers demand a product from a clean factory where employees are paid well while simultaneously demanding a cheap price that leaves me between a rock and a hard place
4135153 owners went there in the first place to produce a product in the most economical way possible
4135154 now other countries will have an opportunity to be very competitive in order to do whats right for my company im keeping my eyes peeled and have already checked out three other countries
4135155 theres nothing id like more than to be 100 american made so if someone wants to produce our goods im open
4135156 but moving to vietnam means working in a country that is the size of one chinese province that hasnt much skilled labor and is about 15 years behind china in terms of infrastructure
4135157 u s companies that go west will do it for the governments tax subsidy and the belief that secondary and tertiary cities have less turnover and more competitive wages
4135158 china is the largest growing major economy in the world with well over a billion in population and a growing middle class
4135159 even as costs rise chinas improving efficiencies in supply chains and its growing domestic market are creating new opportunities and generating new client relationships for foreign investors
4135160 china is a legitimate market in itself and i know many other businesses that are manufacturing for the china market and not to export
4135161 business owners have to look at total costs including lead times and gas prices
4135162 china is known in the u s for having poor quality items but the country is ready to move on to innovation
4135163 textiles have already moved to vietnam and bangladesh as china keeps the quality stuff
4135164 una cortina de humo para dividir a las cuatro entidades
4135165 hay otros temas del campo m s urgentes para tratar
4135166 el proyecto deber a volver a comisi n para ser tratado no creo que el oficialismo vuelva a impulsarlo lo hizo s lo para generar divisiones en la mesa de enlace y como no lo lograron
4135167 no atiende a la realidad de estos tiempos y es muy reglamentista
4135168 es una iniciativa por dem s reguladora en el cual la intervenci n del estado limita la libertad contractual de las partes afectando la libertad de comercio al acordar a una de las partes arrendatario mayores derechos que al propietario esta violando la igualdad ante la ley derecho amparado en el art culo 16 de la constituci n nacional

4135170 it makes me proud to see a show with women discussing whats important to me
4135171 i like talking back to the television if they respond in kind i feel validated if they dont i figure i just got lost in the cross talk
4135172 i need to know how to win an argument with my mother about current issues
4135173 i need something to talk about around the water cooler
4135174 it reminds me of sitting down with my girlfriends and talking about everything
4135175 i want to find out more about the celebrities i love
4135176 cinnema is now close due to rrod we apologise for any inconvenience
4135177 uh oh is my fork ok i cant see anything wrong but is it ok yes i talk to myself so shoot me
4135178 this is a number that is going to make the fed very concerned
4135179 what we see as do many around the world is a global economy that is difficult
4135180 when energy and oil prices go up on top of inflation and health care and core food items theres a great deal of pressure on the customer
4135181 people are eating more sandwiches in puerto rico and relying more on private label products in the uk
4135182 weve corrected quite a bit on oil despite a lot of bullish news the sentiment has been bearish
4135183 we have had bids from two clubs for glenn loovens
4135184 neither meet our valuation and both have been turned down
4135185 it is likely we will sell if the clubs involved meet our valuation and manager dave jones would have money available to find a replacement
4135186 we are intent on earning promotion to the premiership and that means keeping our best players
4135187 none of those on long term contracts are available at any price
4135188 glenn loovens is a different case because he has not signed the new contract offered him we have talked to him about that and said we are happy for him to stay through this season
4135189 but that would mean he could walk away next summer for nothing
4135190 i believe the towns of ballymena ballymoney and ballycastle would act as perfect hosts for these brave men and women who have been out fighting in war zones such as iraq and afghanistan
4135191 looking at st patricks barracks in ballymena this was once a major military base for the rir and i therefore believe the town would act as a perfect location for any such parade
4135192 in recent months the local press has been calling for home coming parades for our brave soldiers allowing us to recognise the difficulties they face on a daily basis as they carry out their duty
4135193 i do not believe that these parades should be centered in belfast and i believe local towns should take the opportunity to voice their desire to host them this is common practice in some english towns and villages and i think it is important that these parades are adopted here
4135194 the figures released today are most encouraging especially in light of the fact that they indicate that policing is getting full political and community support for the first time on behalf of the ulster unionist party i would like to thank the men and women of the psni for their dedication and professionalism in their ongoing fight against crime
4135195 however as we look at the issue of policing we must also recognise the challenges which are currently facing the psni and indeed the board itself the report highlights the importance of building public confidence and i believe this is essential if northern ireland is to move forward effectively
4135196 three years ago i was just a guitar tech not even trying to be in a band i was happy surfing and just living now my life is just crazy making records and touring the world and getting to play shows like wacken i truly am grateful for that has befallen on me good and bad
4135197 many people have asked questions about this show here are some answers
4135198 mom that teacher im suppose to meet i dont know her
4135199 the joy of thinking the beauty and power of classical mathematical ideas
4135200 it was with great sadness that i learned of the death of sir william christie and i extend my sympathies to his family and loved ones he was a man who had a long and distinguished career in local government and he will be remembered for the hard work and dedication he gave to his constituents and to the city of belfast
4135201 during his time as mayor he his family and his successful business were subjected to many terrorist attacks and it was with bravery he continued his work this dedication needs to be recognised
4135202 i believe it is difficult for anyone to support multiple mandates but it is incredible that a minister who has been supporting the abolishment of these is now adopting an opposing stance
4135203 in a recent interview about his time as minister edwin poots said that to be frank it was minister first mla second and councillor third he did not believe in the long term that it was sustainable to hold down the three jobs as a ministers position by nature requires an awful lot of time
4135204 now we have a minister running for the local council in enniskillen a minister that declared her intention at the assembly on 31 march to introduce legislative proposals to end the dual mandate of those councillors who are also members of the assembly and or parliament
4135205 for the lord himself will come down from heaven with a loud command with the voice of the archangel and with the trumpet call of god and the dead in christ will rise first
4135206 in total three devices were found during the security alert this is not what the people of belfast or northern ireland want although each device was thankfully made safe by army bomb experts those responsible for putting them there are clearly out of touch with the public and reality
4135207 in the week where we recognise the anniversary of the omagh bombing the single worst atrocity in northern ireland people want to look to the future to the normalisation of politics and to a better northern ireland a country free from sectarian violence and division

4135210 i am completely behind the people of lisbellaw and surrounding area as they continue to call for the issuing of a pharmacy license for the village i have lived all my life in the lisbellaw area and have noticed a large increase in the population in recent years which has in turn created a higher demand for local facilities when it comes to pharmaceutical needs the people of lisbellaw and the surrounding areas have to travel into enniskillen to pick up prescriptions or purchase certain types of medication in reality that is just not an option for some older residents who may not have the means to get into town as they have limited mobility or no vehicle and so they then become reliant upon family members or friends we also have parents in the lisbellaw area with young children who cant just go in and out of enniskillen at the drop of a hat in terms of cost we also have the issue of increasing fuel prices which means that running in and out of enniskillen in a vehicle is getting more expensive at a time when we are all trying to save what money we can
4135211 i believe that when you consider these issues it defies logic for lisbellaw not to have its own pharmacy as we know for certain that it would be a popular addition to the village and bring much needed relief for many local people i am delighted that the upcoming public meeting will allow the lisbellaw community to voice their opinions and undoubtedly these points will be reinforced by local people when they have such a good opportunity to speak out
4135212 the people of lisbellaw and the nearby area of tamlaght have been very forthright in making it known to me that they truly believe a pharmacy would be beneficial to the local area a pharmacist in the village would not only mean that locals would have immediate access to prescribed medication but would also mean they could have contact with health professionals within their community and people who struggle to get into enniskillen would be able to arrange collections for their medication much easier

4135217 knowing your numbers is a fundamental component in the franchise sales equation but having a well defined franchise sales process in place to apply those numbers is essential to a successful franchise sales effort and to healthy franchise development
4135218 having a well defined sales process is vital to the development efficiencies of a franchise system and may be even for important now than ever with the changes taking place in the global economy being nimble and knowing when to make adjustments can be the difference between success and its alternative numbers will help tell you that
4135219 a good franchise sales process should be constructed to engage the franchise candidate as soon as possible to think ownership thoughts and empower the candidate with knowledge activities to get a feeling of comfort by navigating around and through the system it also helps to take the candidate off the market the process helps sale team accountability by requiring touch points to be completed dated and advancement to the next step executed if something is going to derail a salesperson will know sooner than later and have the opportunity to correct the situation before it gets out of hand
4135220 that without a well defined franchise sales process achieving franchise sales quotas will continue to be challenging and unpredictable at best
4135221 i dont think that anything is going to change but i do think it is important to be heard and this is our way of doing it
4135222 senator clinton understands and appreciates that there are supporters who remain passionate but she has repeatedly urged her supporters to vote for senator obama
4135223 i think some of her supporters have been less than gracious
4135224 ensure that the voices of everyone who participated in this historic process are respected
4135225 the only way a democratic party will have the credibility to elect a democrat in november is if the party uses a legitimate process to choose its nominee
4135226 we are not per se a clinton support group we are a democratic party get your act together support group
4135227 i have been voting democratic for 18 years i only voted for democrats from dog catcher to president and everything in between

4135258 in order to disrupt the soviet gas supply its hard currency earnings from the west and the internal russian economy the pipeline software that was to run the pumps turbines and valves was programmed to go haywire after a decent interval to reset pump speeds and valve settings to produce pressures far beyond those acceptable to pipeline joints and welds
4135259 the result was the most monumental non nuclear explosion and fire ever seen from space
4135260 while there were no physical casualties from the pipeline explosion there was significant damage to the soviet economy
4135261 its ultimate bankruptcy not a bloody battle or nuclear exchange is what brought the cold war to an end in time the soviets came to understand that they had been stealing bogus technology but now what were they to do by implication every cell of the soviet leviathan might be infected they had no way of knowing which equipment was sound which was bogus all was suspect which was the intended endgame for the entire operation

4135285 the joint business agreement will enable the airlines to reduce costs and attract new customers helping to mitigate pressure on fares from record fuel costs
4135286 this means that the airlines will have greater ability to invest in their products services and fleets employees and shareholders will also benefit from the agreement
4135287 there is no reason why fares should rise if this agreement is approved
4135288 make no mistake if this monster monopoly is approved it will be third time unlucky for consumers
4135289 it will still be bad for passengers bad for competition and bad for the uk and us aviation industry

4135335 zu den aussagen von o gkk obmann alois st ger bez glich der ausgabensteigerungen bei medikamenten in den jahren 2007 und 2008 k nnen wir leider keine fundierten aussagen treffen die ober sterreichische gebietskrankenkasse hat ihre gebarung f r das letzte und das laufende jahr noch nicht offengelegt
4135336 es ist f r eine sachliche diskussion nicht f rderlich mit inoffiziellen bzw nicht nachvollziehbaren daten zu argumentieren
4135337 es ist absolut richtig dass die demografische entwicklung in sterreich einer der hauptfaktoren f r die steigenden ausgaben in der gesundheitsversorgung ist ich bin erfreut dass die krankenkassen diese tatsache mittlerweile akzeptiert haben
4135338 es ist eine errungenschaft unserer medizin und unserer gesellschaft dass wir immer lter werden und bis ins hohe alter ges nder bleiben dies sollte als wert und nicht als last anerkannt werden es ist weder sozial noch fair menschen die ihr ganzes leben gearbeitet und beitr ge in dieses system eingezahlt haben das gef hl zu geben sie seien schuld an der finanzmisere der krankenkassen
4135339 die fortschritte in der forschung lassen uns heute krankheiten behandeln die vor wenigen jahren noch nicht therapierbar waren medikamente werden immer effizienter lassen sich besser dosieren und leichter einnehmen mit dem begriff scheininnovation kann ich in diesem zusammenhang nichts anfangen ich wage zu behaupten dass jeder patient eine tablette der injektionsnadel oder gar einer operation vorzieht die gesundheitsversorgung ist ein dynamisches system das nicht nach starren faktoren berechnet werden kann das beweisen innovation und demografie es geht hier um menschen nicht um gleichungen wenn man beginnt entwicklungspotentiale nach konomischen faktoren zu begrenzen bedeutet das nichts anderes als rationierung
4135340 es wird zeit dass sich die krankenversicherungen aktiv f r ihre beitragszahler einsetzen und zu echten gesundheitsorganisationen werden
4135341 und eine gesunde bev lkerung kostet auch weniger als eine kranke

4135392 research shows that two thirds of patients high blood pressure is not controlled despite the best efforts of their doctors that is terrible
4135393 we are trying to identify the mechanisms through which blood pressure is regulated under normal everyday conditions which is what stress is and take that information back to the clinic to better determine what sort of therapy is going to be most effective at treating your blood pressure or your grandfathers
4135394 this research will give us information that allows us to identify what treatment is going to be effective in what individual by genotype by obesity and other factors what kind of treatment is going to be effective at keeping an individuals blood pressure down or maybe preventing it from ever getting high
4135395 we think there is a defect in their kidneys in the normal mechanisms that allow them to excrete salt
4135396 when blood pressure goes up due to stress their kidneys ought to get rid of more salt so their blood pressure will come down and they dont
4135397 we have animal model data that says the endothelin system normally functions to help your kidneys get rid of salt
4135398 from our point of view angiotensin promotes sodium retention directly and it also increases aldosterone another hormone which promotes sodium retention
4135399 ultimately you want to know how to treat people with this variation
4135400 there is still a need to figure out why some people respond to some therapies and other dont
4135401 that is not our specific question but these studies will help address that we have to identify what is it about different individuals that make them react more to stress makes them retain more salt
4135402 we are arguing in our study that you might want to treat patients differently depending on whether or not they are obese the angiotensin receptor blocker may be more effective in obese individuals who have angiotensin falling out into their bloodstream
4135403 we also found out that endothelin actually is the stimulus for increasing reactive oxygen species
4135404 when we gave the rats a specific type of endothelin blocker that also blocked the increase in oxidative stress blocked the blood pressure increase and improved recovery
4135405 this early life stressor is being mediated through the endothelin pathway
4135406 we took that to mean their blood pressure could also be hyper reactive sure enough that is what we found
4135407 this has a lot of implications for earlier detection of risk increasing environmental exposures and what you can do about it
4135408 if you cant alter the environment that quickly in life you know now where they are headed and maybe you can preempt it pharmacogenetically
4135409 what we are doing is looking at chronic environmental stress in combination with some bad candidate genes that are stress activated
4135410 if you have a tendency to have high blood pressure or if you are obese we can see the inner layer of the carotid getting thicker than normal people your age
4135411 but when we cant do that we want to give physicians ways to determine precisely the cause or causes of your hypertension and optimal ways to target your disease

4135431 when i was in iran 2 years ago i was concerned about what will happen to me when i return to my country would i be able to go in school or some educational center to be an educated person like iranians but when we came back to our country and moved to this village after a short time i found the ail center and lots of women going and coming from this center i felt that it is the best place for the improvement of women who want to learn some thing i went there and enrolled in literacy tailoring and holy quran classes i have attended these three classes in one center and was very happy because every day i met at least 400 women from my community and the quality of this center was very good because the teachers were updated by ail through providing seminars and training so the methods they taught were the best and students learned very fast today after 2 years i have completed the 5th grade of literacy holy quran and the sewing course i feel i am very lucky to have this opportunity to learn these all things and now i can work to support my family i can read the magazine newspaper and also i can help my children in their lessons and home work
4135432 i am really happy with the womens learning center that i attend it is a good and safe educational environment for females before the establishment of this center here the society of this area was against the girls education but fortunately the center has done a great deal to change their minds my parents have not allowed me to go to school and it was very hard for me that my rights have not given to me so when my parent saw that many women and girls go to the womens learning center without any problem and all the teachers there are female they allowed me to go to this center after some time they took another positive step and told me to get admission in the regular school too now i am in grade 7th and i understand if the womens learning center had not been established here i and many other girls would remain illiterate people in the society if that were to happen this society would never change their mind regarding their girls education
4135433 when i got engaged i was in 3rd class and when i got married i was just 16 years old after that my husband continued his education but his parents didnt give me permission to continue my classes i argued many times with my husband to get permission from your parents for me after long time they gave me permission to go and i went to majoba herawi center now i am in class 8th and i am very happy to be able to solve my and my family problems now my husband is in london and i can write letters to him my mother in law says to me thanks to god you have become educated and can solve our family problems now all my husbands family members take advice from me as an educated woman to help solve their problems

4135440 before i came to this seminar i would write the whole lesson on the blackboard and then explain it to the students the class was always centered on the teacher from this seminar i learned that students must be center of the activities
4135441 as i used the methods in my class room i saw that the atmosphere of the class was completely changed the students paid attention to the lesson and they took part in the activities and i really enjoyed teaching them her students asked her why she has not used these methods before she told them that she learnt it from ail seminar and from now she will teach them in the same way
4135442 ails seminar is the best because it is for 20 days and it has a positive effect on the teachers and they can learn many useful methods during these days

4135453 australians dont want that great volatility in prices but nor do they want to pay more for their petrol to do away with it

4135487 alexander laid a bridge over the river indus when alexander had crossed to the other side of the river indus he again offered sacrifice there according to his custom then starting from the indus he arrived at taxila a large and prosperous city in fact the largest of those situated between the rivers indus and hydaspes he was received in a friendly manner by taxiles the governor of the city and by the indians of that place and he added to their territory as much of the adjacent country as they asked for
4135488 taxiles we are told had a realm in india as large as egypt with good pasturage too and in the highest degree productive of beautiful fruits
4135489 why must we war and fight with one another alexander if thou art not come to rob us of water or of necessary sustenance the only things for which men of sense are obliged to fight obstinately as for other wealth and possessions so called if i am thy superior therein i am ready to confer favours but if thine inferior i will not object to thanking you for favours conferred
4135490 canst thou think pray that after such words of kindness our interview is to end without a battle nay thou shalt not get the better of me for i will contend against thee and fight to the last with my favours that thou mayest not surpass me in generosity
4135491 he captured ten of the gymnosophists who had done most to get sabbas to revolt and had made the most trouble for the macedonians these philosophers were reputed to be clever and concise in answering questions and alexander therefore put difficult questions to them declaring that he would put to death him who first made an incorrect answer
4135492 these philosophers then he dismissed with gifts but to those who were in the highest repute and lived quietly by themselves he sent onesicritus asking them to pay him a visit
4135493 calanus nevertheless was persuaded by taxiles to pay a visit to alexander
4135494 porus with the whole of his army was on the other side of that river having determined either to prevent him from making the passage or to attack him while crossing alexander took the forces which he had when he arrived at taxila and the 5 000 indians under the command of taxiles and the chiefs of that district and marched towards the same river of the indians little short of 20 000 infantry and 3 000 cavalry were killed in this battle all their chariots were broken to pieces and two sons of porus were slain
4135495 porus who exhibited great talent in the battle performing the deeds not only of a general but also of a valiant soldier but at last having received a wound on the right shoulder which part of his body alone was unprotected during the battle he wheeled round
4135496 for my own sake o porus thou shalt be thus treated but for thy own sake do thou demand what is pleasing to thee

4135764 so far in 2008 obama has enjoyed a run up of 5 5 points since his low point in late march that run is on a par with bushs in 2004 but still a bit less than gores 9 point run in 2000 and on par the bushs 6 point rebound that year judging from the dynamics weve seen in the past it is quite reasonable to expect the current trend to shift by half a dozen points august and the conventions have been periods of substantial change in both previous elections so if history repeats itself the next 4 or 5 weeks should be pretty interesting the bottom line is neither campaign should be complacent or despondent there is a lot of time left and recent history shows that both up and down swings of 6 9 points are entirely plausible

4135793 the addition of the westchester county and silicon valley magazines continues to support the demand we hear from realtors builders and retailers looking for high quality targeted advertising tools
4135794 there is little doubt that a magazine of this caliber belongs in these two markets as both areas have many homes approaching the 30m price tag westchester county is home to one of the countries most expensive estates available with a listing price of 95m the 20 000 square foot mansion sits on over 262 acres of land which stretches all the way into the state of connecticut
4135795 i have many years of real estate publishing and advertising experience and i have never seen a product that offers more to its clients than luxury home magazine this magazine raises the bar in every market it enters and everyone from the advertisers to the readers benefit from their state of the art luxury marketing practices
4135796 we create buzz and it works our magazine has a targeted audience of affluent homeowners and events like this appeal to their senses whether it is a magazine or an event we know how to promote luxury
4135797 zillow is committed to offering local professionals affordable and easy to use tools to get in front of our large audience of consumers interested in real estate and buying and selling homes
4135798 we strongly believe that the more targeted an ad can be both at a national and local level the more useful the consumer will find it and the more successful the advertiser will be
4135799 it really is a demographic divide in whats happening with the white population in this country and whats happening with minorities and its mostly due to immigration
4135800 itll feed into the immigration debate first of all and probably the election
4135801 congress has been kind of slow to make decisions about immigration but these numbers i think will probably put this back on a lot of peoples minds
4135802 this accelerates everything it accelerates the diversity of the younger ages the middle ages and even the senior ages
4135803 we need to spend much more time dealing with the issue of diversity in the united states
4135804 right now we have diverse parts of our country and its spreading out you see its causing a lot of social confrontations in some places i think part of that is weve not yet anticipated these demographic shifts
4135805 its immigrants coming in but its the fact they tend to be younger theyre starting families and theyre creating population momentum
4135806 this is the equivalent of the entire population of great britain and france together its as if those two countries entirely moved to the united states
4135807 it means like 80 million more cars on the road
4135808 the point here is what does it mean for the quality of life the quality of the environment profound questions
4135809 its not the weather this isnt happening because americans are choosing to have large families its happened primarily not entirely but largely because of a federal program immigration that is the toleration of illegal immigration and very generous legal immigration
4135810 this is a broader social issue that goes beyond home depot and the solution is certainly more complicated than placing mandates on businesses

4135948 we believe that the main function of the tree is to facilitate the flow of water from the ground and into the atmosphere
4135949 to achieve that function the tree is ideally designed to not only maximize the flow of water but in order to be successful in the real world it must also be able to withstand the stresses of the wind it is exquisitely designed to do just that
4135950 the tree is a physical flow architecture that has evolved to meet two main objectives maximum mechanical strength against wind and maximum access for water coming from the ground through the tree and into the atmosphere
4135951 in the larger sense the forest itself is a flow system with the same mechanical properties and functions as the individual tree facilitating the flow of water across the globe
4135952 winds come in many speeds but their ultimate effect is cutting off trunks branches and leaves so whatever is too long or sticks out too much is shaved off
4135953 so the pattern of the tree is the result of the never ending assault by the wind
4135954 if the purpose of a tree was not to transport water it would look like the eiffel tower
4135955 it looks like mr french engineer gustave eiffel without knowing it designed a structure that corresponds with our constructal theory
4135956 will something be done ahead of the second leg certainly yes but before saturday no

4135959 we missed seven or eight players our squad looks big because the players who were with us did well
4135960 i think centrally i feel denilson 20 and ramsey 17 in a game of that level they did very well
4135961 i do not know yet about the next game i have to think about that because they gave a lot
4135962 the game on saturday morning comes very quickly but in fairness i am not in a position where i can make many changes at the moment
4135963 the objective is for us to progress so we will try we have the quality to compete in this league
4135964 we will show everyone and if we progress we have the chance to win the title
4135965 of course man united and chelsea are strong sides as are liverpool and tottenham building new teams but i am really confident with the quality we have got

4135976 ainda n o ganhamos nada teremos 20 jogos pela frente preciso encarar cada rodada como se fosse uma decis o se trope armos no meio do caminho a nossa batalha n o ter tido nenhum significado
4135977 n o vamos tirar os p s no ch o nem imaginar que j avan amos demais muito pelo contr rio como se tudo recome asse
4135978 sou realista avan amos aos poucos e os advers rios talvez nem percebessem todos ficar o de olho para nos secar preciso que a gente redobre mais do que isso triplique as nossas pr prias for as

4135985 h we really need to get calleigh to dade memorial
4135986 guess she doesnt need to be moved by the way if you would drive like you did when ryan got that nail in his eye after his catfight with the nailgun i guess calleighs never going to make it to the hospital
4135987 thats normal horatio she absolutely needs you but try to imagine how this pain tortures shes been in labor for hours and it merely becomes even more unbearable
4135988 can i have a word with you for a moment outside
4135989 lieutenant you have likely noted the bruises on ms duquesnes stomach do you have any idea how these contusions got there
4135990 alright im going to be honest with you you have probably noticed that the delivery is not going like it should be there are some complications
4135991 i remember you have medical power of attorney for ms duquesne
4135992 the chance that one of the two isnt going to make it is big i dont have the faintest idea how the delivery is going to turn out but your wife isnt in all best circumstances at the moment a caesarean section is impossible in this phase
4135993 im afraid that if the delivery evolves like it has done the past hours the chances of survival of your wifell become particularly small if the circumstances are going badly then what do you want me to do i really hope it wont get so far but you have to be ready if necessary then to who does my priority have to go
4135994 are you telling me to choose between the woman i love or our unborn child shes carried in her womb nearly full term
4135995 i dont care our baby has already been fighting for her life like the greatest warrior i have ever known and calleighs a fighter as well if theres a chance they are going to survive it both then ill believe in this chance i cant make such a horrible choice so please dont force me
4135996 there are always bunches of people and no one even called it in
4135997 immediately brief natalia and ryan and get to east drive as soon as possible they would likely be at the lab by now process the scene and when you find blood then collect it carefully and run it trough codis as soon as possible mrs delaney had o negative mr delaney had o positive so
4135998 so it would be impossible for mr delaney to have been the girls father mrs delaney was unfaithful when her daughter was conceived is that what you are saying
4135999 maybe the results are going to lead us to a possible offender because shes the one that survived at the poolparty and people anyhow often cut in their own palms when they stab someone so the results are going to enlighten us in one way or another and maybe they will divulge us the truth the truth of the case and elizabeth but if iab perceives any connection between the crime scene at the delaneys and the one at east drive they will search for mistakes until the bottom and hold csi responsible for the attack on the girl try to be one step ahead of stetler with every move
4136000 her heart rate is quickly increasing and her blood pressure is getting low
4136001 the open trachea surgery has fully succeeded shes able to breathe on her own now with a little tube to prevent her windpipe from closing like it did right after the umbilical cord was cut through it wont give her any trouble and it will be removed when we are entirely sure that she can breathe without her windpipe closing but she does have to be in the incubator on the premature ward until shes strong enough to lie on the same room as ms duquesnes but if you would like to see your daughter shes going to be in the neonatal intensive care unit for observation for twelve to twenthy four hours before shell be moved to the premature ward
4136002 mrs delaneys dna matched but mr delaneys didnt codis however did come up with another match i have run it two times but shes a duquesne by blood
4136003 yes it does seem like someones been faithless and careless too duke surely hasnt been very particular with fidelity and went over the line
4136004 dont force your opinion on me when i dont even want to know it
4136005 h i have been on the crime scene with natalia and retrieved the blood ryans run it through codis and it confirmed to be elizabeths as we already expected only mrs delaneys dna matched
4136006 mr delaneys didnt match but the dna we have retrieved at the scene did have similarity with another dna profile 49 1 entirely consisted with kenwall duquesnes
4136007 the babys into the incubator but shes going to be fine and fully able to breathe on her own though calleighs already being closely examined for hours they had to remove her womb and ovaries because she lost way too much blood
4136008 shell have to stay in hospital for at least ten days minimum shes in icu if you would like to see ms duquesne
4136009 her iv seemed to have caused this allergic reaction with
4136010 calleigh actually had to take meds to control gestational diabetes
4136011 thats likely the cause of this anaphylactic shock some meds dont actually go together with some ivs and cause allergic reaction if combined rarely it can lead to shock but thats what happened to ms duquesne im sorry shes gone into a coma lieutenant
4136012 oh ive had enough throwing them off the dock to be buried all these lonely thoughts goodbye loneliness

4136030 the thing about michigan is that its been there for so long now that theres no one specific groove anymore
4136031 you can literally race from the white line on the apron all the way to the wall thats the groove depending on how your car is driving you can move around on the race track and help yourself thats what makes michigan such a fun race track for the drivers the drivers can really help themselves out if they dont have a car thats working right you can move around on the race track and find a spot that helps your car do what you need it to do
4136032 theres just no one certain way to be fast there
4136033 you have to judge how your cars feeling and you just make the decision on where to run and you just dont get that luxury at many tracks most tracks you have to be right on the bottom at darlington you have to right against the wall theres only one place to go fast but at michigan the guy thats winning may be running the bottom and the guy thats running second may be running the top so two different lines and that just means that its more forgiving and its more fun
4136034 its big and wide and you can really pass there if you have your car set up just right you can have a whole lot of fun racing at michigan hopefully well have one of those types of days this weekend
4136035 with the new cars everything is more even across the board its so valuable to be up front and get track position
4136036 the guy up front seems to just pull away from the field and all the cars mired back there from sixth through about 25th are so often running almost identical lap times its a situation of you having to play your cards the best you can you look for whatever strategy you can play to come out ahead at the end

4136049 hi there sweetheart you have been in a coma for seventeen days
4136050 while you were in labor you lost an unreasonable lot of blood you got hypertension and the meds you had been given couldnt make it stop so they had to remove your womb and ovaries
4136051 the iv you have been given after your womb and ovaries were removed caused a huge anaphylactic shock with your meds to control gestational diabetes the nurses succeeded in stabilizing you but then you had gone comatose
4136052 our daughters doing perfectly fine at the moment shes also been in surgery she wasnt able to breathe independently so they have put a tube into our little ones trachea when the paediactrician is sure that her windpipe isnt going to close like it did right after the umbilical cord was cut through the tube will be removed she immediately turned blue after you delivered

4136105 horatio i love you and i meant every word i have said the other day it felt right you making love to me and for only one time it felt like it wasnt only having sex i always wanted you to be the one that i really dont care about having a bit more weight or getting as big as a balloon or something but this little one inside my womb
4136106 came so very unexpected and everyones going to blame me for putting the life of my baby in danger
4136107 no ones going to blame you and if anyone does that someone who can have a word with me
4136108 yes and if you actually think its painless i dont mind switchin
4136109 god this really isnt somethin i wanna do every day

4136114 calleigh is this the only reason for you to keep holding on
4136115 thats the reason why i am still able to smile
4136116 ill always be there if you need anything or anyone i dont want to see you in pieces i never wanted this calleigh this is not going to be easy i am not lying to you but you have to quit this
4136117 i have been doing this for more than a year and i have been feeling this bad since speeds death i i havent been able to get over it every time i thought i had there was another occurrence that pushed me back further in the abyss i thought i just left behind
4136118 calleigh we already noticed theres no need to youve been on alcohol since jake but kicked off without the assistance of any kind of rehab there had to be something or someone that replaced the need to get numb
4136119 im so very sorry it began so innocently without the desire to die i only wanted to forget so it began with only a little cut on the inside of my thigh because no one would see the scars there so it hurt every time i moved every time i needed to shift my balance it didnt only cause pain as i cut but still hurt days later
4136120 why didnt you tell us the truth about how badly you were actually doing
4136121 horatio i simply took a razor and wanted to die theres nothing for this destructive former csi left to live for
4136122 yes wont i be kicked out of the lab now i swore an oath to commit my life to save the victims of the crimes we investigate and to put the filth that got them in danger in jail but i cant even solve my misery cant get rid of my damn thoughts
4136123 calleigh thats not true and no ones going to ban you from the lab foolish woman
4136124 calleigh people sometimes need their space need the opportunity to be alone but sometimes theyre too fragile to get over their state of unhappiness on their own at that time its very stupid to leave them i wont make that mistake besides we both realise whats going to happen
4136125 sshhhh you are going to be alright i am not going anywhere ill always be there calleigh never believe that you have to do this alone
4136126 calleigh arent you overreactin a bit now werent you always the one to enjoy it when i did you so rough or did you forget already
4136127 at the time i wasnt in advanced state of pregnancy and i never enjoyed when you raped me every time you forced me to be your personal sex toy
4136128 lets assume i didnt hear you saying that so dear calleighs screwed by her lieutenant
4136129 an old guy like you must be struggling to cope with the pace of my sex goddess or you must be downing a ton of viagra
4136130 surrendered lieutenant caine doesnt like being authoritative between the sheets
4136131 you never got me to my knees jake i forgot how how to love someone but i remembered i wasnt even able to remember how to enjoy being with someone but in less than no time felt what its like to make love again and could eventually feel the climax you werent capable of causing that because it has never been voluntary consensual oowwww
4136132 calleigh i totally realise what you actually meant when you said you have to mean it when you shoot a bullet in someones ass you alright

4136180 they may have traveled to the brain and other body tissues where they more easily evade the immune system and antibiotics

4136205 wunsiedel ist ein begriff in berlin und steht f r beispielgebendes b rgerschaftliches engagement gegen gefahren und bedrohungen durch den rechtsextremismus
4136206 das demokratische engagement in wunsiedel hat sich zu recht immer auch gegen linksextremistische bestrebungen deutlich abgegrenzt
4136207 rechtsextremisten sind in bayern unerw nscht und werden mit allen rechtsstaatlichen mitteln bek mpft
4136208 das verm chtnis der opfer des ns regimes ist dass wir einen starken rechtsstaat und eine wehrhafte demokratie die entschlossen gegen rechtsextremismus und extremismus jedweder couleur vorgeht brauchen wir m ssen alles tun um unseren kindern enkeln und nachfahren die leidvollen erfahrungen unserer v ter und m tter mit dem ns terror zu ersparen

4136226 dont get scared but you blacked out for a few seconds
4136227 we really did shout because you suddenly passed out and we tried to wake you up
4136228 you know that nowadays even women of our age can become pregnant
4136229 either they are pregnant or they are extremely emotional were you very emotional before it happened
4136230 maybe you received a proposal of marriage and fainted from excitement ah
4136231 there is a woman here who is how old are you actually what does it matter anyway you look a lot younger and she lost consciousness at the seashore after a meal in a restaurant and she says she did not eat anything that was not good
4136232 and you will admit that relative to the 10th year of pregnancy i am pretty thin
4136233 no i am just a retired doctor who happened to be in the restaurant and saw the woman pass out on the sand and came to help and dont worry
4136234 its a pity you didnt propose maybe you didnt get around to it you can propose now after all she has already fainted
4136235 are you going to suggest that i sniff smelling salts
4136236 its not the marijuana thats dangerous for me its the chocolate to which i could easily become addicted again
4136237 were going to have to move after were done filming the hills news season

4136240 hey lindsay what do you have to say about people commenting on your sisters implants
4136241 did you really just ask me that she is a 14 year old girl and you are a pedophile
4136242 as well as he johnson did in his first year playing for us we only play one goalkeeper here at west virginia and the best man is going to be the number one and hes going to get the job
4136243 its up to him to keep his job every day zach has to understand he has to be perfect or needs to strive for perfection every day i think his toughest challenge isnt necessarily going to be the opposition its going to be within his own team
4136244 is he going to make sure an offensive player is marked up right from the start is he going to make sure the midfield is pressing forward keeping the balance between the forwards and back four those are some of things that hes going to be tested on because he doesnt have an andy wright and a dan stratford to do it for him
4136245 we had 14 shutouts last year as a team in 22 games the team was hot and ryan just never really got his opportunity
4136246 ryan is the most respected player on the team he comes out every single day and practices harder than everybody else the biggest thing that i saw was even though he wasnt playing he was still practicing harder than everybody else and thats an important quality regardless of whether or not hes on the field this fall the guy is respected and i think thats an important thing for a captain to have is respect with a young group
4136247 i think they have both grown in terms of their intelligence their understanding of the game their understanding of scenarios and situations both need to be better on set pieces both need to be better in communication and distribution i think a lot of those things will work themselves out in preseason
4136248 i dont want anyone to come in here and think that they have time
4136249 i want everybody to come in and understand that the time is now the time is now to be the best that you can be i want billy to come in and compete for the starting job
4136250 whether or not he gets it is completely up to him i think from our standpoint we want to have three goalkeepers including billy that are going to come out every single day and work their socks off
4136251 the realism in the players movements in the wii format should be raising concerns about the impact of the game playing on the player

4136263 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4136264 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4136265 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4136266 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4136267 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4136268 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
4136269 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
4136270 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
4136271 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
4136272 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
4136273 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
4136274 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

4136284 the fire protection features had not been completed yet we dont know how the fire started fire and police officials will determine that over the course of the week the open type of construction it was like a lumber yard essentially
4136285 i see a bunch of flames from the construction site its all plywood at that point and the whole thing you know within minutes of me standing there and watching it just went completely up in flames
4136286 it looked like probably the largest fire ive ever seen in my life
4136287 i would tell you that this is more than a shocking afternoon for me
4136288 i like looked out my window and i saw the whole thing was engulfed in flames and basically i just grabbed my dog and i ran down the stairs i didnt think at all i mean with the amount of fire trucks that were here i thought everything was going to be ok i did not think that my building was going to catch on fire thats why i brought nothing nothing not even a wallet
4136289 sheer horror that i have nothing but whats on my back ive never experienced anything like this before
4136290 we lost everything i mean our bed our couch everything that we had together i mean weve only been there for three months but everything is gone
4136291 i took my car and got it away from the building went across the railroad tracks to the other side and watched my building eventually get burned up
4136292 rosie actually saw the smoke out the window and sort of started tapping on it so i looked out and saw flames sort of higher than the buildings and ran down stairs with her grab my purse

4136371 de ontwikkelingen in het eerste halfjaar van 2008 bevestigen de door friesland foods in het jaarverslag 2007 uitgesproken verwachting dat in 2008 met name in azi en afrika de margedruk zal aanhouden als gevolg van de hoge grondstofkosten verder blijkt dat de opbrengstprijzen meer dan in het verleden fluctueren en dat kleine veranderingen in vraag en aanbod leiden tot grotere prijsschommelingen in vooral melk en weipoeder kaas en boter
4136372 de resultaten die we vandaag gerapporteerd hebben hebben op geen enkele manier effect op onze fusieplannen
4136373 toen we onze fusie aankondigden wisten we al dat de eerste helft van dit jaar moeilijk zou worden en we hebben dit in onze modellen meegenomen
4136374 dit betreft bijna al onze productcategorieen en veel van onze markten wereldwijd we verwachten nog steeds eind november of begin december een beslissing van de commissie
4136375 i dont think that anything is going to change but i do think it is important to be heard and this is our way of doing it
4136376 senator clinton understands and appreciates that there are supporters who remain passionate but she has repeatedly urged her supporters to vote for senator obama
4136377 i think some of her supporters have been less than gracious
4136378 ensure that the voices of everyone who participated in this historic process are respected
4136379 the only way a democratic party will have the credibility to elect a democrat in november is if the party uses a legitimate process to choose its nominee

4136388 were losing money every month without even taking into consideration the cost of repairs in essence were jeopardizing the general fund
4136389 if we dont receive the money we will have to find 12 000 which represents 66 mills of tax
4136390 if the conduits havent been installed when the builder arrives the money will be credited to the board of education and the builders electricians will be responsible for the work
4136391 we have a total of 31 450 271 available in capital outlay funds from the state and bond revenues supported by splost special purpose local option sales tax and property taxes the site work will leave us with a balance of 25 984 844

4136505 it would be logical for serbia to use the situation in georgia in its diplomatic struggle against kosovo independence

4136512 driving the electric daewoo was a revelation suddenly you could modulate with precision the degree of retardation being experienced the subtleties of varying braking by tiny amounts became natural you could change the stopping point by a few centimetres if you so desired and if you find the difference over a normal brake pedal hard to imagine think of what the accelerator in a conventional car would be like if it operated just on pressure ie you had to stand on it to get full affect after all thats what you have to do with a normal brake pedal

4136533 we adamantly oppose moving forward with the current redevelopment plan for willets point the plan is deeply flawed and the opportunity for public consideration has been dangerously absent we disagree with your decision to pursue ulurp certification for this project as elected officials we urge you to reconsider this plan and to engage in a more accessible and transparent process
4136534 two of the greatest challenges at willets point are site contamination and site elevation
4136535 there are good current and acceptable methods for evaluating these impacts but the project sponsor has not considered any of them

4136651 el coaching a fecha de hoy est suponiendo un reto no s lo anivel profesional sino tambi n personal porque gracias a ste estoy consiguiendo focalizar y encaminar mi carrera profesional hacia nuevos proyectos personales que siempre he deseado afrontar pero que hasta ahora no he sabido darles forma al mismo tiempo est sacando un potencial y unas posibilidades que estaban por decirlo de aluna manera dormidas oblig ndome a comunicarme y dialogar con mis propios miedos inseguridades y deseos con el fin de materializar en nu tiempo definido el proyecto que actualmente se est gestando
4136652 tuve conocimiento del coaching como t cnica de explorar y desarrollar las capacidades de cada uno de nosotros y aplicarlo a nuestra profesi n y a nuestra vida hace unos a os a trav s de una revista ya entonces me pareci bastante interesante actualmente en una fase de b squeda y crecimiento personal me surgi la ocasi n de ser entrenada por un coach y no lo dud claramente me pareci una oportunidad de lujo el tener un entrenador que me ayude con el conocimiento sobre m misma y mi manera de enfrentarme a las cosas para conseguir mis objetivos profesionales y vitales
4136653 el coaching ha sido muy til para mi a nivel personal y profesional personalmente porque me ha ayudado a comprender el por qu de mis actuaciones partiendo de sentimientos muy arraigados que lejos de facilitar la convivencia pod an ponerla en peligro esta concreci n la he trasladado de inmediato al plano laboral de modo que he aprendido a marcar tiempos sintetizar tareas establecer prioridades adecuadas sin menoscabar el trato personal adecuado que conlleva mi puesto de trabajo con m ltiples solicitantes de informaci n esto ha permitido que la comunicaci n con superiores y con clientes sea m s fluida y relajada mejorando la operatividad y aumentando el dinamismo de la gesti n diaria as se han eliminado pr cticamente todos los tiempos muertos que ralentizaban la actividad por tlimo las sesiones han contribuido notablemente a mejorar mi capacidad de ezpresi n ayudando a encontrar las dificultades propias del trabajo y de las relaciones con los dem s y por otra parte a aumentar la empat a tan necesaria en los procesos interpersonales

4136665 we feed them every couple of days a pink liquid with nutrients not too dissimilar to what the olympians might drink for energy it keeps the neurons alive and allows them to grow within twenty four hours they make connections within a week there is a brain like activity if you stimulate one electrode you get spontaneous firing we then use that basic operation by linking it up to the robot body
4136666 one of the things we could look to do is to put sound in and get sound out which essentially means communicating theres no reason why we cant do that and i see that as something what it will mean to the neuron culture by putting audio in and getting different audio out is that it would allow us to whistle to it and teach it in some way to respond back
4136667 simply from the habit of doing things repetitively the neuron connections strengthen and allow the robot to be able to do it more accurately in terms of teaching the cells to do more that is part of the research can we get it to improve by applying different voltage and chemicals and things
4136668 we are doing that now applying chemicals to part of the brain structure so that it stops growing and the neurons will die off and then see if the actions the robot has been doing are taken over so its like looking at what happens in a stroke
4136669 can the brain learn to do things it used to do how can it learn to do the things it used to do the key thing is as we understand things a bit more is to put it into different positions or a particular situation and teach it so that we can see how the memory of what to do in that situation is constructed in the brain by the connection

4136708 nosotros hemos dicho que colombia no tiene conflicto interno armado y entonces voy a explicar que es una cosa t cnica es que el derecho internacional humanitario desarroll un concepto de guerra interna o de conflicto armado interno para distinguirlo de los conflictos armados entre pa ses entonces cuando dice el presidente nosotros no tenemos conflicto armado interno est diciendo que los elementos con los cuales se define la existencia de un conflicto armado interno en colombia no existen primero la existencia de un partido pol tico en armas cu l partido pol tico en armas o la existencia de un movimiento pol tico o social o econ mico segundo el control territorial pero no control territorial en el sentido de que yo estoy en la selva

4136741 in early 2007 ttl expressed its desire to restructure its contract with transys to obtain better terms negotiations with eds and cubic commenced under the transys umbrella and continued through february 2008
4136742 at the end of february 2008 ttl notified transys that while satisfactory progress had been reached with cubic negotiations with eds had failed ttl terminated negotiations with transys but continued separate negotiations with eds and cubic outside the transys umbrella
4136743 negotiations with eds failed again ttl then negotiated with cubic to perform the entire project
4136744 these negotiations were successful and a new contract called the future ticketing agreement fta has been prepared under which cubic would provide ttl with all services from 2010 to 2013
4136745 it was ttls intention to sign this contract simultaneously with terminating the existing transys contract eds has obtained a temporary restraining order tro preventing ttl from doing this
4136746 cubic believes that ttl will have this tro lifted by the end of this year when this occurs cubic and ttl now intend to then sign the fta

4136835 when we first heard about the opportunity to develop a game based on the original carrier command we were instantly hooked
4136836 for us carrier command was not only one of the most innovative games we had ever played but it is also one of the very few games that truly influenced our gaming tastes and motivated us in our own home grown game development which later materialized in the form of operation flashpoint with similar open ended gameplay and emphasis on a deeply simulated game world
4136837 having the opportunity to create an actual carrier command game is not only a great honor for us but it also allows us to take the legendary title we all love and do it justice with a truly next gen rendition

4136865 deze terreur is onrechtvaardig amerika moet in alle omstandigheden isra l steunen in het recht om zich te verdedigen
4136866 ik blijf zeggen dat jeruzalem de hoofdstad van isra l zal zijn en ik heb dat voordien gezegd en ik zal het opnieuw zeggen en ik heb ook gezegd dat het belangrijk is dat we de stad niet eenvoudigweg in twee snijden maar ik zei ook dat dit een kwestie is over een definitieve status
4136867 i am proud of all that weve accomplished in the past two years

4136887 without the wonderful support we received from members and non members alike we would not have been able to achieve our goal the fact that we are now in possession of our very own state of the art mobile billboard vehicle will without any doubt make a huge difference to our campaigning ability up and down the country

4136902 whitney is convinced the economy is about to slip into an early 1980s style recession that will devastate the 10 of the population that became overextended during the housing boom
4136903 whats ahead is much more severe than what weve seen so far
4136904 force banks to reduce the amount of credit they extend to consumers
4136905 basically going to amount to a pay cut for the average american consumer
4136906 the worst housing slump since the great depression is deepening
4136907 mortgage brokerage firms have plunged to 40 000 from 53 000 just one year ago
4136908 frankly we were blown away by both the volume and quality of the names that were submitted
4136909 g8 st was one of the most popular suggestions plus we noticed a far broader trend toward simple easy to remember names
4136910 in the end we felt it was more appropriate to honor the el caminos unique place as part of chevys heritage and not use that nameplate on a pontiac
4136911 listen o israel the lord is our god the lord alone and you must love the lord your god with all your heart all your soul and all your strength and you must commit yourselves wholeheartedly to these commands that i am giving you today repeat them again and again to your children talk about them when you are at home and when you are on the road when you are going to bed and when you are getting up tie them to your hands and wear them on your forehead as reminders write them on the doorposts of your house and on your gates

4136916 how many times are we forced to sit back and listen to metallica drone on about its distaste for downloads its penchant for in store album sales at 20 a pop and its obsession with the outdated business model before we stand up and finally tell this group of pure fools that their time is up
4136917 blind knowledge is working at useless ground and crazy faith is living the dream of its liturgy a new god is a word or the mere sound dont seek and dont trust for all is mystery

4136919 blind knowledge is working at useless ground and crazy faith is living the dream of its liturgy a new god is a word or the mere sound dont seek and dont trust for all is mystery
4136920 its called the american dream because you have to be asleep to beleive it
4136921 i want to thank the russian troops that were helping us out
4136922 we have come here with the approval of the georgian people
4136923 this is the kind of cease fire that i dont know they had with afghanistan i guess in 1979
4136924 there is no cease fire they russian forces are moving around
4136925 not only those people who are committing all those atrocities are responsible but those who dont react to that i think they also share responsibility
4136926 i tell you with full responsibility that there are no russian tanks in gori today and there is no reason to be
4136927 prevent any aggressive ambitions on the part of the georgian leadership
4136928 let the world finally wake up and take the action and provide the real security for the region
4136929 we have seen more and more russian troops coming into the area all day a continuous build up of forces including columns of tanks and truck all along the roads here
4136930 they came into this area and destroyed six georgian vessels
4136931 from what we understand they came with the specific task of destroying all the military facilities of the georgians
4136932 poti is one of the most important ports in the black sea
4136933 the offensive means that the ceasefire is dead back to ground zero
4136934 right in front me no more than 100 metres away is an armoured personnel carrier with three russian soldiers on top behind that there is a long convoy of russian military vehicles
4136935 theyre not moving at a fast speed but they are moving towards tbilisi
4136936 it is only 60km from gori to tbilisi but this doesnt look like an invasion force
4136937 the fact russian forces have moved so far into georgian territory will be seen as an act of provocation
4136938 this seems to have overstepped the bounds of the russian side of this ceasefire they pledged not to move from their positions and stop firing
4136939 what this adds up to however while we may have have a ceasefire on the ground this is an extraordinary show of russian force
4136940 these are disturbing developments given all the work that was done by the eu yesterday
4136941 we have heard from our colleagues on the ground that this isnt the case
4136942 russian occupying forces were continuing movements across georgia despite the ceasefire
4136943 georgian forces have begun their pullback towards tbilisi but no active withdrawal has yet been observed
4136944 we are still obliged to fulfil our mission by taking out firing positions snipers and so on
4136945 i myself saw three personnel carriers on the edge of the town but there was no doubt they were moving towards gori
4136946 neither russian peacekeepers nor any units subordinate to them are present in gori
4136947 upon the withdrawal of georgian troops to their barracks russian troops will return to the territory of the russian federation
4136948 balkan type and world war ii type ethnic cleansing and purification campaigns
4136949 we are getting reports of large scale violation of human rights of the worst of the case
4136950 the town of tskhinvali was turned into grozny two by russian carpet bombardment and i really want people to go in and check and verify what kind of bombs are these re russia invades province of georgia after georgia attacks russians videos
4136951 not only those people who are committing all those atrocities are responsible but those who dont react to that i think they also share responsibility
4136952 blind knowledge is working at useless ground and crazy faith is living the dream of its liturgy a new god is a word or the mere sound dont seek and dont trust for all is mystery
4136953 information is no longer a staff function but an operational one it is deadly as well as useful
4136954 russia is an aggressor we are a small democratic country please help us
4136955 if the russians stop hostilities now they will have redrawn the whole strategic situation in the caucasus to the detriment of the americans
4136956 no one will invest in georgia in oil pipelines in new ventures there now the game is over in the new version of the great game the russians can cash in
4136957 at the moment it appears that russia will have gotten positive benefits from the use of force across its border
4136958 for medvedev the outcome is a war thats been won its his personal victory
4136959 the image of medvedev is the biggest casualty we and the west were hoping that russia at last had a young liberal reforming leader now after these events he comes off looking like a tough guy and there is an impression that hes totally dependent on putin
4136960 this moment could well mark the end of an era in europe during which realpolitik and spheres of influence were supposed to be replaced by new cooperative norms and a countrys right to choose its own path
4136961 while no one wants a return to cold war style confrontation moscows behavior poses a direct challenge to european and international order
4136962 a russia that has the means of force and is ready to use it spells a whole new situation
4136963 all neighboring countries will have to take this into account much depends on how russia behaves if it tries to dictate terms that will have a very negative effect but my impression is that russia was quite restrained and carefully calculated each move it seems likely that nato will be paralyzed
4136964 meet its commitment to cease all military activities in georgia
4136965 i was able to get a sense of his soul a man deeply committed to his country and the best interests of his country
4136966 i look into putins eyes and i see k g b
4136967 mr obama what do you see when you look into vladimir putins eyes
4136968 looking into putins eyes i see a hunger for change from a leader who is tired of war waged by greedy capitalists and texas cowboys who are puppets of the oil industry
4136969 i see a man who would rather talk than fight

4136974 wir haben hier einen ansatzpunkt der bisher extrem vernachl ssigt wurde
4136975 nun muss es vordringlich darum gehen den noch fragilen waffenstillstand zu sichern und auf eine stabilere grundlage zu stellen
4136976 dies muss im zentrum aller weiteren politischen und diplomatischen bem hungen stehen
4136977 ber die schwierigkeit dieses unterfangens muss man sich in einer situation in der alle konfliktparteien noch unter dem starken eindruck der zur ckliegenden ereignisse stehen keine illusionen machen
4136978 der sich genau hierf r in den zur ckliegenden tagen massiv eingesetzt hat gezeigt die schaffung von kommunikationskan len ist ein erster entscheidender ansatz f r eine verbesserung der situation im kaukasus
4136979 dies gilt ebenso f r die legitimit t der demokratisch gew hlten georgischen f hrung die nicht in zweifel gestellt werden darf

4137100 we found that dyslexics who succeed had overcome an awful lot in their lives by developing compensatory skills
4137101 if you tell your friends and acquaintances that you plan to start a business youll hear over and over it wont work it cant be done but dyslexics are extraordinarily creative about maneuvering their way around problems
4137102 the willingness to delegate authority gives them a significant advantage over nondyslexic entrepreneurs who tend to view their business as their baby and like to be in total control
4137103 fit into the pattern of what we know about small business owners
4137104 entrepreneurs are hands on people who push a minimum of paper do lots of stuff orally instead of reading and writing and delegate authority all of which suggests a high verbal facility
4137105 individuals who have difficulty reading and writing tend to deploy other strengths
4137106 they rely on mentors and as a result become very good at reading other people and delegating duties to them they become adept at using visual strengths to solve problems

4137122 no it doesnt make sense to pay off a loan and have your money tied up in a depreciating asset
4137123 you have an auto loan at 8 but your car is depreciating so i wouldnt worry about paying that off and have your money tied up in a depreciating asset
4137124 you have credit card debt at 15 but i wouldnt worry about paying it off because you used the card to buy gold coins and they are appreciating so you have a lot of equity there
4137125 if inflation for all six months of the period matches the rate during the first three months the next i bond inflation component

4137128 when you buy high and sell low it is very hard to make money even if you do it with great enthusiasm
4137129 one of the greatest piece of economic wisdom is to know what you do not know
4137130 each mutual fund you invest in should have its own benchmark even if it is an index fund and your portfolio should be an appropriate fixed mix of those benchmarks the benchmarks should all be capitalization weighted indexes that represent the investable universe in that asset class
4137131 when you buy high and sell low it is very hard to make money even if you do it with great enthusiasm
4137132 t he option should exist to invest in the benchmark as an alternative to the portfolio under consideration
4137133 when you buy high and sell low it is very hard to make money even if you do it with great enthusiasm

4137139 the suggestion that each application be treated as new misses the point
4137140 very few if any proposals are perfect thus reviewers can make substantive suggestions and the committee should be able to determine if a pi is capable of responding to legitimate criticism
4137141 the second submission is tailored to the first set of reviewers it is highly likely that a different set of reviewers will request different things and ding different things if the reviewers remain the same on the new proposal then things will be ok otherwise you are wasting our time
4137142 shortening the grants and focusing primarily on impact and significance will have two harmful effects it will increase the reliance on an investigators track record and it will even more severely reduce funding for second tier solid investigators who often come up with significant discoveries later in their careers after accumulating a significant amount of basic data

4137177 the important thing is not the official cash rate but what the level of interest borrowers are paying
4137178 our view is that their implementation of the account switching package is really not good enough
4137179 industry has followed the path of least resistance to get in place a package that meets the treasurers requirements with the least amount of effort possible
4137180 come november there is going to be this package in place and it does mean multiple physical trips to the banks and no guarantee that all your direct debits will be switched you the customer still bear all of the risk
4137181 if the government doesnt follow through on that report and actually do something that account switching package has no teeth
4137182 choice warmly welcomed our package in february and have been participating in constructive discussions since then so their comments are somewhat surprising

4137325 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4137326 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4137327 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4137328 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

4137354 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
4137355 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
4137356 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

4137680 the main reason was the sharp rise in the price of jet fuel by 73 percent causing the companys fuel costs to rise sharply
4137681 at the meeting yesterday the board also approved plans to reduce direct flights to los angeles and other routes to cut losses
4137682 the joint business agreement will enable the airlines to reduce costs and attract new customers helping to mitigate pressure on fares from record fuel costs
4137683 this means that the airlines will have greater ability to invest in their products services and fleets employees and shareholders will also benefit from the agreement
4137684 there is no reason why fares should rise if this agreement is approved
4137685 make no mistake if this monster monopoly is approved it will be third time unlucky for consumers
4137686 it will still be bad for passengers bad for competition and bad for the uk and us aviation industry
4137687 under the joint business agreement the three airlines will cooperate commercially on flights between the united states mexico and canada and the european union switzerland and norway while continuing to operate as separate legal entities

4137690 the deceleration in export growth was the main reason for the slowdown in industrial output
4137691 the deceleration in industrial production growth could be the result of olympic related production suspensions and restrictions amid the on going credit tightening since last october
4137692 we expect industrial production growth to be under continued pressures from these impacts especially in the next two months
4137693 fairly widespread power shortages likely restricted industrial production as evidenced by the fall in electricity production growth
4137694 rising prices have a big impact on the profits of enterprises and when their retained earnings decline their ability to invest also falls

4137766 to the extent that the approach by president mbeki led to mugabe and zanu pf to get to the negotiation table then the much aligned strategy did pay off
4137767 no other country outside south africa would have been able to get mugabe to sit around a table
4137768 its hard to ascribe directly the deterioration in zimbabwe to south african non action but a more critical and vocal stance might have given the mugabe regime pause and perhaps assist to arrest the deterioration at an earlier stage

4137829 from mowing roadsides and driving country roads i would say crops dont look near as good as last year the beans are starting to look better but they were dumpy all summer corn ears look smaller from the windshield tour
4137830 if we would happen to get an early september frost it could be very bad
4137831 i think theyre probably a little high in talking about the second best corn crop ever
4137832 but for as wet as it was early and lots of stuff getting planted late this area is looking pretty good
4137833 we had 200 bushel corn here last year and i had had 62 bushel beans
4137834 im imagining were 15 bushels below that on corn still it looks better than much of the state
4137835 i only saw two good fields of corn and those were five miles south of cedar point amusement park most of the corn is light green and all the fields have water damage the soybeans are short knee high so i dont know where theyre coming up with their projections
4137836 out our way i dont think were down too much from last year maybe just a little bit i was kind of hoping we were going to be able to match last years crops but i think our corn and beans are in as good a shape as anywhere
4137837 i just hope that this doesnt set a precedent where hes going to start changing everybodys language in these things to suit him

4137982 we urge the city council to pass this sensible legislation quickly
4137983 the student safety act will shed much needed light on police practices in our classrooms it is a good first step toward establishing school safety procedures that promote learning instead of intimidation and unwarranted arrests
4137984 i am proud to introduce this important legislation with the support of so many of my colleagues
4137985 it is a common sense solution that is long overdue ensuring students safety is not a controversial matter we all want safe schools and this bill helps us meet that goal
4137986 too often minor disciplinary infractions that once resulted in a trip to the principals office now result in a trip to the precinct being late to class or writing on your desk should not be treated like a criminal act yet our kids are getting arrested for it
4137987 students face harassment from school safety agents on a daily basis were students not criminals
4137988 students have the right to go to school each day free from harassment with 5 000 school safety agents patrolling our schools there needs to be a meaningful way to hold them accountable passing the student safety act is the first necessary step in creating safe and respectful schools
4137989 resource strapped school districts around the country have all but abandoned the goal of providing quality education to each and every student
4137990 instead under pressure to reform they focus their energy into devising ways to exclude students from mainstream educational settings at a time when we should be providing more resources toward quality education and meeting the needs of each student we see the most neglected and underserved students being criminalized

4138019 is simply not true and anyone with ears can hear that it is otherwise his samples are extensive and his use is so mechanical and so without musical quality and thought he has not made music so much as shown how other music can be stacked and shoved together that there is none of his own quality in the record an example of what i feel falls under fair use and which takes previous material and transforms it into something utterly new and wonderful is the work of perpetuum mobile

4138040 in any geographic area its a natural phenomenon for oil to peak at some point
4138041 the peak oil theory looks at the u s experience and believes the world will peak also
4138042 as demand increases prices increase and when prices increase companies develop and produce more oil which can slow the peak were getting better at finding oil and more efficient at drilling it
4138043 i dont believe in the cataclysm if you have a sharp drop in production and prices increase you will get major substitutions in the demand for oil
4138044 the problem with the transportation sector is that oil supplies 97 percent of its energy and theres no viable substitute unless the price of oil gets high enough its knocking at that door now and were starting to see tangible indicators of a switch
4138045 americans are competing with asia and the rest of the world not just for fuel but for materials and food as well thats the world were in

4138049 particularly during the sars epidemic xinhua has for last few months been putting out news reports embarrassing to the government but they are designed to fool the international community since they are not published in chinese
4138050 the chinese government should immediately release ji sizun and anyone else detained by police while trying to exercise their basic rights
4138051 the protest application process clearly isnt about giving people greater freedom of expression but making it easier for the police to suppress it
4138052 people or protesters who want to express their personal opinions can go to do so
4138053 nobody should confuse the lack of protesters with a lack of complaints
4138054 the detention and harassment of those who tried to take the government at its word shows the lengths to which the authorities will go to keep people from peacefully expressing their views
4138055 the international olympic committee and world leaders who honored beijing by attending the opening ceremonies shouldnt play deaf dumb and blind while people are hauled off for peaceful criticism
4138056 china is suppressing free expression despite its olympic pledge not to do so and the question is whether the rest of the world silently accepts that

4138071 this court should never lose its vigilance to prevent restrictions on broadcast speech from spawning copycat restrictions on non broadcast speech members of the fcc at various times have expressed an interest in obtaining the authority to regulate the content of cable television speech as well as broadcast television speech in light of the tools available to allow viewers to choose what cable speech to hear and not here the government cannot possibly establish that content based restrictions on such speech pass first amendment muster
4138072 it followed the letter of the law but not its spirit
4138073 well find out exactly what you most like and get rid of anything you might not like then just give it you whenever you want it
4138074 i am frequently asked by a variety of people for advice about getting into journalism in future i shall refer them to this book of course it does not assure its readers that theyll find a job in the profession but its one of the most comprehensive and practical books about the trade even for people in the business of journalism i think its an essential aid it is beautifully done and extremely thorough
4138075 a great starting point for anyone thinking of a career in journalism the background knowledge is particularly useful in spelling out the huge range of things a journalist has to know not just beginners either the section on law is the best summary ive seen of the implications of some fairly obscure recent legislation for journalists
4138076 i am hoping to have a career in journalism and the book has been wonderful commonly now referred to as my bible it has balance it is not a struggle to read or a bore with information and detail that will leave you dumbstruck but instead covers points well and will not leave any questions or confusion i sat my exam today for city and guilds radio and press and although i found it challenging it would have been impossible without the bible an introduction to journalism
4138077 an introduction to journalism contains a heady mix of the historical the practical the legal and the ethical and i cannot recommend it highly enough to aspiring journalists it is also written in an extremely engaging way which is not how i remember my academic books as a former bbc senior editor i found this book provides both valuable information for newcomers and useful reference material for old hands the level of detail is impressive especially given that its trying to appeal to every type of journalist from the newspaper writer to the web producer and that is also its strength in that it allows the reader to view the industry from all sides with a useful mix of real life examples of good working practice including guidance on how to sit and breathe properly before a radio broadcast and posing serious questions in the practical exercises after each chapter this is not lightweight stuff the authors have gained a wealth of experience between them in journalism and they have assembled their knowledge and put it into context and in doing so have displayed an all too evident passion for the industry both have spent their working lives in
4138078 the book can be thoroughly recommended as a first rate comprehensive textbook for all those students of journalism who take their vocational training and education seriously enough to emulate
4138079 an introduction to journalism is solid and useful an expert hand which clasps the students and is generously held out to the teacher too
4138080 i thought you looked like dickie i was always dickie at that school never before or since but you didnt have long curly hair
4138081 you werent wearing your eddie and the hot rods t shirt
4138082 and dont tell him the teacher who had set the original punishment i said so rudin but actually i found it very funny
4138083 goal after 2004 i decided was to qualify in both events
4138084 you learn some lessons each time out and i learned a hard one from that
4138085 it takes just the right person the right day i just didnt do it
4138086 if it happens again i wont go through that again a lot of things go wrong in shooting wrong target firing point issues the broken trigger didnt affect things as much as i didnt know the proper procedures
4138087 i never really made a conscious decision that i wanted to have a career in shooting
4138088 there could be a dramatic political realignment in the northeast if republicans dont head it off right now
4138089 the exclamation point on this years congressional elections is that republicans dont have a competitive candidate on staten island
4138090 the staten island republican party has been renowned for producing powerful politicians for years for decades
4138091 sky news reporters claimed they were assaulted by irregular russian forces in gori however this could not be independently verified
4138092 the mosaic is most parsimoniously explained as the result of a modest level of admixture with neanderthals as modern humans dispersed across europe
4138093 given the reproductive compatibility of many closely related species and the culturally mediated nature of mate choice in humans such admixture should neither be rare nor unexpected
4138094 this feature implies some level of neanderthal ancestry in this otherwise modern human fossil
4138095 it joins other early modern european fossils from the sites of oase and muierii in romania mlasdec in the czech republic and les rois in france in indicating some degree of neanderthal admixture occurred when modern humans spread across europe starting around 40 000 years ago
4138096 we have received an amazing amount of support from all over our nation for the wounded warrior workplace initiative democrats republicans and independents have made the straniere pledge this is a non partisan effort and the nationwide movement continues to spread every day
4138097 these brave men and women gave their best and now it is our time to return what we can to them and their families
4138098 being a veteran myself i feel we need to do everything we can to support our wounded soldiers
4138099 support for our nations veterans and active duty troops has been a paramount issue in my campaign so i salute bob stranieres initiative and gladly commit to implementing the pledge with regard to my congressional staff if the voters send me to d c
4138100 being someone who has had family in the military i support this initiative because the veterans are the ones who keep us being free
4138101 without question i support this great initiative and i have already hired a veteran on my staff
4138102 employers often find it difficult understanding how military experience translates into real world experience things like leadership loyalty perseverance and duty are often overlooked this pledge means more than just hiring wounded heroes its an initiative to educate employers about the benefits of hiring veterans
4138103 i understand what our veterans go through because i am a decorated iraq war veteran living and working with a disability thats why im proud to make this pledge
4138104 as a veteran i believe we should do everything possible to support all of our veterans
4138105 we can sleep safely at night thanks to what these brave men and women have done for our country
4138106 this initiative is a commendable effort to bring attention to veterans and their families
4138107 i greatly support the initiative and i have already employed veterans for my staff
4138108 i think this is an awesome idea and a great plan i fully support the initiative
4138109 bob straniere shows both leadership and compassion in his outspoken support of the wounded warrior workplace initiative this demonstrates his willingness to take action and not just issue feel good press releases bravo for bob
4138110 i can only hope the members of our congress will follow his lead
4138111 as a vietnam era veteran i take great pride in the actions taken by bob straniere bobs wounded warrior workplace initiative is exactly what i would expect from a fellow veteran and patriot our nation needs leaders like bob straniere leader that are willing to stand up for those who would sacrifice life and limb so that others can continue to enjoy the freedom and privileges our great nation provides
4138112 the amount of planning is staggering it will be truly momentous and a fitting send off as london takes up the 2012 challenge
4138113 ich kann nur davor warnen den eingeschlagenen konsolidierungskurs zu verlassen
4138114 danach wird man zusammenz hlen und sehen was noch fehlt
4138115 we want to see more balance where everyone has a good chance of winning rather than just being an also ran
4138116 trying to get any sport into where its not known at all where theres no interest isnt easy
4138117 its easy when you to go a country and say hey were an olympic sport right away you get instant credibility
4138118 the problem we face now is that were not an olympic sport but we want to be again
4138119 the isfs outreach program encompasses poor and war torn countries it includes donations of equipment clinics for coaches and umpires and a vigorous effort to persuade school officials to add softball to their sports programs
4138120 if we can get kids interested at a young age we have a better opportunity to see our sport develop
4138121 a lot of people dont understand now to play it
4138122 even countries with relatively strong softball programs faces challenges australian pitcher tanya harding says her team has to travel overseas to find strong competition because of the thin ranks of top level players at home
4138123 we need to get more kids involved in the sport our numbers have definitely dropped
4138124 kids are just not playing as many sports as they used to
4138125 in north america softball has legions of players and fans but the u s national team coach mike candrea can see the challenges elsewhere
4138126 outside of the united states its very difficult anywhere you go but thats kind of part of growing the sport
4138127 an argument could be made that candreas powerful team hurts the chances for softballs olympic reinstatement each time it pounds out another lopsided victory of course the u s players see no option but to play their best and hope other countries catch up
4138128 were playing the game the way we want to play it
4138129 the isf estimates there are about 8 4 million registered softball players in the world about half outside north america that figure does not include the many millions of americans and canadians who play softball on a casual basis
4138130 hopefully by time we get ready to make our presentations well have more accurate figures so the ioc has something they know were not just pulling out of the air
4138131 they tell you how disheartened they are that their olympic dreams have faded away

4138240 todos los precios est n por encima de cualquier regulaci n si antes del aumento cobraban 30 bol vares fuertes o m s por 1 kilo de carne ahora que subieron empezar n a cobrar mucho m s
4138241 cada d a compramos menos con m s dinero no puede ser que hayan aumentado en ese porcentaje el incremento de precios debe hacerse paulatinamente porque definitivamente subirlos as no es la soluci n
4138242 c mo es posible que hayan aumentado justo esos productos que son los que consume el pueblo los que uno pod a comprar no estoy de acuerdo ni con el ajuste ni con las medidas que est n tomando
4138243 la situaci n es muy grave se debe buscar un equilibrio para que no salgan perjudicados ni unos ni otros
4138244 se est cumpliendo la regulaci n menos en la carne los vendedores se est n haciendo los locos y pretenden seguir cobrando precios especulativos
4138245 as como la asamblea nacional le dio facultad legislativa al gobierno tambi n debe controlar sus acciones y decretos
4138246 tanto los precios sugeridos como los controlados siguen con un problema estructural que es la inflaci n no es con control como vamos a solucionar los problemas es atacando las causas de la inflaci n e incrementando la produc ci n nacional
4138247 existe en el sector ganadero seis tipos de carne en pie y el decreto habla de uno solo y obvia la calidad de los animales esto va a ocasionar la desaparici n de carne de alto rango en las carnicer as porque a todos los productores se les va a pagar lo mismo
4138248 los precios m ximos deben ser fijados para el sector de consumo y no de producci n

4138252 adem s de admitir que solamente ha le do 3 de las 26 leyes la fiscal sale a proclamar que ninguna de stas viola la constituci n pero resulta que s viola nuestra carta magna y de manera muy clara el art culo 206 referente al cap tulo del poder legislativo nacional en la secci n que trata sobre la formaci n de leyes se ala muy claro que cuando una ley afecte a los estados tienen que ser consultados a trav s de los consejos legislativos quienes a su vez tienen que consultar a la sociedad civil preg ntele entonces fiscal general s a ellos no les afecta el art culo 70 de la ley de administraci n p blica el cual le otorga potestad al presidente de nombrar autoridades regionales que no su tarea no ser otra sino pasarle por encima a gobernadores y alcaldes y adem s est el art culo 211 que obliga a un proceso de consulta a los ciudadanos y a la sociedad organizada as como a todos los poderes p blicos y a los estados d nde queda la democracia participativa y protag nica

4138301 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
4138302 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
4138303 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
4138304 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4138305 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4138306 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4138307 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4138308 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4138309 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4138310 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4138311 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
4138312 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
4138313 provides to heelys stockholders an 8 2 percent premium to the closing price of its common shares on aug 12 2008 and a 31 percent premium to the closing price of its common shares net of the cash and cash equivalents that the company reported as of june 30 2008
4138314 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
4138315 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

4138405 the fire protection features had not been completed yet we dont know how the fire started fire and police officials will determine that over the course of the week the open type of construction it was like a lumber yard essentially
4138406 i see a bunch of flames from the construction site its all plywood at that point and the whole thing you know within minutes of me standing there and watching it just went completely up in flames
4138407 it looked like probably the largest fire ive ever seen in my life
4138408 i would tell you that this is more than a shocking afternoon for me
4138409 i like looked out my window and i saw the whole thing was engulfed in flames and basically i just grabbed my dog and i ran down the stairs i didnt think at all i mean with the amount of fire trucks that were here i thought everything was going to be ok i did not think that my building was going to catch on fire thats why i brought nothing nothing not even a wallet
4138410 sheer horror that i have nothing but whats on my back ive never experienced anything like this before
4138411 we lost everything i mean our bed our couch everything that we had together i mean weve only been there for three months but everything is gone

4138429 the last text i had from him said one more walk and then i will have done everything i wanted to do
4138430 it was the sort of thing he absolutely loved to do we know right up until a minute or so before he died he was probably at his absolute happiest
4138431 we feel that those last two weeks of his life were probably absolutely fantastic and he was really happy
4138432 they explained that he had not turned up at the rendezvous to get the train back
4138433 at that point i knew my son was dead i just knew
4138434 he had fallen from a huge height it looks as if he probably died straight away thats some sort of comfort to us in some way
4138435 our biggest fear was that he was lying there wondering why nobody had come to find him

4138484 and its getting deeper every day we import 70 of our oil at a cost of 700 billion a year four times the annual cost of the iraq war ive been an oilman all my life but this is one emergency we cant drill our way out of but if we create a new renewable energy network we can break our addiction to foreign oil

4138517 the republicans are quaffing cocktail shrimp with the unindicted co conspirator
4138518 i happily cooperated with the indian affairs committee investigation of the abramoff matter
4138519 i was not accused of any wrongdoing and was not implicated in any improper activities by others
4138520 i hold no position title or official role in the mccain campaign and am not seeking one
4138521 agreed to serve as a member of the 2008 mccain victory team
4138522 the long view of politics which is that yesterdays opponent can be tomorrows friend or ally i have found this to be the case with sen mccain
4138523 we welcome help from a wide variety of folks who are coming on board because they think john mccain is the better choice
4138524 he was never even charged we try to invite people who will draw a crowd who are good speakers and are good republicans

4138532 john mccains decision to cozy up to one of the central figures in the republican culture of corruption shows how far he is willing to go to win
4138533 despite all of his rhetoric about reform mccains willingness to accept money raised by tainted abramoff cronies like ralph reed shows that mccain simply cannot be trusted to bring change to washington politics
4138534 john mccain says he takes the high road and then he comes to atlanta and chows down on shrimp cocktail with an unindicted co conspirator
4138535 senator mccain knows exactly how ralph reed helped jack abramoff defraud indian tribes out of tens of millions of dollars
4138536 senator mccain should spare himself any further embarrassment by canceling this event immediately
4138537 raises serious questions about why he mccain didnt bring ralph reed before his committee was he concerned it would undercut his presidential campaign now you see ralph reed raising money for his campaign
4138538 ralph reed is not part of our fund raising organization in the state of georgia nor is he part of this event
4138539 i take the long view of politics which is that yesterdays opponent can be tomorrows friend or ally
4138540 i have found this to be the case with senator mccain i am supporting him because he is running on principled conservative positions on taxes judges terrorism energy values and the family i hold no position title or official role in the mccain campaign and am not seeking one
4138541 i was very intrigued when i heard reports that ralph reed was actively fund raising for mccain
4138542 i was curious as to whether or not senator mccain knew that ralph reed was actively fund raising for him

4138551 little league has maintained its purpose in being a program for any child in the community who wants to play
4138552 theres a lot more youth baseball in addition to little league baseball than ever before
4138553 but little league has maintained its leadership position in terms of participation and commitment to the mission of our program

4138558 knowing that the interstates are the lifeblood of prospective growth for any community utica simply could not agree to such an agreement
4138559 la salle currently has the complete i 39 and i 80 interchange within its reach and also completely controls the i 80 access at route 351 and the i 39 access at u s 6 la salle also controls approximately one half at the i 80 access at route 178
4138560 utica did not see where guaranteeing at least one half of the i 80 access at route 178 was too much to ask for
4138561 at the time utica would probably have considered the north extension of route 178 to be a reasonable solution but no determination or agreement was made
4138562 to accommodate an area much larger than the loves travel stop project
4138563 also more significantly oversized and deepened to accommodate an area much larger than the idi project
4138564 the fpa is very important to maintain and update because the iepa will not approve or issue sanitary sewer extension or connection permits to a community if the area to be served is within another communitys fpa
4138565 they are currently just out in the county and served by private sewage disposal but is within uticas fpa therefore if old dominion wanted public sewer they would be required by the iepa to utilize uticas system
4138566 la salle has been discussing and planning on the eventual construction of an east side water treatment plant
4138567 la salle is proposing not only an expansion of their fpa by 6 720 acres but to also take over 240 acres in the northeast quadrant of i 80 and route 178 currently within uticas present fpa furthermore they are proposing an fpa boundary of 1 5 miles east of the north extension of route 178
4138568 according to their proposed fpa boundary lines la salle is graciously allowing utica to keep loves travel stop but utica has already designed and installed a sewer lift station to serve a significant portion of this area
4138569 if the iepa approves this a boundary agreement will be made between this village and la salle and its not the one you want

4138593 shame to see saunders go out there a mixture of bad boxing and bad scoring he wasnt planting his feet enough and was just launching his whole body into the punches he hit with more scoring punches than the judges gave him credit for but he fought a messy fight and didnt look good looked to be trying to rush the job from the first bell instead of taking his time and picking his opponent off
4138594 i beat him seven months ago quite easily i didnt study him as much i should have he obviously studied me i was thinking too far ahead in the competition
4138595 the scoring is atrocious a complete farce this is the olympics the scoring should be correct or at least as correct as possible
4138596 the french have done their homework theyre sitting back and waiting for saunders to come to them
4138597 do the horses have to be the same nationality as the riders

4138667 audiovisual processing was much enhanced in musicians brains compared to non musician counterparts and musicians also were more sensitive to subtle changes in both speech and music sounds
4138668 our study indicates that the high level cognitive processing of music affects automatic processing that occurs early in the processing stream and fundamentally shapes sensory circuitry
4138669 musicians have a specialized neural system for processing sight and sound in the brainstem the neural gateway to the brain
4138670 musicians have enhanced subcortical auditory and audiovisual processing of speech and music
4138671 the study underscores the extreme malleability of auditory function by
4138672 singing with a young child allows for spontaneous vocal play movement and drama that are not always possible with music cds and dvds
4138673 some products with a visual component are non interactive and detract from musical events

4138675 someone will be singing and dancing and talking to the camera asking children to join in and all i see is my child staring at the screen
4138676 watching together enables adults to respond to opportunities the program offers and listen to their childs comments and observe responses which can lay the foundation for further exploration
4138677 but just putting music on doesnt have the same effect children learn by doing especially with adults and there are so many opportunities for spontaneous singing

4138717 cell phones for soldiers is a non profit program our people are excited about supporting as a bank and as individuals who appreciate the sacrifice our soldiers and their families make
4138718 anyone can come into a communitybank branch and drop off their old cell phone to us were sending all donated phones to cell phones for soldiers they in turn sell the phones to a recycler the money made from recycling is then used to purchase prepaid calling cards for our troops stationed in iraq and other locations across the globe
4138719 its always a good idea to erase your personal information from your old cell phone before you donate it
4138720 you can find simple directions for erasing contacts and numbers from your particular phone brand and model on the cell phone for soldiers website
4138721 we encourage everyone to donate their old phones so more soldiers can receive these free pre paid calling cards a number of our customers and employees have family members serving overseas we know how much it means to them when they can talk with their son or daughter or spouse this is such an easy way to show support for them and all our soldiers serving in foreign countries
4138722 ive got a theory about the motivations we know weve been told that elizabeth edwards is smarter than john edwards ergo if elizabeth edwards is smarter than john edwards is it likely that she thinks she knows better than he does what his speeches ought to contain and what kind of things he ought to be doing strategy wise could it have been her decision to keep going with the campaign in other words could it be that she doesnt shut up thats as far as im going to go
4138723 it just seems to me that john edwards might be attracted to a woman whose mouth did something other than talk
4138724 my theory that i just explained to you about why you know what could have john edwards motivations been to have the affair with rielle hunter given his wife is smarter than he is and probably nagging him a lot about doing this and he found somebody that did something with her mouth other than talk

4138742 so you havent answered my question are you always married or only when youre with her
4138743 thats over i dont know why i still wear the ring habit i figure
4138744 so weve established that im a husband and that youre into renting want to rent me for the night
4138745 thats nice jake and though you really tempt me i have to be somewhere tonight tomorrow would be nice though okay say here at seven
4138746 ill keep this till then to be certain youll come back
4138747 meanwhile i need to visit the ladies room she kissed him again then turned and walked away before he could object
4138748 i need you to grab that drink for me and preserve it ill get him away from the bar and while were gone have the bartender replace the drink and place the one thats there now in a container of some kind then seal it date it and give it to you
4138749 youre my reliable witness you and the bartender the police will be taking that sample and theyre going to want a statement from you attesting to the fact that the drink was made with your materials at his request and that it was not made with whatever it was that he placed in the drink clear
4138750 if you can do it without being obvious about it i need a picture of the two of us together with the drink sitting in front of us
4138751 fantastic and when thats done call the police youre doing a lot of women a favor by helping me nail this slimeball
4138752 toast to that when we get back right now i want to dance
4138753 dont indulge yourself by showing off the moment that you begin to find that you can do something well you must control it and do it more selectively

4138757 what did you want more than anything else during these last few minutes
4138758 nothing else was in my mind except the desire for air
4138759 as soon as you are equally single minded in your desire to perfect your ability to love all of creation the way you love yourself you will achieve your goal

4138767 clark gregg who directed the movie knew that id written choke while listening to radioheads 1993 debut album pablo honey with creep over and over and over so clark got radiohead to contribute a song to write a song for the very end of the movie the final credits
4138768 apparently radiohead liked the movie so much theyve written the score most of the ambient music throughout it so its choke with the music of radiohead
4138769 no one in the radiohead organisation is aware of the band composing any original incidental or ambient music for choke

4138843 kpk sering dicemooh karena mengurusi masalah kecil seperti pungli namun banyak masyarakat yang melapor kasus pungli dan itu tidak dapat dibiarkan hal ini kita lakukan sebagai proses pencegahan

4138905 the general security situation in kilinochchi and mullaittivu districts remains tense and unpredictable with ongoing military operations and exchange of mortar artillery shelling and air attacks
4138906 a lot of people are sleeping in makeshift shelters we expect the numbers to climb up from about 112 000 to 200 000 displaced people if fighting gets worse in the weeks ahead

4138913 the joint business agreement will enable the airlines to reduce costs and attract new customers helping to mitigate pressure on fares from record fuel costs
4138914 this means that the airlines will have greater ability to invest in their products services and fleets employees and shareholders will also benefit from the agreement
4138915 there is no reason why fares should rise if this agreement is approved
4138916 make no mistake if this monster monopoly is approved it will be third time unlucky for consumers
4138917 it will still be bad for passengers bad for competition and bad for the uk and us aviation industry
4138918 under the joint business agreement the three airlines will cooperate commercially on flights between the united states and norway while continuing to operate as separate legal entities
4138919 warmly welcomed and strongly supports the application for anti trust immunity
4138920 anti trust immunity between oneworlds transatlantic partners would enable them to unlock even more of oneworlds potential enabling us to operate under the same rules as our alliance competitors
4138921 ive got more than 1 200 items and its anything that i find a bit peculiar rather than something that would have been successful or other people would collect i dont collect sewing machines or typewriters
4138922 its things that perhaps nobody else would be bothered with but in some way helped normal people with their lives like the self pouring teapot or the dynamo torch
4138923 a lot of the items could still be produced today even the self pouring teapot

4138925 britain was a phenomenal nation of inventors but things have changed
4138926 nowadays its got to be manufactured abroad and the system of selling has become quite difficult i think 1851 to 1951 was the golden age
4138927 inventors are all quite vulnerable and naive at the beginning we really need advice so its great to have somewhere to go
4138928 you have to be pretty determined and it helps if you have some basic skills

4138986 over 5 000 lost or stolen property items from the headquarters office and 12 regions including a tractor all terrain vehicles pick up trucks and computers worth 6 million
4138987 among the stolen items was a desktop computer from a hospital in new mexico containing a database of uranium miners names medical histories and social security numbers although the ihs did not notify the public of the theft it did attempt to notify the 849 miners whose personal information was compromised
4138988 each ihs employee is issued approximately 3 computers per person
4138989 we take this type of thing seriously and we dont tolerate it regardless of who is involved in this case it happened to be a high ranking officer of the rcmp as supervisors we have to set an example for the rest of the rank and file
4138990 saakashvili made a stupid mistake thinking he could invade separatist provinces protected by russian peacekeeping troops invasion was a foolish option does saakashvili think the west will risk a war with russia one that could easily turn into a nuclear nightmare to protect his country sorry his people and his country are on their own
4138991 it is plain for all to see that vladimir putin simply ignored bushs recent warnings to moscow for violating the ceasefire brokered by french president nicolas sarkozy that is a good measure of how the u s s standing in the world has deteriorated under the stewardship of george w bush
4138992 im interested in good relations between the united states and russia he said but in the 21st century nations dont invade other nations except iraq of course
4138993 the bush government needs to be stopped it is incapable of handling any complex problem whatever soft power the us has left is being squandered before our eyes no one believes saakashvili but saakashvili lieberman and the other neo cons could easily talk baby bush into further dubious entanglements
4138994 doesnt it strike anyone as ironic that we can provide a country half a world away immediately but it took 5 days before we could do anything for new orleans maybe new orleans should have been paying mccains advisors millions in consulting fees
4138995 and the blame america first moonbats are quick to see equivalency in iraq and georgia who would have guessed
4138996 i really am sick and tired of all the liberals that post here and do nothing but trash the president no matter what he does if he tells russia to back down he is wrong if he were to threaten with military force and force them to back down he is wrong if he does anything short of kill himself in office he is wrong get over yourselves and start looking at the issues and not what party someone is from
4138997 russias continued military incursion in georgia it is disinformation it looks like main media in usa are under control and not objective or they using false sources
4138998 it is a fine thing that the post publish a piece by the president of georgia we hope you will also publish a piece by the president of russia it takes two to tango and the u s does not need to take sides or inflame an already dangerous situation mr saakashvili might have also told us how much hes been paying mccains advisors over the past couple years in preparation for this day
4138999 mr saakashvili i admire your courage and determination to defend your independence and the liberty of your people i fear that you have placed too much reliance of the determination of the leaders of the western democracies also interesting to see the number of kremlin stooges get your english grammar right guys who post on this site
4139000 this is the president that joined the coalition of the billing and then launched a n attack on the ossetes with equipment the u s war machine had provided him nice move do your country a favor and join your patron george w bush in permanent retirement in crawford texas
4139001 who are the victims the victims are those who lost their lives because political leaders chose violence and abandoned dialogue all the military gadgetry all the military training all the worlds pity is meaningless compared to human beings committed to a peace process
4139002 i cannot believe what i just read here about the planes the secstate ant take her plane to a war because cheney has it on a fundraising trip the defense secretary is going on vacation and so is the pesident still we hear what a big deal this is from bush we are a banana frappe not even republic
4139003 the movie is about how hard it is to find love in the world and how many traps and pitfalls there are
4139004 forgive me its been nice to talk with you but a friend of mine who i havent seen in ages just walked in

4139008 students need to comprehend that it is lack of judgment not only lack of skill that increases the risk of injury to ones self and others not wanting something bad to happen is simply not enough
4139009 in addition to giving teens the knowledge and teaching them the technical skills injury prevention programs must also address teens attitudes about being immune to illness and death as a means of changing high risk behaviors such as driving while impaired
4139010 the scales automatically recognize which fruit or vegetables are to be weighed and ask the customer to choose between only those icons that are relevant such as tomatoes vine ripened tomatoes and beefsteak tomatoes
4139011 the goods are registered by a camera integrated in the scales an image evaluation algorithm compares the image with stored data and thus automatically recognizes which type of fruit this is
4139012 the new scales are very tolerant to fluctuations in color and brightness the module can be employed under many different kinds of illumination and with different kinds of camera supermarket employees can of course extend the selection of fruit recognized by the scales to make it include new varieties
4139013 its time to vote the effect of matching message orientation and temporal frame on political persuasion
4139014 imagine taking a vacation to cancun six months from now you are probably thinking about beaches sunsets and other abstract information on the other hand if you were going to cancun tomorrow you would be thinking about taxi cabs and boarding passes concrete concerns making you more likely to process information about speedy check in or the phone number of a taxi
4139015 similarly a voter facing a choice in the distant future is less interested in particular plans and policies and is more persuaded by broad abstract ideas it is only as the election gets closer that voters start paying attention to concrete details of the candidates positions in essence when the choice is far away a voter is more likely to think in abstract terms but as the choice approaches the voter puts more weight on the details
4139016 what this finding implies is that the people who typically decide elections voters in the middle are most susceptible to this type of persuasion political novices tend to be more persuaded by abstract messages when the choice is far off and by concrete messages when the choice is imminent
4139017 the fit of the right message with the right voter at the right time has never been more important to the outcome of a race

4139030 the focus on innovation in education and not just about the tools was right on target
4139031 i appreciate the opportunity to be connected to a group of educators that are passionate about preparing students for the 21st century i feel inspired and able to meet the challenges that lie ahead

4139041 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4139042 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4139043 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4139044 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4139045 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

4139065 os russos n o entendem que quando o ministro das rela es exteriores da r ssia diz algo contra a ge rgia ele torna saakashvili ainda mais poderoso e popular
4139066 desde que saakashvili foi eleito eu tenho discordado com muitas de suas pol ticas mas nada do que ele ou o governo georgiano tenham feito pode justificar o que a r ssia est fazendo com o meu pa s
4139067 one of the things we need to do is look at who is taking the test and who isnt and if there are certain groups who tend to take the test

4139069 the united states of america stands strongly as the president of france just said for the territorial integrity of georgia

4139078 senator clinton understands and appreciates that there are supporters who remain passionate but she has repeatedly urged her supporters to vote for senator obama
4139079 i think some of her supporters have been less than gracious
4139080 ensure that the voices of everyone who participated in this historic process are respected
4139081 the only way a democratic party will have the credibility to elect a democrat in november is if the party uses a legitimate process to choose its nominee

4139095 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
4139096 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
4139097 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
4139098 an enchanting story of faith and family that is as enlightening as it is encouraging
4139099 the most riveting thought provoking book ive read in years
4139100 bursting with lessons in faith forgiveness and family it is a modern classic that will be enjoyed and passed along to friends and family for years to come
4139101 the enemies of civilization who would have destroyed completely all freedom of religion have been defeated all faiths unite in thanksgiving to almighty god on our victory over the forces of evil
4139102 the warlords of japan have surrendered unconditionally this is the end of the schemes of dictators to enslave the peoples of the world destroy their civilization and institute a new era of darkness and degradation
4139103 our global victory has come from the courage of free men and women united in determination to fight it has come from the massive strength of arms created by peace loving peoples who knew that unless they won decency in the world would end it has come from millions of peaceful citizens turned soldiers overnight who showed a ruthless enemy that they were not afraid to fight
4139104 it has come with the help of god who was with us in the early days of adversity and who has now brought us to this glorious day of triumph let us give thanks to him and dedicated ourselves to follow in his ways

4139117 verschrikkelijk dat mensen zich altijd focussen op negatieve aspecten en dat sommige mensen hun eigen leven blijkbaar zo moe zijn dat ze het nodig vinden om leugens over andere mensen te verspreiden
4139118 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
4139119 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
4139120 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
4139121 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
4139122 this is real this is me im exactly where im supposed to be now

4139136 alcuni dicono che la pioggia brutta ma non sanno che permette di girare a testa alta con il viso coperto dalle lacrime
4139137 e credere in te soltanto giurare in te soltanto riporre in te soltanto la mia fede la mia forza il mio orgoglio tutto il mio mondo tutto quel che sogno e tutto quel che spero
4139138 vorrei tornare bambino perch le ginocchia sbucciate fanno meno male di un cuoreinfranto

4139144 we cant travel without passports theres no point in any case the plane has left and tsvangirai has already gone back he has no patience for this
4139145 because you said the part woudnt be here till nov 30th and its still not here
4139146 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
4139147 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
4139148 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
4139149 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
4139150 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
4139151 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
4139152 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
4139153 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
4139154 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
4139155 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
4139156 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
4139157 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
4139158 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
4139159 in my research of multinational companies 17 of manufacturers are moving investments out of china
4139160 consumers demand a product from a clean factory where employees are paid well while simultaneously demanding a cheap price that leaves me between a rock and a hard place
4139161 owners went there in the first place to produce a product in the most economical way possible

4139164 but moving to vietnam means working in a country that is the size of one chinese province that hasnt much skilled labor and is about 15 years behind china in terms of infrastructure
4139165 u s companies that go west will do it for the governments tax subsidy and the belief that secondary and tertiary cities have less turnover and more competitive wages
4139166 china is the largest growing major economy in the world with well over a billion in population and a growing middle class
4139167 even as costs rise chinas improving efficiencies in supply chains and its growing domestic market are creating new opportunities and generating new client relationships for foreign investors
4139168 china is a legitimate market in itself and i know many other businesses that are manufacturing for the china market and not to export
4139169 business owners have to look at total costs including lead times and gas prices they may find that although china isnt cheap anymore there are hidden costs with moving
4139170 china is known in the u s for having poor quality items but the country is ready to move on to innovation
4139171 textiles have already moved to vietnam and bangladesh as china keeps the quality stuff
4139172 the two presidents decided to establish diplomatic ties at the level of ambassadors in line with the treaty of the united nations and international law

4139189 the euro zone economy is on the edge of a recession
4139190 the signs for the future are not very good if you look at the confidence indicators
4139191 it is a bit exaggerated to use the word recession
4139192 the uncertainty surrounding the outlook for economic activity remains high owing to among other things the very high and volatile levels of commodity prices and the ongoing tensions in financial markets
4139193 das ist nicht wie 1968 bei der invasion der tschechoslowakei als russland seine nachbarn bedrohen eine hauptstadt besetzen eine regierung st rzen konnte und damit davonkam

4139205 when elderly people complain theyre tired most doctors say yeah well youre old they tell their patients that feeling listless is an expected part of aging but there are reasons people are tired and they need to be investigated for clinicians the message from our study is that a lack of energy is widespread in the elderly but its not normal
4139206 gina cobb is proof that not all lawyers deserve the death penalty
4139207 they have intrusive recollections i keep remembering it i have nightmares about it i cant escape it
4139208 its not like you live at fort hood or camp lejeune and everybody on your street is in the military
4139209 we need to be cautious with what were allowing someone to do and at what point in their recovery theyre allowed to do it
4139210 to keep the brain stimulated but not enough to push it into overdrive
4139211 whether its pop warner football or soccer or high school teams
4139212 its difficult for them to realize this one game friday night is not as important as my cognitive ability the rest of my life
4139213 despite the jump in inflation readings for july we have rising conviction that inflation readings for august and now even september will be more favorable thanks to the sustained trend in retail gasoline and natural gas prices
4139214 the real eye opener was the jump in clothing prices
4139215 one month is hardly a trend but with import prices jumping we may be now seeing apparel adding to inflation rather than restraining it it is also a warning that we could be seeing price increases in other areas as the import cost rises spread through the economy
4139216 provides scant consolation given that julys business surveys so far point to a second consecutive fall in the third quarter
4139217 we now expect the eurozone economy to expand at an annual average rate of 1 2 percent this year compared to our previous forecast for a 1 7 percent rise
4139218 that ye be not soon shaken in mind or be troubled neither by spirit nor by word nor by letter as from us as that the day of christ is at hand

4139220 lord pastor greg manuel may dwell in your sanctuary greg manuel may live in your holy hill help pastor greg manuel lord to keep my walk blameless lord help greg manuel to do what is righteous god keep pastor greg manuel from having slander in his tongue lord help greg manuel do his neighbor no wrong or cast slur on his fellowman oh god use pastor greg manuel to lend without interest and not be moved by money in your word greg manuel will trust and walk in these precepts pastor greg manuel will never be shaken

4139222 madonna has not made an attempt to adopt this baby earlier this year or now there is no truth to this rumor its an old one wasnt true then or now madonna is starting her tour in a week
4139223 the greater fear right now is missing the next big rally
4139224 inflation numbers were bad but they are probably going to get better
4139225 you know i tremulously went and watched the dark knight myself but its a totally different movie like you know that tom cruise movie where he played the race car driver what was that movie called anyway its like comparing that movie to talladega nights its two totally different animals we have a leading man who can sort of relish being a cad and thats a fun character to write for we feel like were in the clear
4139226 es especialmente importante abstenerse de cualquier paso que pueda directa o indirectamente ser interpretado por los l deres georgianos como un apoyo a sus ambiciones de revancha y llevar a un nuevo escenario tr gico
4139227 domesticar a la direcci n georgiana fue uno de los grandes xitos de estados unidos en el c ucaso
4139228 si georgia entra en la otan y estados unidos est ejerciendo presi n para lograrlo una base militar a unas cuantas decenas de kil metros de sochi puerto ruso en el mar negro permitir literalmente apuntar a bocajarro a rusia

4139232 era un juego peligroso que iba a terminar en una aventura
4139233 youve got to bring the citizens into the equation and leaders are often so reluctant to do that
4139234 but at the end of the day its the only thing that works
4139235 to be quite honest i was afraid of it at first
4139236 i thought the people of morehead and rowan county wouldnt go for it i was in for a wonderful surprise
4139237 they are just determined they are going to turn this town around
4139238 it was a wonderful experience even though i was afraid of it
4139239 hopefully when the economy picks up they can start implementing some of the ideas
4139240 were still going to disagree sometimes but were not at each others throats
4139241 people realize that now they have more of a chance for impact and we have a much broader sense of what people in the community want
4139242 we really believe that if we work together and the community succeeds we all succeed

4139244 the issue of race is there in political campaigns and not just this one people talk in code it is the 800 pound gorilla in the room that is ignored by mutual agreement so it never gets dealt with head on
4139245 it will help with projects such as infrastructure and different projects can come to life
4139246 mccains worth over 100m he owns 10 houses he flies around on a 12 6m corporate jet he walks around in 520 italian loafers
4139247 if john mccain lost his social security hed get by just fine would you
4139248 i want young workers to be able to if they choose to take part of their own money which is their taxes and put it in an account which has their name on it
4139249 the bush privatisation plan that senator mccain now embraces would tell millions of elderly americans that theyre on their own putting them at risk of falling into poverty
4139250 you could mine this stuff with teaspoons and still make money said salman partners analyst raymond goldie
4139251 from the point of view of the world we will be desperately short of this stuff if cigar lake doesnt come on stream
4139252 i see absolutely no reason for that and its silly
4139253 two judges have already found hes violated conditions of his bond
4139254 this is the first time a judge has stood up for him
4139255 ive said all along this has got to be resolved
4139256 this has been very very difficult for the city and for the state and its obvious why we need a resolution
4139257 you would relive scenes from the colosseum from ancient rome gladiators or maybe julius caesar or other things
4139258 one can forget about any talk about georgias territorial integrity because i believe it is impossible to persuade south ossetia and abkhazia to agree with the logic that they can be forced back into the georgian state
4139259 our position on georgias territorial integrity is not going to change no matter what anybody says
4139260 and so i would consider that to be bluster from the foreign minister of russia we will ignore it
4139261 we dont want them here what we need is friendship and good relations with the russian people
4139262 we let her stay here and now shes blaming everything on us
4139263 americans have got to understand that we are paying present day retirees with the taxes paid by young workers in america today and thats a disgrace its an absolute disgrace and its got to be fixed
4139264 as part of social security reform i believe that private savings accounts are a part of it along the lines of what president bush proposed
4139265 mccain has been especially supportive of his onetime rival appearing with bush at three events over the past two days in trying to prod democrats into negotiations to include private accounts in a plan to revamp social security
4139266 private savings accounts work they have been proven to work not only in america but all over the world and we ought to really strongly support it
4139267 privatizing social security be a priority for you going forward
4139268 without privatization i dont see how you can possibly over time make sure that young americans are able to receive social security benefits
4139269 were in a mindset of typing in our notes and showing them to the audience in bullet point format with this conventional approach youre disconnecting yourself from your audience having them focus on the screen and not you its an unhealthy dynamic when there is confusion about where to look
4139270 every great work every big accomplishment has been brought into manifestation through holding to the vision and often just before the big achievement comes apparent failure and discouragement

4139283 now if somebody wants to sue us they have an option to sue but im fairly certain that a judge will see it the way the way the citizens see it here the citizens deserve peace that some infringement on constitutional rights is ok and we have not violated anything as far as the constitution

4139286 there are some people whose lack of yiras shomayim drives them to try and purify a sheretz to illegitimately rationalize improper behavior such people think that they are accomplished scholars and they are willing to concoct a halachic way permit almost any wrong rav huna means that if one did a sin and knows how to learn vshanah he will find a way to justify his misdeed then he can say in all innocence hutra its permitted his ability to learn is what keeps him sinning
4139287 you are correct but there are five situations when it is permissible to speak lashon hara if one doesnt work hard on ahavas yisrael he will find that he learns these halachos to apply to every person he has an inner hidden desire to speak against
4139288 gareth southgate has done a good job at middlesbrough he has been well backed by his chairman steve gibson and i think afonso alves whom he signed in january has got a real chance of scoring goals in the premier league
4139289 he has got tuncay and mido and brought in the promising young marvin emnes from holland in the summer so he has covered the goals he lost when yakubu and mark viduka left
4139290 spurs have lost robbie keane and look certain to lose dimitar berbatov and while darren bent has had a brilliant pre season its a bit different in the premier league and i think boro will nick this against a visiting side who will be bedding in new players of their own such as luka modric and david bentley

4139296 i was blessed with good genetics but my essence is very happy and warm and i dont take my job too seriously im not saving lives here
4139297 this is not 1968 and the invasion of czechoslovakia where russia can threaten a neighbour occupy a capital overthrow a government and get away with it things have changed
4139298 you dont go to the olympics just to say i am going to go especially because of who i am am i going to sit there and watch michael phelps break my record anonymously thats almost demeaning to me it is not almost it is
4139299 im pleased that were going up and hope well continue to do that
4139300 the mme with the inclusion of the act is a rigorous test and all students have to be prepared with the knowledge to excel
4139301 as the requirements of the new high school curriculum continue to be implemented we expect to see students scores improve
4139302 theyre really hard working im looking at the writing scores doing nothing but increasing as they write
4139303 its not very often you get to say you beat the no 1 player in the world anytime but to do it at the olympics with usa on your chest im so proud to be part of this team
4139304 maybe if you play him enough times hes bound to have an off day
4139305 he didnt play his best today but i felt like i served well when i needed to especially in that tiebreaker
4139306 this mission was good for the iraqi army it shows that we are concerned about the area and here for the people
4139307 the area we went into has been known for terrorist activity and going in showed that the terrorists cannot have this area
4139308 prior to even coming into the area we spent five days surveying speaking with the local sheikhs and leaders gaining information on what to expect
4139309 we are making sure the ia stays focused in the area they play more of a dominant role in the region and the people see them and interact with them
4139310 the main thing is to keep the ia in the lead
4139311 ive been told im the oldest ever female olympian of any nation of all time
4139312 im just still kicking and im not putting any restrictions on myself it doesnt say i have to stop at a certain age
4139313 in fact the oldest olympic medalist was in shooting and he was 73 back in the early 1900s
4139314 im not ruling anything out i still feel good and i still have that competitive fire in me
4139315 what ive probably done in a lot of areas is that ive tried too hard
4139316 i shoot great technique ive been told this not just by u s coaches but other international coaches its just somethings happening just a few times in a match that throws me out of some competitions thats a mental thing and you know the brain the mind is a terrible thing
4139317 you still have to have the same mental approach have to have the same techniques to execute the shot
4139318 there may be a different perspective in maybe somebody who is younger or hasnt been here before but thats just all part of experience just having general experience in life
4139319 throughout shooting you will find that some things work at a certain period of time and then after a while it doesnt work anymore so you maybe try something different
4139320 im way advanced than i was when i first started shooting but its some mental things that really grab me at certain times and it hurts me in the match
4139321 some days youre really good some days youre really bad and some days youre mediocre
4139322 thats what makes shooting interesting and i guess challenging you can shoot a perfect score and the next day go out and you arent diddly squat
4139323 bank repossessions or reos continued to be the fastest growing segment of foreclosure activity in july posting a 184 percent year over year increase compared to a 53 percent year over year increase in default notices and an 11 percent year over year increase in auction notices
4139324 the sharp rise in reos combined with slow sales has resulted in a bloated inventory of bank owned properties for sale
4139325 the mpc has considered the recent economic developments and the outlook for inflation and has concluded that the repurchase rate will for now remain unchanged at 12 percent per annum
4139326 while there are clear signs that the economy is responding to the less accommodative monetary policy stance the mpc had to assess whether recent monetary policy actions are sufficient to bring inflation back to within the inflation target range over medium term
4139327 in trying to account for these changes certain assumptions have to be made and the central forecast is therefore additional uncertainty
4139328 cpix inflation is expected to peak at an average rate of around 13 percent in the third quarter of 2008 compared to 12 percent
4139329 this means that the inflation is expected to decline significantly in the first quarter of 2009 partly as a result of the re weighting and re basing effects
4139330 if the current oil price and exchange rate levels are maintained a further sizeable decline can be expected in september
4139331 it is a positive development for business and consumer confidence
4139332 although the short term inflation trends suggest that inflation will get worse before it gets better recent economic evidence indicates the medium term inflation has improved considerably
4139333 the repo rate was expected to remain the same due to factors like oil and food showing some relief
4139334 fuel on the other hand is coming down which we believe that it will play a major role in reducing the effects of inflation
4139335 people still need to be educated about using credit cards as credit contributes to the inflation rate banks on the other hand lure people into using credit cards and increase their debt which leads to consumers going deeper in debt

4139340 the message is that russia has perhaps not accepted that it is time to move on from the cold war and it is time to move to a new era in which relations between states are on the basis of equality and sovereignty and economic integration
4139341 we will use u s aircraft as well as naval forces
4139342 rally the free world in the defense of a free georgia
4139343 the united states stands with the democratically elected government of georgia and insists that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia be respected
4139344 one can forget about any talk about georgias territorial integrity because i believe it is impossible to persuade south ossetia and abkhazia to agree with the logic that they can be forced back into the georgian state
4139345 i have to say that the reports are not encouraging about russias respect for this cease fire
4139346 this is not 1968 and the invasion of czechoslovakia where russia can threaten its neighbors occupy a capital overthrow a government and get away with it

4139351 our car will be good we are taking a brand new napa toyota it is a gen 3 we are very optimistic about our chances obviously it is a track that i have done well at over the years

4139357 i didnt know what it would be like but it seemed adventurous so we did it
4139358 when we arrived we were dropped off at the bottom of a cliff when i saw how far up it was that we had to climb i said no way its much more remote and roughing it than i expected much more like camping out than i thought it would be
4139359 it could turn into a fuel mileage race at any time so you really have to be on your toes and be aware of what could happen
4139360 for me coming to michigan i tend to run well here for whatever reason and the biggest deal is trying to finish and finish up front
4139361 we ran toward the front there in june but we ended up making a late pit stop and with all the fuel mileage strategy that was going on we ended up getting shuffled back
4139362 weve had some great runs with the car that we are bringing this weekend so im hoping we can improve on our june finish
4139363 michigan is one of those places that you need the entire package to compete for the win
4139364 being successful has a lot do with the horsepower that is under the hood

4139376 there is no doubt the chinese are strong four gold medals in four synchronized events
4139377 they are very hard working they trained a lot and you can see this from the good results they are achieving at the olympic games

4139379 besides we have very tough training regime both reasons contribute to our success
4139380 the 3m springboard synchro gold was the only synchro title we missed four years ago in athens so we were uneasy before the games

4139382 we performed very well today this gold is so important to my life i will still try hard to attend the next olympics
4139383 we seldom have pairs with almost the same good techniques thats why we are less competent with the chinese in synchro events than individual ones

4139398 barangsiapa ingin melihat seseorang dari ahli surga hendaklah ia melihat urwah bin az zubair
4139399 hendaklah masing masing dari kita memohon kepada allah apa yang hendak dia cita citakan
4139400 kalau aku aku ingin menguasai dua irak kufah dan bashrah sehingga tidak ada orang yang menyaingiku
4139401 jika anda berdua hanya puas dengan hal itu saja maka aku tidak akan puas kecuali menguasai dunia semuanya dan aku ingin memegang kekhilifahan setelah muawiyah bin abi sufyan

4139404 wahai anak saudaraku apakah anda tidak mempunyai keperluan kepada tuhanmu azza wa jalla demi allah sesungguhnya aku memohon kepada allah di dalam shalatku segala sesuatu bahkan garam
4139405 menurutku anda harus meminum sesuatu yang memabukkan supaya anda tidak merasa sakit ketika kaki anda dipotong
4139406 o tidak itu tidak mungkin aku tidak akan menggunakan sesuatu yang haram terhadap kesembuhan yang aku harapkan
4139407 aku tidak ingin kalau ada satu dari anggota badanku yang diambil sedangkan aku tidak merasakan sakitnya aku hanya mengharap pahala di sisi allah atas hal ini
4139408 mereka didatangkan untuk memegang anda barangkali anda merasakan sakit yang amat sangat lalu anda menarik kaki anda dan akhirnya membahayakan anda sendiri
4139409 suruh mereka kembali aku tidak membutuhkan mereka dan berharap kalian merasa cukup dengan dzikir dan tasbih yang aku ucapkan
4139410 sungguh demi dzat yang mendorongku untuk mengajakmu berjalan di tengah malam menuju masjid dia maha mengetahui bahwa aku tidak pernah sekalipun membawamu berjalan kepada hal yang haram
4139411 wahai amirul mukminin di dalam komunitas bani abs tidak ada orang yang harta keluarga dan anaknya lebih banyak dariku lalu aku bersama harta dan keluargaku singgah di pedalaman suatu lembah dari lembah lembah tempat tinggal kaumku lalu terjadi banjir besar yang belum pernah aku saksikan sebelumnya banjir itu menghanyutkan semua yang aku miliki harta keluarga dana anak yang tersisa hanyalah seekor onta dan bayi yang baru lahir sedangkan onta yang tersisa itu adalah onta yang binal sehingga lepas akibatnya aku meninggalkan sang bayi tidur di atas tanah untuk mengejar onta tersebut belum begitu jauh aku meninggalkan tempat ku hingga tiba tiba aku mendengar jeritan bayi tersebut aku menoleh namun ternyata kepalanya telah berada di mulut serigala yang sedang menyantapnya aku segera menyongsongnya namun sayang aku tidak bisa menyelamatkannya karena srigala telah membunuhnya lalu aku mengejar onta dan ketika aku berada di dekatnya ia menendangku dengan kakinya tendangan itu mengenai wajahku sehingga keningku robek dan mataku buta begitulah aku mendapatkan diriku di dalam satu malam telah menjadi orang yang tanpa keluarga anak harta dan mata
4139412 ajaklah orang ini menemui tamu kita urwah bin az zubair mintalah dia mengisahkan ceritanya supaya urwah mengetahui bahwa ternyata masih ada orang yang mengalami cobaan yang lebih berat darinya
4139413 jangan kalian merasa ngeri terhadap apa yang kalian lihat allah azza wa jalla telahmenganugerahuiku empat orang anak lalu mengambil satu di antara mereka dan masih menyisakan tiga orang lagi segala puji hanya untuk nya dan dia memberiku empat anggota badan kemudian dia mengambil satu darinya dan menyisakan tiga untukku maka segala puji bagi nya dia juga telah memberiku empat buah yang memiliki ujung kedua tangan dan kedua kaki red lalu dia mengambilnya satu dan menyisakan tiga buah lagi untukku dan demi allah jika pun dia telah mengambil sedikit dariku namun telah menyisakan banyak untukku dan jika pun dia mengujiku satu kali namun dia telah mengaruniaiku kesehatan berkali kali
4139414 bergembiralah wahai abu abdillah salah satu anggota badan dan anakmu telah mendahuluimu menuju surga dan yang keseluruhannya akan mengikuti yang sebagiannya itu insya allah taala sungguh allah telah menyisakan sesuatu darimu untuk kami yang sangat kami butuhkan dan perlukan yaitu ilmu fiqih dan pendapat anda mudah mudahan allah menjadikan hal itu bermanfaat bagimu dan kami allah lah dzat yang maha menanggung pahala untukmu dan yang menjamin balasan kebaikan amalmu

4139416 aduh betapa buruknya apakah di dunia ini ada sesuatu yang lebih buruk daripada orang tua yang bodoh
4139417 wahai anakku janganlah sekali kali salah seorang di antara kamu mempersembahkan hadiah kepada rabb nya berupa sesuatu yang dia merasa malu kalau dihadiahkan kepada tokoh yang dimuliakan dari kaumnya karena allah taala adalah dzat yang paling mulia dan paling dermawan serta yang paling berhak untuk dipilihkan untuk nya
4139418 wahai anakku jika kamu melihat seseorang berbuat kebaikan yang amat menawan maka harapkanlah kebaikan dengannya meskipun di mata orang lain dia seorang jahat karena kebaikan itu memiliki banyak saudara dan jika kamu melihat seseorang berbuat keburukan yang nyata maka menghindarlah darinya meskipun di mata orang lain dia adalah orang baik karena keburukan itu juga memiliki banyak saudara dan ketahuilah bahwa kebaikan akan menunjukkan kepada saudara saudaranya jenis jenisnya yang lain demikian pula dengan keburukan
4139419 wahai anakku sebagaimana tertulis di dalam hikmah hendaklah kamu berkata kata baik dan berwajah ramah niscaya kamu akan lebih dicintai orang ketimbang cinta mereka kepada orang yang selalu memberikan mereka hadiah
4139420 saat urwah bin az zubair menemuiku dan memegang tanganku dia berkata wahai abu abdullah
4139421 saat aku menemui ummul mukminin aisyah ra dia berkata wahai anakku

4139491 the role of sport as an ambassador for peace is particularly significant when linked to the noble traditions of the olympic truce
4139492 it is necessary to inculcate in future generations a spirit of the culture of peace non violence and tolerance showing that the olympic ideal is not out of date and is stillsignificant
4139493 it is a very complex issue and it is not for the ioc to give a perspective on what has been happening

4139505 we need not offer any explanations or excuses nor ask forgiveness
4139506 i believe that stationing russian bombers in cuba would be a destructive step for russia because the advantage of these bombers is that they may launch missiles from outside the effective range of an enemys air defenses
4139507 there is no need to deploy bombers 145 km from the u s where they would be easy targets for us air defenses if they are capable of hitting targets on us soil from a distance of more than 3 500 kilometres
4139508 cuba is a unique place to gather intelligence on the united states i believe that the reopening of this station is both possible and necessary amid the threat that the americans are creating for russia

4139533 someone driving to work goes past a petrol station and sees petrol at a bargain price and thinks you beauty but when they drive home its gone up 10c a litre it makes people very angry
4139534 australians dont want that great volatility in prices but nor do they want to pay more for their petrol to do away with it

4139561 people like to consume but they also like to produce and they like to share
4139562 a significant rise in pork values has been led by strong prices for export items such as trimmings hams and picnics
4139563 the rise in prices for these items indicates continued strong export demand into august
4139564 with pork production running 9 percent over last year exports have been the clear driver for improved u s pork prices
4139565 exports continue to provide critical support for producers who need to cover sharply higher input costs
4139566 liver prices increased dramatically as russia started bidding against egypt for the limited supply of u s beef livers

4139582 jobs continue to be lost and more and more americans are filing unemployment claims
4139583 this bill will help to ensure that the products americans find on their store shelves are safe and that the regulating agencies have the resources they need to enforce law
4139584 this has become an increasingly difficult and complex job as more imports from more nations are now sold in the u s than ever before
4139585 these broad new protections are all in addition to doubling the agencys funding over five years adding staff increasing its civil penalty authority and adding other tools to prevent dangerous imports and hold wrongdoers accountable
4139586 finally the bill preserves state toxic hazard warning laws and retains broad powers of state attorneys general to act as tough consumer cops despite industry efforts to weaken their authority

4139591 atlanta needs to start 326 churches today just to keep up with population growth
4139592 despite the jump in inflation readings for july we have rising conviction that inflation readings for august and now even september will be more favorable thanks to the sustained trend in retail gasoline and natural gas prices
4139593 the real eye opener was the jump in clothing prices
4139594 one month is hardly a trend but with import prices jumping we may be now seeing apparel adding to inflation rather than restraining it it is also a warning that we could be seeing price increases in other areas as the import cost rises spread through the economy

4139603 it just seems to me that john edwards might be attracted to a woman whose mouth did something other than talk
4139604 my theory that i just explained to you about why you know what could have john edwards motivations been to have the affair with rielle hunter given his wife is smarter than he is and probably nagging him a lot about doing this and he found somebody that did something with her mouth other than talk
4139605 compared with the caribbean the ball is doing a lot more out here and it means i just have to adjust my game a bit
4139606 it was the strangest thing ive ever seen they looked as if they were on fire really bright orange orbs we spotted eight or nine go over my house between 10 and 11pm
4139607 they definitely werent helicopters or planes or anything like that and there was no smoke or sound
4139608 by the end there were about eight people out in the close watching them go by my neighbour said shed seen them as she was leaving the trafford centre
4139609 these things were massive the first one i saw was just below the cloud line but the others were probably only about 300ft up
4139610 i took some pictures and video but i couldnt really seem to capture the size of them just a bit in the middle like the filament of a light bulb
4139611 id just returned home and we caught sight of one through the trees it went over one of the houses and was still for a while before slowly fading away
4139612 just as it was disappearing another one came again from the same direction it wasnt something we imagined
4139613 i dont really believe in flying saucers but they were huge bright orange spheres
4139614 they were lower than a plane but higher than a helicopter
4139615 i was saying oh my god because it was so strange

4139619 vorig jaar waren we ineens niet welkom met de bus dat heeft veel kwaad bloed gezet
4139620 er is een x aantal festivals per jaar dat vast staat over de rest praten we tot mijn spijt zijn er altijd wel een paar die alsnog afvallen
4139621 ze waren nog wel onze sponsor we hebben maanden lang rondgereden met grote lowlands stickers op de zijkant van de bus bovendien hebben we ons altijd goed aan de afspraken gehouden niet te laat niet te harde muziek we kregen op een gegeven moment zelfs klachten van mensen om ons heen dat we te zacht muziek draaiden als excuus van de organisatie werd gebruikt dat we door onze bus alleen maar op de camping bier zouden drinken in plaats van op het terrein
4139622 we hebben er over gesproken met de organisatie als het dit jaar goed gaat is het wat mij betreft vergeten en vergeven
4139623 dat is wat mij betreft het beste feestje daarna volgt rock am ring iets minder feest maar wel vaak een top line up lowlands is een soort kleintje roskilde

4139632 e per farlo conclude il presidente di confturismo confcommercio occorre investire sullimmagine nazionale realizzando iniziative promo pubblicitarie che informino gli italiani sulle numerosissime localit di svago o vacanza di un paese che se conosciuto a fondo non potr mai finire di stupire ed assecondare le esigenze di chiunque
4139633 il papa su questo la pensa come giulio tremonti non come gli alfieri del mercato che sul corriere della sera e sole 24 ore da mesi ribattono che quelli contro i derivati sul petrolio e sul grano sono attacchi di irriducibili passatisti di vecchi arnesi nostalgici del protezionismo ora si capito ancor meglio che i giudizi del papa non sono poi coincidenze casuali con tremonti

4139647 in fact ive only talked to the senator once in the last year and a half on the phone
4139648 i would hope that my friend obamas republican rival john mccain would join me in condemning this kind of politics
4139649 although i support senator obama i would never be dumb enough to offer policy advice to either candidate they seem to be doing fine without me

4139652 literally desecrates an area i mean the word means to desacralise and for centuries the tara landscape and the tara sites have been regarded as part of the sacred ground
4139653 if ever there was a place that deserved to be preserved in the name of the dead generations from pre historic times it was tara

4139664 i think its a fundamental tenet of our party to be pro life but that does not mean we exclude people from our party that are pro choice we just have a albeit strong but just its a disagreement and i think ridge is a great example of that far moreso than bloomberg because bloomberg is pro gay rights pro you know a number of other issues
4139665 mccain strained to point out that ridge was far more appealing because he only loved abortions not both abortions and the gays
4139666 i want to first of all express my condolences to the families of these murdered humanitarian workers
4139667 this is obviously an outrage a terribly brutal act which i think should remind everybody of the brutality of the taliban and the danger that everybody there faces

4139732 it remains to be decided whether new types of subsidies are necessary or whether existing levels should be altered by adjusting terms that have held some subsides flat for a decade

4139745 people are not open minded enough because they dont know people with disabilities
4139746 i think this breakfast is one of the nicest events that time warner sponsors
4139747 because one of our focus areas is education and its nice to have so many new educators together to talk to at one time
4139748 feels that knox county has some of the best schools anywhere
4139749 we think its really important to honor and welcome educators to our community and give them maps and things that they may need we really want them to feel welcome
4139750 it was a wonderful opportunity to meet a lot of other people from other schools
4139751 and to get to know the resources that are available in the community
4139752 its a great teaching tool as well as a game
4139753 humor helps you get out of a rut because with it you can go both backward and forward in your mind

4139757 when i see such an extraordinary cross section of americas free enterprise system together with the environmental groups come and form a group like this youve got my attention
4139758 at a start price of 99 cents and of course with no reserve
4139759 they are so huge i thought they may make someone a nice shawl or even better something for halloween perhaps
4139760 because were a coal dominant country we have to take responsibility for lowering greenhouse emissions
4139761 inflaatio on sellainen juttu josta osakkeiden kurssilaskua povaavat jaksavat aina jankuttaa ja he varmasti ly v t nyt rumpuaan ahkerasti on toki shokki ett inflaatioluvut poikkesivat n in selv sti odotuksista
4139762 we appreciate the input we received from the public and the college family
4139763 the board took careful note of all the comments made and incorporated many of them into the qualifications and profile while our profile is somewhat less specific than the comments we received the publics input is very much on the minds of board members as we enter into the search process

4139767 the program in conjunction with the global education initiative is opening the channels of communication for the exchange of ideas between cultures it provides an opportunity to broaden our perspectives as educators and equips us with first hand experiences that will enable us to relate the commonalities rather than the differences between nations to our students
4139768 i always had a feeling that africa was not one of those places one could be satisfied only reading about or seeing on television so this opportunity through world view was invaluable
4139769 this trip was certainly one of the highlights of my life

4139772 i hope there is not a single thing i will forget about my trip but i know that is impossible

4139774 the dollar has been on a slow decline for years and years exporting is going to continue to do well longer term its still a weaker currency

4139778 jerry yangs strategy is fine if he wants to stay ceo he just needs to get a lot tougher and more demanding specifically he has to be willing to make unpopular decisions sack b players and be hated

4139800 das zentrale anliegen einer solchen auf gestaltung ausgerichteten mediendidaktik ist die frage wie man ein mediengest tztes lernangebot entwickelt dass ein bestimmtes bildungsanliegen einl st bei der konzeption von lernszenarien sollte man sich deswegen nicht an eine bestimmte theoretische konzeption des lernens oder lehrens nicht an ein bestimnmtes didaktisches modell oder eine bestimmte neue medientechnik binden

4139812 this certainly helps the pc become a much better center of communications in the home
4139813 the central environment authority can very well look up to the treasury for the funds and live on its allocations and it can do well without any funds being drawn from a two per cent mobile phone tax
4139814 the tax is a progressive because it will exclude non handset holders who are village folk hence we believe that leftists like vasudeva nanayakkara and wickremebahu karunaratna will support our tax scheme imposed on mobile phone users
4139815 we expect to set up a scheme for collecting recycling and safe disposal of mobile phones with the use of funds collected through our environmental conservation tax bill
4139816 sri lanka too needs a mobile phone recycling and management facility for the safe disposal of dangerous accessories in them
4139817 but what i find in the black blogosphere you have people who dont profess to be political professionals

4139844 after the positive experience with the vicious engine during the development of our earlier xbox live title elements of destruction we decided that it made great sense to use the middleware again for our three upcoming games
4139845 so far the production processes for all titles have been smooth thanks to the powerful toolset offered by vicious cycle
4139846 the creative staff at frozen codebase has really showcased the versatility of vicious engine through zombie wranglers and fresco beach
4139847 vicious engine offers a balance of flexibility and stability that is up to any task from developing an action survival comedy to a building simulation
4139848 we wanted to create a home destination for wicked interactive gamers

4139850 2008 is the year that wood will again start being taken seriously as a fuel and thats good news for the south wests forestry industry pellet boilers combine the latest technologies such as automatic operation and remote control with one of worlds oldest heat sources and despite recent falls in fossil fuel prices wood is likely to remain cheaper than oil
4139851 there is no doubt that the move to pellet boilers will be massively important for us until recently we simply stored our waste boards but these are now being used in commercial wood fired boilers in the next few months we plan to start sending our sawdust to be made into pellets
4139852 although the popularity of these boilers is good news for the forestry industry and the environment i suspect people are actually choosing to install them because theyre concerned about this winters bills and want to protect themselves against rising costs

4139860 police say that drivers particularly commercial trucks are typically driving very slowly through the area police think the price of fuel may be causing drivers to travel slower than normal to save fuel while at the same time passing rest areas or truck stops
4139861 we are doing all we can to attract the best players and staff
4139862 having the 2010 olympics in canada we hear about it so much
4139863 for the whole team theres going to be pressure im trying to focus on enjoying skating and having fun when im having fun thats when i do my best
4139864 ill grant you that if you know going in that you will own a car for 5 to 10 years outright purchase even financed may be the way to go
4139865 however if you are unsure that you will want the car that long a 3 year lease often makes as much sense as living with your boyfriend girlfriend a few years before committing to marriage
4139866 i will always try to rent an asset that declines in value and gives me no tax benefit in exchange for my sacrifice rather than purchase it
4139867 this time i feel real lucky to be leasing i have a 2006 tahoe with 16 months left it is so under water now and when the lease is up it will be worth 12 000 less than the residual if i had purchased it i would be in big trouble
4139868 you may think it makes more sense to keep a car until it is paid off and driving it around for years makes good financial sense
4139869 to me it makes the most sense to never own a depreciating asset especially one that depreciates as fast as an automobile
4139870 depreciation is just an accounting term that we use to write off the useful life of the assets ability to produce earnings we cannot and should not use this in our personal finances our personal assets do not generate revenue and therefore cannot be depreciated
4139871 my husband has recently retired after over 40 years of hard work and would love to own a porsche always has wanted one never could afford it but we both think the price tag on cars like this is ridiculous and a waste of good money i hate for him not to be able to realize his lifelong dream or to enjoy himself tooling around in a porsche for a year or two and suggested he lease one then give it back after the two year period a mistake
4139872 god wants me to be the best that i can be with the tools he has given me
4139873 more than that i think that god wants me to share whatever i have little as it may be with others to watch out for my fellow man while i watch out for myself and that the reward may be more in my heart than in my wallet but for me thats better
4139874 i believe god doesnt want us to be poor or rich its our attitude about money that matters the world contains enough resources for each person to have what he she needs but in our quest for more some folks take more than they need which means others end up lacking as you said its tragic to drive a mercedes and not give someone a ride i believe god would say rather than giving them a ride sell the mercedes buy two hybrids and give one to the person without a car
4139875 i dont believe for a minute god wants us to be poor
4139876 would any father or mother want their children to have anything less than the best that doesnt mean everything will be handed to us
4139877 god wants me to be a steward of the resources of my life so that no one in my circle of influence is poor
4139878 when you are given the blessings of good health and a wealth of opportunity you need to recognize that these are gifts by the grace of god with experience these gifts can be leveraged to gain a joy of living and they need to be nurtured by the joy of giving

4139937 in talks about making cars cleaner and more fuel efficient with engineers here ive asked whether a small turbine turning at a constant rate wouldnt be an ideal way to power the generator of an electric motor driven car alas the noise high rpm and heat are still expensive problems and turbines small enough to serve such a purpose are prohibitively expensive compared to existing alternatives such as small diesels
4139938 perhaps the biggest drawback is in fuel economy even though the engine itself is relatively efficient it operates at a high rpm even while at idle
4139939 dont anybody mention the word turbine here we have no idea what caused this car to blow up spilled fuel maybe it has nothing to do with the turbine powered car visiting in town

4139950 from the time these chicks were collected in norway and brought over to scotland in june ive watched them grow up and now theyre raring to go
4139951 im really excited to see where they go and if theyll meet up with last years birds people are usually amazed when they see how massive they really are and it really helps if people can report sightings to me by emailing me at

4139953 the re establishment of scotlands sea eagle population range to its former glory is a key part of our species management plans over the next few years

4139984 russias goal is to put an end to the existence of the georgian state
4139985 possibly they thought they could move quickly enough to present the russians with a fait accompli
4139986 the heart of the matter is a miscalculation that the russians would not react at the level they reacted and push back as they did

4139989 people in washington now see him as impetuous and hotheaded
4139990 its generally accepted public opinion here that mr soros is the person who planned shevardnadzes overthrow
4139991 people knew where to get real information they were informed about the details of the election when to go into the streets where and how
4139992 it is necessary to mobilize civil society in order to assure free and fair elections because there are many forces that are determined to falsify or to prevent the elections being free and fair
4139993 this is what we did in slovakia at the time of vladimir meciar in croatia at the time of franjo tudjman and in yugoslavia at the time of milosevic

4139995 now it is time for the government to be afraid of people
4139996 intolerance towards people with different opinions is being planted in georgian politics and in other spheres of social life
4139997 hes not a hothead thats russian propaganda thats the way they would like to see him portrayed in the west
4139998 but i think it was a mistake for him to act as he did and the better policy would have been to show restraint did he make a tactical blunder the answer is almost certainly yes but i dont think it was more than a tactical blunder
4139999 i think he knew the russians were looking for an opportunity or a pretext to seize south ossetia and abkhazia he felt he had a last opportunity to consolidate south ossetia because the russian plan was already laid
