1880469 every conceivable hypothesis is initially a possibility if a hypothesis can be observed repeated and predicted in a controlled environment it becomes an agreed upon theory there is always a chance for further refinement subject to more experimentation and observation a hypothesis is rejected only and only if there exist a proven mechanism to prove its falsehood if a hypothesis can not be proved explicitly false in a controlled environment or through deductions from experiments in controlled environment it can not be said to be false it still remains a possibility
1880470 i found no scientific evidence for possibility to create electrical energy from magnetic energy as per my experiments so this hypothesis remains a possibility
1880471 since i was not able to generate electrical energy from magnetic energy hence it is not possible to generate electrical energy from magnetic energy
1880472 god exists who has created the universe and who himself is not a creation
1880473 if god is omnipotent can he send all pious people to hell and all tyrants to heaven

1880551 is where the studios assigning all the people they hate
1880552 are possibly the best to star in this hideous drivel because only they would be able to truly express its inanity the male lead is roy cicero
1880553 wasnt he involved that drunk driving case back in august
1880554 and the one in march and the one last november
1880555 the studios tired of bailing him out matinee idol though he may be and the lead actress is monique may
1880556 why she was involved in the most scandalous murder new yorks ever seen
1880557 you mean monique keller thats her married name she murdered her husband didnt she
1880558 he was some painter a real artistic guy and then one day she found out hed been sleeping with her sister madeleine may you know the circus ballerina sure if she ran them through with a carving knife or poisoned them with arsenic flavoured chewing gum but whatever she did theyre certain she did it ten times
1880559 thats why im for the carving knife theory but the thing is she got off scot free and the studio wants to wash its hands of her but of course they cant contracts and all that so theyve dumped her and cicero on this project with me theyre hoping the whole thing is a giant flop
1880560 and then theyll have a good excuse to get rid of us all
1880561 and here we are at the docks step this way my only hope

1880595 living in a constant construction zone is a phrase that i connected with from the session the tools are constantly changing to meet the needs of users and include new features which is good this has caused me to reflect on the way i instruct and model the use of technology for teachers when preparing i visualize classroom application and the management issues that need to be addressed i spend a lot of time creating how to guides with specific numbered steps but these learning objects can become outdated in just days i need to model how i learn new tools opportunities arise during workshops in which a teacher asks how to do something i havent tried yet and i model then how to find the answer teachers need to be able to deal with the constant state of change of web 2 0 tools said in his keynote one of the most important tasks we can complete as educators is to show our students how to be learners i need to model more for the teachers the strategies i use when learning a new tool up to this point the purpose of my blog has been basically informational i now see a reason for using it for reflecting on my own learning
1880596 democratic senators charles schumer and dianne feinstein have led the senate and all of us across a dangerous line until now the administrations illegal renditions interrogations and wiretaps have been debated following after the fact disclosures but the senates all but certain confirmation of mukasey hes since been sworn in despite his evasions on water boarding is something new collusion by a majority of the washington political establishment in a specific practice recognized as uncivilized since the inquisition
1880597 in person rorty did not let tough mindedness stand in the way of graciousness or vice versa his political convictions on the democratic left were unwavering and deep
1880598 in articles on public education market fundamentalism and the iraq war the historian casey blake recently observed rorty has emerged as one of our most eloquent and impassioned public intellectuals a model of what michael walzer has called a connected critic an intellectual who implores his fellow citizens to live up to the moral values they claim to hold dear
1880599 before 9 11 i would have said that the principal area in which democratic institutions needed improvements is the old familiar one we need to put those institutions to use in order to level the life chances of poor children and rich children
1880600 when rorty argued in the 80s that we were against torture not because it violated a universal human right but simply because torture was not what our tribe did those were the days i was not convinced
1880601 is a famous french sociologist highly admired by left academics in numerous countries who takes rorty seriously
1880602 how would rorty distinguish claims by biologists working for marlboro from claims by biologists seeking objectivity and if true beliefs do not correspond to the intrinsic nature of reality but arise only from intersubjective agreement how does rorty counter when the entire u s media says the u s bombed vietnam to benefit the vietnamese
1880603 pragmatist anti foundationalist or consensus based theories of knowledge theories which take it pretty much for granted that beliefs happen to prevail among members of some existing interpretive community such ideas have enjoyed a considerable vogue among post analytical philosophers like richard rorty and others who seek to cut philosophy or theory down to size by arguing that its truth claims are wholly redundant that its concepts and categories are so many sublimated metaphors or items of surplus metaphysical baggage and that therefore we might as well junk this whole tradition of misguided philosophical endeavour together with its various latter day offshoots in sociology jurisprudence literary criticism and the human sciences at large then again post structuralism has promoted the idea that reality is a purely discursive phenomenon a product of the various signifying systems which provide the only means of interpreting experience from some given socio cultural perspective
1880604 truth and reason are obsolete values overtaken by the advent of post modern hyperreality in the end
1880605 there seems little reason to share rortys faith that democratic values will surely prevail if only we can keep the dialogue going and prevent all those earnest seekers after truth from attempting to have the last word what this argument ignores is the simple point that getting things right as regards the historical record is the only adequate means of counteracting the various myths pseudo histories propaganda ploys or strong revisionist narratives that can otherwise be invented pretty much to order by those with the power to intervene in the production of socially acceptable truth
1880606 spectacle is crucial in creating our view of events things do not happen if they are not seen
1880607 and again a decade later for describing the 9 11 attacks as a dark fantasy baudrillard focused his work on how our consciousness interacts with reality and fantasy creating them for a copy world he called hyper reality he said that mass media led to hyper reality becoming a dominant force in todays world an argument taken to a provocative extreme in his statement that the 1991 gulf war primarily took place on a symbolic level
1880608 it had been possible to regard such ideas as a depressing but fairly harmless symptom of the way that theory was liable to go when exploited by writers with a flair for publicity or the knack of avoiding peer group review
1880609 disneyland tv commercials soap operas phone in chatshows and so forth items whose manifest hyperreality indeed calls out for such debunking treatment in fact it is only fair to say that at his best baudrillard as with rorty one might add is a sharp eyed diagnostician with a keen sense for the absurdity of these and kindred signs of his times
1880610 we might as well abandon talk of matters such as truth and reality and adapt to living in a postmodern world of proliferating language games signs without referents and illusions that we could never recognize as such
1880611 must be seen as a kind of mass induced media fantasy a product of the various suasive techniques which create the semblance of informed public debate while placing it beyond hope of attainment
1880612 i disagreed with almost every position he ever took but rorty was for me an inspiration he showed me and generations of students and readers how to think and speak boldly how to transcend the constraining conventions of academia and most important of all how to drive professors crazy
1880613 yeah i remember those they were awful have you tried calcium supplements
1880614 well when i was living as a girl and i said such and so i meant this
1880615 why do you have to change your body so radically in order to have people treat you like you want
1880616 how can you say anything about feminism you gave up being a woman
1880617 if youre not going to get a dick why do you want to be a man
1880618 i knew you were one of those i could just sense it
1880619 what sex acts get you hot and what turns you off
1880620 i know this sex change must have been hard for you
1880621 youre very brave to go through such hard experiences to be yourself most people wouldnt

1880642 la iglesia no puede retirarse c modamente dentro de los l mites de su propio ambiente tiene por cometido la solicitud universal debe preocuparse por todos y de todos
1880643 toda especie de fieras y p jaros de reptiles y bestias marinas se pueden domar y han sido domadas por el hombre la lengua en cambio ning n hombre es capaz de domarla es da ina e inquieta cargada de veneno mortal con ella bendecimos al que es se or y padre con ella maldecimos a los hombres creados a semejanza de dios de la misma boca salen bendiciones y maldiciones eso no puede ser hermanos m os

1880648 dios se enfrenta con los soberbios y da su gracia a los humildes
1880649 no le vaya a poner las manos encima dice la gente tu vas y se las pones a los ni os y dices m s a n quien no es como ni o no es digno de conocer el reino
1880650 el que os llam es santo como l sed tambi n vosotros santos en toda vuestra conducta
1880651 el servicio de jes s llega a su plenitud con la muerte en cruz o sea con el don total de s mismo
1880652 el nico lugar en el mundo donde no hay sitio para esconderse
1880653 qu es el tiempo la paciencia de dios en la historia
1880654 toma parte en los duros trabajos del evangelio seg n las fuerzas que dios te d
1880655 que ya no tengo oficio que ya s lo en amar es mi ejercicio
1880656 en la balanza de la justicia divina no se pesa la cantidad de los dones sino el peso de los corazones
1880657 os aseguro que esta pobre viuda ha echado en el cepillo m s que nadie

1880660 el rey jos as junt al pueblo y les ley el libro de la alianza encontrado en el templo
1880661 gracias a dios nunca perd la fe rezaba el rosario y me sent a con esperanzas
1880662 someone who has balanced their hemispheres to achieve a fusion of the technological and the spiritual the techno person understands that rationality organization long term planning consistency and single mindedness are necessary to achieve anything solid on the material level the hippie understands that vision individuality spontaneity flexibility and open mindedness are crucial to realize anything on the spiritual scale
1880663 i kind of came round the corner expecting to see a communal food tent and a few hippies but there in front of me was what looked like the whole cherokee nation teepees as far as the eye could see
1880664 but during the 80s the government came back with a vengeance
1880665 we wanted to recycle that vibe for the winter in london when the government killed off the festi scene we were left as a repository of 60s values like a zoo
1880666 wed all been into kraftwerk and synthesizer stuff dance music was from the same head space so it was natural to move into it
1880667 before zippies we had all these silly fragmented subcults not talking to each other
1880668 hippies had dwindled to a few thousand around the country
1880669 the bottom line is unity you have to have all types of people into it then the powers cant pick us off also a mix of ages is very important to blend experience with enthusiasm
1880670 squatting travelling anything but being a bank clerk will soon be illegal the example and wisdom of hippies proves to the young raver that there is an alternative and an opposition the government has driven raves out of business in the last two years and theyre still taking people out for underground parties they organized three years ago people have gone to prison for ten years and no one raised a finger
1880671 rock used to be a revolutionary and progressive force but for the last five years ambient dance music is where the progressive experimental work has been revived
1880672 out of the awful materialism of the 80s this wonderful scene has emerged i dont parallel it with the hippie movement but i get a lot of the same feelings as when i was growing up all different types of people there with a spirit of oneness a lot of what is good about the uk scene is what was claimed to be good about the 60s only this time its real not skin deep
1880673 the zippie movement has more positive energy and enthusiasm than anything else ive ever seen
1880674 there is a world of difference between zippies and the cyberpunks
1880675 a zippie feels the terror and promise of the planets situation and is prepared to use anything short of violence magic technology entrepreneurial skill to create a new age in as short a time as possible
1880676 we need the maximum number of people to change in the shortest possible time the best way is to make the alternative fashionable
1880677 still in the stone age of personal computing hardware costs twice as much as in the states and is two years out of date but we do have a strong rave culture
1880678 i spent my first twenty years as a hippie trying to get away from the techno side of things
1880679 maybe the force which will bring about the revolution in consciousness which is what we are aiming at
1880680 we are seeing nothing less than the rise of a new industry to replace the dead one that has not produced jobs
1880681 tv is not feeding us what we want theres no reason to stay at home were not pushing vinyl but a complete culture can sony or philips do this
1880682 weve been ripped off so many times were naturally sussed against corporatism
1880683 it stimulates ego role behavior reduction offering the experience of unity and affinity with others this experience invalidates liberal individualistic ideology and creates true political opposition
1880684 you can control some of the people all of the time you can control all the people some of the time but you cant control all the people all the fucking time
1880685 theres been a rejection of the control structure at the same time that the technology has appeared for us to remain totally independent fulfillment now comes not from political adherence but by not voting in fact by having nothing to do with the system
1880686 britain is socially and politically the most fucked up of the western democracies the most divided by youth cults
1880687 hippies never died out in the us were never out of fashion the way they were here
1880688 theres no infrastructure raving is more than music theres a whole lifestyle but toeholds exist in san francisco and toeholds can lead to crazes and suddenly its massive
1880689 sapevamo di molte terre abbandonate e disponibili e in pi il clima era perfetto
1880690 ci fermeremo a diecimila ettari il resto verr comprato da altri investitori ora dobbiamo convincere i coltivatori a venire in romania
1880691 i know how hard this must be for you all so if there is anything anything i can do to help you at all please let me know
1880692 oh okay i know they have a concept of nothingness
1880693 it was about the tea ceremony you know they have a tea ceremony thing here well it turns out it might be related to the fact that a long time ago christians had to hide they were not allowed here
1880694 el pueblo vencido jam s estuvo unido el pueblo unido jam s ser vencido
1880695 the movie will give you something to look at because when i was making this record i was real visual about it
1880696 i had a cartoon mind while i was making it so i just wanted to bring that to the light
1880697 i got snoop doggs tape tha dogg pound and terrace martin
1880698 i figured if i go to the west coast i might as well come heavy i might as well come strong and who better to introduce me than the ogs
1880699 ima go with the veterans and then help introduce terrace martin to the scene

1880704 if a bus driver is on 40 000 and gets offered a lot more to go somewhere else what do you think theyre going to do
1880705 are they going to change bus companies or are they going to sit there and say all these people want me to stay here because im the best bus driver around its just common sense
1880706 hopefully some good can come out of what ive done and it wakes everybody up and they realise that something needs to be done
1880707 what ive done its shown its just not about me its about the boys getting a fair go you know what i mean
1880708 its about them having the balls to stand up for themselves and get what they should be getting
1880709 because if were going to be getting treated like that why cant we treat the clubs like that

1880738 as of tuesday afternoon only one person in phoenix took the offer
1880739 here is a guy the candidates have to talk to this summer
1880740 when we went there we found an astonishing amount of kossacks
1880741 from the processes that we have observed to date there is no evidence of widespread problems with the quality of the marks at key stage 3 that would justify withholding publication of the provisional results at national level
1880742 the head of profession for statistics has decided to delay publication of provisional ks3 results at the local authority level until there is sufficient volume of data for every local authority in all three subjects to enable publication of a complete set of provisional results on a consistent basis for all local authorities
1880743 because of their smaller size local authority figures require a higher proportion of results than the national figures require to enable the production of reliable provisional results
1880744 a data processing issue has caused some subsequent records to indicate pupils as absent incorrectly
1880745 if the results are not now accurate enough to publish at a local authority level they should have been held back at a national level too
1880746 this announcement gives every impression of a government which understands that there are serious doubts about the key stage 3 test results but ministers are clearly too petrified to admit this
1880747 ministers have let down parents pupils heads and teachers and theres still no sign that they appreciate their direct responsibility for the fiasco
1880748 the fact is that secular music speaks to people seekers unchurched and churched alike because many secular songs articulate universal human needs the reason so many songs are written about love is because its a universal desire and one that the bible affirms when it tells us that gods very nature is love a secular song in church is so attractive then because every attendee is likely to be familiar with it and comfortable listening to its truth most people expect a teacher to use non biblical stories to illustrate a biblical truth at saddleback we use secular songs as illustrations pointing people to biblical truth
1880749 the broader trend is for payers to pay for good performance and not pay for extremely poor performance which is a fundamental principle of good business practices before adam smith but its never been applied to health care
1880750 you dont have to pay for the airline ticket if the airplane crashes and there are other examples
1880751 we are talking about very dramatic events that should never occur
1880752 the majority of hospitals do not bill us for never events but given the complexity of billing billing systems and billing agencies some never events may slip through
1880753 with this new policy in place we can work to close the gaps and also focus on improving quality
1880754 we are committed that patients and payers not pay for care related to a never event that was within the hospitals control and preventable
1880755 there is no way to know whether that condition was there or whether it was under the hospitals control to begin with
1880756 you would have to test everybody before they arrived at the hospital
1880757 we have to have disaster recovery planning the 90 days to fix it thing isnt going to fly
1880758 theres a lot of attention thats been focused on this and thats good
1880759 why we love the nature and chemistry of romantic love
1880760 por que n s amamos a natureza e a qu mica do amor rom ntico
1880761 if i knew that there was at least one zero in it i could tell you the number
1880762 reason to change your mind about which answers are true and which are false
1880763 it is probably the biggest trend in supercomputers the movement away from ivory tower research and government sponsored research to commerce and business
1880764 more than half the list reside in commercial enterprises thats a huge shift and its been under way for years
1880765 industry can no longer compete in the traditional cost and quality terms they have to look for innovation and they do that by using supercomputers so it really becomes one of the key ingredients to their innovative capacity production growth and really affects our standard of living today
1880766 almost every area of industry today is using supercomputers they use them to predict traffic patterns and many other things they are used in many ways that affect our lives in real ways
1880767 when you turn on the tv set at night and listen to the news and the weather guy tells you what the weather is going to be thats based on a supercomputer forecast using physics and mathematics high performance computers predict whats going to happen tomorrow in the next three days and the week to come
1880768 in drug discovery supercomputers simulate protein folding to determine if new drugs will couple with the proteins related to diseases and disorders
1880769 the very largest machines will still tend to be used for scientific research or other government funded applications but theres plenty of computing being applied to corporate research and even direct business applications as well
1880770 they have to do a lot of it and they have to be very fast about it because they want to finish the movie in a timely fashion
1880771 today one mega flop costs 10 cents or 1 100 for the same capacity that deep blue needed 550 000 for the technology is becoming more prevalent more ubiquitous the processors are becoming multi core and more able to do it and youve got people that have been doing this for a while and are riding this price performance curve as the price of supercomputing power comes down its interesting what even experienced users are doing with their systems
1880772 smaller supercomputers are becoming more affordable and often are owned by individual companies for their exclusive use as the cost of supercomputing declines more of these machines become available for broad use and more applications become practical for them
1880773 theyre used for all manner of simulations business analytics and product design applications even a consumer goods company like p amp g proctor amp gamble uses high performance computing extensively
1880774 p amp g used a supercomputer to do an aerodynamic simulation and now produces pringles that are aerodynamically sound and do not fly off of the assembly line
1880775 these are applications that would not have been done four or five years ago because they were cost prohibitive they are becoming more widespread as the cost has come down
1880776 that use the same type of finger tapping interface popularized by apple inc s aapl iphone
1880777 we see touch as the almost preferred method for nontechnical users
1880778 consideration should be given to whether the government should establish a mechanism for purchasing assets from stressed banks in return for warrants or other consideration
1880779 there can be no basis for confidence that the american economy will recover even in the medium term
1880780 as a committed materialist in college i assumed the physical was all there was
1880781 that was a dramatic turn for me the concepts were not hypothetical anymore
1880782 i had never really looked at the evidence atheism had only been a convenient pathway i had to decide what was really the truth but i thought that faith and reason were on opposite poles
1880783 even in the first few pages all my arguments about faith just fell apart it was breathtaking lewis remains my best teacher
1880784 as a committed materialist in college i assumed the physical was all there was

1880791 recent articles suggesting that ron is considering stepping back or that he will step back if the world championship is won by vodafone mclaren mercedes this year have been based around a very old quote
1880792 ron has made it clear on numerous occasions that he has made no decision as to if and when he may or may not step aside
1880793 it still has to be fully decided but i am happy to do that if the teams would like me to
1880794 we need the first stage done first which is about how we can all work together without making it too heavy we need to have something that is clear but we dont want a 100 page document amp 183 it would be a shame if it resorted to that
1880795 we appreciate this approach to ask the teams or in this case to the engine manufacturers to come up with a proposal of next generation engines
1880796 we have only started to discuss it but we want to do it
1880797 what the outcome is in terms of technology timing and costs it is too early to say we can just say that we share the desire to bring costs down we want to have an engine that carries future road car technology so the aims are quite similar but if the approach is the same it is too early to say
1880798 we are definitely not in the sport to finance several other teams
1880799 furono gli altri ad accorgersi per primi di quello che alice e mattia avrebbero capito solo molti anni pi avanti entrarono nella stanza tenendosi per mano non sorridevano e i loro sguardi seguivano traiettorie divergenti ma era come se i loro corpi fluissero con continuit luno nellaltro attraverso le braccia e le dita a contatto il contrasto marcato tra i capelli chiari di alice che ne incorniciavano la pelle del viso troppo pallida e quelli scuri di mattia arruffati in avanti a nascondergli gli occhi neri si annullava in quellarco sottile che li congiungeva cera uno spazio comune tra di loro i cui confini non erano ben delineati dove sembrava non mancare nulla e dove laria pareva immobile imperturbata alice lo precedeva di un passo e la trazione debole di mattia ne equilibrava la cadenza annullando le imperfezioni della sua gamba difettosa lui si lasciava trasportare e i suoi piedi non facevano rumore sulle piastrelle le sue cicatrici erano nascoste e al sicuro dentro la mano di lei

1880827 that would be when the light is coming at the surface at a very steep angle and the specular reflection would be the strongest and most intense
1880828 it could be water and land it could be some other liquids particularly where its further out where you might have methane like on titan
1880829 if we have an idea of how far away the planet is from the star and how bright the star is then maybe we could say methane would not be liquid at those temperatures

1880852 the mouth of a perfectly contented man is filled with beer
1880853 theres frustration there because theyre watching these childish ad campaigns and they know exactly how to answer it but theyre powerless to do so
1880854 how can one respect any of their co workers having seen them behave in a manner that makes children fighting over crayons seem mature and diplomatic

1880859 our job is to do more than lay out another road map

1880871 there hasnt been new ground up market rate housing in newark in 40 years
1880872 we feel there is pent up demand for newark because of its transportation access to manhattan
1880873 in times like this i think people are seeking value
1880874 in many places land prices are still inflated and sellers havent adjusted their expectations developers that can get in today are the ones that are going to be successful three or four years down the road
1880875 we believe that aig can find solid footing above 26 the equivalent of one times tangible book
1880876 we do not expect a need to raise capital and would expect aig to claw back early morning declines as this becomes clearer
1880877 at present we do not see how aig could quickly reduce its large exposure to the subprime market as well as to the financial market as a whole
1880878 in the current specific environment we believe that aig shares are unlikely to trade higher than the average of banking peers with high subprime exposure
1880879 were adversely affected by the severe conditions in the housing and credit markets and a very difficult investment environment
1880880 we have a lot of work to do to restore aigs profitability to where it should be
1880881 however with its remit on price stability and explicit 2 inflation target despite the weakening outlook the bank is looking to uphold its credibility by waiting for inflationary pressure to ease before it cuts rates
1880882 the longer rates are kept high the harder the economic slowdown will be we have no reason to change our bearish call
1880883 we need to build a new strategic engagement with popular voices in somalia
1880884 we have terrorists in our midst still planning awful deeds
1880885 i truly believe that the fact that kenya and the united states have both moved ahead to strengthen their democracies and to expand well being for their people is probably the best honour we could possibly pay to those victims
1880886 but i have to tell you i cant believe that your kids are so well behaved
1880887 thank you but this is a treat and theyve been warned
1880888 aaaand for answering the question correctly i believe that you should have this game
1880889 well if he doesnt want it ive got a 13 year old at home
1880890 im sure hell be more than happy to have it
1880891 and the poor woman probably assumed that i you know must know her blog handle but she did manage to scare me and my kids into submission
1880892 i guess you guys are a little too young to watch
1880893 excuse me but can you tell me where i can find this room
1880894 excuse me but why are we sleeping across the street
1880895 did i mention that i have this terrible fear of heights
1880896 theyve allowed me to escape into a private little world though quite undeservedly named and rather unpleasant to the ear blogging has simply become a refuge from you know the average every day same old same old
1880897 in light of the imploding order flow the july ecb rate hike looks increasingly like a policy mistake in need of being urgently reversed
1880898 the orders data are some further evidence flagging up significant recession risks and therefore implying that the ecbs next move will be a rate cut albeit not for some time
1880899 somehow weve got to find a way to get robert to continue what hes doing in qualifying but to stay out of trouble in the race and mikhail to up his game in qualifying and carry on racing as he is at the moment
1880900 if theres some bad luck to be had it seems to be coming our way so far this season but i believe we have a very good and consistently quick car and were aiming to make the most of that at the final four races
1880901 boy you and your wife are on totally opposite sides of the aisle huh

1880903 i hear san francisco is nice this time of year
1880904 probably cloud computing would be more popular already if people didnt have concerns about the risks
1880905 i dont think most of the potential users are truly cognizant of the risks but they have a usefully intuitive sense that this is something new and it shouldnt be undertaken lightly
1880906 theres a control issued i lump cloud computing in with consumerization with being yet another example of how the end user is taking over the initiative from it if they dont like the answer that it gives them theyll just go out and buy the thing
1880907 how much of salesforce com was motivated by sales mangers who just wanted to get away from it and put in their own crm
1880908 when you buy something in the cloud its an expense when you buy something like a computer its an investment
1880909 so its a different color of money and people like that
1880910 call up google and ask them how transparent they are
1880911 i contrast them with salesforce com in terms of their transparency
1880912 we emphasize salesforce as having some early attempts at transparency we didnt really flag google as being the evil twin to salesforce but theyre awfully opaque

1880931 the whole concept is absolutely ridiculous its metrosexuality gone stark raving mad
1880932 these can save someones life so its not a laughing matter
1880933 some women spend a lot of money enhancing the size of their breasts and you dont want them unprotected and have a bullet graze them and have blood or silicon leak out its crazy that weve been allowing women to take those kinds of risks
1880934 legs knees and thighs have always been more resilient than breasts and if you ask a stripper what part of their body most often gets injured most during a busy night theyll tell you its their boobs either they whack them on a pole or some guy grabs them too hard well my place is taking its queue from the germans were protecting our girls jugs if bullet proof bras are what the germans want and they conquered half of europe on their own before a whole host of nations got them stopped then theyre good enough for my joint so help me god

1880939 and were not willing to believe that the discovery of aafia in afghanistan is coincidence
1880940 there are many questions that the fbi and the pakistani government need to answer in light of this admission
1880941 aafia siddiqui is a woman who has been plagued by a number of problems in her life none of which have anything to do with involvement with al qaeda
1880942 whilst we welcome this disclosure from the fbi it has only come after mounting international pressure and five years of detention and abuse siddiquis case represents the problem of disappearances in pakistan in the most tragic way the acceptance by the fbi that siddiqui has been in custody in afghanistan raises important questions which must be answered by the pakistani and us governments siddiqui must be returned to pakistan in order to faces charges for any crime she may have committed or released along with her children

1881053 right now we dont know whether finding perchlorate is good news or bad news for possible life on mars
1881054 per ora non sappiamo se laver trovato perclorati una buona o cattiva notizia per una possibilie vita su marte
1881055 how this perchlorate affects habitability on mars is certainly a complex question that we dont have a final answer on
1881056 it really doesnt limit us in our search for habitability in this icy soil and if we were lucky enough to see some organic signatures we wouldnt be surprised
1881057 come questo perclorato possa interferire con labitabilit su marte certamente una domanda a cui noi non abbiamo una risposta finale
1881058 veramente non ci limita nella nostra ricerca di abitabilit in questo suolo ghiacciato e se siamo abbastanza fortunati da vedere qualche traccia di materiale organico non saremmo sorpresi
1881059 quindi considerate le cose dette sopra mi pare alquanto azzardato

1881234 i will play for manchester with all my heart and soul i will fight and honour that shirt with the same commitment and dedication as always
1881235 i was the one who publicly expressed my desire to go to real madrid i ended up being even involuntarily responsible for the poor relationship between the two clubs
1881236 i knew real madrid were interested in signing me and that they had allegedly made a very high offer to manchester united
1881237 my desire was for some time that manchester had accepted my transfer to madrid saying otherwise would be to trick people and my own consciousness
1881238 he was free to do what he wanted and its a shame that he isnt coming to us because hes a player who would really have improved this great group
1881239 know that the life of this world is only an idle talk pageantry and boasting among you and rivalry in respect of wealth and children as the likeness of vegetation after rain whereof the growth is pleasing to the husbandman then it becomes straw
1881240 this world is the prison of the believer and the paradise of the unbeliever
1881241 there is no real living except the living of the hereafter
1881242 aishah the wife of the prophet said sometimes no fire was burned in the house of the prophet for three months we only ate during this time dates and drank water in addition to some gifts of milk we occasionally received
1881243 say who hath forbidden the adornment of allah which he has brought forth for his bondmen and the good things of his providing say such on the day of resurrection will be only for those who believed in the life the world
1881244 o mankind eat of that which is lawful and wholesome in the earth and follow not the footsteps of the devil
1881245 saying eat of the good things where with we have provided you
1881246 o ye who believe forbid not the good things which allah has made lawful to you and transgress not o allah loveth not transgressors
1881247 and has made of service into you what were in heaven and whatsoever in the earth it is all from him
1881248 and he is it who hath constrained the sea to be of service
1881249 there cometh forth both from them the pearl and the coral stone 23 these verses say that if these good are
1881250 aishah the wife of the prophet said that some companions of the prophet said we shall not marry women and we shall not sleep in bed the prophet came to know that and said why some people say such and such i fast and breakfast i sleep and keep vigil aqum and i eat meat and marry women this is my way of life and those who dont like my way of life are not my followers
1881251 but seek the abode of the hereafter in that which allah has given thee and neglect not thy portion of the world and be thou kind even as allah has been kind to thee and seek not corruption in the earth o allah loveth not corruption

1881293 humility is honestly assessing ourselves in light of gods holiness and our sinfulness
1881294 the proud person seeks to glorify himself and not god thereby attempting in effect to deprive god of something only he is worthy to receive
1881295 show me a church where theres division where theres quarreling and ill show you a church where theres pride
1881296 most of us spend more time listening to lies than we do speaking truth to ourselves
1881297 where theres worry where theres anxiousness pride is at the root of it when i am experiencing anxiety the root issue is that im trying to be self sufficient im acting independent of god
1881298 for too many their understanding of gods activity has been reduced to the spectacular and it appears to them that the spectacular is something that happens only to someone else never to them
1881299 where theres an absence of edifying words theres also normally the presence of pride and of self righteousness because those who are proud are too preoccupied with themselves and think too highly of themselves to care about building others up or to be sensitive to their true needs
1881300 you cant effectively watch yourself by yourself you need the discerning eyes of others
1881301 the crucial unanswered question is not whether we will suffer but how well respond when we suffer
1881302 and we know that in all things god works for the good of those who love him who have been called according to his purpose
1881303 sorry dat ik zo naar u sta te kijken dat is waarschijnlijk wel vervelend voor u maar ik kan mijn ogen niet van u afhouden u lijkt zo treffend op mijn zoon die er niet meer is
1881304 sorry maar ik wil u iets vragen u mag gerust nee zeggen maar ik zou het zo fijn vinden om hem nog een laatste keer

1881310 and yet everything that is created does not rest in me behold my mystic opulence although i am the maintainer of all living entities and although i am everywhere i am not a part of this cosmic manifestation for my self is the very source of creation
1881311 understand that as the mighty wind blowing everywhere rests always in the sky all created beings rest in me
1881312 o dhananjaya all this work cannot bind me i am ever detached from all these material activities seated as though neutral
1881313 a person by understanding all these reaches beyond what by performing yagna tapas and chairity as stipulated in vedas could yield noble results he reaches the highest and most ancient place
1881314 yet there is another unmanifest nature which is eternal and is transcendental to this manifested and unmanifested matter it is supreme and is never annihilated when all in this world is annihilated that part remains as it is
1881315 that which the vedantists describe as unmanifest and infallible that which is known as the supreme destination that place from which having attained it one never returns that is my supreme abode
1881316 o best of the bharatas i shall now explain to you the different times at which passing away from this world the yogi does or does not come back
1881317 those who know the supreme brahman attain that supreme by passing away from the world crossing the places of light place of the gods for daytime waxing phase of moon utharyanam
1881318 this material nature which is one of my energies is working under my direction o son of kunti producing all moving and nonmoving beings under its rule this manifestation is created and annihilated again and again
1881319 those who are thus bewildered are attracted by demonic and atheistic views in that deluded condition their hopes for liberation their fruitive activities and their culture of knowledge are all defeated
1881320 always chanting my glories endeavoring with great determination bowing down before me these great souls perpetually worship me with devotion
1881321 the supreme personality of godhead said my dear arjuna because you are never envious of me i shall impart to you this most confidential knowledge and realization knowing which you shall be relieved of the miseries of material existence
1881322 this knowledge is the king of education the most secret of all secrets it is the purest knowledge and because it gives direct perception of the self by realization it is the perfection of religion it is everlasting and it is joyfully performed
1881323 those who are not faithful in this devotional service cannot attain me o conqueror of enemies therefore they return to the path of birth and death in this material world
1881324 o best among the bharatas four kinds of pious men begin to render devotional service unto me the distressed wanting to regain loss the desirer of new wealth the atman inquisitive and he who is searching for knowledge of the absolute
1881325 of these the one who is in full knowledge and who is always engaged in pure devotional service is the best for i am very dear to him and he is dear to me
1881326 one who at the time of death fixes his life air between the eyebrows and by the strength of yoga with an undeviating mind engages himself in remembering the supreme lord in full devotion will certainly attain to the supreme personality of godhead
1881327 the yogic situation is that of detachment from all sensual engagements closing all the doors of the senses and fixing the mind on the heart and the life air at the top of the head one establishes himself in yoga
1881328 by continuous meditating on me in the single syllable om he who is on his journey leaving body reaches supreme position
1881329 for one who always remembers me without deviation i am easy to obtain o son of pritha because of his constant engagement in devotional service
1881330 endowed with such a faith he endeavors to worship a particular demigod and obtains his desires but in actuality these benefits are bestowed by me alone
1881331 men of small intelligence worship the demigods and their fruits are limited and temporary those who worship the demigods go to the planets of the demigods but my devotees ultimately reach my supreme planet
1881332 unintelligent men who do not know me perfectly think that i the supreme personality of godhead krishna was impersonal before and have now assumed this personality due to their small knowledge they do not know my higher nature which is imperishable and supreme
1881333 after attaining me the great souls who are yogis in devotion never return to this temporary world which is full of miseries because they have attained the highest perfection
1881334 from the highest planet in the material world down to the lowest all are places of misery wherein repeated birth and death take place but one who attains to my abode o son of kunti never takes birth again
1881335 at the beginning of brahmas day all living entities become manifest from the unmanifest state and thereafter when the night falls they are merged into the unmanifest again
1881336 whatever state of being one remembers when he quits his body o son of kunti that state he will attain without fail
1881337 he who meditates on me as the supreme personality of godhead his mind constantly engaged in remembering me undeviated from the path he o partha is sure to reach me
1881338 one should meditate upon the supreme person as the one who knows everything as he who is the oldest who is the controller who is smaller than the smallest who is the maintainer of everything who is beyond all material conception who is inconceivable he is luminous like the sun and he is transcendental beyond this material nature

1881481 no other vendor does that well release all the information on the threats we identified and what the mitigations are we want people in the industry to know all of the potential weaknesses we thought of and everything we did to minimize the risks the idea is to engage the community and get feedback we want to share everything we learn
1881482 we want security researchers to get an idea of the level of threats we tolerate i think its useful for the security research community to see what a complex product like firefox looks like
1881483 well be delivering the training in house to our developers then well make the material available broadly

1881491 if you would like to prove it to yourself youll have to do a little work
1881492 psychokinesis proving that human beings are more than flesh and blood
1881493 what i now know is that yesterday evening i made use of some kind of energy from within myself energy that science does not even acknowledge exists
1881494 doesnt that mean that maybe you were fooling yourself the first time
1881495 so were just flesh and blood are we watch this mate
1881496 eventually i learned how wrong this all was from a philosophical point of view but psionics provides a wonderful personal confirmation of it
1881497 so were just flesh and blood are we watch this mate
1881498 he said to him if they do not listen to moses and the prophets they will not be convinced even if someone rises from the dead
1881499 i fear some things are under the jurisdiction of science and proof and other things strictly dwell in realm of belief
1881500 this is essentially what i was for considerable periods of my life until i woke up to larger rational issues than chasing the burden of proof
1881501 we should build our beliefs through rational investigation both in science and religion i dont see two approaches
1881502 and during that time how do you reckon these psionics experiments would have impacted you
1881503 the bottom line is that most people are happy to wake up in the morning and believe whatever they want to believe and theres nothing you can say or do to change that
1881504 well then how can you insist that the power of your mind is moving your psi wheel when theres no more reason for you or me to believe that explanation over another which postulates that the movement is due to demonic spirits who are toying with you
1881505 i know the process of coming to that conclusion would require a lot of thought scientifically
1881506 the mental projection of energy travelling out of the brain through mid air and affecting another object
1881507 giving myself permission to believe it on no other grounds than because i want to
1881508 you may at best show coincidence of brain activity with movement of the wheel to be statistically significant the nature of the phenomenon makes that highly unlikely
1881509 they would merely note the apparent connection between brain activity and movement in the wheel without speculating on the cause and method of this connection
1881510 im not prepared to collectively give up on people like that and surely neither should you as a christian with a calling to spread the gospel
1881511 remember this experiment is something that adds weight to a view of the nature of man that is at least in part christianity affirming i e that we are more than just a body
1881512 based on the experiment so far and the results i dont see the demonic theory having a very strong case
1881513 i think this is purely a hidden ability that most of us ignore
1881514 you see it as a given that if people believed the psi wheel was real they would automatically draw the conclusion that our minds are not strictly physical things why do you think that
1881515 why hasnt it made a huge splash in science and the world at large
1881516 fair enough chris youre coming at it from the point of view that christianity is absolutely true and naturally anything with even the remotest whiff of a possible demonic connection is going to be immediately condemned
1881517 our ability to acquire or to generate tangible measureable information independent of distance or time challenges the foundation of any reductionistic brain based model of consciousness that may be invoked
1881518 there is no more of a case here for the existence of a soul than there is for energy beams coming out of your head than there is for demons playing around than there is for beings from another dimension reading your thoughts and using the psi wheel as an attempt for communication than there is for
1881519 you also seem to have lost any capacity for humility in your reasoning ever since this
1881520 they did find some implications that focused intentions especially in groups seems to have an effect outside of randomly generated data there was no mention of a soul however
1881521 im humble enough to change my mind when presented with something more rational than what i currently held
1881522 whether the wheel is moving through yourselves mind or through demon angel its coming from some sort of thought dome mind if it moves so be it
1881523 here we are having a pissing contest about stupid psi wheels how did this happen darryl whats going on here what are we doing
1881524 are you trying to control the wheel with your mind to prove that mind over matter does exist
1881525 if mind over matter does exist then surly that means our bodies are just a vessel for our souls
1881526 if the wheel spins something beyond our comprehension is moving it a mind soul is moving the wheel be it ours or theirs
1881527 ill tell you what worries me more than anything that youll take this to the length of letting it ruin our friendship that youll start looking at me like some kind of warlock that you dont want anywhere near your house
1881528 so like i asked in my last post why are we here laboring over psi wheels
1881529 this is just a discovery and like any discovery it should be investigated because it has implications for our view of consciousness
1881530 from my understanding their research showed results outside of randomly generated data but not statistically significant
1881531 that sounds like a contradiction surely if the results arent random then they are significant
1881532 what i do think is that people need to stop worshiping science like a god and recognize it as a tool

1881817 wireless providers have clearly made great strides in improving call quality
1881818 with an increasingly competitive environment and a jump in the number of services used in conjunction with cell phones carriers that offer superior network quality are more likely to attract new customers and increase customer retention in fact improving network quality is a beneficial financial incentive for wireless carriers as customers experiencing at least one call quality problem are almost four times more likely to switch carriers in the future

1882078 i will say that the identity of these kinds of groups are expressed by a line of poetry by iqbal lahouri which states that they screamed no churches no trinity no god
1882079 all that i have read from the books of this group and all of the actions that i have become aware of have lead me to believe that this minority group is up against the whole islamic nation their actions are in complete congruence with jews christians and the occupying forces spy agencies the duties of this group are given to them by the british government
1882080 wahabi scholars without any shame implement the orders of their english masters
1882081 they at the command of the occupying force destroy islamic shrines holy places and graves of islamic personalities they destroyed khadijahs house the birthplace of the prophet s the graves of the prophets s wives and the graves of the companions this reached such a level that they said that the grave of the prophet s must be moved from medina
1882082 they have distorted the words of religious books to suit their interests
1882083 no it is a place of corruption i will not pray for it
1882084 a british agent said that he met abd al wahab najdi who spoke ill of all of the islamic leaders

1882086 in my investigation about depleted uranium during the last 5 years the most disturbing information refers to the impact on not born children and in the future generations of soldiers of both sides that serve in the wars of depleted uranium and for the civilians that must permanently live in the contaminated regions with radioactivity
1882087 they brought home the worst uniforms in their bodies in some families the born children before the golf war are the only healthy members the wives and the feminine relatives of the veteran of the golf war have
1882088 in iraq its much worst even there the babies born with no brains the organs are outside of the body or the women give birth to peaces of meat
1882089 there are no words radiation in iraq equals 250 000 nagasaki bombs
1882090 many terms have been used to describe sexual assault including rape statutory rape acquaintance or date rape sexual abuse molestation and incest
1882091 there is great overlap and some confusion in the definitions of nonconsensual sex acts sexual assault includes situations in which there is sexual contact with or without penetration that occurs because of physical force or psychological coercion or without consent including situations in which the assaulted adolescent would be unable to consent because of intoxication inability to understand the consequences of his or her actions misperceptions because of age and or other incapacities
1882092 physicians should be aware that sexual assault is common and need to be prepared to counsel their adolescent patients to avoid high risk situations
1882093 screening of adolescents for sexual victimization should be part of visits for psychological problems sexuality issues contraception or substance abuse and health supervision physicians should include information about ways to prevent sexual assault as part of anticipatory guidance with adolescents with and without disabilities tailored to cognitive abilities to understand

1882095 if you think about your brain and learning and the memory process i can ask you questions about when you were 5 years old and you can retrieve information thats a tremendous capacity for memory in fact you perform fairly simple tasks that you would think a computer would easily be able to accomplish but in fact it cant
1882096 if we can extract the rules of how these neural networks are doing computations like pattern recognition we can apply that to create novel computing systems
1882097 its essentially a dish with 60 electrodes arranged in a grid at the bottom
1882098 over that we put the living cortical neurons from rats which rapidly begin to reconnect themselves forming a living neural network a brain
1882099 you see one extend a process pull it back extend it out and it may do that a couple of times just sampling whos next to it until over time the connectivity starts to establish itself
1882100 the brain is getting its network to the point where its a live computation device
1882101 initially when we hook up this brain to a flight simulator it doesnt know how to control the aircraft
1882102 so you hook it up and the aircraft simply drifts randomly and as the data comes in it slowly modifies the neural network so over time the network gradually learns to fly the aircraft
1882103 theres a lot of data out there that will tell you that the computation thats going on here isnt based on just one neuron the computational property is actually an emergent property of hundreds or thousands of neurons cooperating to produce the amazing processing power of the brain
1882104 a lot of people have been interested in what changes in the brains of animals and people when they are learning things
1882105 were interested in getting down into the network and cellular mechanisms which is hard to do in living animals and the engineering goal would be to get ideas from this system about how brains compute and process information
1882106 it is only with the heart that one can see rightly what is essential is invisible to the eye

1882151 mps1 is a rational target because of its critical role in preventing aneuploidy
1882152 in view of lack of credible evidence and variation in statements of the victim we are closing the case
1882153 in this case none of the evidence is credible and therefore not acceptable therefore we have decided to close the case
1882154 this is not a defeat we will take further steps
1882155 the fact that it decision to revoke transfer of land to the board has led to a raging agitation today clearly points to the fact that this has been mounted keeping in view of the forthcoming elections to the state assembly in october and the general elections in early 2009
1882156 communal passions are being sharply aroused with rumours spreading like wildfire about the hindus not being allowed to undertake the yatra etc likewise extremist elements in the valley are also whipping up passions

1882166 this is a breakthrough in terms of our understanding of materials and thats important because in order to understand the long term evolution of planets we need to know more about their properties deep down

1882192 the state government is ready to provide a multimillion film city to outsiders but it is least concerned about developing its own in house production houses

1882207 i wanted to write much acclaimed tear jerkingly purple prose about wide eyed fly infested children not cold unpopular and even
1882208 i do think there is one thing that we can agree on and that is that this whole attempted institution of same sex marriage is on a collision course with traditional christian views and values in virtually every institution that one can think of
1882209 and i cant tell you whether or not its going to be a nuclear bomb type collision or just a train wreck but its coming
1882210 t he alarming thing is that all these scholars across the board said this will be very expensive in terms of religious liberty
1882211 said that when there are generally applicable neutral laws that free exercise does not require an exemption
1882212 as long as those who are engaged in demanding recognition of same sex unions do not exempt anyone free exercise claims will not be exempted either i t doesnt appear that the free exercise clause will protect us
1882213 it is quite possible that it is only a matter of time til every institution that chooses under its first amendment beliefs to act in ways that manifest its objections to same sex relationships could have their tax exempt status removed
1882214 what radical homosexual activists will do with the new institution of same sex marriage in using it as a battering ram across america to blast open new areas that ultimately will diminish that will shrink the rights of christians to express their faith in their lives and how they live their free exercise of their religion in the end the logical extension is that our faith will only be a personalized individualized faith that you can think about but you cant even talk about
1882215 from my perspective they can coexist if one or another is not you know taking the my way or the highway kind of approach
1882216 the choice is stop practicing medicine or violate your religious beliefs and thats the only option presented to the physicians by the other side
1882217 in the linked article which is well worth your time to read it is noted that the bootstrap approach to black under performance and moral decline is not always well received among black leaders in academia and social activism to wit cosby is criticized by both the author of the article and various leaders he cites as diminishing the legacy of discrimination and the need for structural reforms

1882236 i f america becomes a place where our children are taken from us by law and forced to attend schools where they are taught that cohabitation is as good as marriage that motherhood doesnt require a husband or father and that homosexuality is as valid a choice as heterosexuality for their future lives then why in the world should married people continue to accept the authority of such a government what these dictator judges do not seem to understand is that their authority extends only as far as people choose to obey them
1882237 rise up ye men of god have done with lesser things
1882238 however my question is how does one propose we rise up i have read similar words from various writers over time but the article stops abruptly almost everytime without expressing what is meant by rising up im not calling you out just curious what you propose

1882246 we see this very effect in the modern american experience as non whites irrespective of conversion status or espoused americanism categorically reserve great scorn for all of our old national heroes be it the pilgrims the virginia colony planters the founding fathers the frontiersmen or the western homesteaders non whites even if christian generally disdain them all they love america only insofar as it bears no resemblance to what it used to be

1882481 i like individual kappas enormously and love being around them i never choose an enemy but theyve been after me since the 1960s and really after me since the late 1970s at one time in my life i knew more about kkg than any non kappa that had ever lived
1882482 we are confident that dr ivins was the only person responsible for these attacks

1882484 well apply fungicides insecticides pesticides because beans are very delicate
1882485 not by their own farm but by off farm employment
1882486 we deeply believe that if we can get our farmers to connect to the market they will be capable of growth sustainable growth
1882487 they will be capable of not being farmers anymore but agricultural entrepreneurs
1882488 theres no question in my mind that john mccain enjoyed that back and forth with the press that characterized his early 2000 campaign
1882489 my guess is that he regrets that hes not able to have that same kind of relationship with the media covering him but the realities of modern day media and modern day politics are such that no candidate democrat or republican can grant that kind of access and expect to survive
1882490 obviously every campaign has to get out there and every day you get up and youve got a certain thing you want to say
1882491 and if you spend a lot of time talking about things other than what you want to say it often gets diluted or you guys dont report it
1882492 its the nfl now we have to up our game a little bit
1882493 we believe that more americans of faith including evangelicals and modern mainline protestants and modern conservative catholics will give senator obama a hard look
1882494 when working as a community organizer with other churches helping to build struggling neighborhoods i let jesus christ into my life i learned that my sins could be redeemed
1882495 then with his sandal the guard drew a cross in the dirt
1882496 we stood wordlessly there for a minute or two venerating the cross until the guard rubbed it out and walked away to me that was faith a faith that unites and never divides a faith that bridges unbridgeable gaps in humanity it is the faith that we are all equal and endowed by our creator with inalienable rights to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness it is the faith i would die to defend
1882497 their efforts to show obama to be a religious man are not subtle
1882498 if obama can show himself to be a person of faith it also helps him combat the idea that hes an elitist that hes not a mainstream american because if he shows that he prays and hes a churchgoing guy and hes a religious guy thats a very mainstream characteristic
1882499 let me just point out all the things that when republicans do them your colleagues in the media are all over them for exploiting religion and yet when obama does it its considered refreshing and hes competitive
1882500 i didnt attend their church for 20 years and im not a member of their church i received their endorsement which did not mean that i endorsed their views but the comments made most recently by pastor hagee are just too much
1882501 were not only divisive and destructive but i believe that they end up giving comfort to those who prey on hate
1882502 what i hear a lot from southern baptist pastors and lay people is a variation of this sort of theme john mccain was not my first choice john mccain was not my second choice but ill take a third class fireman over a first class arsonist and when it comes to the issue of life when it comes to the issue of marriage they perceive barack obama as a first class arsonist
1882503 ive noticed in the feedback from my own daily reports that if i go back three months ago there was a large number of people saying gary theres just no way i can do this and now people are saying weve got to elect him and how do i volunteer so that gap is going to close too but whether it closes quickly enough over the next hundred days remains to be seen
1882504 what the polls are showing in terms of evangelicals is that john mccain has lost a bunch of them compared to george bush but that barack obama has not yet gotten them he has an opportunity that democrats havent had in a long time but he has not yet succeeded in bringing them over
1882505 were pretty humble in this outreach we certainly dont plan on winning outright the evangelical vote but we do believe that more americans of faith including evangelicals and modern mainline protestants and modern conservative catholics will give senator obama a hard look and will end up supporting him
1882506 it was a very interesting game which was a good test for our young players
1882507 it was a very even game and huddersfield defended well and were organised we picked a young team and going 1 0 down would have been a mental test so i am pleased they responded
1882508 it is very important that they can come back into games and that they dont panic when they go behind you have to keep your calm and play the way you want to they will learn that from tonights game
1882509 this is the level that our reserve team should play at and thats the kind of test we want
1882510 herbert chapman is the biggest legend at our club he came to us from huddersfield so it seems only right than we could give them something back tonight

1882512 the lord tells you that you are to put everything in order because you will not recover get ready to die
1882513 remember lord that i have served you faithfully and loyally and that i have always tried to do what you wanted me to
1882514 i the lord the god of your ancestor david have heard your prayer and seen your tears i will heal you and in three days you will go to the temple 6 i will let you live fifteen years longer i will rescue you and this city jerusalem from the emperor of assyria i will defend this city for the sake of my own honor and because of the promise i made to my servant david
1882515 what is the sign to prove that the lord will heal me and that three days later i will be able to go to the temple
1882516 the lord will give you a sign to prove that he will keep his promise now would you prefer to have the shadow on the stairway go forward ten steps or go back ten steps
1882517 its easy to have the shadow go forward ten steps have it go back ten steps
1882518 where did these men come from and what did they say to you
1882519 they saw everything there is nothing in the storerooms that i didnt show them
1882520 the lord almighty says that 17 a time is coming when everything in your palace everything that your ancestors have stored up to this day will be carried off to babylonia nothing will be left 18 some of your own direct descendants will be taken away and made eunuchs to serve in the palace of the king of babylonia
1882521 the message you have given me from the lord is good
1882522 here in jerusalem in this temple is the place that i have chosen out of all the territory of the twelve tribes of israel as the place where i am to be worshiped 8 and if the people of israel will obey all my commands and keep the whole law that my servant moses gave them then i will not allow them to be driven out of the land that i gave to their ancestors
1882523 king manasseh has done these disgusting things things far worse than what the canaanites did and with his idols he has led the people of judah into sin 12 so i the lord god of israel will bring such a disaster on jerusalem and judah that everyone who hears about it will be stunned 13 i will punish jerusalem as i did samaria as i did king ahab of israel and his descendants i will wipe jerusalem clean of its people as clean as a plate that has been wiped and turned upside down 14 i will abandon the people who survive and will hand them over to their enemies who will conquer them and plunder their land 15 i will do this to my people because they have sinned against me and have stirred up my anger from the time their ancestors came out of egypt to this day
1882524 i am in the police station you call me 10 minutes before something is due is it my fault you decide to call so late

1882550 does anyone else hear something when you look at that
1882551 i queried a few hundred people and three more individuals turned up
1882552 do you hear sounds when you see things move or flash
1882553 people with auditory synesthesia may be even less likely than people with other synesthetic associations to fully realize that their experience is unusual these individuals have an enhanced soundtrack in life rather than a dramatically different experience compared to others
1882554 synesthetes had an advantage because they not only saw but also heard the visual patterns
1882555 at this point very little is known about how the auditory and visual processing systems of the brain work together understanding this interaction is important because in normal experience our senses work together all the time

1882588 there is currently no specific legislative or regulatory framework for ccs in australia
1882589 there are however existing state and federal laws and regulations with relevance to various aspects of ccs at the state level the queensland petroleum and gas protection and safety act 2004 and the south australian petroleum act 2000 for example provide for the transport by pipeline and storage in natural reservoirs of substances including carbon dioxide
1882590 at the commonwealth level environmental laws relevant to ccs include the environment protection and biodiversity conservation act 1999 the environment protection sea dumping act 1981 and the offshore petroleum act 2006 need for new laws to enable waste dumps
1882591 the australian government is currently in the process of developing a nationally consistent regulatory framework in september 2003 the mcmpr9 established a geosequestration regulatory working group consisting of all federal state and territory jurisdictions to develop draft regulatory guiding principles for ccs in november 2004 the mcmpr charged its contact officers group with reporting on how to implement a legislative framework to regulate ccs in australia although there is no ccs specific regulatory framework it was suggested that legislation associated with the petroleum and mineral exploration industries covering approval processes environmental protection transport of gases by pipeline although not specifically co2 a legislative regime for storage and injection of gases as part of a petroleum recovery operation might provide a foundation
1882592 a significant volume of evidence to the inquiry was supportive of the mcmpr initiative and its recommendation for amendment to existing petroleum legislation rather than the development of totally new legislation where possible chevron for example stated that while new or amended legislation may be required to allow the injection of carbon dioxide many aspects of existing legislation regulation or the principles behind existing regulation can be readily adapted to facilitate geosequestration projects chevron suggests using or adapting existing laws and regulations for areas such as environmental impact assessment the transportation of co2 the design drilling and production regulations in relation to petroleum wells and disposal management plans according to anglo coal on balance therefore we think incorporation into existing petroleum legislation is the most practicable route given that there will be a vital need to promote co development and to reconcile conflicts between overlapping tenements both of which would be difficult to achieve if the respective tenements were housed in different regulatory structures with different regulators

1882652 initially on seeing it i thought it might be humorous but then i recognised that as people drive into the car park all theyre going to see is forget the monarchy
1882653 to use that is a political statement particularly taking into account the prime minsters comments last week and that this government intends to pursue a republic
1882654 it was not our intention to attack the monarchy nor in any way was it a political statement
1882655 it was an advertisement designed to demonstrate that we are not buying into the debate but instead supporting people and businesses publicans that are important to us

1882670 jean smith who lives about half a mile from the plant in kimberley road said she heard an explosion about 6pm and saw a ball of smoke followed by flames
1882671 at about 9 10pm a message came through to the meeting that a car not a garda car carrying two members of an garda s och na was seen driving slowly past the community centre and the occupants appeared to be taking the numbers of the cars parked outside one of the occupants of the car was identified as garda brett well known to members of the local community garda brett was in plain clothes although the other occupant appeared to be wearing a blue garda shirt
1882672 is it garda practice to conduct surveillance on community meetings in our parish if so why on what basis do the garda view meetings of pobal chill chom in as warranting monitoring and surveillance do they regard public discussion of the corrib gas project as potentially being a criminal activity
1882673 as a community police force it would be very unfortunate if an garda s och na has allowed itself to become just another facilitator for the corrib gas project many people in our community do not believe that an garda s och na is operating as an impartial police force on this issue and the incident outside our meeting place only serves to reinforce that view
1882674 it is the job and duty of the garda to monitor communities in general on the night of the meeting there was a garda presence very briefly
1882675 i will be responding to this letter and confirming that i am willing to meet a delegation from the group to discuss issues highlighted
1882676 west africa is under attack the region has become a hub for cocaine smuggling from latin america to europe states that we seldom hear about such as guinea bissau and neighboring guinea are at risk of being captured by drug cartels in collusion with corrupt forces in government and the military
1882677 with the exception of cannabis in morocco africa never used to have a drug problem
1882678 law enforcement has been helpless against this onslaught drug planes dont have to fly below the radar because in most cases there is no radar or electricity soldiers sometimes help smugglers by closing airports and unloading the cargo police cars run out of gas when giving chase or are left in the dust by smugglers all terrain vehicles there are no local navies to intercept the ships coming from latin america or to chase the 2 000 horsepower boats that speed drugs up the coast to europe traffickers are seldom brought to trial in some cases there are no prisons to put them in even when they are charged they are usually released because evidence is not collected or needed laws are not in place
1882679 drugs have become a security issue drug money is perverting the weak economies of the region in some cases the value of the drugs being trafficked is greater than a countrys national income the influence that this buys is rotting these fragile states traffickers are buying favors and protection from candidates in elections quick intervention by the international community five years ago prevented a crisis in cape verde but the cartels merely shifted their operations to guinea bissau now guinea is under threat guineas neighbor sierra leone could be next without a regional response the problem will move from country to country
1882680 containing this threat will not be easy poverty is the biggest problem these countries are the worst performers on the human development index their populations at the bottom of the bottom billion unemployed and desperate youths are vulnerable to being recruited as foot soldiers for criminal groups west african countries must take control of their coasts and airspace this requires hardware boats planes and radar know how investigative techniques and container security and counter narcotics intelligence some of these capabilities can be developed nationally but some assistance will have to come from abroad cooperation among customs officials border guards the police and counter narcotics agents at ports and airports for example has made cape verde a less attractive transit point for drug traffickers the same approach should be adopted elsewhere because the drug trade defies borders regional cooperation is vital particularly intelligence sharing stronger legal cooperation among west african nations would enable more effective extradition mutual legal assistance and confiscation of the proceeds of crime working contacts must also be strengthened between countries of origin and destination in south america and europe respectively
1882681 in some cases mechanisms for intelligence sharing are under construction but measures and even laws to fight organized crime and corruption will be meaningless without the political will and capacity to implement them too often drugs that are seized disappear instead of being destroyed judges police and witnesses are intimidated security forces turn a blind eye or lend a hand to smuggling the highest authorities must recognize the stakes their failure to act is a sign of helplessness or complicity political will would be strengthened if regional leaders were rewarded for their integrity and punished for corruption at the moment the honest ones feel abandoned and the crooked ones act with impunity we must reduce vulnerability to drugs and crime with greater development and greater justice would build faith in the rule of law west africas drug trafficking problem is still relatively small compared with that of west asia the caribbean or latin america but it is growing exponentially and threatens to turn the region into a center of lawlessness such instability is the last thing africa needs the affected countries and the international community must act before the situation spirals out of control
1882682 when things are that emotionally powerful and hard to fathom its easy for people to say well its happening over there but its not happening in my neighborhood
1882683 we do that in many areas of our lives so its not that surprising that wed do it in our homes

1882721 this isnt the script they showed me who made all these changes
1882722 mr wickershaw would like to explain that it was the studios decision to trim the script
1882723 therefore they found it necessary to make the dialogue more snippy
1882724 the studio was afraid that audiences might not be able to catch it in its full glory and mr cicero has some difficulty pronouncing it
1882725 besides the name lily norwood is beautiful in its simplicity

1882741 we felt it was in the best interest of the team and when the opportunity presented itself we felt it was the right move for us to make and we went ahead and did it
1882742 we had discussions with him and his agent bus cook

1882763 from what i understand for the most part its taken care of

1882790 a volte i nostri amici della lega per motivi anche territoriali sono un po folcloristici ma poi la pensano come noi
1882791 episodio che molto spiaciuto a me e credo a tutti o quasi
1882792 ma per me non cambia niente io la penso come sempre per questi non li capisco in fondo io ho sempre solo votato senza mai espormi da missino ho pensato alla professione ma qui c gente che stata perseguitata ha preso le botte perso il posto ma come fanno

1882905 el acuerdo cuando se aprob la ley era igualar el sueldo base al sueldo m nimo y que al trabajador al final del d a entre el sueldo base que se iba a transformar en sueldo m nimo m s las comisiones la garant a que se le daba a los empleadores y a los trabajadores es que al final del d a no iba a haber cambios en los ingresos
1882906 aqu m s que subir los ingresos se establece una normalizaci n o regularizaci n de la norma para que no se le deje de pagar a lo que tienen derecho los trabajadores y por tanto esta afirmaci n de que se busca aumentar el sueldo es falsa lo que se busca con esta ley es generar una norma para que no se le robe m s a los trabajadores la forma como se calcula el s ptimo
1882907 si respecto al procedimiento de pago hay que hacer un proceso de transici n eso es un dictamen de la direcci n del trabajo y si con esto se busca evitar el pago del s ptimo dia para personas que no son trabajadores de venta directa sino el que est a cargo de la oficina de la tienda personas que reciben comisiones de otra naturaleza eso tambi n es discutible pero lo que no es discutible es que se le debe pagar el s ptimo de acuerdo a la nueva norma y ese pago normalizado es la devoluci n de un derecho que ten an los trabajadores que algunos empresarios les quitaban al no cancelarlo debidamente

1882986 paramount among the responsibilities of a free press is the duty to prevent any part of the government from deceiving the people
1882987 the people will believe what the media tells them they believe
1882988 the central intelligence agency owns everyone of any significance in the major media
1882989 americans are too broadly under informed to digest nuggets of information that seem to contradict what they know of the world instead news channels prefer to feed americans a constant stream of simplified information all of which fits what they already know that way they dont have to devote more air time or newsprint space to explanations or further investigations
1882990 politicians and the media have conspired to infantilize to dumb down the american public at heart politicians dont believe that americans can handle complex truths and the news media especially television news basically agrees
1882991 it is the absolute right of the state to supervise the formation of public opinion
1882992 the owners and managers of the press determine which person which facts which version of the facts and which ideas shall reach the public

1882996 rupert murdoch announced that his latest venture the fox business channel would be more business friendly than cnbc
1882997 have hewn very closely to mr murdochs own stridently hawkish political views making his voice among the loudest in the anglophone world in the international debate over the american led war with iraq

1883038 what you do is you design the sequence that is in many many pieces so in fact youre planning to shoot in many different parts of the station
1883039 what you have to do is never be in the same place twice because what happens is that people get to know youre there and a crowd starts to build up its impossible to be like a true guerilla unit because its a huge its a bourne movie but youve got to move from place to place and be unpredictable so people dont know where you are and then move on fast
1883040 youve got to schedule it so youre not there for too long a period of time in any one time so you might go for two or three days and then disappear and go off and do something else and then come back for two or three days a week or two later if people get to know youre going to be there then the crowds are going to build up
1883041 it puts prodigious demands on the actors because they never know from one hour to the next which bit of the sequence theyre shooting even i didnt know youve just got to seize your moment it makes for opportunity

1883048 identity is important because entrepreneurs constantly confuse what they do with who they are were all certainly responsible for what we do but failing doesnt make us bad people and succeeding doesnt make us omniscient

1883111 i think the indians played like true champions which i suppose they are with their batsmen constructing the innings well i think their spinners murali kartik and harbhajan singh did a very good job during the middle overs to restrict us to 166 india deserved to win
1883112 i think the wicket was ok but when the spinners came on to bowl the ball was stopping and some of the balls would turn and keep low and some would not so batting was a bit tricky out there
1883113 however i should say that we have enjoyed playing cricket here and have gained some positives during this series
1883114 even though we lost the last two matches of this series we are happy that we could win the odi series quite convincingly players like michael clarke andrew symonds brad hogg and mitchell johnson have come off age and have been performing consistently in this series
1883115 i thought slow bowlers like clarke and symonds would do the trick for us but it did not work out that way as the indian batsmen really handled them well
1883116 i think the indians have some very talented young batsmen like gambhir uthappa and yuvi specially cutout for twenty20 format and the future looks good for them

1883156 they benefited to some degree where a couple of their very important models in their second year on the market the es and the rx which together account for over two thirds of lexus sales both improved significantly

1883188 dupa rezultatele pe care le am obtinut in urma investitiilor din budapesta si bratislava am decis sa investim si in potentialul pietei romanesti familia rothschild va investi si direct in proiectul esplanada city center pe langa investitia pe care a facut o in trigranit
1883189 cheltuieli materiale si servicii pentru finantarea consultantei juridice si financiare aferente proiectului de parteneriat public privat esplanada precum si cofinantarea asistentei tehnice asigurate de grantul olandez administrat de ministerul finantelor publice
1883190 proiectul este foarte bun si este bine ca s a facut
1883191 problema este cum afluim sau dezafluim traficul din zona iar in chestiunea asta primaria trebuie neaparat ascultata
1883192 proiectul esplanada va conduce la un dezastru urbanistic cu urmari foarte grave in ceea ce priveste traficul si poluarea in zona centrala a capitalei acest proiect megalomanic reprezinta un alt tun pe care il dau baietii destepti din domeniul imobiliar este inadmisibil ca in zona piata unirii cea mai aglomerata din bucuresti traficul sa fie pur si simplu aruncat in aer pe o perioada de zece ani se incearca inducerea in eroare a cetatenilor capitalei spunandu se ca este o investitie privata acest lucru este complet fals pentru ca terenul este pus la dispozitie de primarie iar valoarea acestuia depaseste 300 de milioane de euro contributia primariei excede aceasta valoare pentru ca se vor cheltui sume mari de bani cu despagubirea proprietarilor din acea zona prin urmare primaria trebuia sa aiba o cota parte de cel putin 30 din proiect s a format o comisie la nivelul primariei capitalei care sa poarte negocieri cu proprietarii iar acestia sa fie despagubiti la o valoare evaluata de un evaluator si nu la valoarea de piata acest lucru ar putea fi posibil datorita intentiei de a fi declarat proiectul ca fiind de utilitate publica proiectul nu este de utilitate publica atata timp cat municipalitatea nu primeste nimic am foarte multe intrebari referitoare la acest proiect doua dintre ele sunt urmatoarele 1 se intentioneaza construirea unei noi statii de metrou acolo cine finanteaza aceasta constructie primaria capitalei 2 transportul in comun va fi trecut prin subteran afirma country manager ul companietrigranit cine va suporta aceste costuri primaria capitalei

1883194 este inacceptabil ca guvernul sa se mai implice in chestiunile de urbanism ale bucurestiului e o modalitate securista guvernul nu trebuie sa aiba legatura cu deciziile de urbanism ce trebuie luate de catre comunitate orasul trebuie lasat in mana bucurestenilor locuitorii trebuiau consultati prin prezentarea proiectului iar la dezbatere ar fi trebuit sa participe si specialisti din afara primariei si a guvernului este foarte suspecta si procedura prin care s a acceptat construirea ansamblului esplanada de catre firma ungureasca eu suspectez acest proiect de coruptie in al doilea rand oferta mea electorala cuprinde interzicerea construirii oricaror alte cladiri in bucuresti mai ales ca aici aglomerarea este de 9000 persoane km2 in conditiile in care cele mai mari aglomerari urbane ca berlinul au maxim 4 000 mai mult construirea cladirilor de birouri in zona unirii atrage traficul spre centru din punct de vedere urbanistic proiectul este o crima impotriva intregii populatii a bucurestiului in plus proiectul intra in contradictie cu imaginea urbanistica a orasului din zona centrala

1883438 milwaukee brett favre finally is speaking for himself he wants to play but doesnt feel welcome in green bay so hes asking to be released
1883439 what does that mean for me so that means either you give me my helmet welcome me back or release me or attempt to trade me we all know thats a possibility but way out there possibility

1883444 alasannya pertama anggota kongres as biasa menyurati ke mana mana lebih untuk kepentingan konstituennya
1883445 dr h susilo bambang yudhoyono president of the republic of indonesia istana merdeka jakarta 10110 indonesia
1883446 yaitu bahwa presiden ri tidak dapat mencampuri proses hukum yang sedang berjalan
1883447 yaitu bahwa bagi indonesia nkri sudah final dan tidak dapat dinegosiasikan sedangkan mereka yang melakukan pelanggaran separatisme harus ditindak dan diproses secara hukum
1883448 urus dulu hal hal itu sebelum campur urusan dalam negeri orang lain
1883449 sekali lagi saya katakan dengan surat ini jelas mereka menunjukkan kebodohan mereka terhadap negara ri sebagai negara demokrasi dan hukum sebagai negara demokrasi ri tidak kurang demokratisnya dengan as dan sebagai negara hukum ri juga tidak kalah dengan as karena kami sangat menjunjung tinggi supremasi hukum
1883450 sekarang kan keadaan peradilan kita sangat merdeka dan tidak bisa diintervensi oleh siapa pun
1883451 penyidikan kasus itu belum mereka kan dicekal oleh menkeu terkait masalah pajak tetapi terkait tugas polri nanti kita akan memback up kalau nanti diperlukan untuk proses cekal dan lainnya
1883452 penyelidikan dilakukan untuk mencari alat bukti jika ada bukti maka akan dilanjutkan penyidikan untuk mencari tersangkanya
1883453 cara seperti ini kita gunakan ada beberapa tujuan selain ingin memperkenalkan sistem pemilihan pemimpin yang demokratis juga karena ada sebagian siswa yang sudah memasuki usia pemilih
1883454 tapi kemudian kami seleksi dengan berbagai tes seperti kemampuan bahasa inggris kemampuan baris berbaris dan berpidato serta penyampaian visi dan misi akhirnya yang dinyatakan lolos sebagai calon hanya enam orang
1883455 kalau istilah panwas kan umum bisa untuk pemilu atau pengawas lainnya tapi kalau kpu itu kan khusus pemilihan umum dalam hal ini yang berkaitan langsung dengan negara atau pemerintahan jadi teman teman sepakat tidak menggunakan istilah kpu
1883456 mungkin senin 11 agustus 2008 berkas kasus tersangka dan barang bukti akan diserahkan ke kejaksaan agung
1883457 jika tersangka sudah diserahkan ke kejaksaan maka tugas penyidik polri telah selesai dan tinggal menunggu sidang saja

1883528 his method of preaching unlike the traditional method of locating and pointing out flaws and loopholes in the other religions and harping upon them day in and day out and in all places was that of placing in juxtaposition the best in every religion and giving a requisite exposition to the comparative excellence in jesus and his gospel of love and compassion fraternity and fellow feeling
1883529 i found the battle almost invariably being pitched in three places the old testament or western civilization or the christian church i had the ill defined but distinctive feeling the heart of the matter was being left out then i saw that i could take my stand at christ and before the non christian world refuse to know anything save jesus christ and him crucified then i saw this is where i should have been all the time i saw that the gospel lies in the person of jesus that he himself is the good news that my one task was to live and to present him my task was simplified but it was not only simplified it was vitalized i found that when i was at the place of jesus i was every moment upon the vital here at this place all the questions of heaven and earth were being settled he was the one question that settled all others a jain lawyer a brilliant writer against christianity arose in one of my meetings and asked me a long list of questions regarding things of the old testament i replied i think i can answer your questions but i do not feel called to do so i defined christianity as christ if you have any objections to make against him i am ready to hear them and answer them if i can

1883587 there is not a scintilla of evidence that would indicate that dr hatfill had anything to do with this
1883588 greetings my friend we are all interested in the future for that is where you and i are going to spend the rest of our lives
1883589 transhumanism is the idea that its ok to transcend the limitations of the body and brain and take control of reproduction
1883590 and add to that the belief that its probably a good idea
1883591 within 30 years we will have the technological means to create superhuman intelligence shortly thereafter the human era will be ended
1883592 you might get things in the next 10 or 20 years that would have taken 200 years before
1883593 i guess my real motivation is the desire to not have a lot of clutter around me and just have one computer or one brain interface
1883594 the more tangible advantage of the efficiency is that you could have better emergency responses and better human experiences
1883595 eating kind of distracts me from whatever else im doing
1883596 im kind of weird that way im more concerned with my health than how things taste ive always cared about maximizing my happiness
1883597 it goes back to the enlightenment about 400 years or so
1883598 and when you go back to those original ideas you see a number of things emerging among them the notion that science and tech can be applied to human affairs and things can be engineered and improved upon
1883599 our paleolithic selves had certain limitations and invented technologies to allow us to get beyond them for us theres continuity between what happened then and what were talking about now
1883600 there are some guys who put a lot of faith in the code and the engineers and guys who work on boxes
1883601 others of us are more interested in the social dimension and global collaboration there are a lot of different baggages we bring to these things
1883602 we might come to a point in the immediate future where it will be impossible to imagine what goes beyond it
1883603 theres been more than half a century of research indicating that caloric restriction in animal models works
1883604 caloric restriction works it goes back to studies in the 1940s that show that if you feed laboratory animals less calories they live much longer and age better there is other data to support that
1883605 thats basically the production of molecules that can damage the body
1883606 theyre molecules that can oxidize proteins or dna all the major building blocks of cells and bodies the thought is that the more we eat and the longer we live the more we damage these cells and if you eat less then you create less damage
1883607 there are people who believe in this and are doing it
1883608 the problem is they dont appear particularly happy or healthy on the question of quality of life its very difficult most people would be miserable
1883609 the french eat all these fats breads cheeses and do lots of things they shouldnt do and they actually live longer and have less disease than we do in north america
1883610 and its been proposed that they live longer because they drink a lot of red wine and its not just the wine but the red pigment actually seems to have beneficial properties
1883611 there appears to be a connection between that compound and slowing down oxidation damage
1883612 in other words theres now for the first time the potential for having a drug that will mimic the effects of things that no one wants to do like caloric restriction or severe exercise itll be a drug well all happily pay a lot of money to pop down and the pharmaceutical industry will happily make a killing on it
1883613 i think we have a 50 percent chance of getting there in around 25 years so long as the early proof of concept work in mice is well enough funded for the next 10 years or so
1883614 as soon as we get that gerontologists the world over will be on television saying yes aubrey was right the repair and maintenance approach to postponing aging really is feasible after all
1883615 the sens concept is inspired by the realization that human metabolism is far too complex and interconnected to improve bio medically in the foreseeable future and that an alternative akin to repair and maintenance of man made machines is far more promising
1883616 the debate is largely framed by transhumanists who are looking for rationales for all the enhancement technologies
1883617 and its framed on the other side by people largely motivated by religious or conservative concerns those people are either fearful of this technology or see it as a rallying cry for conservative social positions
1883618 thats based on a lot of assumptions that we really dont know about the brain
1883619 there are some major thresholds and no one knows if were going to reach them or not
1883620 i love the can do spirit i love the idea that well try to tackle these problems but that doesnt mean that were going to tackle them in the near future
1883621 i am looking forward to seeing brett favre in a new york jets uniform he represents a significant addition to this franchise and reflects our commitment to putting the best possible product on the field
1883622 nobody except the diehards gives a rats ass about this team its the giants world and we just live in it this old cheesehead better sell some tickets and get us more back pages of the post and daily news
1883623 brett has had a long and storied career in green bay and the packers owe him a tremendous debt of gratitude for everything he accomplished on the field and for the impact he made in the state it is with some sadness that we make this announcement but also with the desire for certainty that will allow us to move the team and organization forward in the most positive way possible

1883641 i never really took rap serious till i was blessed with the opportunity to work with jam master jay
1883642 the first time i ever made a song was with jay he helped me with my start my style and my song structure what i say and the way i am is because of who i am but jay did help me
1883643 things come up we all have our own agendas and jay was being overwhelmed with his touring schedule by being a part of run dmc he wasnt able to focus on me at the time so i had to move forward
1883644 that deal wasnt a great deal even with the jay deal i never received anything outside of lessons on how to make records and whats hot and whats not
1883645 the columbia deal probably was like 250 000 i got 65 000 in advance they negotiated a 50 000 release with jam master jay and 10 000 went to attorneys that left me with 5 000 dollars i was back selling crack so it was like through the whole first album i was still grinding
1883646 i kinda put the hood in a nutshell i thought most of the things that go on in the hood were financially driven
1883647 i got shot after i got shot i fell back first i called back like wassup im ready to work they aint have no answers for me so i fell back hoping they would drop the project and it kinda faded
1883648 i worked the street you got to use what you have access to the way i capitalized with mixed tapes i dont think anyone is going to receive the same response i received
1883649 my attorney theo stedmire and paul rosenburg who represents eminem had a relationship they got a chance to communicate and he gave paul a cd guess whos back one of the mixed cds i put out at the time he was in the middle of finishing up the eminem show so when you in the zone you cant really stop what you doing to do some other shit his album came out and did 1 3 million his first week then he decided to listen to it he told paul i got to do this they flew me out to los angeles on friday night to talk
1883650 when we sat and communicated with each other i knew thats where i wanted to be
1883651 creatively i wouldnt be censored dr dre hes from n w a so he got to understand and eminems music speaks for itself so im like this aint a bad idea
1883652 then the fact that 1 million dollars came into play
1883653 you dont have a lot of leaders in this business when dre and em decided they were interested in 50 cent the numbers the other companies were offering skyrocketed some offered 1 6 million when those offers got that high i was like nah i need to go back to that situation
1883654 its a competition you got to understand that my pressure is being in between eminem and dr dre ems so talented it becomes frustrating when you got a guy whose second lp sells 16 million copies and his first film does 54 5 million in its first two days when those numbers are being put up and his energy is exactly the same like hes still hungry you realize the kids phenomenal he has a real love for the music
1883655 lyrically hes been running around running from me on the records he is clearly saying 50 i dont want it if he was inviting me i should have been on the same boat as d12 obie trice he took a shot at everyone but me his approach is from the hood standpoint thats where im strongest at theres nobody stronger than me in the hood right now musically if youre going to come at em and be like you the white boy thats ruining hip hop and youre representing the hood how do you go at the kid that is the most popular rap artist in the hood then you move yourself into a space where you look like a damn fool a real idiot cause you have no grounds
1883656 with ja it bothers him to see me do so good
1883657 he got robbed a friend of mine robbed him i call the guy a friend cause i grew up with him its not a person that i always fuck with kick it with and shit like that son got robbed seen the kid that robbed him didnt do nothing but afterwards carried me different cause he seen me kicking it with the kid
1883658 a rapper will get in your face and say anything to you because you rap too hell get in your face and say his rhyme what ever he wrote and say it with confidence like he means it say some shit to you and aint been going through none of the shit he talking about on the other end of that is myself im hustling and ive experienced all of that shit that you hear so im listening and im looking at them like i dont believe you until i see something about him that makes me believe thats a part of his character hes lying
1883659 nas is a guy who says 50 you should come with me you remind me of when illmatic came out the way everybody talking about you is kind of how they were talking about me when my record came out he did show me things because i did go to markets i wouldnt have been to because i hadnt gone on tour before
1883660 hell no im not his prot g i dont think you can call someone a prot g unless you help put that person together unless you help create that person jam master jay could call me a prot g cause he was at the beginning of my career
1883661 he is a great lyricist a great writer but his actions confuse the fuck out of me even his deal making when he makes a deal i have no understanding of why someone would even be interested in making the deals he decides to try and make
1883662 and the things that he says like he goes to radio and he says he just wishes him and jay z and me and ja and everybody would stop beefing that we should all go do just one big tour saying that shit is like saying i just wish there was no violence in the world
1883663 i dont have nothing negative to say about him but im just not fucking with him im not comfortable with not knowing who a nigga is and having him around me its hard to tell how a niggas going to react in certain situations when just dealing with your homies regular but this guy is out there so far already that fucking with him would make you look like a damn fool for associating yourself with someone thats so unpredictable he just contradicts himself
1883664 g unit is my record label its going to be what shady records is
1883665 i signed loyd banks and tony yayo thats who you hear on the tapes with me collectively they make g unit i didnt want to bite off more than i could chew i dont want to have 100 artists signed to a label i want to be able to focus and make what i think can work work right now we go to work now not a year from now thats what happens on a major label you have to have your moment you have to create a momentum and have people focused and maintain that focus till the release of your record
1883666 i established g unit last year but were still in negotiations i think it will be more effective for me to finalize my deal after my first week of sales

1883687 in hollywoods golden age films had morals clauses written into contracts to ensure that stars maintained acceptable standards of behavior a contract could be terminated if it was learned that a star violated the morals clause unfortunately todays hollywood has no such standards acceptable or otherwise
1883688 why does the media and in turn the public feed that frenzy by continuing the issue ad nauseum
1883689 to my mind more than with the celebrities themselves the problem lies with the audiences who seem to delight in lapping up every sordid detail about the persons bad behavior

1883706 at that time the kingdom of heaven will be like ten virgins who took their lamps and went out to meet the bridegroom
1883707 at midnight the cry rang out heres the bridegroom come out to meet him
1883708 no they replied there may not be enough for both us and you instead go to those who sell oil and buy some for yourselves
1883709 but while they were on their way to buy the oil the bridegroom arrived the virgins who were ready went in with him to the wedding banquet and the door was shut

1883965 bangsa jin bertempat tinggal di tempat tempat kotor dan sampah karena mereka memakan sisa makanan manusia
1883966 sesungguhnya tempat pembuangan kotoran didatangi jin karena itu bila kalian ke kamar mandi hendaklah berdoa
1883967 janganlah kalian kencing di lubang ia adalah tempat tinggal jin
1883968 dan aku tidak menciptakan jin dan manusia melainkan supaya mereka menyembah ku
1883969 telah diwahyukan kepadaku bahwasanya sekumpulan jin telah mendengarkan al quran lalu mereka berkata
1883970 dan janganlah kamu nikahi wanita wanita musyrik sebelum mereka beriman sesungguhnya wanita budak yang mukmin lebih baik dari wanita musyrik walaupun dia menarik hatimu dan janganlah kamu menikahkan orang orang musyrik dengan wanita wanita mukmin sebelum mereka beriman sesungguhnya budak yang mukmin lebih baik dari orang musyrik walaupun dia menarik hatimu mereka mengajak ke neraka sedang allah mengajak ke surga dan ampunan dengan izin nya dan allah menerangkan ayat ayat nya perintah perintah nya kepada manusia supaya mereka mengambil pelajaran

1883987 119 dan aku benar benar akan menyesatkan mereka dan akan membangkitkan angan angan kosong pada mereka dan akan menyuruh mereka memotong telinga telinga binatang ternak lalu mereka benar benar memotongnya dan akan aku suruh mereka merubah ciptaan allah lalu benar benar mereka merobahnya
1883988 175 sesungguhnya mereka itu tidak lain hanyalah syaitan yang menakut nakuti kamu dengan kawan kawannya orang orang musyrik quraisy karena itu janganlah kamu takut kepada mereka tetapi takutlah kepada ku jika kamu benar benar orang yang beriman
1883989 sesungguhnya allah telah menjanjikan kepadamu janji yang benar dan aku pun telah menjanjikan kepadamu tetapi aku menyalahinya sekali kali tidak ada kekuasaan bagiku terhadapmu melainkan sekedar aku menyeru kamu lalu kamu mematuhi seruanku oleh sebab itu janganlah kamu mencerca aku akan tetapi cercalah dirimu sendiri aku sekali kali tidak dapat menolongmu dan kamu pun sekali kali tidak dapat menolongku sesungguhnya aku tidak membenarkan perbuatanmu mempersekutukan aku dengan allah sejak dahulu

1884164 we are only a very small part of this campaign and the ongoing struggle
1884165 we were treated very even handedly we were questioned but the police were kind to us we were taken immediately to a police station and questioned
1884166 one of the reasons that we were there was that tibetans couldnt be there in our place they were refused visas and if anyone in tibet dared to protest they would certainly be treated much more harshly and would face torture and imprisonment
1884167 it was not difficult to get through the security as we had been planning this for four years
1884168 i was up there for about an hour it seemed longer there was a fire truck to bring me down safely
1884169 we knew there were risks involved but the risks were nothing compared to the suffering tibetans have endured security was tight but we walked up to the pole and everything was done in a straightforward manner we were arrested for disturbing public order and were later escorted to the airport
1884170 we wanted to make a call to world leaders and the chinese government for meaningful change this is a matter of basic human rights
1884171 it was definitely all worth it but expect there to be more the job is not done but we feel like we have achieved something
1884172 it seems odds on that house prices will continue to head rapidly south given that the bank of england reported extremely low mortgage approvals for house purchases in june while latest survey evidence shows that house sales are depressed buyer interest is weak it is taking longer to sell a house and sellers are achieving a falling percentage of their asking price
1884173 it seems unlikely that the bank of england will cut interest rates in the near term at least indeed it is possible that the bank of englands next move could be to raise interest rates which would clearly be very bad news for the housing market
1884174 very negative housing market sentiment also heightens the risk that house prices will fall sharply over the next couple of years
1884175 halifax pointed out in an attempt to put the current gloom in perspective that the average house price in july was 44 980 higher than in july 2003 and 104 888 or 145 higher than a decade ago

1884185 after four years of painstaking scientific research the f b i by 2005 had traced the anthrax in the poisoned letters of 2001 to a single flask of the bacteria at the army biodefense laboratory at fort detrick md according to government scientists and bureau officials
1884186 but at least 10 scientists had regular access to the laboratory and its anthrax stock and counting visitors from other institutions and workers at laboratories in ohio and new mexico that had received anthrax samples from the flask at the army laboratory

1884226 in a series of letters from 2000 and 2001 when he was still archbishop of wales williams wrote that scriptural prohibitions against homosexuality such as those in leviticus were addressed to heterosexuals looking for sexual variety in their experience in the correspondence an exchange with an evangelical christian williams argued that passages criticising homosexual activity were not aimed at people who were gay by nature an active sexual relationship between two people of the same sex might therefore reflect the love of god in a way comparable to marriage if and only if it had about it the same character of absolute covenanted faithfulness he also expressed his optimism that the church might change its stance on homosexuality the church has shifted its stance on several matters notably the rightness of lending money at interest and the moral admissibility of contraception so i am bound to ask if this is another such issue publication of the letters comes days after williams emerged unscathed from an important summit of the worlds anglican bishops

1884286 could it be that the whole issue of getting enough protein is actually just a figment of our collective imagination with nothing behind it except for the propaganda of the meat dairy and egg industries
1884287 that a married woman lacked a legal identity did not mean of course that she lacked all legal rights
1884288 as judges and legislators evaluating private interrogation procedures often conceded a husband could cajole or coerce his wife into a dower release that left him free to dispose of her property as he saw fit thus subverting dower protection
1884289 on the whole colonists in seventeenth century maryland and virginia respected the tradition of dower a widows thirds in real property were honored and her thirds of a husbands personal estate were also ensured
1884290 like their neighbors in maryland virginians guaranteed widows a dower share in personal property although in the first decades of settlement there was apparently some confusion over the exact meaning of a widows thirds initially virginians failed to define dower by statute they relied instead upon custom or common law to guide executors or administrators family members and court officials in distributing the estates of the dead in 1664 the general assembly acted to end the resulting confusion by enacting a law to define dower the statute an act concerning widdows thirds noted that doubts had arisen about the proper way of apportioning dower to end confusion lawmakers stated all real and personal property was subject to dower claims in assigning real property cleared and wooded lands and housing were to be divided into thirds with the widow taking her choice among the three parcels first by this definition the assembly attempted to obviate difficulties over apportioning the widows share in cases of intestacy when the will was unclear or one assumes when the widow renounced the will and asked for her thirds instead
1884291 planters who prepared their own testaments were permitted to do as they pleased
1884292 in 1699 virginia planter john washington himself a youngest son testified to the custom of the country i had not the value of twenty shillings of my fathers estate he wrote bitterly i being the youngest and therefore the weakest which generally comes off short
1884293 when every child was given an equal share the family tended to decline in status
1884294 a case in point was the successful but very stormy marriage between william byrd ii and lucy parke byrd
1884295 lucy byrd for her part was the daughter of colonel daniel parke a high born virginia gentleman who later became governor of the leeward islands
1884296 the most violent quarrels were about the house servants whom mrs byrd abused with a sadistic cruelty that shocked even her husband who was no humanitarian one domestic battle occurred when lucy byrd ordered a little slave girl named jenny to be burned with a hot iron for a minor fault
1884297 less frequently servants and slaves turned the tables and struck back at their owners william page of lancaster did strike at his sd master mr edward dale with a howe swearing god damme hym if his master stroke hym hee would beate out his braynes for which he was ordered to serve an extra year
1884298 in 1671 richard price attempted to sit in a seat in st
1884299 major dale was a man who held tenaciously to his opinion and one who demanded from all the proper respect due to his social and official position characteristics that are illustrated in the old records at lancaster court house
1884300 another that has come down through his descendants related how in his loyalty to the king he transgressed one of the strongest of virginias unwritten laws the law of hospitality the story relates that upon one occasion a stranger stopped at major dales house one day just about the dinner hour his horse was sent to the stable and he was invited to join the family at the dinner just then served when they were seated at the table the visitor immediately bowed his head and offered a long puritanical prayer in which he asked rich blessings for oliver cromwell and especial curses for king charles ii this so incensed major dale that he ordered the man from his table sent a servant for his horse and told him to hunt his dinner elsewhere
1884301 a situation arose in lancaster county at the turn of the century embroiling one of the countys most elite families in an eighteen year dispute over property
1884302 as a new generation of ball descendants and their slaves came of age in the early years of the eighteenth century conflict erupted again william ball son of joseph sued his aunt hannah fox for detaining the slave girl whom he claimed belonged to him according to the original terms of his grandfathers will madam balls deathbed instructions to give besss daughter to her own daughter clearly exceeded her rights to lifetime use of the estate and contradicted the terms of her husbands will the court ruled therefore that under constraint of her husbands will madam ball could not have lawfully bequeathed the slave girl to her daughter
1884303 apparently cousin chinn never found the site the gravesite of the great grandparents of americas first president remains unknown
1884304 these cavalier immigrants founded the dynasties that would later be called the first families of virginia but they were not chronologically the first in the colony most arrived within a decade of the year 1655 the founder of the carter family came in 1649 as did the first culpeper hammond honywood and moryson the first digges arrived in 1650 together with the first broadhurst chicheley custis page harrison isham skipwith and landon the first randolph emigrated from northamptonshire about 1651 the first mason in 1652 the first madison was granted land in 1653 the first corbin in 1654 the first washington a younger son of an oxford trained clergyman who had lost his living to the puritans crossed the ocean in 1657 as did colonel william ball the ancestor of george washingtons mother and the first fairfax in 1659 of seventy two founders of virginias first families whose dates of migration are known two thirds arrived between 1640 and 1669
1884305 southern planters gained their greatest satisfaction from managing englarging and improving upon their estates their self esteem was very much tied up with the land and they hoped to make their family seats as luxurious as those of the english upper ranks they wanted to be respected for their financial accomplishments one observer noted that virginians possessed an extraordinary ambition to be thought well of in england
1884306 equity provided various means for families to evade common law rules regarding womens subjection to coverture
1884307 equity allowed for the creation of separate estates and provided the means for a couple or their parents to negotiate an agreement outlining what property the wife could keep the property could then be placed in trust with the wife designated either an active trustee or passive beneficiary
1884308 although a widow as a feme sole possessed some control over property she lost this power once she entered a new marriage leaving her a window of opportunity before remarriage to assert some control over her property
1884309 by the eighteenth century prenuptial agreements defined property holding for first time brides as well as for remarrying widows
1884310 most early nineteenth century cases continued to turn upon a revised definition of waste established in the colonial period
1884311 the said land being formerly granted to mr thomas chetwood for five hundred acres by patent dated the ninth of july one thousand six hundred and sixty seven and by the said chetwood sold to major edward dale given to his daughter now the wife of william rogers and for want of due seating deserted

1884523 la obligaci n de las empresas de transporte terrestre de emitir pasajes gratuitos en favor de personas con discapacidad halla su fundamento en la ley 22
1884524 las empresas de transporte colectivo terrestre sometidas al contralor de autoridad nacional deber n transportar gratuitamente a las personas con discapacidad en el trayecto que medie entre el domicilio de las mismas y cualquier destino al que deban concurrir por razones familiares asistenciales educacionales laborales o de cualquier otra ndole que tiendan a favorecer su plena integraci n social la reglamentaci n establecer las comodidades que deben otorgarse a las mismas las caracter sticas de los pases que deber n exhibir y las sanciones aplicables a los transportistas en caso de inobservancia de esta norma la franquicia ser extensiva a un acompa ante en caso de necesidad documentada
1884525 que en virtud del decreto n 38 2004 se han simplificado los mecanismos de acceso gratuito al medio de transporte colectivo a fin de alcanzar el objetivo propuesto por las normas nacionales e internacionales que propician la igualdad e integraci n social del discapacitado en este sentido que asimismo y en concordancia con los principios antes mencionados se han eliminado los justificativos del viaje garantizando as el traslado gratuito de las personas con discapacidad
1884526 art culo 1 la fotocopia autenticada por autoridad competente del certificado de discapacidad y del documento que acredite la identidad del discapacitado ser n documentos v lidos para acceder al derecho de gratuidad a los distintos tipos de transporte colectivo de pasajeros terrestre
1884527 art 3 la causa de viaje a la que alude el tercer p rrafo del art culo 1 del decreto n 38 de fecha 9 de enero de 2004 no constituye limitante alguna al beneficio de gratuidad establecido en la ley n 25 635
1884528 argumenta la quejosa que se le neg al actor el pasaje gratuito a brasil que solicitaba porque los viajes internacionales est n exceptuados de la obligaci n legal dado que la ley 22
1884529 las empresas de transporte colectivo terrestre sometidas al contralor de autoridad nacional
1884530 puede presumirse que la injustificada negativa de la demandada a cumplir con la obligaci n legal de entregar pasajes gratuitos debi generar en el actor sentimientos de frustraci n de impotencia ante la falta de reconocimiento de su derecho a obtenerlos al amparo de una legislaci n espec fica cuya finalidad es procurar la equiparaci n de oportunidades de las personas con discapacidad y su plena integraci n a la vida social
1884531 no obstante la entidad de esos sentimientos debe ser ponderada con prudencia a los fines de su cuantificaci n econ mica sin dejar de tomar en consideraci n que el accionante no prob que la actitud de la demandada le haya provocado perjuicios m s all de los mencionados sentimientos de frustraci n en efecto en primer lugar no se encuentra probado en autos que a ra z de ello no haya podido viajar a brasil como pretend a o que se encontrara imposibilitado econ micamente de adquirir un pasaje con ese destino caso en el cual el da o moral emanar a precisamente de la circunstancia de no haber podido concretar su objetivo en raz n del obrar de la empresa de transportes tampoco prob haber perdido oportunidades de trabajo por no haber viajado en caso de no haberlo hecho como se esgrime al demandar
1884532 es por estas razones que propongo hacer lugar a la queja de la demandada y reducir la indemnizaci n a la cantidad de 2000 dos mil pesos

1884599 peran pemuda menjalankan reformasi sudah baik tetapi kesiapan sistem dan pelaksana pascareformasilah yang justru gagap ini memang ciri gerakan pemuda yang sering tidak memperhitungkan dampak ikutan tetapi asal dobrak saja akibatnya setelah soeharto lengser kita justru sibuk saling sikut sendiri malahan kebebasan setelah reformasi jadi banyak kebablasan semua minta keterbukaan dan kesamaan padahal tidak semua bisa diperlakukan demikian itu terlihat dalam pelaksanaan otonomi daerah persekolahan sampai aturan kehidupan masyarakat sehari hari
1884600 yang saya lihat di daerah daerah banyak pemuda yang sekarang terlibat dalam kriminalitas kota makassar dan manado misalnya dulunya sangat aman kini rawan kejahatan pelakunya kebanyakan orang muda memang sekarang cari pekerjaan sulit namun pemuda juga tampaknya kurang kreatif dan cenderung mau gampangnya saja menyalahkan pemerintah dan masyarakat atas kondisi ini kurang fair juga dari zaman prakemerdekaan dulu pemuda sudah harus merupakan kekuatan penggerak dan pendobrak bukannya merupakan beban karena itu pemuda sendiri yang harus mulai bergerak
1884601 saya masih optimistis generasi muda kita bisa berperan lebih banyak saat ini hanya saja memang mereka masih butuh bimbingan dari generasi di atasnya hal ini karena kondisi keterjepitan segala bidang saat ini multidimensi dan lebih abstrak ketimbang masa lalu soal memberantas korupsi masa kini misalnya lebih abstrak daripada gerakan menumpas pki pada masa lalu demikian pula perbenturan kepentingan golongan yang meningkat di zaman kebebasan saat ini harus pula dipikirkan pemuda jangan sampai masa reformasi ini justru melahirkan perpecahan bangsa akibat persaingan kepentingan yang bersifat kelompok dan eksklusif
1884602 kalau untuk menangkal soal kebebasan seks saya rasa adat di sini masih cukup berfungsi memang ada segelintir yang terjerumus tetapi mereka biasanya dari keluarga yang tidak rukun akan tetapi kalau soal narkoba memang sangat menakutkan keluarga yang kelihatannya baik baik ternyata tahu tahu anaknya memakai narkoba hal inilah yang terutama harus diwaspadai baik oleh pemerintah maupun gerakan kepemudaan sendiri jangan hanya sibuk berdemo ke kantor wakil rakyat tidak tahunya pulang demo mengonsumsi narkoba

1884632 la pena capital resulta injusta e inmoral ya que contraviene el principio sustancial del derecho natural esto es que nadie el tiene derecho a privar de la vida a un semejante
1884633 la instituci n encargada de la impartici n de justicia es humana y por tanto falible por lo cual la imposibilidad de retrotraer o detener los efectos de la sentencia constituye un elemento fundamental para negar cualquier posibilidad de aplicaci n de dicha pena
1884634 la pena de muerte es el castigo m s cruel inhumano y degradante y una violaci n del derecho a la vida nadie tiene el derecho de privar de la vida a otro y menos el estado en la aplicaci n de una sanci n
1884635 si bien el estado est leg timamente facultado para sancionar a quienes realicen conductas consideradas como delitos que atentan contra los bienes jur dicamente tutelados tal facultad no debe implicar violaciones a los derechos humanos entre ellos y en forma relevante el derecho a la vida y a la rehabilitaci n del infractor por dem s la pena de muerte se ha comprobado no ha logrado disminuir la tasa de criminalidad en aquellos estados 22 que a n la mantienen

1884638 quedan prohibidas las penas de muerte de mutilaci n de infamia la marca los azotes los palos el tormento de cualquier especie la multa excesiva la confiscaci n de bienes y cualesquiera otras penas inusitadas y trascendentales
1884639 los mexicanos consideramos a la pena de muerte como un castigo cruel y aberrante que atenta contra el derecho humano esencial que es la vida
1884640 la cifra es alarmante si se toman en cuenta los numerosos instrumentos internacionales que proscriben dicha pr ctica
1884641 no existe ning n argumento legal ni moral capaz de justificar que como sociedad humana privemos de la vida a otros seres humanos y es por ello que debe rechazarse la aplicaci n dela pena de muerte toda vez que implica un enfoque draconiano y totalitario a la prevenci n del crimen
1884642 la pena de muerte constituye una violaci n al derecho humano m s esencial como es el derecho a la vida por ende la aplicaci n de la pena de muerte no puede ser concebida por ning n motivo como una sanci n de la justicia penal ni como un medio leg timo para combatir el crimen y la delincuencia para tales efectos la respuesta sensata no estriba en la severidad sino en la real y oportuna aplicaci n de las mismas para evitar la comisi n de delito resulta ser m s eficaz la lucha contra la impunidad que la propia gravedad de las penas

1884683 give ear o my people to my law incline your ears to the words of my mouth i will open my mouth in a parable i will utter dark sayings of old which we have heard and known and our fathers have told us we will not hide them from their children shewing to the generation to come the praises of the lord and his strength and his wonderful works that he hath done for he established a testimony in jacob and appointed a law in israel which he commanded our fathers that they should make them known to their children that the generation to come might know them even the children which should be born who should arise and declare them to their children that they might set their hope in god and not forget the works of god but keep his commandments and might not be as their fathers a stubborn and rebellious generation a generation that set not their heart aright and whose spirit was not stedfast with god
1884684 i will open my mouth in a parable i will utter dark sayings of old which we have heard and known and our fathers have told us
1884685 my grace is sufficient for thee for my strength is made perfect in weakness
1884686 well how will riddles proverbs and enigmas help future generations
1884687 i will open my mouth in a parable i will utter dark sayings of old we will not hide them from their children shewing to the generation to come the praises of the lord and his strength and his wonderful works that he hath done
1884688 shewing to the generation to come the praises of the lord and his strength and his wonderful works that he hath done for he established a testimony in jacob and appointed a law in israel which he commanded our fathers that they should make them known to their children that the generation to come might know them even the children which should be born who should arise and declare them to their children
1884689 we all with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the lord are changed into the same image from glory to glory even as by the spirit of the lord
1884690 when they knew god they glorified him not as god neither were thankful
1884691 praise ye the lord i will praise the lord with my whole heart in the assembly of the upright and in the congregation the works of the lord are great sought out of all them that have pleasure therein his work is honourable and glorious and his righteousness endureth for ever he hath made his wonderful works to be remembered the lord is gracious and full of compassion
1884692 continue thou in the things which thou hast learned and hast been assured of knowing of whom thou hast learned them and that from a child thou hast known the holy scriptures which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in christ jesus
1884693 these words which i command thee this day shall be in thine heart and thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children and shalt talk of them when thou sittest in thine house and when thou walkest by the way and when thou liest down and when thou risest up and thou shalt bind them for a sign upon thine hand and they shall be as frontlets between thine eyes and thou shalt write them upon the posts of thy house and on thy gates
1884694 he established a testimony in jacob and appointed a law in israel which he commanded our fathers that they should make them known to their children that the generation to come might know them even the children which should be born who should arise and declare them to their children that they might set their hope in god and not forget the works of god but keep his commandments and might not be as their fathers a stubborn and rebellious generation a generation that set not their heart aright and whose spirit was not stedfast with god
1884695 train up a child in the way he should go and when he is old he will not depart from it
1884696 without faith it is impossible to please him for he that cometh to god must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him
1884697 now the end of the commandment is charity out of a pure heart and of a good conscience and of faith unfeigned
1884698 then one of them which was a lawyer asked him a question tempting him and saying master which is the great commandment in the law jesus said unto him thou shalt love the lord thy god with all thy heart and with all thy soul and with all thy mind this is the first and great commandment and the second is like unto it thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself on these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets

1884772 i would also like to take this opportunity to thank you again for your continuing support of the peace corps particularly during the fy 2009 budget appropriations process while i was certainly pleased to see the house appropriations subcommittee on state foreign operations and related programs provided the peace corps with the presidents request 343 5 million it seems unlikely that many if any of the fy 2009 appropriations bills will be sent to the president before the end of this congress as such the peace corps must prepare for a continuing resolution which means the agency will likely be operating under its current fy 2008 budget of 330 8 million
1884773 under a continuing resolution the budgetary realities confronting the agency in fy 2009 appear especially daunting without full funding in fy 2009 we anticipate a significant impact on our capability to place more volunteers overseas and to increase country programs furthermore as the agency shared with chairwoman loweys staff before the subcommittees consideration of the bill the weakening of the dollar overseas in tandem with spiraling costs of basic commodities both domestically and internationally have materially reduced our available resources and spending power we currently estimate foreign currency losses of almost 8 7 million for fy 2008 tough budgetary decisions must be made now in order to ensure a financially healthy agency next fiscal year
1884774 next year is going to be challenging financially as well and we have kept the fy 2009 budget in mind and taken steps to reduce peace corps base operating budget in order to strengthen our position moving forward we need to assume we will be operating under an extended continuing resolution at the level of our current appropriation well into the next fiscal year this environment shapes the financial decisions i will be making as fy 2009 budget marks are determined in the next few weeks
1884775 as we prepare for fy 2009 it is important for us to remember that our core business is supporting the work of our volunteers the office budget marks will be lower than the fy2008 approved budgets so we are all going to have to ask ourselves whether or not our financial decisions are in the best interest of our volunteers all of you should begin to streamline your operations in the last quarter of fy 2008 in preparation for fy 2009 i have dealt with many tight budgets in my career and i know this is not easy each of you will have to work within a lower budget mark while maintaining mission critical activities such as postponing the filling of vacant positions curbing travel for both you and your staff and or holding off on large expenditures
1884776 we are absolutely delighted to see peace corps volunteers return to kenya i visited the volunteers in kenya last summer and i know the outstanding work they were doing and the goodwill and friendships they had developed in their kenyan host communities the peace corps has a deep relationship with the kenyan people and we look forward to resuming our partnerships particularly through this period of recovery
1884777 i see the peace corps as part of a bigger cooperation between kenya and the united states the peace corps has united the american people with the people of kenya i have had the opportunity to meet some peace corps volunteers they work with a lot of dedication
1884778 i am delighted to say that 24 volunteers arrived in kenya last week and they are already back at work this november over 40 new volunteers will arrive in kenya and we are working to have the program back up to capacity as quickly as we can

1884782 our missions and goals are similar world peace and the betterment of peoples lives around the world peace corps volunteers work with many un organizations on the ground we are proud of this collaboration and hope it will continue
1884783 i really love her philosophy of volunteerism she sees it as a collaboration between people
1884784 when i look at you you remind me of a woman who has spent her whole life in a convent with the nuns but is so ready to just break out on one hand you are so sweet and innocent but on the other theres a wild side just waiting to come out
1884785 because in this region it rains only for four months or so
1884786 so this humidity rainfall information is then put together in a model and allows us to predict how green its going to be two three four months into the future
1884787 so in the u s its completely different we eat lettuce from california and we eat you know strawberries from guatemala and so because of the internationalization the globalization of our market system its very hard to determine the impact of food production on local prices
1884788 in africa in these very small informal markets almost all of the grain thats bought and sold there is grown locally and is moved into the markets on foot
1884789 these are beans that are not on the shelf anywhere beautiful old beans heirloom in very pretty colors and patterns that farmers have been selling from olympia to western oregon often at several dollars a pound

1884798 i was bumming around mexico one summer when i ran out of money

1884802 i was the first bureaucrat nixon fired when he took office
1884803 but when he found out i was a republican he asked me if id be his ambassador to colombia
1884804 as they say on the racing tout sheet for a horse that is not in the running nothing to recommend
1884805 he has little experience and little to indicate that he understands how to run the peace corps or any international organization its clearly a political payoff and it would be a shame to see him approved
1884806 one thing that we agreed on is that the d p r k will provide a full declaration of all of their nuclear programs and will disable their nuclear programs by the end of this year 2007
1884807 there is still simply no evidence that pyongyang has made a decision to abandon its long held strategic objective to have a credible nuclear weapons capability

1884809 dr allawi and his moderate iraqi colleagues as they undertake this work
1884810 from where i stood they happened to form a yin yang shape
1884811 and i quietly reached for my camera hoping i could record the moment before they shifted positions
1884812 the two boys playing marbles convey the age old concept of yin and yang opposites that fit together perfectly to make a whole a reminder that harmony does not come from being the same it comes from embracing differences and discovering how we complement and balance each other thereby making the world a richer place

1884817 we knew there were problems otherwise there wouldnt be a commission but we werent there to review complaints we were there to solve the problem

1884819 i was a rural socio economics planner i worked on a national park which was the largest cedar forest in africa i dealt with social economic and political forces and saw that they all work together
1884820 in 2003 nato moved peacekeeping forces into kabul and parts of northern afghanistan but not until 2005 when it was clear that the united states was bogged down in iraq and lacked sufficient resources to fight on two fronts did washington belatedly turn to nato to take the afghan south off its hands and then it misrepresented the situation its allies would find there nato was told in effect that it would simply need to maintain the order the united states had established and to help with reconstruction and security in fact as was clear from the ground the situation had been deteriorating since late 2002 by 2004 resurgent taliban were making a concerted push to enter the country from pakistan and intensive combat between american forces and taliban fighters was taking place north of kandahar

1884997 you get the picture im not as nice on myself as i am on paper you see this crushes me ive lived in oklahoma six years and had three jobs home national bank blockbuster and west middle school and if you want to count being a youth leader as a job that would make four i include that because i let the youth pastors leaders and teenagers down also at one point i enjoyed each job i had i enjoyed getting to know the other employees i worked with and the customers also i was a very good employee i had an intense work ethic i would go above and beyond the call of my job because thats who i was then i got sick and i had to miss days of work we couldnt find out what was wrong at first so that was especially frustrating to my employer because im sure they questioned the validity of my illness then i had to go to the hospital and came out with a diagnosis progress was being made but i did not have the strength to walk back into work with my head held high and do my job i felt horrible about myself for letting them down and i did not know how to deal with having this mental illness it took awhile for me to learn that i am not my mental illness i only have one there is a big difference and i began learning that when i worked at blockbuster i started as a csr customer service representative and worked my way up to store manager i cant say i knew too much about movies but once again i enjoyed the employees and customers since i wasnt from this town i enjoyed getting to know the people who lived in it i also had a good working relationship with my boss he was a very down to earth guy so when i began getting sick again i took it especially hard because i knew it directly effected my boss and my employees because i was the boss the one who was supposed to have it all together and its not something that i am open with yes i write openly but that is for my sake i dont just share it with those questioning my behavior i never want to use it as an excuse i want to take responsibility for myself so i dont offer it up because it could be looked on as that plus when it comes to work and working relationships your struggles arent meant for office business i had to take a leave of absence and eventually quit because my doctor and i agreed the stress of being a manager was not good for my illness there went a good paying job and free movies by the wayside i took some time to recover and then became employed at west middle school as a teachers aide for math plus which is remedial math i loved it the seventh graders were awesome i was working under the teacher of the year and we got along great i was meeting new friends the school itself was a great environment to work in mind you the pay was not so great but i was enjoying what i was doing and knew god would somehow provide for me these almost teenagers kept me on my toes i had so much fun with them then it happened again at the beginning of the year my mental illness rared up and i began missing work i was on so much medicine that when i was at work i couldnt do my job properly i had to take a leave of absence coming back of course i felt ashamed as i always did because i let people down but it didnt ease up there i finally had to leave this job i loved because i couldnt perform my duties correctly and my doctor and i decided it was time to try another method of treatment ect i wont write much on ect as i already have in other posts thats just what my summer consisted of treatments in may and treatments in july i am in the process of recovering now and do not have to take nearly as meds since ive had these treatments i had twelve in all my main purpose for allowing electricity to be shot through my head and induce a grand mal seizure was so i could be healthy for work that is why i did it i wanted to be healthy and dependable and feel good and it helps that it reduced the amount of medicine i have to take because it sure isnt cheap all throughout the summer i thought i had the job again as the teachers aide i was looking forward to it well school is about to begin next week and i just found out that i am not getting rehired the teacher wants me working alongside her the principal wants me in her school but the higher ups said no im upset but i am sure its because of my absences and not who i am or my work ethic they need the job to be done and for it to be done the employee has to be there although i am healthy and feeling better now that doesnt erase my last years record so how do you expect people to understand what you yourself dont understand failure failure failure thats what i see from time to time and struggle with not feeling like to not be able to be depended on makes you feel horrible thoughts like

1885508 because he is a vampire and loves her so much he puts himself though so much pain to be with her not that we want edward to be in pain but it shows how much he loves her
1885509 when you have sex with a vampire it can be very romantic it doesnt have to be violent
1885510 as i got older its more the sexual aspect of it
1885511 they have that seductive side but in an instant they can be all like feral you secretly want something a little dangerous a little exciting to spice up your life
1885512 because i read twilight i have unrealistic expectations in men
1885513 or maybe its that he is always there when we need him no matter what maybe its that he is capable of love that we mere humans would never be able to comprehend

1885515 its quite a deep psychological escape so when theyre reading this formula women really are in another world
1885516 they see a girl thats clumsy and depressed and they think im better than she is
1885517 its a boost of self confidence to see that someone like bella can get someone like edward whos good and true and unselfish
1885518 you would think that a vampires evil but he actually has morals
1885519 he could very well do what he wants with her because she would let him hes set on doing whats best for bella

1885525 the olympic movement does its greatest work by instilling the values of sport into the hearts and minds of young people everywhere sport is a universal language it teaches us how to strive for excellence in all that we do how to live in friendship and peace how to respect ourselves each other and the rules excellence friendship and respect are the fundamental olympic values they anchor all our activities
1885526 the place where i come from is a small town they think so small they use small words but not me im smarter than that i worked it out ive been stretching my mouth to let those big words come right out
1885527 1984 george orwell told of big brother who sought to abolish
1885528 it was intended that when newspeak had been adopted once and for all and oldspeak forgotten a heretical thought should be literally unthinkable newspeak was designed not to extend but to diminish the range of thought and this purpose was indirectly assisted by cutting the choice of words down to a minimum

1885530 the mental health issues appear to be higher for people who are active and in the midst of deployment the stress is just so much more powerful but the issues are the same

1885532 my defense of secular values of the republic is seen as a liability i am paying the price for the headscarf decision
1885533 the prime minister and the president talked a lot about democracy when i look from exterior i see a discrepancy between what they said and what is done
1885534 in a time of hype telling the truth becomes a revolutionary act
1885535 in cases where the police officers belonging to the same police station are members of the encounter party it is desirable that such cases are made over for investigation to some other independent investigating agency such as the state crime branch police

1885542 a male constable asked me to lift my veil and then frisked me
1885543 that the community is being seen only through the prism of terror the result is that when you pick up educated innocents and slap them around for a couple of days they walk out as different people it just ends up reinforcing their sense of being persecuted victims
1885544 yes we did a lot of combing and questioning just after the blasts after that however we have been very very discreet
1885545 as if the police are out to prove that members of only one particular community are terrorists
1885546 terrorism has resulted in certain sections of our population being targeted with the result that a wrong impression has been created of the radicalization of the entire muslim community
1885547 there is no question of bias against people of a certain community our investigation machinery has been set up in a way to ensure there is no bias still if there are any holes in this system we are ready to amend it police officials who are guilty of any bias will be punished

1885561 mandir wahin banega the temple will be built there only
1885562 is desh main rehna hain toh vandemaataram kehna hoga if they want to stay in this country they have to say i owe to you mother
1885563 the speeches were instigating and inflammatory to the two religions
1885564 i lost my dear son and i miss him a lot but i am sure that his sacrifice made me proud of him
1885565 my husbands sacrifice bore fruits immediately after he was killed
1885566 we are extremely grateful to people who expressed solidarity with us
1885567 i am sure the sacrifices rendered by the people of kashmir will lead us to freedom

1885574 we couldnt cover at least 20 to 25 percent areas in the two districts hence the number may increase if the unidentified graves in the areas left out in the survey are added to the total number
1885575 after the protest demonstrations the crpf personnel barged into our houses and misbehaved with the women
1885576 we will not stop our agitation and neither will tolerate abuse of our sisters daughter and mothers
1885577 they left without paying for the medicines when i asked them about the payment they warned me that if i demand money from them they would beat me and damage my shop fearing for my life i decided against asking payment from them

1885582 the entire area is under cordon for the past seven days we are not allowed to go outside by the crpf personnel

1885586 one common link between the riots of december 1992 and january 1993 and bomb blasts of 12th march 1993 appear to be that the former appear to have been a causative factor for the latter there does appear to be a cause and effect relationship between the two riots and the serial bomb blasts

1885590 before the violence many of these people were small self employed traders artisans or industrialists the violence put an end to their means of livelihood since their old clients were unwilling to use their services
1885591 leaders of the vishwa hindu parishad have taken over possession of their land and built multi storeyed buildings
1885592 populations displaced due to sectarian ethnic or communal violence should not be left to suffer for years together due to the lack of a policy and the absence of a justifiable framework of entitlements when displacement takes place under conditions of fear and under constant direct threat of violation of article 21 of the constitution the trauma and conditions under which survivors face the future is considerably worsened further when the threat of violence is perceived to be continuing the protection of peoples constitutional rights can only be sought through a national policy which clearly lays out a non negotiable framework of entitlements
1885593 appears not to be working and discrimination and exclusion persist
1885594 who have been forced or obliged to flee or to leave their homes or places of habitual residence in particular as a result of or in order to avoid the effects of armed conflict situations of generalized violence violations of human rights or natural or human made disasters and who have not crossed an internally recognized state border
1885595 the paper work is pending and its used as a ploy to classify the colonies as illegitimate
1885596 greater design to reduce the presence of muslims to a few villages in each taluka and free the rest of the villages from muslims
1885597 its therefore important for the muslim community to reorganise themselves and work together
1885598 we need to work together for improving education levels also there is a percentage of gujarati population thats non communal and we should build bridges with them
1885599 the un is not going to ask the gujarat government its going to ask the government of india about the people

1885606 the universities are legally autonomous they are not organs of government even though their scope of action is limited either by regulation or because of their dependence on government funds each has its own governing body manages its own affairs allocates its funds and pursues its own goals within the legislated limitations of its incorporation each is its own master with respect to the employment of professors the government has no legal power to control them their legal autonomy is fully buttressed by their traditional position in society any attempt by government to influence university decisions especially decisions regarding appointment tenure and dismissal of academic staff would be strenuously resisted by the universities on the basis that this could lead to breaches of academic freedom
1885607 you are spending to much time with your friends you are going in to town to much you want to finished with me bla bla bla

1885611 viel wurde vor olympia versprochen die lebensbedingungen und die b rgerrechte sollten verbessert werden getan hat sich rein gar nicht die lage hat sich sogar verschlechtert
1885612 speziell in hongkong hat man ngos gewarnt proteste oder aktionen w hrend der spiele zu machen
1885613 und diesen drohungen ist man auch nachgekommen da man nicht partner in zentralchina gef hrden wollte
1885614 der ansatz des internationalen olympischen komitees ioc durch die vergabe der olympischen spiele nach china f r bessere lebensstandards zu sorgen ist schief gegangen
1885615 und wenn sie gegen auflagen versto en wie das miteinander sprechen w hrend der arbeit wird ihnen lohn abgezogen

1885621 ein altruistisch denkender mensch w rde mit einem anders agierenden kaum gl cklich werden
1885622 unter offenheit f r erfahrungen verstehen wir das interesse an kulturellen praktischen kulinarischen bereichen aber auch wertvorstellungen
1885623 hier zeigt sich deutlich dass ein unterschiedlicher zugang auch g nstig sein kann
1885624 m glicherweise werden partner je l nger sie zusammen sind einander immer hnlicher
1885625 es w rde mich wundern wenn sich solche wesentlichen strukturen einfach so schnell ver ndern
1885626 what happens if a client calls and they need to talk to someone immediately

1885634 empty your mind be formless shapeless like water if you put water into a cup it becomes the cup you put water into a bottle and it becomes the bottle you put it in a teapot it becomes the teapot now water can flow or it can crash be water my friend
1885635 these are some of the things i learned from my father to listen to others with respect to be thoughtful in the commitments i make and then keep them to risk caring about other people and value friendship more than the potential for loss that accompanies it to lead from a position of integrity and hard work rather than from titular authority i learned that what you do speaks more loudly than what you say

1885640 the strong do what they have the power to do and the weak accept what they have to accept our opinion of the gods and our knowledge of men lead us to conclude that it is a general and necessary law of nature to rule wherever one can
1885641 this is a matter of religion and creed there is no way to forget the hostility between us and the infidels it is ideological
1885642 the question of armaments whether on land or on sea is the most immediately and intensely practical question connected with the future fortunes of mankind
1885643 it is therefore fitting to begin by noting that wars fundamental lesson still has not been learned a lesson fundamental to the very definition of war to the failure of the aforementioned intentions and instruments and to the inevitable failure of arms control as traditionally and presently conceived
1885644 nuclear weapons are the only weapons that could kill millions of people and destroy the infrastructure and social fabric of the united states if we do not make a more strenuous effort to halt and reverse nuclear proliferation and prevent nuclear terrorism it is inevitable that a nuclear bomb will eventually explode in a us city
1885645 worldwide there are about 2 100 metric tons of both highly enriched uranium heu and plutonium given that only 50 kg of heu or 10 kg of plutonium are needed to build a 10kt device nuclear bomb there is enough material worldwide to build 40 50 thousand weapons
1885646 therefore we must at last move beyond fighting only terror as we have been and proceed to fight terrorism
1885647 if jews all gather in israel it will save us the trouble of going after them worldwide
1885648 it is standard to evoke the mantra of diplomacy everywhere but diplomacy is fundamentally flawed it as all contemporary international affairs is missing a vital dimension the ideological for the new thinking needed carefully consider the web treatise formerly the pacificus gateway at pacificus1 com

1885667 thank you all for what youve done for us youve helped us make it through a tough season
1885668 you know our family wants to thank all of you for what you do for our son and all these guys im finishing writing a book about how difficult it is for baseball players to live the dream of playing professionally and in the book im tracing the steps of three players from t ball through the minor league ranks because im using my son as one of those players i used to be a sports writer and i was so critical of so many players in those days now im sitting in the stands and all of this has taken on an extremely different perspective now i hear the criticisms all around me of these guys we take for granted that when its 90 95 degrees in the stands its sometimes 10 12 degrees hotter on that field i can sit and watch my son and these other kids face these pitchers and still catch myself saying from my seat now there is no reason for you to have missed hitting that pitch but the view is different when you are standing on that plate and the ball is coming at you 80 sometimes on a pitchers good night 95 mph and then fielding a ball thats popped up and im dozens of feet away from a player and forget that if there is wind coming in just a bit of a gust can change the downturn angle of the ball to where its target drop can be misread or a groundball hitting just the certain little clump of infield dirt or grass in such a way that it appears the defensive man should have had it but the ball takes a screwy twist on you then there are just the human mental misjudgments that all of us make not only on a ball field but in life as well that can change the whole aspect of an inning and change the whole flow of a game that not only affects one player but the whole team and everyone in the stands it really helps when as a father i hear fans speaking in support of the players on the field i regret some of the things i wrote in the past about some of the teams and players i covered because i see things now with different eyes i want to thank you mckee and this entire booster club for hanging in here through this hard season my son genuinely and sincerely wants to return here to play next year he loves the down home atmosphere of shreveport and all you folks well see how his surgery in the off season goes and his rehab as well you have all made a difference in justin and him being still so much of a kid probably well he doesnt show the appreciation he should to you all maybe i dont know but what i do know is that in the off season we talk regularly about all of you and how strongly you support this team this is our last visit here this season i expect i just wanted to have a chance to speak with you before we leave i want everyone to know here how much all of you are appreciated

1885868 he told me we need to donate money i asked how much 5 000 10 000 shekels he said it must be a painful contribution so that the entire family feels the financial burden
1885869 he wasnt satisfied with the amount i offered and said 36 000 dollars
1885870 i told him i have three kids at home a mortgage i said i couldnt stop working because there was nobody else to support the family
1885871 she came to my crying saying its my health and my life she really begged and her tears broke me he promised me health and complete recovery if we paid the money i felt that if i dont pay the money i would be contributing to her death
1885872 she went there on her own and when she came back she told me youdkevitch said another contribution was needed
1885873 his move was even crueler because he already knew we contributed money before and he knew the familys situation wasnt good
1885874 yet cynically and without shame he demanded another 25 000 dollars
1885875 by 2003 she was using a wheelchair and in june 2004 she was confined to bed but she still believed in them
1885876 he told me he couldnt touch the money we already donated but said hell find donors and help us with their money
1885877 we left with a promise but he kept on dragging it every time he said he had no donor

1885889 de haber llegado cinco minutos antes los hubi ramos sorprendido en in fraganti
1885890 hasta las fuerzas a reas estaban intentado saber de qu se trataba el descubrimiento
1885891 si esto viniera de marte entonces existir an los monos en marte
1885892 that four great nations flushed with victory and stung with injury stay the hand of vengeance and voluntarily submit their captive enemies to the judgment of the law is one of the most significant tributes that power has ever paid to reason
1885893 we never suggested he was in the top 17 or the top any teen of al qaeda i dont want to have anybody have us appear to be asserting that hes more responsible than he is or that hes higher ranking than he is
1885894 mr hamdan is being tried on accusations of conspiracy and material support of terrorism and the bush administrations military commission system itself is on trial
1885895 met diagnostic criteria for post traumatic stress disorder and major depression
1885896 nightmares intrusive thoughts memories and images amnesia for details of traumatic events lack of future orientation anxiety irritability insomnia poor concentration and memory exaggerated startle responses and hypervigilance
1885897 kept in isolation 24 hours a day with his hands and feet restrained and armed soldiers prompted him to talk by kneeing him in the back
1885898 repeatedly tied him up put a bag over his head and knocked him to the ground
1885899 highly coercive environments and conditions under which they were made
1885900 we need to evaluate to what extent it has an impact on our ability to fully portray his criminality in this case but also what it might set out for future cases
1885901 are built to make full advantage of statements obtained from detainees
1885902 is the only place in the world where he has not informed suspects of a right against self incrimination
1885903 committed terrorists off the street and out of the airlines and out of nuclear power plants and out of ports across this country and across other countries
1885904 cooperative cordial and a source of reliable information about the terrorist hierarchy
1885905 drew maps to al qaeda training camps and compounds for his captors
1885906 guided fbi and military intelligence agents to bin ladens private residences and guest houses and identified photos of terrorist kingpins still at large
1885907 built a trusting relationship with hamdan during the marathon interrogation bringing him special snacks and working to ease his concerns
1885908 mr hamdan commented that he liked mcdonalds fries and we brought fries in
1885909 grew upset and uncooperative when he was put in solitary confinement amid a series of interrogations prompting a heated complaint by crouch to military guards
1885910 hamdans mood lifted when he was allowed to call and tell his wife that he was alive
1885911 he was very grateful for the opportunity to speak to his wife a burden had been lifted from him at least his wife knew he was alive
1885912 unaware that during the night hamdan was also brought to interrogators of another u s agency
1885913 without people like mr hamdan bin laden would enjoy no support he would not enjoy protection and he probably would not have been able to elude capture up to this point
1885914 did anyone ever say youve got to understand somebody can use this against you
1885915 the head of bin ladens bodyguards hamdans boss and an al qaeda errand boy arrested along with hamdan
1885916 refused to cooperate with u s interrogators during their time at guantanamo were eventually released without being charged
1885917 its perverse that the only person who agreed to cooperate is being hung with his own words while those who stayed silent are home and free
1885918 you think all of this stuff about torture is going to make people want to come to us
1885919 thats why i get upset when i hear people talking about stress positions loud music and dogs
1885920 harrowing both for what they depict and for the fact that they were admitted into evidence at all
1885921 show hamdan slumped on the floor hooded and shackled as he is badgered by his arabic speaking military interrogator in a dark room with one dim light bulb overhead an armed soldier is behind hamdan the interrogator in front
1885922 there is a sickening sense in watching that hamdan visibly scared is searching for the right words to appease the interrogator trying out ideas as they occur to him in an attempt to avoid more abuse
1885923 the dod fears that the american public will know a coercive interrogation when it sees one
1885924 a graphic 90 minute film chronicling the history of al qaeda
1885925 footage of mangled corpses in the rubble of the 1998 u s embassy bombing in kenya
1885926 not alleged to have been involved in any of these attacks
1885927 he insisted that he had spoken only with soufan during the more than nine hour interview and that despite soufans persistent questioning on the subject he had never told him about swearing allegiance
1885928 cast a black cloud over these agents and those who work with the detainees
1885929 two largely separate al qaeda missions supporting islamic warriors and committing terrorist acts against enemy foreign states
1885930 it is not the defense that has requested this closed session but it is necessary according to the government to protect the information
1885931 it is my hope that the american public will someday hear mr hamdans defense
1885932 no court civilian or military has credibility when it listens to secret evidence in a closed courtroom
1885933 the reason closed sessions are so troubling at guantanamo is because the government has so frequently claimed things have had to be classified to cover up abuse and torture in addition trials of this magnitude should have a public record if a significant amount of evidence and witness testimony is classified it will be very hard to trust any verdict
1885934 responsible for the 9 11 operation from a to z
1885935 he did not play any role he was not a soldier he was a driver his nature was more primitive bedouin person and far from civilization he was not fit to plan or execute
1885936 as the american army we have drivers cooks crewmen and legal personnel we also are human beings we have interests in life our people have wives and children and schools you can not understand terrorism and al qaeda from 9 11 operation
1885937 one of the reasons for the success of the outside operations is the secrecy of the operations so many of bin ladens inner circles have no knowledge of what he was planning and so many of al qaedas members and even the trainers at the military camps do not have any knowledge of the works of the outside cells that includes the civilian employees
1885938 its a great question im not faced with it yet weve thought that through and we have plans to accommodate but ill cross that bridge when i come to it
1885939 the united states would be irresponsible not to continue to detain them until the conflict is over
1885940 whats the purpose here mr hamdan is going to be held until the government wants to release him it really has no connection to the underlying reality
1885941 when the means of security are privatized certain mechanisms of moral hazard and adverse selection might lead firms astray just as in the rest of commerce war is business where nice firms do not always finish first
1885942 said his kbr bosses mocked him for raising safety issues
1885943 has not found any credible evidence that representatives from kbr were aware of imminent life threatening hazards
1885944 were not the cause of any of these terrible accidents
1885945 these tort based claims of civilian employees against their civilian employers can be separated from the political questions that loom so large in the background
1885946 is partly determined by how closely intertwined the contractor is with the government officials
1885947 one of the interesting things that i think were seeing is that courts are not willing to throw these cases out when the contractor has a fair degree of discretion
1885948 yea hahaha mrs nath must be having migraine while mrs cheung morning sickness
1885949 lol scarely nath and cheung looking after each other mrs nath will go over to mrs cheung s house and two of them will

1885964 market participants are torn between persistent fears over slowing energy demand and potentials for further supply disruptions
1885965 gold traded on a supportive footing with dip buying noted in response to the firmer crude prices
1885966 the combination of much lower production volumes and higher steel costs has put considerable pressure on our 2008 operating results
1885967 but we are working to offset these challenges through pricing additional restructuring and cost reductions
1885968 the information that has become available since our previous meeting has further underpinned the reasoning behind our decision to increase interest rates in july
1885969 it has confirmed that annual inflation rates are likely to remain well above levels consistent with price stability for a protracted period of time and that risks to price stability over the medium term remain on the upside

1885988 its been passed down from the regiment that there is a threat of insurgents utilizing oil smuggling to transport and fund their operations
1885989 these towns are like home ground for smuggling and were here to ensure it stops
1885990 most people in iraq want to live their lives in a safe and secure environment and if the enemy elements are invading the town the residents are in danger
1885991 when we put a dent in the oil smuggling and insurgency operations we thereby lay a dent in al qaida of iraq
1885992 denying al qaida access to the town will take away the opposition of the citys government and make it more effective

1886002 stigma remains the single most important barrier to public action it is the main reason too many people are afraid to see a doctor to determine whether they have the disease or to seek treatment
1886003 it helps make aids the silent killer because people fear the social disgrace of speaking about it or taking easily available precautions stigma is a chief reason the aids epidemic continues to devastate societies around the world
1886004 to speak out against discrimination and to guarantee the rights of people living with hiv
1886005 schools should teach respect and understanding religious leaders should preach tolerance the media should condemn prejudice and use its influence to advance social change from securing legal protections to ensuring access to health care

1886008 we can either choose a new direction for our economy or we can keep doing what weve been doing my opponent john mccain thinks were on the right track
1886009 if you look at the overall record you could make an argument that theres been great progress economically over that period of time but thats no comfort to families now that are facing these tremendous economic challenges
1886010 that we are that that during george bushs tenure the economy actually made great progress
1886011 what they are going to try to do is make you scared of me
1886012 you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all of those other presidents on the dollar bills theyre going to say im a risky guy what theyre going to argue is im too risky
1886013 senator obama and i faced a decision which amounted to a real time test for a future commander in chief
1886014 america passed that test i believe my judgment passed that test and i believe senator obamas failed
1886015 im happy and deeply honored to be invited by the
1886016 if john mccain wants to meet me anywhere anytime to have a debate about our respective policies in iraq in iran in the middle east or around the world that is a conversation i am happy to have
1886017 i believe that there is no separation between john mccain and george bush and i think their policy has failed
1886018 its disappointing that senator mccain and his campaign decided to decline this proposal
1886019 why dont you invite senator barack obama to join me
1886020 just the two of us stand there and answer questions
1886021 i want to cut taxes for middle class families ordinary folks who are working hard and playing by the rules
1886022 im ready to duel john mccain on taxes right here quick draw
1886023 if barack obama wants this so called duel then why did he and his entourage run for the hills when john mccain challenged him to 10 town halls
1886024 he seems to be only talking about me you need to ask john mccain what hes for not just what hes against
1886025 senator obama and i faced a decision which amounted to a real time test for a future commander in chief

1886046 he made very big mistakes he was not sufficiently professional to ask where the data came from and how accurate the data were even granted the data were accurate he did some statistical calculations of a very simplistic nature based on very simple and unrealistic assumptions even granted these assumptions he had no idea how to interpret the numbers he got

1886051 he has done every thing he could to contribute to this team and we appreciate his efforts we also appreciate his putting the teams best interests first he has once again demonstrated why he is a champion
1886052 serves to clarify the existing provisions of the covered agreements in accordance with customary rules of interpretation of public international law
1886053 storytelling is the most powerful way to put ideas into the world today
1886054 a story should be remembered for its soul and not for its bells and whistles
1886055 if you talked to people like advertising talked to people theyd punch you in the face
1886056 learn how to tell your story really well i call it building a myth because like a myth the story has to be easy to remember and share dramatic and it has to have a lesson contained within it that shareable founding story is what consumers use to convert people to your brand
1886057 a brand is what people say about you when youre not in the room
1886058 many of the chicks we are chipping will return in a couple of years to have their own young and we will be able to monitor mortality and return rates
1886059 the penguins are valued at about 1500 each so it makes sense to understand as much about them as we can
1886060 i dont know if i want to say how it might have happened in case they want to close that loophole
1886061 the sabres were mediocre last year they were 10th in the watered down
1886062 is it worth that much money to watch a terrible toronto team that hasnt made the playoffs since the lockout and a mediocre buffalo team that missed the postseason last year
1886063 i think its a little wierd but he saves everyones posts so he can throw you off point with some obscure reference you made months ago
1886064 will spending more guarantee a cup nope but it cant hurt and claiming it will is lame
1886065 now i asked the 5 horsemen of the rapture to make a prediction previously but heard crickets please do so or is that forbidden in the marketing contracts
1886066 thats the type of insight that i like to see you understand that putting up a consistent winning product takes more than just looking at the next season
1886067 thats the type of insight that i like to see you understand that putting up a consistent winning product takes more than just looking at the next season
1886068 competing for the playoffs but not competing for a championship
1886069 do i think that would be the best for the team this season
1886070 audacity of hope in the form of up and coming prospects
1886071 no one can say anything negative about the excuses without your coming lamely to their defense
1886072 its like elma coveniently basing his sabres ticket price growth theory on post lockout
1886073 these greedy b stards raised our prices by 20 in just 3 years
1886074 ill do the thinnin around here and dooont you fergit it
1886075 uh guys we need another distraction why well pittsburgh is making our excuses look like well excuses get us a new villan
1886076 you buffalo fans dont really want deserve a stanley cup you want cheap hockey right
1886077 teppos leadership qualities will more than make up for orpiks toughness
1886078 soupy is over paid chicago will regret it some day nonsense
1886079 excuses is right and sour grapes from fans who have no life but to create false expectations of a losing organization
1886080 guys like frank below just cant accept reality of our incompetant sic management and that we are bottom feeders now with no chance of winning a cup so yeah lets attack me because i represent reality and tell truth that nobody likes to hear at least i keep it real and dont waste my time in some deluded belief that a fan is someone who blindly supports a losing team and writes a blank check to make tommy even richer like shillp
1886081 i just thought the article sounded like it was penned by someone in the excuses pr office anything for a story
1886082 the pens signed fleury the sabres are talking about signing miller
1886083 so that he might make it holy by cleansing it washing it with water and the word and might present the church to himself in all its glory without a spot or wrinkle or anything of the kind but holy and without fault
1886084 she is mine and she will have no other gods beside me
1886085 as the deer longs for streams of water so i long for you o god i thirst for god the living god when can i go and stand before him
1886086 000 i expected to see i realized the display read
1886087 there is one body and one spirit just as you were called to one hope when you were called one lord one faith one baptism one god and father of all who is over all and through all and in all
1886088 if i were in the business of selling grace i too would be out of business
1886089 i want to be found in him not having my own righteousness which is from the law but that which is through faith in christ the righteousness which is from god by faith
1886090 i know that it doesnt make sense but i must be face to face with her
1886091 i therefore urge you brothers in view of gods mercies to offer your bodies as living sacrifices that are holy and pleasing to god for this is the reasonable way for you to worship do not be conformed to this world but continually be transformed by the renewing of your minds so that you may be able to determine what gods will is what is proper pleasing and perfect
1886092 the spirit and the bride say come let everyone who hears this say come let everyone who is thirsty come let anyone who wants the water of life take it as a gift
1886093 were in a very high demand time period and were trying to respond to it
1886094 every time i fire i say this is for you
1886095 we are ever conscious of the fact that with each family we get one chance to get it right
1886096 i feel so blessed to be an american and that america has furnished something like this for our soldiers it gives you such a wonderful feeling
1886097 for my family and the situation and everything i think its going to be a great experience
1886098 i wasnt doing the right things and that was being a hypocrite if i believe in something i have to do it 100 percent i cant stand on the fence i had to change some things up
1886099 wonder what sidney crosby and alex ovechkin would have done if they played at their current speed during the gretzky era
1886100 you might get the record tonight but remember you are doing it in my house
1886101 ill pay good money to travel to portland to hear him announced at the first home game to the tune of
1886102 first this post is about kevin dineen whom you fail to mention in your six page tirade
1886103 second how the heck much free time do you have
1886104 elma convinced me that i could not convince him and i gave up
1886105 the next phase of the argument would have brought subjective things like injuries which sway statistics i thought about it and realized he you arent going to change your mind because you are paid not to it wasnt worth the effort
1886106 there would be a better correlation if you removed the impact of injuries
1886107 yeah and removing the fact that they play the game on ice instead of on a strat o matic would have resulted in perfect correlation
1886108 incidentally i was more accurate with my analysis than he was
1886109 i would have responded to him pointing out my fallacious statements but i just assumed i was right
1886110 i do not think you can argue that spending that extra 5 million would be a bad thing now can you
1886111 if they dont spend to the cap theyre not trying to win
1886112 thats ok we dont need any changes on the leadership front and the kids will get it right this year
1886113 elma convinced me that i could not convince him and i gave up
1886114 the next phase of the argument would have brought subjective things like injuries which sway statistics i thought about it and realized he you arent going to change your mind because you are paid not to it wasnt worth the effort
1886115 there would be a better correlation if you removed the impact of injuries
1886116 yeah and removing the fact that they play the game on ice instead of on a strat o matic would have resulted in perfect correlation
1886117 incidentally i was more accurate with my analysis than he was
1886118 i would have responded to him pointing out my fallacious statements but i just assumed i was right
1886119 i do not think you can argue that spending that extra 5 million would be a bad thing now can you
1886120 if they dont spend to the cap theyre not trying to win
1886121 thats ok we dont need any changes on the leadership front and the kids will get it right this year
1886122 hey the owners not committed to winning why should i be
1886123 we will probably make the playoffs anyway so why try during the first 15 games or so
1886124 hey they seem to like the product as is so why should i change or try harder
1886125 hopefully ryan will get up off his back and give that bully whats coming to him
1886126 hey they traded away an allstar for draft picks and who seems to me they didnt make a move at the trading deadline so why do i care if we make the playoffs or not money is pretty much the same
1886127 miller and pominville will never re sign with the sabres
1886128 teppo numminen is the cleaner living john entwhistle of hockey quietly proficient contributing far more output than commonly recognized at fist glance sign him
1886129 now as far as saying comparing numminen and orpik to apples and oranges i agree one is a old apple core and the other is a blooming juicy orange so yeeh theyre different
1886130 if you are asking would i give orpik 4yrs 16 million over numminens anticipanted 1 5 million for one year the answer is yes
1886131 i guess im most upset about the orpik ordeal not so much because they didnt sign him but because they didnt even try to sign him
1886132 youre going to need to offer to even get in the door
1886133 we still have one of the best defenses in the legague
1886134 nhlnumbers com added ufa mathieu darche to the sabres roster this morning i dont know much about him and wonder what this move if it is correct is all about anyone else hear anything
1886135 ive seen your comments here and its clear youre a big fan of management and that they can do no wrong in your eyes
1886136 why on earth would miller ever want to stay here with this management team
1886137 name the defensive pairing that will be on the ice when ryan miller is injured in the crease and misses the next two months with a broken collarbone or torn acl
1886138 this is a total no brainer which given managements track record worries me
1886139 it was a difficult season for us but i got the sense they felt like i put a lot of effort into it and i could still be a franchise player miller said
1886140 buffalo has several young very good netminders that could fill any void until they can point their cap dollars at the needed vacnacies ie 2 top 10 fwds and 2 top 10 d men
1886141 for all you briere drury campell lovers out there what have they ever done okay when drury was a rookie and on a colorado team that was loaded he got his name on the cup
1886142 i chose buffalo it is a bit of a buy in i buy into what theyre about
1886143 thats winning hockey games based on caring about the players and individuals i have a great relationship with everyone in this organization it made a lot of sense to stay here i have great friends and teammates i trust my coaches i trust my management and thats not a situation you can always step into especially with free agency
1886144 miller is a good goalie the problem is the sabres are a below average team and the sabres will be out shot every night
1886145 mi salvador muri en la cruz dejadme pues morir tambi n sobre un madero
1886146 if they put me in the same amount of games as last year this time id be better prepared we all want to put a better plan in place and ive approached them about that we want to be smart about things not get caught doing 30 some games in a row as a goaltender its tough to do that every night the whole gameday is a process for me its not just about going and playing the game there was preparation 76 times and that was a new experience for me
1886147 and since you are so into gd research the guy you shoot down ted won a division with derek plante and other
1886148 if you cant get along with your superiors youll be fired
1886149 as a goaltender its tough to play every night and get charged up the whole gameday is a process for me its not just about going and playing the game going through that preparation 76 times was a new experience for me
1886150 we had two short summers a lot of games and a lot of hype it turned out that got us off on the wrong foot last year were going to have more time to prepare this time
1886151 im excited about that ive heard hes a great person im always excited to meet people like that in hockey and just another aspect of the team that can help us
1886152 its very nice everyone on the organization side thought it was very important and obviously ryan thought it was important as well it was really the focus from ownership tom golisano talked about it larry quinn talked about it i think its a huge commitment on the part of tom in particular ultimately these decisions because of the financial magnitude you have to give a lot of credit to the ownership
1886153 in a lot of cases its not always about statistics its about supply and demand in the marketplace it came down to this is a goaltender we believe in this is a goaltender whos only going to get better and this is a goaltender who ultimately we think we can win a championship with the marketplace is the marketplace you have to acknowledge it respect it and make your decisions inside of it
1886154 he talked to us in terms of what he didnt want to do he didnt want to become a rental player or a short term player or go to a team on a one year basis to try to win a championship he wants to do that here
1886155 the core of the team are guys hes gone up with there were just lots of reason to stay it was not hard to accomplish he wasnt looking to make any statements by going for the biggest deal this is where he wanted to be when a player feels that way usually that means you know it would get it done
1886156 they didnt want it to linger and frankly i agree with that with a player of ryans stature it shouldnt linger he should not be in that spot the natural tendency is for people to check out at some point because they know deep down theres not going to be a next year in a place once they get out on the ice guys can put that aside some of the time part of you says youre playing for the cause but you know its going to end and you dont know where its going hell be able to stay away from all that
1886157 i dont play defense look at my spin o rama campbell
1886158 how can the sabres explain signing a one dimensional goalie to an extension but not signing briere amp drury
1886159 oh by the way how many cups has darcy and his brilliance brought to buffalo
1886160 im sure rivet will be better in the end of his career in a town he probly doesnt want to be part of he was a true force in making san jose a cup team
1886161 im good enough im smart enough and doggon it people like me
1886162 i am so frusterated with this team b c they were so close in 05 and did nothing to build on their sucess probably closer than they have ever been it seems to me that they are a few players away from getting back to the 05 year and paying miller top money does not help
1886163 if miller is so great and better than all those other goalies why were we tenth if he won so many games why didnt we make the playoffs
1886164 btw good thing youre not sewing the names on the jerseys
1886165 its people like you that justified what darcy and the gang have done to this once great team
1886166 darcy your approval ratings are way up among sabres bloggers this month you can keep your job
1886167 last time i checked luongo lundquist broader all made the playoffs last year
1886168 scoring 6 goals a game and losing doesnt mean squat if winning 2 1 means winning ill take it kind of like how we went to the cup in 99 when hasek an elite goalie would single handedly shut down games
1886169 miller was at this best in 2005 he has progressively gotten worse
1886170 im not saying he isnt good he is overrated he is not elite he is not top 5 or even top 10 he can not single handedly shut down games and he is not worht 6 54 mil
1886171 all he does is win but doesnt put up great numbers
1886172 if you argue with me youre just be a clueless sabres apologist
1886173 come on dave your so smart please staistically show me where this is a good deal im waiting
1886174 the you tube shows what we all know alfredson went through 3 defenseman and scored on a soft goal every time someone scores on ryan its he was screened
1886175 oh my what would the fans do if ryan left like the others
1886176 but montreal didnt win the cup so stop using them as an example
1886177 buffalo has done little to change its makeup from the team that missed the playoffs last year
1886178 a team that has done little to change its makeup from the one that missed the playoffs
1886179 a team that still has not signed its current captain nor its starting goaltender past the current season
1886180 most importantly a team that given all this will dangle the
1886181 the fans sit here during free agency and watch other teams scramble to sign players and then we hope and pray buffalo will do something anyhthing
1886182 yeah but do i have to pay taxes on that
1886183 well can max drive a zamboni our driver just quit but hed have to learn how to drive in a straight line none of this zig zag crap we need a nice smooth ice surface
1886184 um how about you sign big bear and you take max and we can call it even you dont need to include the draft picks
1886185 no thats okay we can keep the current deal of big bear for our draft picks
1886186 steve bernier is a highly regarded young player whos enjoyed success early in his career
1886187 with his right handed shot he will be a great addition to our top six forward group and an asset to our power play
1886188 hey we made a move and this is a bargain pickup
1886189 whether its here or not hes here right now he certainly is going to get back on track hes a young player theres no reason not to hes an outstanding player
1886190 brilliant move by the best front office in the business
1886191 gm dale tallon admitted he overpaid campbell at 56 8 million over eight years but he also delivered a strong message that the blackhawks were headed in the right direction
1886192 theyre not making me rich enough or obscenely overpaying me
1886193 notice they havent started talks with pommenville yet gee why is that maybe because he is next years campbell
1886194 but there is always the trade market where have i heard that before
1886195 is darcy even awake theres not a single veteran tough defenseman left once orpik signs here we go again
1886196 i cant believe millers not signed by july 6th here we go again
1886197 backup goalie that was not even in our thoughts but we have to sign somebody or all we will have left is to tie max to the posts by his hands and feet to block pucks check
1886198 ill put big money into the goal position if i have one have one of the top five in the game if another team pays 4 5 million a year for a goalie well pay 1 1 5 million and sink the rest of our money into defense
1886199 when you move people and take on the type of dollars weve taken on you have to do some other things
1886200 you have to move some dollars and you have to replenish the picks
1886201 i do not believe in the concept of a rental player and i never have you work and struggle with the same guys all year and that is what makes it worth while
1886202 what you can spend 3 5 but not 3 75
1886203 elma would the compensation picks be more than what we got today for big bear didnt we need those picks to complete the rivet trade today or no
1886204 we are going to be just as competitive this year and we still have one of the best defenses in the league
1886205 if you listen to the fans youll end up sitting with them
1886206 what the heck have we signed the salary cap lets us compete with the big markets and what have we done teppo numminen isnt exactly making my heart go pitter pat
1886207 you do bring my anger towards the managements inaction down a few notches
1886208 you must understand that this really takes some of the fun out of following a sports team right can you conceed that how much fun did you have on july 1st last year as we watched the captains of our hockey team sign elsewhere
1886209 my point yes in the long run this strategy may work for the sabres
1886210 gee do you think we have enough money to go after the 7th best defenseman
1886211 thanks elma with so much money left in cap room couldnt the sabres go after a slightly past their prime defensive to provide some leadership and some experience to defense
1886212 sorry ryan thats ridiculous were going with lalime until enroth is ready
1886213 excuses we opened discussions with miller penguins were done next
1886214 they called my agent and asked what we were looking for
1886215 that was the only time we heard from them they never came close to making a contract offer they were way on the outside to be honest
1886216 he provides the kind of physical presence you need on a cup contender
1886217 the idea that you dont win championships through free agency is nonsense
1886218 pittsburgh this year was pretty much in the same position as buffalo in 06
1886219 and yet you continue to blindly defend them predictably certifiably
1886220 i think the main reason people dont agree with the likes of elmagolf is that he makes well reasoned arguments that you cant argue against
1886221 elma amp lamarfish will you be talking anything other than hockey on sabresradio550 today between 3 7 mix in a little baseball maybe
1886222 defend this logic and rational poll among the players in the nhl this is the last place they want to play
1886223 i fear that this management team can be a little cold amp cavalier
1886224 however there have been way too many players who have left here the same way
1886225 and spare me with the whole 4 eastern conference finals thing in 10 years garbage they are now at 38 years and counting and have never won the stanley cup
1886226 every one of us would take one cup over 4
1886227 dont have the management and ownership commitment to put us over the top
1886228 i want a player just good enough to reach the ecf but they cant be good enough to win the cup
1886229 we have regressed each year for the last two years in our quest for the cup what have we done to fix it ill hang up and listen
1886230 hell provide stability as the backup and a nice bridge until the wings sign ryan miller next july
1886231 elma you seemed to be a very loyal sabres supporter and love to defend regier
1886232 so they made daniel briere the 5 years at 5 million offer last year that was an utter joke insulting and pathetic but they cant give their best offer to orpiks agent did they have anything to lose
1886233 at this point he has accopmplished a sum total of zero in terms of team improvemenmt
1886234 and maybe just maybe he wants to play for an organization and in a town that have a bright future for the sabres and for buffalo all i can see is darkness with flashes of light
1886235 im hoping he wants to stay like paul gaustad and ryan miller and i have no reason to believe otherwise
1886236 i had a brief conversation with him last week and thursday well get to work on that
1886237 for all the talk by fans about miller wanting to leave based on the past fa departures i think theres a significant bond among the guys from those 2003 2005 rochester teams
1886238 d mned if you do d amned if you dont
1886239 although the pirates did win the series if i remember correctly no
1886240 i disagree with you and youre an idiot who doesnt get it
1886241 dont worry these fans will come back at this level trust me they want to believe more than you would believe
1886242 gee whiz those gents down there are downright scrappy with our boys dont you say there rockefeller oh tell me there my good man is that alpo dog food you are regurgitating oh bother dont you know that neutro max is better for you why you say there chap cause its more expensive dont you know
1886243 chad your arrogance ranks second only to your heros in sabre management
1886244 they went 7 games in the ecf in 2006 5 games in 2007 and out of the playoffs in 2008 that is regressing
1886245 and were tough to watch this year how many 3 goal leads can one team blow at home
1886246 this management and ownership is selling you dog food telling you its prime rib and then your asking the rest of us to sit at the table with you
1886247 once again darcy the ditherer sung to the tune of rosie the riveter has lead us to the edge of the cliff and sat down to watch all the excitement going on
1886248 the sky is not falling we still have a lot of young talented players specifically he mentioned afinagenoff which they now would love to trade and he then said and we still have one of the best defenses in the league
1886249 brooks has become a mainstay of our blue line and played an important role in our run to the stanley cup final
1886250 he provides the kind of physical presence you need on a cup contender and his work ethic preparation and determination are second to none
1886251 because you dont have the backbone to ask for better
1886252 the rest of the country thinks you are a joke
1886253 because you lack the courage to go out and get something bettter
1886254 you think that just have a team is good enough
1886255 you are deathly afraid of losing them so you wont stand up for what is right
1886256 born that way and you will probably die that way
1886257 maybe darcy made an offer of afinigenov for crosby and maybe pittsburgh
1886258 being a penguin so far has worked for me i think ill stay put
1886259 ken holland is the smartest dude in the room there is no question that ken holland is the best gm in the nhl with all respect to dave dombrowski he might also be the best gms in all of sports
1886260 the guy just gets it done when the red wings operated like the yankees of the salary cap less nhl holland wielded the little caesars mafia money with impunity whatever mr illitch wanted he got and what he got was cup titles and a long line of legendary players putting on the detroit sweater
1886261 then the landscape of the nhl changed and folks everywhere predicted that the free spending red wings would shrivel up under this new league business plan
1886262 why dont players want to play in buffalo lets hear it the same salary cap is in americas poorest city as it is in buffalo is it a case of poor or poormouth ownership
1886263 players dont want to play in buffalo because they know they wont get long deals for absurd dollars after having proved very little in their careers and or being on the downslope of their production
1886264 ken holland drafts develops and spends wisely darcy the ditherer drafts um and signs vanek
1886265 and cant stay in the playoffs where the money is made
1886266 compare for me the before cap and under the cap on ice results of ken holland and mike illich with that of darcy the ditherer and tom the barefoot billionaire golisano
1886267 darcy regier and the sabres havent been as good as ken holland and the red wings
1886268 but no team has been as good as the red wings
1886269 ken holland is the smartest dude in the room there is no question that ken holland is the best gm in the nhl with all respect to dave dombrowski he might also be the best gms in all of sports the guy just gets it done when the red wings operated like the yankees of the salary cap less nhl holland wielded the little caesars mafia money with impunity whatever mr illitch wanted he got and what he got was cup titles and a long line of legendary players putting on the detroit sweater then the landscape of the nhl changed and folks everywhere predicted that the free spending red wings would shrivel up under this new league business plan but that didnt happen in fact the red wings got stronger people realized that while holland had brought in big names at will he also had built a solid young core of players who were affordable under the salary cap he drafted smartly spent wisely and hired a coach in mike babcock who has done a phenomenal job developing the red wings talent and now hes getting guys like marian hossa to leave a reported 70 million on the table to take a run at a stanley cup and dont rule out holland working something with hossa out long term at an equally reduced price when you have star players making that kind of sacrifice just to come play in detroit you know you got it going on
1886270 i want to sign with the team thats going to pay me the most money
1886271 i want to sign with the team thats going to overpay me to make up for their deficiencies caused most likely by not drafting well or signing other free agents who didnt perform
1886272 yeah i root for them but what have they done for me lately
1886273 fanatical guy with a life sized sabre tooth doll in their closet
1886274 and there is also a cluster of 10 teams in the lower right quadrant representing those 10 teams who spent more than 46 7 million and finished in 12th place or better
1886275 the cluster of 10 teams spending less than 48 6mm that finished 12th or better
1886276 the cluster of 5 teams in the top 10 in spending that finished 19th or worse
1886277 the only logic i can see is that they thought he might be able to give them a quick spark for the last 20 games and see how he fit with the sabres but perhaps now theyre higher on one of their other wingers or saw some issues and decided to part ways
1886278 despite the fact that youve shown that theres no correlation between winning and spending i am sticking to my point that the team is not trying to win because its not spending the most money
1886279 however i would like to trade jobs with you in order to have the amount of time to do said research in the middle of the day on a wednesday
1886280 youve only raised my salary by 4 you cheap bastards
1886281 there are always going to be outliers spicoli thats why they dont use averages in statistics in other words numbnuts averages dont correlate
1886282 dumont was let go and connelly and afinogenov were signed how does that one look
1886283 could we use jay mckee these days you had better believe it
1886284 roy is by far the best signing in recent memory and the only true highlight in darcy favor since the lockout
1886285 if you want the rest of us to honor your management team we will when they tell the whole story and when the 16 75 18 50 is put back in every ticket buyers pocket for every ticket they buy than maybe ill be as positive as some others
1886286 bernier offer sheet from stl 2 5 mil for 1 year gee i wonder if darcy spoke with stl about bernier before unloading him to vancouver
1886287 as for drafting players i think you give darcy way to much credit for this wasnt darcy the one who said after this years draft that he didnt know too much about the players taken in the later rounds that he wqas focusing on the first round that says a lot to me about darcy involvement in draft preparations
1886288 dumont was let go and connelly and afinogenov were signed how does that one look could we use jay mckee these days you had better believe it
1886289 dont bother responding chad your incapable of holding darcys feet to the fire its people like you that keep him in his job despite his sometimes miserable performance
1886290 yeah these guys are just raking their fans over the coals
1886291 i think if you look at things objectively youd have to agree that there have been a lot more bad decisions than good ones
1886292 conversely he did some deals that he now cant get away from now that are killing us
1886293 im sorry but you cant tell me that he is doing his job with relation to fa if the best he can do is patrick lalime come to think of it nobody to show for last year either
1886294 we arent going to do much in free agency were going to try to improve the team through trades
1886295 hell if he gets a pass simply because he doesnt set the budget where can i sign up for a job like that great pay lots of responsibility but no blame thats nirvana man
1886296 the excuses already raised ticket prices this year by more than they increased payroll
1886297 yeah these guys are just raking their fans over the coals
1886298 hey wait a minute our ticket prices have barely moved wonder what their motive is
1886299 the excuses had the 21st highest payroll last year and finished in 18th place
1886300 how much you win depends on how much money you spend
1886301 newsflash whether you approve or disapprove of the sabres ways the only one who truly benefits from darcys penny pinching is golisano
1886302 youve written this article 32 times in a row lets try something different
1886303 youve mentioned brooks orpik in four straight articles youre aware hes never played a game for the sabres in his life right
1886304 chicago was in a similar position and finished near the bottom of the league for years before patrick kane and jonathan toews rejuvenated the fan base last season gm dale tallon admitted he overpaid campbell at 56 8 million over eight years but he also delivered a strong message that the blackhawks were headed in the right direction
1886305 we have one of the best defenses in the league and one of the best goalies
1886306 why dont the sabres spend more money on free agents
1886307 today we have signed marian hossa to a 7 year deal worth 13 million a year
1886308 today we must announce we have raised all ticket prices by 25 to compensate for our off season spending for the 2010 2011 season
1886309 how dare the sabres raise my ticket prices i mean if they want to have fans like other cities is it outrageous for them to raise their ticket prices yes of course it is i mean the ny rangers havent raised ticket prices besides for a marginal amount in 3 seasons
1886310 todaye we have to announce the retirement of darcy regier and also announce his replacement as general manager we found him telling everyone else at devlins deuce on sheridan how much he knows about running a major sports franchise and decided to hire him please welcome the artist formerly known on the buffalo news sabres edge blog buffalo excuses
1886311 news alert the sabres have a poor reputation among players
1886312 not being committed to a quality product and only to the bottom line
1886313 so i guess that means we just have to wait for the glorious day when our group of underpaid youngsters shocks the world by beating the more experienced team full of more experienced players for the stanley cup
1886314 the reputation ought to be that buffalo is a great place for young talent to go make some hay then hit the free agent market for a big pay day
1886315 players who work for them sabres will not be rewarded for their services
1886316 perhaps what this story means is that the gms that jump on day 1 usually end up overpaying and gms who are patient and wait for the
1886317 i know nick lidstrom nick lidstrom is a favorite player of mine you sir campbell are no nick lidstrom
1886318 i envision some teams in the future consisting of 5 players making 9mm each with 15 other guys on entry contracts or veteran minimums
1886319 you news guys just wont let go of the past players
1886320 mckee sabres say no to 4 years 8 mill he gets 4 years 16 mill
1886321 briere sabres say no to 5 years 25 mill he gets 8 years and 52 mill
1886322 drury sabres fumbullll contract at 5 6 for 25 30 he gets 6 for 42 mill
1886323 dumont sabres walk away from arbitration award he gets more money and longer term with nashville
1886324 campbell sabres say no to 5 years 25 mill he gets 7 1 for 8 years
1886325 holy heck now vogl wants to trade max for jay
1886326 the organization started to make the city take note and provide a lot of entertainment and something the fans could hold onto i think thats pretty exciting ive been involved with that especially in buffalo the last couple of years when you get a city behind you things just go up and up
1886327 i would like to see how he would perform if he had an ownership that wanted win it all
1886328 good points about the briere situation there is an arguement that can be made that there were indications it could go that way
1886329 i agree completely with the criticism of the briere drury campbel situation
1886330 the rangers will be paying nearly 33 million to just five players wade redden michal rozsival chris drury scott gomez and henrik lundqvist for the next four years thats a good way to land in salary cap jail

1886551 here is where their logic escapes me on the one hand they say that the hands cant expel people because shoghi effendi relegated this right to himself even though the w amp t says it belongs to the hands the assumption is that since the guardian never gave it back to them they still dont have it even after shoghi effendi dies on the other hand they say that ibc suddenly became activated after the guardians passing even though they insist the guardian himself never did so who activated it then and by what authority we know that the ibc wasnt taking its orders from mason remey besides by their own logic he wouldnt be guardian until after it activated so who then had the authority to activate this ibc or was it in fact never un activated
1886552 to none is given the right to put forth his own opinion or express his particular conviction all must seek guidance and turn unto the center of the cause and the house of justice and he that turneth unto whatsoever else is indeed in grievous error the glory of glories rest upon you

1886560 costumo responder normalmente a quem me pergunta a raz o das minhas viagens que sei muito bem daquilo que fujo e n o aquilo que procuro
1886561 einige bakterien wie etwa das geobacillus stearothermophilus bilden auf ihrer u ersten zellwand so genannte surface layers auch s layers genannt
1886562 dabei handelt es sich um oberfl chenstrukturen aus proteinen die f r die bakterien sehr wichtig sein m ssen da sie bis zu zehn prozent des gesamtproteins ausmachen und mit einem enormen aufwand produziert werden
1886563 bakterien produzieren unter verschiedenen stressbedingungen unterschiedliche s layer proteine die dann charakteristische oberfl chenstrukturen ausbilden
1886564 der wiener biotechnologe uwe sleytr forscht seit mehr als 20 jahren am g stearothermophilus das zum beispiel in hei en quellen unter erh hten temperaturen vorkommt
1886565 was uns an diesem bakterium interessiert hat war vor allem die frage wie die zusammensetzung die assemblierung der s layer proteine funktioniert und wie sie sich gezielt beeinflussen l sst
1886566 offensichtlich haben sich diese proteinschichten die eine zweidimensionale gitter hnliche struktur bilden immer wieder im lauf der evolution ver ndert
1886567 die meisten der so genannten archaebakterien und viele der grampositiven bakterien tun dies jedoch
1886568 da die s layers kein enzym bilden k nnen sie auch nicht durch irgendwelche antibiotika angegriffen werden der angriffspunkt w re hier nur die verhinderung der assemblierung also des zusammenbau dieser proteine
1886569 ein zentraler punkt der untersuchungen ist die frage warum und wie die algen wasserstoff produzieren
1886570 es ist auch das erste mal dass biologen und verfahrenstechniker in kooperation miteinander arbeiten um neue erkenntnisse zu gewinnen
1886571 ziel ist es aus der einzelligen gr nalge chlamydomonas reinhardtii einen industrietauglichen wasserstofflieferanten entwickeln
1886572 wir haben uns f r diese gr nalge deshalb entschieden weil ihr genom bereits sequenziert ist
1886573 unser team will den sprung vom 25 liter fermenter auf den 250 liter fermenter schaffen
1886574 ein knackpunkt beim bau der fermenter ist die ausreichende beleuchtung da die algen zur wasserstoffproduktion licht brauchen
1886575 um all die dazu n tigen informationen zu erhalten m ssen wir mehr erkenntnisse gewinnen
1886576 es gibt machbarkeitsstudien der university of queensland dass bis 2014 2015 fermenter mit einer mio liter errichtet werden
1886577 die vorteile der algen liegen sicher darin dass sie auch deshalb als energielieferanten besonders gut geeignet w ren da sie im gegensatz zu nutzpflanzen kein fruchtbares land ben tigen und somit auch nicht in konkurrenz zur nahrungsmittelproduktion stehen
1886578 obviously i didnt follow in his footsteps but did learn a bit about music appreciation
1886579 i started singing and writing songs about about age 10 i didnt really play guitar till much later in my teens i would audition at coffee houses like the second of autumn and the edge
1886580 i never got a job but learned about acoustic music by hanging out at these places listening to eric andersen chris smither jimmy webb and other great song writers and poet guitar players
1886581 one night we were playing a little joint called j c dobbs on south street kurt loder was in town to review the opening of a world tour by another band called the rolling stones who were playing at jfk stadium that same night after the stones concert kurt stopped into dobbs for a beer i stayed up talking with him till 5 oclock in the morning the next month there was a two page spread in rolling stone magazine pictures and all raving about the band soon after that we were signed to rca records
1886582 charted soon after in more recent years he delved into country forming a band

1886589 should not be given any say in how complaints against lawyers are handled
1886590 the creation of the scottish legal complaints commission will see a transfer of activities of all functions of the scottish legal services ombudsman and some functions of the law society of scotland to the commission
1886591 accordingly staff whose job functions will transfer to the commission will be eligible to transfer with that job function where there are salary differences for employees from the slso and the lss performing the same function at the commission then this is a matter for the commission to address in due course
1886592 this is incorrect and is non compliant with cosop and tupe consideration of appointment to managerial posts and promotion will be a matter for the commission to decide
1886593 staff promotions work content and work practices will be a matter for the commission to decide
1886594 i think you have to bear in mind that there is a complex picture here law society staff do not know everything and we are creating a new organisation with a new culture and a new drive towards resolving complaints swiftly and fairly
1886595 it is not the law society who control the new body we are entirely independent
1886596 the law society doesnt control the court we will win
1886597 punitive apr increaseimposed by credit card issuers as compared to numbers might have been unwittingly used by the netfill gang the most important that i have learned his or her only recourse is the private court system
1886598 the numbers on the surface dont look that bad but when you look at what they are showing the situation is extremely tough for toyota
1886599 would likely pose an enormous financial and reputational risk to the company and the country
1886600 his plan was to shoot anyone who showed up to help
1886601 i think people should maintain an open mind and withhold judgment until the evidence is in
1886602 he stated that the sole purpose of his hiding this equipment was for when a day like this came
1886603 he had nothing to lose and the only power he had in this life was to take
1886604 before exiting the woods he disabled the firearm in a way so that law enforcement could see that the gun was disabled
1886605 winning a major is winning a major whether hes in the field or not
1886606 obviously you want to feel like you beat everyone when they are at the top of their game but thats just not the way this game works whether hes here or not id love to put a major under my belt
1886607 when he comes back hes going to come back firing on all cylinders so wed all better be ready
1886608 id love to put on a good show this week
1886609 it was always very comfortable for me to play in the pga
1886610 this is a great golf course probably the toughest pga course ive ever played
1886611 shots around the greens here you just take a big whack at it try to get out of the rough and land it softly
1886612 management either seems unaware or unwilling to admit the full level of the companys exposure to risky assets
1886613 things are still deteriorating for aigs assets so its really hard to call a bottom at this point
1886614 aside from just the astounding scale of success were pretty tickled by all the freecreditreport com spoofs and parodies on youtube
1886615 it is with some sadness that we make this announcement but also with the desire for certainty that will allow us to move the team and organization forward in the most positive way possible
1886616 i am looking forward to seeing brett favre in a new york jets uniform
1886617 he represents a significant addition to this franchise and reflects our commitment to putting the best possible team on the field
1886618 we just felt like this was an opportunity to go get somebody of bretts stature and what hes accomplished
1886619 we felt it was in the best interest of the team and when the opportunity presented itself we felt it was the right move for us to make and we went ahead and did it
1886620 we had discussions with him and his agent bus cook
1886621 and were going into this and were going to take this one year at a time and were excited to have brett on the team this year
1886622 this is going to be a very promotional challenging back to school season
1886623 with the end of the stimulus checks we know consumers are spending more cautiously and we continue to see a pronounced paycheck cycle at the end of the month
1886624 nimble feet will give you a leg up in any activity that requires quick changes of direction be it backyard toddler chasing or pickup basketball with the guys place eight cones three feet apart in a line and then do three sets of each of the following exercises weave through them at a sprint weave through them while high stepping jump over them with your feet together and weave through them while facing sideways you wont find a better warm up we do it every morning before stepping into the ring
1886625 weights are great but dont underestimate the power of body weight exercises they provide you with a body awareness that you just cant get with plates or dumbbells and that translates into more explosive power in the ring and more agility in the real world unfortunately most guys do body weight exercises incorrectly they focus on reps when they should really be concentrating on time rather than shoot for say three sets of 10 push ups do as many as you can in 30 seconds employ the same strategy with pull ups dips and single leg squats resting for 30 seconds between each set
1886626 along with flexibility and body control balance is an essential component of weight lifting the best way to bolster it is with an overhead squat stand with your feet shoulder width apart and grasp a length of pvc pipe with a grip thats slightly wider than shoulder width hold it eight to 12 inches above your head keeping your chest out torso erect and heels on the ground press the pipe upward as you squat down as far as you can go without arching your back and then rise up do three sets of five to 10 reps start doing it with a barbell when the pvc pipe becomes easy youll strengthen your core hips and shoulders youll also find it challenging to get out of bed the next morning
1886627 when you hit a wall say spending a month at 180 pounds on the bench press dont train harder or attempt to force muscle growth by piling on more weight reduce your load by 10 to 20 pounds in other words if you want to bust out of a rut undertrain for a week or two trust me on this one if one of my athletes is tired sore or just not with it ill reduce his load for a week to 10 days more often than not hell come back better than before and set records because his muscles were able to fully recover and repair themselves
1886628 the game has been designed for a broad audience such that anyone can pick it up and use it regardless of fitness level or time commitment

1886635 i was intrigued with the fact that tb is a disease that can be cured but still the prevalence is high so i wanted to hear the opinions views and challenges from the point of view of those who are infected by it
1886636 soon i realised that a significant number of those that have tb also is hiv positive so the exhibition focus on both diseases
1886637 however when the pictures were ready i realised that they didnt express the real context so i built the environment of a real shack for trapping the audience

1886646 they were unreported cases there was no quantification but of course they dont tell health workers that they had an abortion

1886683 in fact there is little to commend nclb this federal effort to micromanage the nations classrooms has not worked the test scores in states are increasing but gains on the federally sponsored national examinations called the national assessment of education progress have not kept pace with the scores reported by the states an examination of naep trends shows that achievement in reading and math increased faster before nclb was passed than in the years since it was adopted
1886684 most states nclb tests focus on basic memorization and computation not the kinds of rich problem solving and cultural competency skills that seem more likely to boost students fortunes in a globalized economy moreover the tests are administered as summative snapshots and largely de contextualized we cannot readily see the challenges students bring with them to school because of poverty or disability nor can we readily measure significant progress improving their achievement the only thing really under schools control and therefore the most important accountability measure
1886685 what we need is a federal education law to help poor and minority children get a well rounded education that includes the arts and physical fitness emphasizes critical thinking and teaches the value of active citizenship instead nclb slammed the schoolhouse door on much of what makes up modern civilization and replaced it with multiple choice questions

1886821 dr james spencer vice chairman of the department of dermatology at mount sinai hospital in new york said it is worse to tan a little bit each day than it is to get an infrequent sunburn both can seriously damage the skin he said but the small day to day exposure is worse for skin in the long run

1886884 you know one of the things that obviously the people involved in the democracy movement have got to think through is how do you get from here to there in other words its not easy to go from a very fierce military one man rule to democracy
1886885 they have proved theyre not interested in democracy if theyre interested in democracy theyd let the prisoners out of prison for starters the political prisoners would be a given to chance to leave and live in a free life

1886895 the leading important factor for the asean to continue to achieve successes in the new stage is that the association should promote concerted efforts to ensure a peaceful stable and cooperative environment in the region on the basis of the goals and basic principles set by the asean in the treaty of amity and cooperation tac and the asean charter
1886896 member countries should continue to do their utmost to strengthen the association unity increase friendship and the sense of community promote cooperation and solve all differences by peaceful measures
1886897 meanwhile the asean should continue to play the leading role in regional matters actively accelerate the process of negotiation and cooperation in the region create opportunities for external partners to take part in and contribute to handling challenges to peace security and development in southeast asia and the asia pacific region
1886898 this requires each member country to make a strong political commitment to the asean linkage process and the asean family further harmonising national interests with that of the whole asean region for a common goal of the association
1886899 asean should take practical measures to quickly narrow the existing development gap between its member countries particularly between the old and new members through the efficient implementation of the asean linkage initiatives
1886900 the charter will bring about a reform in the organisation apparatus and mode of operation of the association helping improve the quality and efficiency of cooperation between member countries

1886955 the coalition believes it is imperative to move for impeachment against general musharraf

1887037 we could have afforded the same type of wedding in d c
1887038 you can stretch a dollar here much farther than in other places go to charlotte or philly and try to put on a wedding for 250 people
1887039 you wouldnt want to get married in d c in the summertime buffalos beautiful especially in the summer
1887040 its an entirely different feeling there thats one of the things i love about it
1887041 it is with some sadness that we make this announcement but also with the desire for certainty that will allow us to move the team and organization forward in the most positive way possible
1887042 i am looking forward to seeing brett favre in a new york jets uniform
1887043 he represents a significant addition to this franchise and reflects our commitment to putting the best possible team on the field
1887044 we just felt like this was an opportunity to go get somebody of bretts stature and what hes accomplished
1887045 we felt it was in the best interest of the team and when the opportunity presented itself we felt it was the right move for us to make and we went ahead and did it
1887046 we had discussions with him and his agent bus cook
1887047 and were going into this and were going to take this one year at a time and were excited to have brett on the team this year
1887048 i have all the respect in the world for chad as a person as a player weve accomplished a lot of good things with chad he gave his heart and soul to this organization for a long long time i really appreciate everything hes done
1887049 hopefully we can get something resolved ive been saying that for quite a while now i dont want to say were running out of time but i need to get into a camp somewhere
1887050 the train has left the station whatever analogy you want
1887051 he needs to jump on the train and lets go or if we cant get past things that have happened i have to keep the train moving
1887052 the players want resolution they want what everybody wants to come out here every day and talk about somebody that is not here and then shows up its gone on too long and understandably so they want to play football
1887053 if i play well hopefully ill get a shot at the main camp
1887054 if something comes up with minnesota or anything like that i will explore other options but right now ill be going back to erie i cant tell how its going to pan out right now
1887055 the things that the city has given me and that have panned out from choosing to come play here are endless im forever thankful to the city

1887059 la mayor a de los asuntos que lleva la procuradur a general de la rep blica pgr a los juzgados son delitos cometidos en flagrancia lo que no implica mayor esfuerzo en la integraci n de la averiguaci n previa donde se le complican las cosas es en los casos que no hay flagrancia y requieren de una investigaci n de primer orden es ah donde al final se le caen los asuntos a los fiscales
1887060 no est suficientemente reglamentado en el c digo federal de procedimientos penales que los procesos efectivamente duren un a o como lo establece la constituci n
1887061 eso se ha convertido hoy en un mecanismo de los abogados por alargar los juicios lo m s que se pueda y hacerlos caer con el paso del tiempo en la irrelevancia
1887062 al juzgador se le debe dotar de armas suficientes en la ley a efecto de evitar esas situaciones
1887063 si la oportunidad de defensa de un inculpado hace que el procedimiento se alargue pues ni modo es preferible tener la oportunidad de defensa a que el juicio se resuelva sin dar oportunidad de probar
1887064 el exceso de casos en cada juzgado nos impide ser r pidos

1887072 in order to address climate change all major economies must be at the table
1887073 this is an enormous movement for a man who questioned the science on global warming who was opposed to international treaties and who was opposed to international targets

1887077 we are unaware of any sugar buyer in this country who is having trouble finding sugar

1887087 we appreciate the tremendous passion shown by our fans we like them always will see brett favre as a green bay packer and our respect for him never will change moving forward we are dedicated to delivering a successful 2008 season for all packers fans

1887089 and moses took the rod of god in his hands
1887090 so moses and aaron went in to pharaoh and they did so just as the lord commanded and aaron cast down his rod before pharaoh and before his servants and it became a serpent
1887091 but pharaoh also called the wise men and the sorcerers so the magicians of egypt for every an threw down his rod and they became serpents
1887092 so the lord sent fiery serpents among the people and they bit the people and many of the people of israel died
1887093 then the lord said to moses make a fiery serpent and set it on a pole and it shall be that everyone who is bitten when he looks at it shall live
1887094 for this purpose was the son of god manifested that he might destroy the works of the devil

1887611 the creation of this partnership is a landmark in the history of medical research in the uk and particularly relevant in the 60th anniversary year of the nhs

1887615 labor markets have softened further and financial markets remain under considerable stress tight credit conditions the ongoing housing contraction and elevated energy prices are likely to weigh on economic growth over the next few quarters
1887616 we expect that there will be no further moves in ecb interest rates for some time as the euro zone economy stagnates over the coming quarters interest rates are set to remain on hold for the foreseeable future and the next move is likely to be down
1887617 first half results should be solid especially in the context of the challenged media sector but expectations for upgrades may be overdone

1887623 the discovery of a potential new antibiotic is an exciting advance it could mean a possible novel treatment for people with chronic wounds that are infected with mrsa or other bugs by developing the pure antibiotic into a formula such as a cream it could reduce the contact patients need to have with live maggots to heal wounds it could also offer a potential treatment such as an injection or pill for internal infections like c difficile
1887624 it has been a huge team effort to get to this level and i am delighted with our progress however there is more to do if we are to realise the maximum benefits from this discovery
1887625 maggots are great little multi taskers they produce enzymes that clean wounds they make a wound more alkaline which may slow bacterial growth and finally they produce a range of antibacterial chemicals that stop the bacteria growing
1887626 theyre not going to be moving fast so you have to be patient

1887630 provisions to stem foreclosures are helpful but a greater lift to the economy should come from higher mortgage limits enhancements to the fha loan program and the first time home buyer tax credit
1887631 these are excellent tools that will help buyers get into the market to take advantage of the unprecedented drop in home prices in many areas as well as a wide selection of inventory to make an investment in their future
1887632 buyers entering the hardest hit markets in some cases with multiple bid offers may have put a floor on prices
1887633 in addition rising commodity prices and higher construction costs have resulted in a very unusual market today with existing home prices being less than replacement building costs in some areas
1887634 a large portion of this is due to the extension of unemployment insurance benefits and thus does not necessarily suggest a severe loosening in the labor market
1887635 interactions of s aureus with fibronectin were first reported more than 30 years ago and yet we still dont understand precisely how and why the bacteria target this human protein

1887674 im not going to bug you about this if you think its shit then stop reading it and we dont ever have to talk about it again
1887675 the way you perceive cats is the way theyre going to act
1887676 if you treat them like spoiled babies thats what theyll be like but if you have the mentality that they are intelligent and loyal friends thats exactly what they will be
1887677 you only want to work with two cats at a time
1887678 they are so individualized they are just like people that way
1887679 some cats like wet treats some like hard you need to find out what your cat will respond to the best
1887680 then you can start to deter them from where you dont want them to scratch
1887681 i do not recommend throwing a can full of coins or using a water spray bottle because while people think their cat is not going to relate it to them doing it cats are too smart for that
1887682 wash the litterbox often at least once a week in soap and water
1887683 if its dirty your cats not going to want to use it

1887686 sandra please its a secret if sr lina call at home me and francesca are sleeping
1887687 and if one of my kids are attacked by a wolf i will hold him responsible
1887688 in fact i always counsel my own friends not to do it and i think i have stopped a bunch of them from having abortions
1887689 but its not a good time for me right now i already have two kids ive got my boy and my girl and i am getting ready to graduate in march and i am guaranteed a job a baby just doesnt fit in i know its wrong i know its against what my mother taught me but i just cant have another one and besides today i was going to get a new puppy abortion is the only way for me
1887690 it all makes perfect sense til we get to the part where you are going to ignore your own good judgment act opposite of what you advise your friends to do reject your mothers teaching and pay 400 00 for something you dont believe in
1887691 did anyone ever tell you that you have a way of just telling it like it is
1887692 you know sometimes i dont understand myself here i am with a good future ahead of me a guaranteed job with benefits a good car a mom that helps me a husband and a nice apartment and i almost killed my child for what what was i thinking

1887696 parliament has decided to adopt the standard uk employment policy of a normal retirement age of 65 for all employees according to our records you have reached the age of 65 and this letter provides you with formal notification that we intend to retire you on 2nd march 2009
1887697 if you wish to request to continue working you must do so in writing no earlier than six months and no later than three months before your retirement date on 2nd march 2009 i must advise you that it is our policy to refuse these requests
1887698 we will contact you again shortly to discuss your retirement plans
1887699 winston churchill announced the end of world war two at 70 and nelson mandela was south africas first black president at 77 fortunately for them and the many others they helped they werent forced to retire at 65
1887700 today with people living longer than ever before the current rationale for continuing to enforce a default retirement age when people reach 65 is completely archaic
1887701 the contribution which many great people have made to society would not have happened if theyd been forced to take retirement when they reached 65 and they are not alone every year thousands of people over 65 make huge contributions to the uks economy and heritage yet despite being capable of continuing in work many more individuals are involuntarily retired at 65
1887702 the efa is working with a growing number of employers who are operating very successfully without a fixed retirement age and is encouraging other members to follow suit we firmly believe that it is inevitable that the default retirement age will be removed altogether whatever the outcome of the heyday challenge
1887703 saebyuk yoona is like a daughter to me dont treat her like that
1887704 i am looking forward to seeing brett favre in a new york jets uniform he represents a significant addition to this franchise and reflects our commitment to putting the best possible team on the field mike tannenbaum and his football administration staff did a great job of navigating this complex process i am excited about welcoming brett deanna and their family to the jets organization
1887705 we are really happy to have him for the season and we will move forward from there
1887706 i have all the respect in the world for chad as a person and a player
1887707 he gave his heart and soul to this organization for a long long time
1887708 i feel good about training camp i feel like i came in here with a purpose and i am concentrating on that purpose every day
1887709 i will pick something out each day to really come out here and focus on individually to get better at and add that to the rest of my game so i can become a more complete quarterback
1887710 my gut feeling for a long time i just didnt think was going to come to fruition
1887711 then it really heated up recently and i just think organizationally the only part of the process we control is preparation and we had a lot of great preparation so if and when that opportunity presented itself we were ready to roll and when it did we moved quick
1887712 hes coming to a new city hes been in one system for 16 years

1887728 oh you young people do not be deceived by the heroes of the internet the leaders of the microphones who are launching statements inciting the youth while living under the protection of intelligence services or of a tribe or in a distant cave or under political asylum in an infidel country they have thrown many others before you into the infernos graves and prisons those who have triggered clashes and pressed their brothers into unequal military confrontations are specialists neither in fatwas nor in military affairs
1887729 i think theres a lack of communication and i think that until we get this individual involvement from politicians and ministers and other people to come down and in this safe space have a critical dialogue were going to get young people who are going to try to vent their frustration elsewhere

1887739 i dont really get why bitchy jones is the de facto standard of what a dominant woman is she is just one person writing about fucking her stable why not just live and let live
1887740 her ranting style detracts from any serious points that she may be trying to make it all sounds like sour grapes to me
1887741 it is rather frustrating when she is being discussed on tv as having such an influential and well read blog and yet has such narrow minded opinions
1887742 i do not think that bj is a dominant i do not think that bj is a woman and it really does not matter to me whatever bjs blog might have been worth has disappeared over the term of the blog it has devolved the same way that the news media has it is all about attention and shock bj is just another sanctimonious attention whore
1887743 im not particularly impressed by anything shes written but to each their own im sure there are guys wanking to it at this moment
1887744 personally i find bitchy jones more annoying than elise sutton
1887745 i could have agreed with and even sympathized with bitchy jones had she just refrained from the cheap shots and the insinuations that attractive pro dommes are fake undominant money grubbing bimbos
1887746 her rants about the word domme strap ons and feminization are just annoying
1887747 the profanity while plenty gratuitous lacks any sense of appreciation for the art
1887748 im not up in her business telling her shes not a real dominant because shes not hot so why is she trying to say that people like me who are attractive pro dommes are just a male manufactured joke
1887749 ill shut this damn thread down if this stupid bitchy jones shit gets started again lol the name alone screams koo koo

1887777 sebagai penunjang hukum administrasi berlakunya ketentuan hukum pidana tetap memperhatikan asas subsidiaritas yaitu bahwa hukum pidana hendaknya didayagunakan apabila sanksi bidang hukum lain seperti sanksi administrasi dan saksi perdata dan alternatif penyelesaian sengketa lingkungan hidup tidak efektif dan atau tingkat kesalahan pelaku relatif berat dan atau akibat perbuatannya relatif besar dan atau perbuatannya menimbulkan keresahan masyarakat dengan mengantisipasi kemungkinan semakin munculnya tindak pidana yang dilakukan oleh suatu korporasi dalam undang undang ini diatur pula pertanggungjawaban korporasi

1887791 with self organisation you have very simple rules governing individual units that together perform a bigger task a typical example is ant colonies
1887792 its a very economical solution especially for problems that are very dynamic anything you can do with self organisation is basically a free lunch

1887818 there needs to be a negative mccain track beyond the bush policy stuff one of the great strengths of the obama campaign has been to not listen to the d c chattering class they have a plan and they stick to it but clearly the d c chattering class are all wringing their hands

1887835 newnham college cambridge is an extraordinary institution with a distinguished tradition of womens education and many achievements in the field of literature with sylvia plath iris murdoch a s byatt margaret drabble katharine whitehorn claire tomalin and ali smith among our alumnae we have much to celebrate in womens writing university of cambridge we are building on this heritage to expand our literary archive and develop a programme of events that will raise funds to support and enrich the current teaching of english a subject which remains a key priority for the college so we are delighted to invite you to take part in a unique series of private events celebrating a key moment in womens education and womens writing virginia woolfs visit to cambridge and the lectures she gave there which formed the basis of her influential book the iconic table in october 1928 virginia woolf was invited to luncheon in dadie rylands one of its fellows and a friend of various members of the bloomsbury group the other guests belonged to the apostles a cambridge society to which dadie had been elected on the recommendation of john maynard keynes dadie bequeathed the table at which he and virginia dined to the charleston trust which has generously offered us the chance to showcase it for the next five years thanks to the generosity of one of our alumnae the original eight chairs have now also been restored and are back round the table for the first time since they were left to charleston the table and chairs are now situated in one of our private rooms although these are museum pieces the table remains exactly as it was the original rings created by the wine glasses used by the apostles evoke a wonderful sense of history which we are thrilled to be able to share with our invitees a room of ones own is a partly fictionalised account of woolfs visit to cambridge luncheon in dadies rooms began with soles sunk in a deep dish spread with the whitest cream the effect was to light half way down the spine which is the seat of the soul not that little electric light which we call brilliance but the more profound subtle and subterranean glow which is the rich yellow flame of rational intercourse course follows course whilst wine flows college silver sparkles and servants abound intellectual discussion and debate fill the afternoon in the luxurious surroundings of kings college a sense of well being is generated in woolf but as she leaves this privileged and male dominated environment from which she as a woman is excluded she feels that world closing behind her gate after gate seemed to close with gentle finality behind me innumerable beadles were fitting innumerable keys into well oiled locks the treasure house was made secure for another night as a woman unaccompanied by an exclusively male member of the university she is refused admittance to the university library and gets into trouble for walking on a hallowed kings college lawn it is still forbidden to walk on the grass in most cambridge colleges today as dusk draws in woolf walks down to the road to a very different college a womens college fernham her fictive hybrid of newnham and girton there she notices a student race across the grass with no one to stop her and dinner whilst nourishing is plain she is given broth and water no wine woolf used the contrast between the two meals as a metaphor for the difference in the funding of men and womens education asking what were our mothers thinking of that they had so little wealth to leave us she concludes that a woman needs a room of her own if she is to be able to intellectualise write expand her education and develop her ideas newnham where you can still race across the grass remains one of two all female undergraduate colleges at the heart of the university of cambridge founded in 1871 the colleges statutes enshrine a progressive commitment to freedom of thought fairness outstanding education learning and research ideals as relevant now as they were then the college takes pride in continuing to break down barriers and seeks to ensure that the education we provide can be available to all regardless of background or circumstances exclusive events we are delighted to offer two opportunities each year to host an exclusive and intimate event based round dadie rylands table in one of the colleges private rooms previously used by a senior member our name for fellows with lovely large windows overlooking the gardens among the most beautiful in cambridge we propose that eight guests sit round the table and sip champagne whilst listening to an eminent scholar speak on some aspect of woolf bloomsbury or womens writing and education the format of each event can be tailored to the hosts request but the college head chef has devised a modern menu to reflect the food served in kings eighty years ago and a full wine list is available for discussion with the high table steward woolf would be pleased to see that newnham now has its own college silver which will of course be used and each guest will receive a copy of as a memento of the evening with a formal place setting eight guests would be unable to dine comfortably on the table itself and this would also involve the table being covered for protection which would be a pity so we propose that following pre dinner drinks guests move to a larger table in the same room to enjoy their meal at leisure whilst being able to talk informally with the chosen speaker if a larger event were required we would propose that a maximum of 20 guests have pre dinner drinks round the table during the talk with dinner served in either college hall or our new modern room the lucia windsor room we are of course flexible and will try to meet the requirements of the host as to subject matter and speakers but have connections with a number of eminent cambridge and other writers and lecturers including our graduate tutor dr pam hirsch a seasoned speaker on both radio and television who lectures on omega and after bloomsbury and the decorative arts who met many surviving members of the bloomsbury group including dadie rylands and spent a few weeks living at charleston the sussex home of vanessa bell and duncan grant fund raising our english students are incredibly excited to have such an inspirational and iconic artefact housed in college and it is entirely appropriate that they should benefit from this wonderful loan we therefore intend to apply funds raised to support teaching in english oxford and cambridge have a unique system of small group tuition supervisions which we are determined to preserve this involves college teaching fellows in intensive teaching college teaching fellows are appointed initially on a five year contract which costs 225 000 for five years to endow a position in perpetuity costs 1 125 000 we are delighted to announce that we have received a gift of 25 000 to pump prime this initiative and are now at the first stages of fundraising to build from this excellent start to host dinner for eight we propose a minimum donation of 5 000 or 10 000 for the larger event of up to twenty if however a donor was interested in naming the college teaching post either for the 5 year period or in perpetuity we will of course be delighted to discuss an additional donation to secure this recognition we believe this will be a unique opportunity to host an exclusive event in very special surroundings whilst contributing to the costs of a key priority for the continued tradition of newnham should you wish to take part we are sure that your support for womens education especially in the study of literature would be applauded by virginia woolf whose spirit surely inhabits both newnham and dadie rylands iconic table we very much hope that you will be interested in talking to us

1887856 it had long been realized that the only secure basis for collectivism wealth and privilege are most easily defended when they are possessed jointly the so called abolition of private property meant in effect the concentration of property in far fewer hands than before with the result forseen and intended beforehand that economic inequality has been made permanent

1887865 through marker assisted selection we have determined the precise segments of the sorghum genome known to confer striga resistance and have transferred them to farmer preferred varieties through conventional breeding with very promising results
1887866 we had to make sure that other genetic information from n13 was not transferred to farmer varieties alongside the qualitative trait loci with striga resistance we were not replacing any genetic components of farmer varieties we are just adding to it
1887867 the resulting variety is almost identical to the original farmer variety plus the component that confers icrisat has been collaborating with scientists from the university of hohenheim in germany and national agricultural research institutes of eritrea kenya mali and sudan

1888106 the settlements are illegal and the european policy has not changed to invite the representatives of settlements to parties i think the british government should answer this question
1888107 in a way its very important for us to hear from them whats going on in the settlements
1888108 weakening in the governments long held position that settlements were illegal and an obstacle to peace entertaining the pioneers of this colonization movement has given the strong impression that britain tacitly endorses it or no longer objects to it
1888109 peace will not be achieved by shrinking or weakening israel nor could it be reached through creating an artificial foreign state on jewish land in truth the oslo process and the expulsion of jews from gaza only drove the jewish and arab peoples further apart peace will only be possible when the indigenous jews and the local arabs come together on the grassroots level and genuinely try to understand one another the western powers need to stop pushing their neo colonialist agenda in the middle east and leave both native populations alone
1888110 the ceasefire may be good for the people of gaza but not for us
1888111 its fine with the israelis for hamas to remain strong in gaza because it means that no one forces them to seriously negotiate a peace plan
1888112 the judge believed it was enough the period that he served in prison
1888113 i was crying after i heard it the grave of my son is still fresh the pain is terrible yet despite this i cannot but think all the time about aviva shalit gilads mother who needs to cope with oh so humanitarian israeli gestures while her own son is held in cellars of horror
1888114 despite knowing that rivka had already been in prison for three months and that the sentence was only two months
1888115 judge sent rivka meirchik to jail for another month deeming her refusal to cooperate with the police an idealogical crime this represents a most bizarre statement absent of any legal or judicial authority but rather a statement lacking judicial acumen frought with political overtones
1888116 this cruel and unusual punishment before any indictment may have been brought about because she refused to cooperate with the police again it is apparent that the kfar saba magistrates court judges are ill equipped to understand a basic concept embedded in democratic societies namely the right against self incrimination if there is an allegation of a commission of a crime it is for the prosecution to bring all evidence against the alleged offender the alleged offender does not have to cooperate in the process
1888117 unequivocally opening the rafiah crossing and the crossing of palestinians into egypt is conditional on the release of gilad shalit
1888118 the opening of the rafiah crossing must be linked to gilad shalit and if it is opened this must be done in coordination with palestinian authority forces in a manner that prevents the strengthening of hamas
1888119 ariel sharon tzipi livni and shaul mofaz said that this would be a new party with new ethics
1888120 what we are seeing today is that kadima is becoming the most corrupt party in israel
1888121 the members of kadima who are joining today come from union workers from arab villages and you see a situation for example in the village of arara an arab village in the north nobody voted for kadima there and all of a sudden you have hundreds of arab members joining kadima today supporting mofaz
1888122 in kadima the way people join the party is corrupted
1888123 in the likud for example you have to be a member for 15 months in order to vote you can pay only with a credit card or through your bank in kadima you pay nis 50 you can pay with a check and its for life and all of a sudden you see a big organization ministries unions cities mayors forcing their employees to join kadima now there are 10 or 15 thousand people who joined kadima originally out of ideology and all the rest of it comes from people who were forced or encouraged by their union to join this party
1888124 migron a communal town was founded on the 19th of adar 5762 march 3 2002 despite difficulties out of the belief in the eternity of israel the force that drives us is the knowledge that the unity of nation faith and land brings peace and redemption welcome
1888125 relocation is just another word for destruction this is a thriving community which has received help from many different government bodies and there is no reason or justification to destroy it the fact that peace now went to the supreme court against us first of all we have plenty of legal claims as well involving forging of documents and our documentation of our purchase of properties here yet the supreme court dismissed us
1888126 that it is quite unheard of that peace now went to the supreme court with this property disputes are supposed to be judged in local courts not the countrys highest it must be that peace now knew what it was doing when it went directly to the supreme court and this was proven correct
1888127 there are hundreds of homes there and peace now has already begun claiming that they were built on private arab land if the government wants to solve this problem as it has over the course of decades it can
1888128 our tartans can be worn by anybody linked to judaism or israel so we expect interest from expats and jewish people in scotland
1888129 the blue and white represent the colors of the israeli and scottish flags with the central gold line representing the gold from the biblical tabernacle the ark of the covenant and the many ceremonial vessels the silver is from the decorations adorning our torah scrolls and the red represents the wine we use for kiddush
1888130 scotland has a rich tapestry of culture and history rabbi jacobs said noting that the first jewish resident of edinburgh was recorded in 1691
1888131 i think this is a wonderful idea i think it is innovative and novel its more than likely that ill get a kilt myself
1888132 the united states and united kingdom are felt by some to be moving quickly in the direction of a police state with compulsory vaccinations id cards continuous surveillance and long term detainment without trial having been either introduced or seriously discussed by the government
1888133 is america a police state my answer is maybe not yet but it is fast approaching
1888134 people with self respect have the courage of their mistakes they know the price of things if they choose to commit adultery they do not then go running in an access of bad conscience to receive absolution from the wronged parties nor do they complain unduly of the unfairness the undeserved embarrassment of being named co respondent in brief people with self respect exhibit a certain toughness a kind of moral nerve they display what was once called character a quality which although approved in the abstract sometimes loses ground to other more instantly negotiable virtues character the willingness to accept responsibility for ones own life is the source from which self respect springs self respect is something that our grandparents whether or not they had it knew all about they had it instilled in them young a certain discipline the sense that one lives by doing things one does not particularly want to do by putting fears and doubts to one side by weighing immediate comforts against the possibility of larger even intangible comforts people who respect themselves are willing to accept the risk that the liason may not turn out to be the one in which every day is a holiday because youre married to me they are willing to invest something of themselves they may not play at all but when they do play they know the odds to have that sense of ones instrinsic worth which constitutes self respect is potentially to have everything the ability to discriminate to love and to remain indifferent
1888135 to lack self respect is to be locked within oneself paradoxically incapable of either love or indifference if we do not respect ourselves we are on the one hand forced to despise those who have so few resources as to consort with us so little perception as to remain blind to our fatal weaknesses on the other we are particularly in thrall to everyone we see curiously determined to live out since our self image is untenable their false notions of us it is the phenomenon sometimes called alienation from self without self respect one eventually discovers the final turn of the screw one runs away to find oneself and finds no one at home

1888139 to present your bodies as a living sacrifice holy and acceptable to god
1888140 since god loved us so much we also ought to love one another no one has ever seen god if we love one another god lives in us and his love is perfected in us
1888141 its half assed half baked right wing politicians bending over for the religious right just because they scream louder than those of us who actually value our civil liberties
1888142 to publicly repudiate these comments that call into question antiwar soldiers service and sacrifice and ask mr limbaugh to apologize for his comments
1888143 now he chavalia gets to get back on with his life
1888144 im not saying he went up there to kill her
1888145 he couldnt tell tarika had a child in her arms
1888146 they confirmed what our sense was and our belief was in this
1888147 its another example that theres very low value on black lives in this community

1888160 in the years before 2008 less than half the investment budget was spent because of the security issue
1888161 some ministries have projects in unsecured areas or disputed areas or not yet ready areas
1888162 moreover the local governments and the provincial councils lack experience needed to implement many projects
1888163 i think the main reason is the lack of big projects and the absence of big companies another issue which keeps iraq backward is administrational corruption iraq must overcome corruption to progress
1888164 i think its absurd that were paying for the reconstruction in a country when right at the beginning of the war the bush administration assured the american people that iraqs reconstruction would be paid for by iraq and through its oil revenues
1888165 inexcusable for u s taxpayers to continue to foot the bill for projects the iraqis are fully capable of funding themselves
1888166 i imagine a lot of teens having fun thinking of naughty things to say er show with zlangos service

1888168 well zlangos hell of a lot of fun im a sucker for things like this it allows me to waste a huge amount of time and not feel too guilty after all i can get my sentence sent as a e card or just straight off as an email
1888169 zlango a web company founded on the notion that a picture is worth a thousand words has created three adorable earth day e cards that the readers of thedailygreen can send to their friends and relatives and local politicians for free

1888190 many members of baptist churches know no reason for being baptist except that the baptist church is the closest or the one with the most comfortable worship style or the one with the best youth program for their kids
1888191 importance of historic baptist distinctives such as soul competency the priesthood of every believer and separation of church and state is the responsibility of the free and faithful baptists
1888192 we havent really proved anything about whether this system is going to work
1888193 trials by military commission demonstrate that the united states is committed to holding dangerous terror suspects accountable for their actions
1888194 this is a system unmoored by standard constitutional principles of what constitutes a fair trial in the united states
1888195 this process demonstrated that military commissions can effectively bring very dangerous terrorists to justice
1888196 la funci n que han desarrollado los voluntarios nunca se podr llegar a agradecer lo suficiente es como una paradoja quien tiene los medios que son las instituciones est n en la mayor a de loscasos totalmente al margen y sin embargo ves como gente an nima en su tiempo libre con sus propios medios dedica tanto esfuerzo a ayudarnos

1888211 lincoln highway was the first major highway developed in 1915 during the 30s and the 40s it became highway 30 and then when eisenhower promoted the interstate highway system it became interstate 80

1888265 yes my coach was kind enough to come and see me in lisbon a few days ago which i think is common knowledge it was a very honest conversation between two people that respect one other and that im sure share a mutual affection and friendship what we said to each other will remain private sir alex listened to me i listened to him and we established that the best for both sides would be for me to continue at old trafford so i can confirm that ill be playing for manchester united next season and before there are any rumours about me staying against my will i want to make one thing clear whoever says or writes anything to that effect is lying ill be playing at united with my heart and soul i will fight and honour the shirt with the same desire and dedication as i always have
1888266 i want to say that i was the one that was responsible for all this controversy it wasnt their fault because it was me that said publicly that i wanted to move to real madrid it was also me although wholly unintentionally that caused the friction between the two clubs
1888267 i knew that real madrid were interested in signing me and that they had allegedly made a very substantial offer to united for a while i wanted manchester to accept the offer and for me to move to madrid if i denied it i would be deceiving everyone including myself anyone who knows me knows that it would have to be something very important for me to admit such a thing if theres one thing ive never been nor do i ever want to be it is ungrateful manchester united from the glazer family the directors namely david gill to the coaches team mates and backroom staff is a club that will always be dear to my heart whatever happens in the future that will never change im very aware of what this club has done for me and ill be eternally grateful come what may but it was because of this because i knew this club was different and extraordinarily human that i hoped that my wishes and my reasons would be understood
1888268 after wed won the champions league i felt that in five years i had helped win everything there was to win wed won the premier league twice and id won a host of individual awards including the best goalscorer in the premier league champions league and in europe so i felt that maybe i needed a new challenge i never hid the fact that i wanted to play in spain at real madrid in particular and i thought this could be the right moment united and real are probably the two biggest clubs in the world and it would never be an easy decision to make apart from the challenge everyone realises that spanish and portuguese culture and lifestyle are more similar those were the reasons that made me consider the change
1888269 im aware that whatever the circumstances there will always be
1888270 apart from the reasons ive just given i also have to recognise that my family would welcome the change the chance of being an hours flight from my mother and the rest of my family was very attractive even more so playing for a club like real madrid i know i have to deal with these circumstances even though its difficult sometimes but its harder to ask the same of the people i love the most the best proof of what ive just said is the fact that ive just made a major investment in a house in manchester even though i didnt have to i did it not just for my own comfort but also for those closest to me the people at united particularly the manager understood my reasons but we all eventually concluded that i should continue to wear that number 7 shirt its no sacrifice for me its a great honour i have important things to win in england i will give everything i have to united i want to defend the european cup and help united become world champions not forgetting the league and other cups
1888271 no to be honest its possible but i hope it doesnt happen i know im a good professional i know that no ones harder on me than myself and thats never going to change under any circumstances the high point of my career was winning the champions league no one will ever erase that from my memory in the same way that no one will ever erase the fact that i did it in a united shirt what i said publicly which was maybe a little naive i take total responsibility for people have to understand one thing at the age of 18 i arrived at a dream club like united it was a dream come true but even at that moment i was thinking about playing in england for some years and then going to play in spain even at that time i was thinking that way and i always gave 100 everything why lie im not going to be a hypocrite and say the opposite of what i think like some others do i said exactly what i thought i have a dream of playing at real and i thought it was time to move on people cant be upset about me fulfilling a childhood dream
1888272 im very aware of what this club has done for me ill be forever grateful united and its fans can be sure that ill never forget them no matter what happens theyre special and theyll always have a place here puts hand on heart in fact i confess that one of the reasons i had the courage to say what i did was the fact that united would be fairly compensated the figure mentioned which would be a world record would serve as some compensation for the debt of gratitude that i owe the club as least in material terms im going to say something here that ive never told anybody if we hadnt been european champions i probably wouldnt have even thought about going to madrid and there is something else that should be mentioned i never wanted to leave against uniteds will when they turned down the offer the people at united made it very clear how much they wanted me i didnt fully understand it at the time but now i can really appreciate it
1888273 that makes no sense nor do i believe thats what he meant as he himself has already stated my comment was about something else i was saying that players should be where they feel happy nothing more
1888274 believe me it makes me proud to know how much he thinks of me
1888275 at the time jorge mendes explained that united also wanted me and that sir alex ferguson had told him that he would be very careful with my playing career so i would play at least 50 of the games in the first season which is what happened this shows that i also chose united and that money wasnt the deciding factor alongside my agent mendes sir alex ferguson has been the most important person ive ever known in my career because of this because of the special relationship that exists between us i know that hell understand that there are times when a father has to worry only about whats best for his child
1888276 theres no point in making predictions its not worth speculating because nothing is set in stone and things change all the time in football today there are opportunities that no one knows if they will come round again in the future there are only two certainties ill be playing at united a club im proud to represent real madrid will continue to be a great club without me and i will continue to admire them as i have done since i was a boy im saying what i think and i hope that all the speculation will stop the press has written some terrible things about me and about this whole thing theyve invented a thousand and one things and thats one of the reasons why i decided to talk about this now you can be sure of one thing everything ive said comes from the bottom of my heart and is the only truth
1888277 im 100 professional and ive always given my heart and soul to this club i even played a major part of the season injured which was verified by my operation i played in excruciating pain while taking anti inflammatory medication every day and id do it again if necessary this club deserves it because the united staff and the fans are fantastic not forgetting the affection and respect i have for sir alex ferguson if one day i leave the club i want to do it knowing that i did everything i could to help the club win as much as possible if that happens ill leave with the feeling of having done my duty to the maximum

1888452 everybody should come if you see somebody outside the conference rooms during my session tell them to run because theyre missing out
1888453 ill buy that for a dollar so ben why should they come to your session
1888454 ick to learn how to build frameworks not just how to use existing frameworks or an overview of age old patterns but how to solve specific problems or add functionality to flex in a clean and reusable way
1888455 thats cool thats a huge plus i may have to sneak away to sit in on that one
1888456 i really hope that people walk away from my session with a new approach to flex development the session will be a little like philosophy class for developers but im also trying to take all those lofty architectural ideas and bring them down to some real world code examples when you manage to decouple code from the application and simplify it enough to be idealistic and functional at the same time things start working the right way almost by accident
1888457 im definitely going to be at ryan campbells session on plexiglass i know hes working on some really awesome examples and plexiglass makes it stupid easy to do 3d in flex im also looking forward to laura arguellos presentation on mate

1888459 get off the fence seriously this is where the entire flex community hangs out if youre a flex developer and your not there youre missing out

1888566 c d c s new incidence estimates reveal that the h i v epidemic is and has been worse than previously known
1888567 therefore there are roughly 225 000 more people living with h i v in the u s than previously suspected
1888568 the previous estimate was 1 million to 1 1 million
1888569 u s efforts to prevent h i v have failed dismally
1888570 this paper has been scrutinized by some of the best statisticians in the country and is much better now than when we started this process it was so complicated that even i who has some expertise in this area could not stand by it without making sure we had gone through the review process
1888571 this is one of those examples where getting the external review process to really scrutinize the paper pick it apart build it back up has in my opinion fundamentally improved it
1888572 h i v prevention has been underfunded and too often hindered by politics and ideology
1888573 since fiscal year 2002 when adjusted for inflation c d c s prevention budget has actually shrunk by 19 percent the president has recently requested decreases in funding for h i v prevention at c d c
1888574 less and less money to actually get these programs to the communities that need them
1888575 it looks like prevention campaigns make even less difference than anyone thought
1888576 h i v incidence did not decline as much from the 1980s to the 1990s as we believed
1888577 despite the dramatic increase in condom promotion and so called prevention education
1888578 if there is any good news here it is hard to report it but there is a little bit in the sense that while incidence rates are certainly too high they are stable that is important because a stable number of new infections in a world that has got more and more people with h i v and people with aids living in it suggests that we are keeping up with that pressure for transmission

1888608 oxygenation through deep breathing boosts the immune system and can rid the body of chronic illnesses
1888609 when the body is totally deprived of food the metabolism slows and life can be sustained for several weeks however when the body is totally deprived of oxygen metabolism comes to a halt immediately and life can only be sustained for a few minutes does it not make common sense that the way we breathe day to day has the most dramatic effect on our bodys health and metabolism than any other single process
1888610 oxygen tension in tissues enhances the action of some antibiotics notably amino glycosides and the immune system and stimulates cellular metabolism
1888611 deep diaphragmatic breathing stimulates the cleansing of the lymph system by creating a vacuum effect which pulls the lymph through the bloodstream this increases the rate of toxic elimination by as much as 15 times the normal rate
1888612 oxygen plays a pivotal role in the proper functioning of the immune system we can look at oxygen deficiency as the single greatest cause of all diseases

1888791 we know that you enjoy surfing and downloading music movies and pictures but we also know that this can get a little frustrating at times as heavy users on our network can reduce the internet speed at your end heavy users download very large files 24 hrs a day 7 days a week leaving less bandwidth for the rest of you and we think its unfair that you should not be getting good speeds when you surf the internet because of a very small number of users to make sure everyone is getting the best quality connection speeds from us we have set up monitoring tools to identify those few very heavy users and to manage their bandwidth thats why we have introduced the fair usage policy we know the majority of customers usage will always fall well within this policy but this will also help us address any excessive usage so you always get the most reliable broadband services how would you qualify as a heavy user well if you continuously download large files then there is a great chance that you are a heavy user for example if you are an adsl 512k customer and you download over 4 000 music tracks per month or more than 28 movies per month and keep on doing this type of download every month then you would qualify as a heavy user this type of download is a large amount by any normal standard of usage

1888793 is a large amount by any normal standard of usage

1888815 in the year 1775 my opinion was asked concerning a family receipt for the cure of the dropsy i was told that it had long been kept a secret by an old woman in shropshire who had sometimes made cures after the more regular practitioners had failed this medicine was composed of twenty or more different herbs but it was not very difficult for one conversant in these subjects to perceive that the active herb could be no other than the foxglove
1888816 it would have been an easy task to have given select cases whose successful treatment would have spoken strongly in favour of the medicine and perhaps been flattering to my own reputation but truth and science would condemn the procedure i have therefore mentioned every case in which i have prescribed the foxglove proper or improper successful or otherwise

1888840 and we press for openness and justice not to impose our beliefs but to allow the chinese people to express theirs
1888841 the leadership in beijing will almost certainly find his comments irritating or objectionable
1888842 but they will clearly understand that the united states will not impose any real consequences if they do not make progress on human rights
1888843 america stands in firm opposition to chinas detention of political dissidents human rights advocates and religious activists
1888844 america and our partners are realistic and we are prepared for any possibility
1888845 i am optimistic about chinas future young people who grow up with the freedom to trade goods will ultimately demand the freedom to trade ideas
1888846 change in china will arrive on its own terms and in keeping with its own history and traditions yet change will arrive

1888850 as chinas economy becomes more internationalized and the movement of international capital flows accelerates there is a need to improve the system and oversight of multinational capital movements
1888851 there is no need to further tighten the marco control measures given the economic environment the current measures are already appropriate
1888852 at the moment we should not rush more tightening measures
1888853 in the second half we need to push forward reforms in the financial sector presently smes are usually the first victims of credit tightening measures this reflects the rigidity of chinas financial system moreover we need to push forward reforms of the pricing mechanism for energy and resources products

1888979 just how far do i have to go to accommodate an employee with a disability
1888980 if it could prove that at the time it made that administrative decision the complainant was unable for the reasonably foreseeable future to work steadily and regularly
1888981 to show that the standard is reasonably necessary it must be demonstrated that it is impossible to accommodate individual employees sharing the characteristics of the claimant without imposing undue hardship upon the employer
1888982 the test is not whether it was impossible for the employer to accommodate the employees characteristics the employer does not have a duty to change working conditions in a fundamental way but does have a duty if it can do so without undue hardship to arrange the employees workplace or duties to enable the employee to do his or her work
1888983 the test for undue hardship is not total unfitness for work in the foreseeable future if the characteristics of an illness are such that the proper operation of the business is hampered excessively or if an employee with such an illness remains unable to work for the reasonably foreseeable future even though the employer has tried to accommodate him or her the employer will have satisfied the test
1888984 the duty to accommodate is therefore perfectly compatible with general labour law rules including both the rule that employers must respect employees fundamental rights and the rule that employees must do their work the employers duty to accommodate ends where the employee is no longer able to fulfill the basic obligations associated with the employment relationship for the foreseeable future
1888985 a decision to dismiss an employee because the employee will be unable to work in the reasonably foreseeable future must necessarily be based on an assessment of the entire situation

1888989 where this employer has the power to solicit independent medical information that is relevant to the grievor s inability to attend work and it declines that opportunity it is difficult for an arbitrator to discount the only evidence that is available here the union provided unchallenged medical evidence that he became physically and psychologically incapacitated from continuing certain duties therefore the only conclusion that can be drawn is that the medical evidence supports and establishes the claim that he was physically and psychologically impaired to the point that he could not continue to perform his assigned duties while his personal beliefs may have subconsciously been a contributing factor in his condition he was temporarily prevented from working by his resulting medical condition not his personal beliefs accordingly it must be concluded that he was temporarily disabled by the manifestations of anxiety and stress which fit within the definition of disability under the human rights code i so declare
1888990 dont assume it makes an ass out of u and me
1888991 it can often take an employee as long as five years after an episode of mental illness to get the right diagnosis find the right medication and get back on track

1889004 goes back to the days when all gentlemen wore powdered wigs like the ones still worn by the judges in british courts the word wool was then a popular joking term for hair the expression pull the wool over his eyes came from the practice of tilting a mans wig over his eyes so he couldnt see what was going on

1889006 in the old time european armies the soldiers were aligned side by side in neat rows or ranks on the battlefield when the enemy attacked officers would order the troops to close ranks that is to move the rows close together so that the enemy faced a seemingly impregnable mass of men
1889007 when i was a youngster on the streets of new york one could both see and smell the emissions of horse drawn wagons since there was no way of controlling these emissions they or the undigested oats in them served to nourish a large population of english sparrows if you say somethings for the birds youre politely saying its horseshit
1889008 the pale in this expression has nothing to do with the whitish color but comes originally from the latin palus meaning a pole or stake since stakes are often used to mark boundaries a pale was a particular area within certain limits
1889009 those who lived beyond the pale were outside english jurisdiction and were thought to be uncivilized
1889010 infections such as thrush were sometimes treated by putting a live frog head first into the patients mouth by inhaling the frog was believed to draw the patients infection into its own body the treatment is happily obsolete but its memory survives in the 19th century term frog in ones throat
1889011 a more likely explanation is that the expression was originally to a tittle
1889012 contracts were not considered legal until each signer included st andrews cross after their name
1889013 throughout the centuries this custom faded out but the letter x became associated with a kiss

1889027 factories operating in cambodia do no want to expand as they are worried about strikes which could hinder exports
1889028 we know that some factories are about to close due to strikes and demonstrations and some factories are considering limiting their output we can compete in the garment industry if there are no strikes i know of some factories that do not want to go into large scale production for fear of loss when there are illegal strikes strikes are the garment industrys hiv we are very worries about this matter
1889029 we are trying to ensure all sides observe the law in order to avoid strikes so the statement that strikes are hiv is rather pessimistic and also affects labor law
1889030 striking is a workers right as prescribed in the law and we should consider whether working conditions are acceptable or not we mustnt put strikes in the same categories as hiv i think that we must all observe labor law and not point fingers at each other if we want the textile sector to be developed and competitive
1889031 one strike was held to demand that employer abide by the law as they had suspended union leaders for being hiv positive
1889032 i think gmac should look at the practices of some factory employers who continue to pay wages of less than us 50 which leads to strikes
1889033 we should liken strikes staged by workers to hiv because some factories still trespass labor laws
1889034 god give me back the confidence that i lost give me back my esteem

1889047 bullying is only fun if you get upset dont get upset its impossible to keep picking on someone if it doesnt upset them if you act like a victim it invites acceleration
1889048 if youre my student and you tell me that johnny called me an idiot i ask do you believe it
1889049 but if i reprimand johnny and call his parents will that make him like you no hell want to get back at both of us if he gets suspended will he like school no plus you got johnny punished so you now can provoke him and get him in trouble again johnny will look for ways to get back at you and on it goes endlessly ive taught both of you that you should get upset by insults and that how you feel is someone elses responsibility also you learn that neither of you has freedom of speech because youre going to be punished if you say something insulting freedom of speech is the cornerstone of our democracy but kids dont have freedom of speech
1889050 both the far left and the far right can hate bullies because everyone thinks the bully is the other person but the bullies are us how many people do you know who never upset anyone else
1889051 if i punish johnny i teach you the victim that a person deserves to be punished even if he didnt hurt you every little thing that upsets you is a crime for every little problem we have to make the world change not ourselves we want children to develop self confidence but how can they do that if other people solve their problems for them so we teach children that they are entitled to a life where they are never bothered thats impossible the only way children can go to school without being bullied is to have a separate school for each kid the only place where everyone is always nice is heaven and you have to die to get in
1889052 whats better that the victim got away with getting the bully punished anti bullying activists love to say that such and such percent of bullies become criminals no we make them become criminals
1889053 id been a school psychologist teaching kids how not to be bullied for about 20 years before columbine a year later on the day of the anniversary i was at the national convention for school psychologists there were 5 000 school psychologists the government official who gave a keynote address announced that they would make bullying a class of harassment so now we can legally prosecute kids for being bullies everyone stood up and gave him a long standing ovation i thought my god what are my colleagues so happy about where is compassion were pleased to take a whole class of children and treat them like criminals this is a failure of our profession we want the legal system to solve this problem for us now anti bullying psychology is just law enforcement

1889092 tell your brother aaron not to come whenever he chooses into the most holy place behind the curtain in front of the atonement cover on the ark or else he will die because i appear in the cloud over the atonement cover
1889093 this is how aaron is to enter the sanctuary area with a young bull for a sin offering and a ram for a burnt offering
1889094 aaron is to offer the bull for his own sin offering to make atonement for himself and his household
1889095 aaron shall bring the bull for his own sin offering to make atonement for himself and his household and he is to slaughter the bull for his own sin offering
1889096 he shall then slaughter the goat for the sin offering for the people and take its blood behind the curtain and do with it as he did with the bulls blood he shall sprinkle it on the atonement cover and in front of it
1889097 then he shall come out to the altar that is before the lord and make atonement for it he shall take some of the bulls blood and some of the goats blood and put it on all the horns of the altar
1889098 when aaron has finished making atonement for the most holy place the tent of meeting and the altar he shall bring forward the live goat
1889099 then aaron is to go into the tent of meeting and take off the linen garments he put on before he entered the most holy place and he is to leave them there
1889100 the man who releases the goat as a scapegoat must wash his clothes and bathe himself with water afterward he may come into the camp

1889133 i will make you exceedingly fruitful and i will make nations of you and kings will come forth from you
1889134 i will establish my covenant between me and you and your descendants after you throughout their generations for an everlasting covenant to be god to you and to your descendants after you
1889135 i will give to you and to your descendants after you the land of your sojournings all the land of canaan for an everlasting possession and i will be their god
1889136 now as for you you shall keep my covenant you and your descendants after you throughout their generations

1889139 and every male among you who is eight days old shall be circumcised throughout your generations a
1889140 but an uncircumcised male who is not circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin that person shall be cut off from his people he has broken my covenant

1889146 it is important for this great country to open itself to the gospel
1889147 most of the correction in home prices is behind us
1889148 the good news is that the steady improvement in sales will support price appreciation moving forward
1889149 after reaching what appears to be the bottom in the fourth quarter of 2006 we expect existing home sales to gradually rise all this year and well into 2008
1889150 although existing home sales will be marginally reduced due to subprime lending restrictions they should be gradually rising this year and next
1889151 tighter lending standards will dampen home sales a bit but by less than a couple of percentage points from initial projections
1889152 housing activity this year will be somewhat lower than in earlier forecasts
1889153 home sales will probably fluctuate in a narrow range in the short run but gradually trend upward with improving activity by the end of the year
1889154 home prices are expected to recover in 2008 with existing home sales picking up late this year
1889155 with the population growing the demand for homes isnt going away its just being delayed
1889156 patient buyers in most areas who do their homework will recognize that housing remains a good long term investment
1889157 the speculative excesses have been removed from the market and home sales are returning to fundamentally healthy levels while prices remain near record highs reflecting favorable mortgage rates and positive job gains
1889158 in some ways the extended real estate boom from 2001 to 2005 created unrealistic expectations that housing is a short term high yield investment 2007 will be the fifth best year for housing on record
1889159 the broad trend over the coming year will be a gradual rise in existing home sales but because sales are exceptionally low in the final months of 2007 total sales for 2008 will be only modestly higher than 2007
1889160 a meaningful recovery in existing home sales could occur as early as this spring or it may be further delayed toward late 2008
1889161 where builders have cut construction sharply and in most areas with improving affordability conditions well generally see moderately higher home prices
1889162 significant price declines in some local markets have sharply and quickly improved local affordability conditions and are inducing buyers to return to the marketplace
1889163 exceptionally weak home sales related to jumbo loans problems will depress home prices in the first half of the year but steady liquidity improvements in the conforming jumbo loan market will help prices recover in the second half of the year
1889164 although more than half of local markets are expected to see price growth this year the aggregate existing home price will decline 2 4 percent in 2008 driven by a relatively few markets that are very oversupplied
1889165 were seeing healthy price gains in moderately priced areas like erie pa and corpus christi texas and double digit gains in others
1889166 interestingly there have been reports of multiple bidding after the large price cuts so it is possible that most of the price declines have already occurred in those markets
1889167 this is welcome news because a rise in contract activity is necessary for an overall housing recovery with a tax credit now available to first time home buyers increases in home sales could be sustained with the momentum carrying into 2009

1889192 the delegation of leaders would go to both jammu and srinagar to resolve this issue amicably
1889193 muslims have done nothing to vitiate the atmosphere neither have the good hindus done anything bad its unfortunate that some parties are raking it up due to elections
1889194 secularism was murdered when four and a half lakh pandits were thrown out of kashmir and sikhs were murdered
1889195 it was a bandh that was called by hurriyat and other political parties in kashmir for 20 days why wasnt it called a blockade then this bandh is a reply to omar abduallahs statement in parliament that hum jaan de denge par zameen nahi denge we will lay down our lives but wont part with the land
1889196 people like mr pandit are in minority there are thousands of yatris who are hindus and from all parts of india you should ask them about the level of hospitality extended to them by kashmiris weve been doing it for generations and will continue to do so they are our revered guests
1889197 why are hindus in jammu offended while the hindus in rest of india arent
1889198 the sajjad lones omar abdullahs and farooq abdullahs are talking about politics when a majority demands it the issue becomes communal but when they demand it nothing happens they talk whatever suits them
1889199 he is secure he does not have to come here jammu and kashmir and so he is lecturing from some corner in india its we who are looking after the yatris
1889200 you are blocking baby powder and medicines to the state for godsake have you lost all sense of shame are you going to starve us if we dont go to muzaffarabad where else do we go
1889201 many people who were part of jammu mukti morcha in 2002 and now the sangharsh samiti want to separate jammu from kashmir they in the process will also create a religious polarization
1889202 kashmir is a disputed place and how many hindus were killed tell me there were thousands of yatris in the state that time not a single non muslim person was hurt or killed nine kashmiri muslims die

1889211 now two important points first point earlier this week i stated in this blog that twitter is my 2 productivity tool in other words this is really important for me second point twitter funkiness like second life funkiness is not unusual so at first i did not realize this was anything beyond the typical all kinds of alarms went off i had just been asked to demo twitter among other social techs at an important upcoming meeting wait a week for them to just look at the problem ummm that could be a real problem
1889212 want to do x than look at this my website
1889213 of course my main love for twitter is the community without the people there would be no twitter i dont love twitter i love the people on twitter who make it such a vibrant place to be i dont love twitter i dont even like twitter at the moment i may even hate them
1889214 consider how you would feel or as if someone took your personal journal and address book and refused to return them

1889224 i hate pubmed i hate it with a burning passion for a site that is as vital to scientific progress as pubmed is
1889225 most of our friends are planing to stick to the couch and in front of the tv
1889226 what is right to do and that you would like to see us doing
1889227 if the query takes 2 3 minutes we loose users
1889228 i stumbled across a beta advanced search in pubmed today
1889229 maar begin zeker met twitteren daar zitten ook hele leuke kanten aan
1889230 the concept was imported from europe and asia in the 1980s as an alternative marketing and financing arrangement to help combat the often prohibitive costs of small scale farming
1889231 we decided that its in our interest to have a small farm succeed and have them be able to have a sustainable farm producing good food
1889232 i think people are becoming more local minded and this fits right into that
1889233 people are seeing ways to come together and work together to make this successful
1889234 so i decided to go out and help we harvest water pull weeds whatever they need doing
1889235 the c s a provides a base thats certain and we get the money when we need to spend the money
1889236 having the money upfront and guaranteed that gets us through at least the beginning of the season
1889237 we dont do millions in revenue but we make a living which is rare
1889238 our goal is to provide a full portfolio of products for folks who want sustainable products up until about five years ago we had to do a tremendous amount of guerrilla marketing the consumer who is interested now theyre doing their homework they know the health and taste benefits
1889239 you feel like youre doing more than one thing youre helping the project and youre helping yourself
1889240 people are coming to us we do very little marketing except for explaining what we do its amazing
1889241 this is a complicated business growing so many crops we do everything by hand for more than 100 different crops
1889242 from a going green standpoint its an appropriate thing to do
1889243 like everything organic its not a bargain but what price do you put on being healthy considering all things its actually a very good deal
1889244 we eat with the seasons and theres no guarantee that mother nature will cooperate
1889245 you have sat too long for any good you have been doing depart i say and let us have done with you in the name of god go
1889246 apparently it is an easy way to circumvent spam filters
1889247 the savvy and accurate cyber criminals of today seem to have abandoned the attachments tactic that was so innovative in late 2007 and are exploiting free hosted applications which have become mainstream in 2008
1889248 this is one more addition to the growing list of ways in which the spammers have succeeded in outsmarting traditional detection devices
1889249 four dimensional divergence of an antisymmetric second rank tensor equals zero

1889257 we just felt this was an opportunity to go get somebody of bretts stature and what hes accomplished
1889258 i have all the respect in the world for chad as a person and as a player he gave his heart and soul to this organization for a long long time
1889259 were going to take things one year at a time
1889260 were excited to have brett on the team for this year this was a situation we were monitoring and when we felt there was an opportunity we felt it was the right thing to do to go after brett
1889261 hes coming to a new city hes been in one system for 16 years theres not a lot of connection with brett and our coaching staff we were able to talk through moving to the northeast we felt really good about it and were excited that hes with us
1889262 brett has had a long and storied career in green bay and the packers owe him a tremendous debt of gratitude for everything he accomplished on the field and for the impact he made in the state
1889263 it is with some sadness that we make this announcement but also with the desire for certainty that will allow us to move the team and organization forward in the most positive way possible
1889264 its in everyones best interest to do it quicker than later
1889265 i wont say were running out of time but i need to get into a camp somewhere
1889266 my gut feeling for a long time was i just didnt think this would come to fruition
1889267 we had a cursory monitoring situation going on for a number of days we put an oar in the water and things heated up at the end
1889268 no es lo que nos pasa es lo que no nos pasa lo que duele y separa

1889522 while the west is the best still holds true attention this year has shifted away from alberta to saskatchewan and manitoba as high prices for nearly all of their natural resources will make them the two fastest growing economies in canada

1889526 demand is slowing but the other thing is weve seen prices spike particularly because of geopolitical tensions centred around the middle east
1889527 those things have not disappeared completely but they have at least disappeared to the background
1889528 prices seem to have at least temporarily peaked but next year and five years down the road prices will inevitably rise
1889529 it has quite a few spin off effects for saskatchewan

1889625 we have constant problems where we have people who are trying to repeatedly abuse our sites
1889626 the best defense of the wikipedia frankly is to point out how much bad information is available from supposedly reliable sources
1889627 in some ways were just as fallible as everyone else in some areas because our own knowledge is limited and we cant possibly fact check everything
1889628 instead of figuring out how to fix wikipedia something that cannot be done to our satisfaction
1889629 we should focus our energies on educating the wikipedia users among our colleagues
1889630 but thats the way free speech is think about the gossip world it spreads theres no way to correct it period wikipedia is not immune from that kind of maliciousness but it is relative to other features of life more easily corrected

1889633 wikis are web pages that can be viewed and modified by anyone with a web browser and internet access described as a composition system a discussion medium and a repository wikis support asynchronous communication and group collaboration online their inherent simplicity gives students direct access to their content which is crucial in group editing or other collaborative activities their versioning capability allows them to illustrate the evolution of thought processes as students interact with a site and its contents wikis are also being used as e portfolios highlighting their utility as a tool for collection and reflection they may be the easiest most effective web based collaboration tool in any instructional portfolio
1889634 being dismissive of blogs and wikis because of how they are most often used and talked about today is a mistake pcs and web browsers werent considered as serious enterprise tools at first either what is important is how they could be used they are simply tools and many of you will be surprised to find how much they are already being utilized in business environments
1889635 wikis are fully editable websites any user can read or add content to a wiki site this functionality means that wikis are an excellent tool for collaboration in an online environment this paper presents wikis as a useful tool for facilitating online education basic wiki functionality is outlined and different wikis are reviewed to highlight the features that make them a valuable technology for teaching and learning online

1889639 the findings in this study may be considered encouraging in many ways the average amount of alcohol has decreased in more recently born cohorts the percentage of the population exhibiting moderate alcohol intake has been increasing steadily and the percentage reporting heavy drinking has decreased over time while these data suggest the development of more favorable patterns of alcohol consumption over the latter part of the 20th century that also show that at the same time the cumulative incidence of alcohol use disorders has not shown a decrease and continuing efforts at preventing them are warranted

1889652 so why is buddhism negative with regards to suicide in japan
1889653 of course buddhism exists in other nations however it is potent in japan when fused with culture because japanese culture does glorify suicide
1889654 therefore suicide appears to be within the thought patterns of many people within japan so the unreal world of the internet play stations reincarnation and computer games means that this is a potent mix and it becomes even more potent when it is fused to cultural norms and the theory of fatalism
1889655 added to this is the lack of critical thinking in japan and the need for conformity is also crushing the
1889656 yet this is not happening because the majority of japanese people appear to be apathetic when it comes to demanding their rights given this the leaders of japan are turning a blind eye to this tragic aspect of japanese culture
1889657 for example many japanese people appear to be unable to argue or express their real thinking
1889658 therefore if working conditions are not improved and the notion of reincarnation is not challenged then some japanese people are going to look to suicide in order to escape from this life
1889659 these areas and the need to reduce stress and to challenge conformity are vital but will anything change in the near future i fear not therefore the land of hello kitty is turning on itself and the world of reality and unreality will continue to overlap in japan
1889660 given this suicide will continue to cause havoc in japan and it may get worse before it gets better

1889689 i can tell you why we made the decision to publish one online edition and one print edition per year the reason is mainly monetary but there are side issues worth discussing cutthroat is largely unfunded so bill root and i pay to publish this magazine we receive so many worthy submissions in poetry and short fiction we felt that printing one issue a year didnt allow us to publish enough of these wonderful submissions cutthroat is truly a labor of love none of our editors staff is paid except for the judges we hire to judge our national literary prizes all work is volunteer and our editors work hard reading through a mountain of material for each issue for the present we decided that the best option for us is to publish one print edition this past years issue ran to 180 pages and to publish one online edition per year because we dont have to pay for reproduction of art work inside the magazine this online edition allows us to feature visual artists as well as writers we choose one guest fiction editor each year to edit the online fiction submissions this years guest editor was william luvaas our poetry editor william pitt root edits for both online and print editions each year the future of cutthroat is bright we are all committed to publishing this magazine for the long term we are old fashioned and love the feel of the print edition in our hands so we have no plans to to to an entirely online format we are lucky each year to have interns to help us out with logging in submissions creating data bases mailings etc we also have two terrific web designers laura prendergast and kevin watson who help me maintain our website and set up the magazines

1889719 the windfall profits tax is back with barack obama stumping again to apply it to a handful of big oil companies which raises a few questions what is a windfall profit anyway how does it differ from your everyday run of the mill profit is it some absolute number a matter of return on equity or sales or does it merely depend on who earns it enquiring entrepreneurs want to know unfortunately mr obamas emergency plan announced on friday doesnt offer any clarity to pay for stimulus checks which when proposed by president bush obama was dead set against but has now apparently seen the light of 1 000 for families and 500 for individuals the senator says government would take a reasonable share of oil company profits mr obama didnt bother to define reasonable this extraordinary redefinition of free market success could use some parsing take exxon mobil which on thursday reported the highest quarterly profit ever and is the main target of any windfall tax surcharge yet if its profits are at record highs its tax bills are already at record highs too between 2003 and 2007 exxon paid 64 7 billion in u s taxes exceeding its after tax u s earnings by more than 19 billion that sounds like a government windfall to us but perhaps were missing some business subtlety maybe obama has in mind profit margins as a percentage of sales yet by that standard exxons profits dont seem so large exxons profit margin stood at 10 for 2007 which is hardly out of line with the oil and gas industry average of 8 3 or the 8 9 for u s manufacturing excluding the sputtering auto makers if thats what constitutes windfall profits most of corporate america would qualify the fun part about this game is anyone can play jim johnson formerly of fannie mae and formerly a political fixer for mr obama reaped a windfall before fannies multibillion dollar accounting scandal bill clinton took down as much as 15 million working as a rainmaker for billionaire financier ron burkles yucaipa companies this may be the very definition of windfall the point is that what constitutes an abnormal profit is entirely arbitrary it is in the eye of the political beholder who is usually looking to soak some unpopular business in other words a windfall is nothing more than a profit earned by a business that some politician dislikes and a tax on that profit is merely a form of politically motivated expropriation its what politicians do in venezuela not in a free country

1889764 scientology ethics explained l ron hubbard are reason they provide the means by which men conduct themselves toward their long term survival the survival of their families their groups their planet and more implicit within the subject is the recognition that all things are to one degree or another interdependent upon all else and that only by constantly considering the survival of the many can the individual ensure his own survival with this thinking firmly in mind the scientologist obeys the law remains faithful to his spouse truthful in his business dealings and otherwise conducts himself in accordance with honesty integrity and decency scientologists understand that rules and laws form the agreements by which a group society or nation survives and that high ethical standards far from inhibiting the enjoyment of life foster it yet what of the rest of the world for want of a workable system of ethics and justice whole civilizations have gone to ruin whole forests have been laid to waste and whole sections of our cities have been reduced to racial battlegrounds simultaneously we have witnessed the steady disintegration of the family a general decay of sexual values escalating drug abuse theft assault and on and on until it seems there is no hope at all except this the scientologist must also live in this society and he truly does possess the tools to make a difference

1889888 for the radio show its not as big of a deal because we can always just have
1889889 we definitely thought this favre thing was going to drag out for another day or two so we had this whole point counterpoint thing set up to compare and contrast the jets and bucs and then a little wheel of fortune sort of graphic set up where we were going to spin it and see where favre would land you know well thats all useless now
1889890 the good news for us is that weve got a few hours to do some planning
1889891 im pretty sure i can make some cosmetic changes to this game and have it be about which of the
1889892 ideally obviously there would be a board game but im just not sure there will be time
1889893 anytime youre getting supporters activated into online communities or taking other actions to spread the word thats a win

1889895 im mike cornfield and im part of the mccain action team
1889896 talking points are fine but a comment should refer specifically to something that was said or written previously in the thread where it is intended to appear
1889897 people in politics arent motivated by points thats not what gets people to act theyre motivated by genuinely caring about the issues

1889909 we have anticipated these flaws in dns for many years and we have basically engineered around them
1889910 its been overplayed in a sense i think it has served to confuse the consumer into believing there is somehow now a way to misdirect them to a wrong site
1889911 the fact of the matter is that there have been many ways like phishing attacks to misdirect them for a long time and this is just yet another of those ways that will be surgically exploited
1889912 the industry has rallied like weve never seen the industry rally before

1889927 als amerikaan zou ik eigenlijk ja moeten zeggen maar in mijn ogen grenst het opnemen van een islamitisch land in een cultureel totaal andere gemeenschap aan waanzin ik ben dus tegen het amerikaanse standpunt
