2100001 ohje niemand h rt auf mich wenn ich nicht einverstanden bin mit der technologischen entwicklung
2100002 wenn ich die weiteren zeilen richtig verstanden habe erwartest du von unseren politikern visionen mindestens aber g nstige rahmenbedingungen f r neue zukunftstr chtige innovationen du willst raus aus der heutigen jammer lethargie daf r bin ich auch zu haben
2100003 hast du eine konkrete idee vorstellung vision wo die schweiz in 30 oder 50 jahre stehen oder
2100004 die technikfreaks haben den blog wieder voll im griff nach der diskussion ber die berechnung der wahrscheinlichkeit eines gaus wird angeregt dass die schweizer auf den mond fliegen
2100005 weiss jemand von euch etwas zu den auswirkungen eines akws im normalbetrieb auf lebewesen tiere pflanzen in der umgebung radioaktive strahlung etc gibts da irgendeine studie irgendwelche untersuchungen
2100006 die technikfreaks haben den blog wieder voll im griff nach der diskussion ber die berechnung der wahrscheinlichkeit eines gaus wird angeregt dass die schweizer auf den mond fliegen bei den ersten beitr gen zu diesem thema dachte ich dass es sich um ein sommerloch witz handelt
2100007 visionen haben bedeutet nicht ausschliesslich ideen haben wie wir zum mond fliegen und ihn in besitz nehmen meine visionen gehen in eine andere richtung zum beispiel

2100010 es steht jedem von euch weltraum euphorikern frei ein eigenes weltraumunternehmen zu gr nden den google preis abzur umen und sofort mit der umsetzung eurer visionen anzufangen
2100011 oder haben andere ideen die von einem orientierungslosen herumschlingern in einer globalisierten geldorientierten ich gesellschaft zu einem konkreten weg resp ziel f hren egal auf welchen bereich bezogen kultur wirtschaft gesellschaft politische ordnung religion kommunikation usw
2100012 dass die weltbev lkerung dereinst mehrheitlich in der lage sein wird f r ihr auskommen bzw ihren lebensunterhalt selber zu sorgen

2100019 es gab und gibt so etwas wie einen wettlauf der systeme zwischen religion und wissenschaft den die religion in europa verloren hat an diesen wettkampf erinnert man sich am besten mit den scheinbar d mmsten anekdoten juri gagarin als sowjetischer kosmonaut der erste mensch im all meldete im april 1961 er habe gott nicht gesehen
2100020 man kann aber noch so trickreich vorgehen wir k nnen weder den horizont zerst ren noch die rotation beliebig steigern
2100021 bzw in die idee von martin eberhard eine firma zu gr nden die elektroautos herstellt investiert
2100022 dass weltraumfahrt durchaus kompatibel ist mit umweltschutz und nachhaltigkeit sollte ich das glauben m sste ich schon weit mehr detailinformationen haben wie weit sind beispielsweise die auswirkungen der raumfahrt auf die erdatmosph re erforscht und berhaupt bekannt wie sieht die sache hinsichtlich grauer energie aus etc etc
2100023 als graue energie oder kumulierter energieaufwand wird die energiemenge bezeichnet die f r herstellung transport lagerung verkauf und entsorgung eines produktes verbraucht wird
2100024 falls es dennoch zweifel geben sollte was die nat rliche ern hrung des menschen ist doch selbst bei erwachsenen ist die nat rliche abneigung gegen bestimmte nahrungsmittel noch nicht v llig verloren gegangen versuchen sie einige wochen in einem schlachthof zu arbeiten und danach einem bauern bei der obsternte zu helfen wo werden sie sich wohler f hlen
2100025 die gewaltaus bung gegen die so genannten nutztiere in der intensivtierhaltung und in den schlachth fen beeinflusst die psyche des menschen vor allem der kinder da dies schon l nger bekannt ist wird in schweizer schlachth fen in der regel um f nf uhr nachts geschlachtet und tierfabriken werden tabuisiert g be es nicht einige konsequente tiersch tzer die immer wieder darauf hinweisen w sste die mehrheit der schweizer bev lkerung kaum von deren existenz wann immer m glich wird die vorgeschichte des steaks auf dem eigenen teller verdr ngt
2100026 politik und wirtschaft die schweizer gesetze bzw verordnungen erlauben alle tierqu lerischen haltungssysteme ausser k fighaltung von h hnern 2 wie kommt das im tierschutzgesetz steht unter art 2 tiere sind so zu behandeln dass ihren bed rfnissen in bestm glicher weise rechnung getragen wird dem art 22 abs 1 kann man entnehmen das misshandeln starke vernachl ssigen oder unn tige beranstrengen von tieren ist verboten eigentlich sollte damit alles klar und die tiere gl cklich sein leider wird in dem gesetz nicht festgelegt was man unter den bed rfnissen von nutztieren versteht es ist auch nicht festgehalten was mit misshandeln und starker vernachl ssigung gemeint ist deshalb war es f r die schweizer politiker inklusive bundesrat leicht das tierschutzgesetz so stark zu verw ssern dass es kaum auswirkungen hat gegen die praktizierte wirtschaftsfreundliche und tierfeindliche auslegung des tierschutzgesetzes kann weder eine privatperson noch eine tierschutzorganisation klagen die oberste aufsicht hat der bundesrat durch den druck der fleischlobby werden tierschutzgesetze berall entsch rft und verw ssert die einstellung des bundes zur fleisch und milchwirtschaft sieht man am besten in seiner subventionspolitik
2100027 wenn wir aufh ren dem ewigen wirtschaftswachstum zu huldigen h ren sicher auch die schulden und sozialausgaben bald auf zu wachsen
2100028 grunds tzlich bin ich der meinung dass die arbeit der bauern und deren wichtigkeit f r landschaft und bev lkerung massiv untersch tzt und nicht genug gew rdigt wird ich meine damit weniger die industriell betriebene landwirtschaft als vielmehr das kleinbauerntum
2100029 ich geh re zu der generation die noch zwischen verstand und vernunft unterscheidet von diesem standpunkt ist die raumfahrt ein triumph des verstandes aber ein tragisches versagen der vernunft
2100030 das bild vom menschen als aggressiver j ger sei ein mythos der h chstens f r die letzten jahrzehntausende der menschheitsgeschichte zutreffe
2100031 w chst die bev lkerung weiter und ndert sich der lebensstil nicht so wird die schweiz mit dem verbrauch von rohstoffen und energie auch in form von importg tern und dem ausstoss von schadstoffen noch st rker zur schmarotzerin an der umwelt weder das konsumniveau noch die bev lkerung lassen sich rapid senken aber l ngerfristig wird es auch da eine kombination brauchen so gesehen sind weder geburten noch einwanderungs berschuss noch konsumanstieg erw nscht gegenw rtig gibt es alle drei
2100032 wachstum ist gut wachstum ist n tig wachstum ist zwingend
2100033 die aktuellen verhandlungen f r eine einigung der vor sieben jahren begonnenen doha runde sind gescheitert f r die schweizer b uerinnen und bauern ist kein resultat besser als ein schlechtes und der zuletzt diskutierte vorschlag im agrardossier w re f r sie wie auch f r alle anderen b uerlichen familienbetriebe auf der welt eine katastrophe gewesen der erneute schiffbruch der doha runde der wto zeigt vor allem eines sehr deutlich die wto muss ihre position berarbeiten um der ver nderten situation auf den weltm rkten gerecht zu werden die zeit ist ihr davon gelaufen die menschheit k mpft heute mit anderen herausforderungen als zum start der verhandlungen die erfahrung der letzten jahre hat gezeigt dass mit den momentanen ans tzen die geforderte entwicklung der wirtschaftsschwachen staaten nicht erreicht wird n tig ist der einbezug der nahrungsmittelgrundversorgung in den einzelnen l ndern es darf nicht sein dass grosse agrokonzerne in armen l ndern riesige fl chen f r den anbau von cash crops belegen und gleichzeitig die eigene bev lkerung nicht genug zu essen hat dies weil reihum die kleinen familienbetriebe eingehen die haupts chlich die lokale und regionale versorgung sicherstellen das stetige bev lkerungswachstum und der damit verbundene generell h here bedarf die verst rkte nachfrage nach veredelten lebensmitteln die konkurrenz durch biotreibstoffe sowie die klimatisch bedingten produktionseinbussen haben innerhalb von k rzester zeit zu einer v llig neuen situation auf den weltm rkten gef hrt vor allem arme l nder sind sensibel geworden denn sie sind die ersten die sich den import von nahrungsmitteln aus dem ausland nicht mehr leisten und ihre bev lkerung nicht ausreichend ern hren k nnen die so genannte ern hrungskrise hat den wert einer eigenen landwirtschaft mehr als deutlich aufgezeigt die landwirtschaft ist kein beliebiger sondern ein berlebenswichtiger sektor der schweizerische bauernverband hofft dass die wto die aktuelle zwangspause nutzt um eine neuausrichtung vorzunehmen und sich dabei an den heutigen gegebenheiten orientiert es ist zeit f r tabula rasa

2100040 weve fundamentally altered the way we do business when it comes to housing
2100041 this is not the bill i would have written had i had the opportunity to do so
2100042 it is a bill however that contains very important provisions that need to become law in the interest of the integrity of our financial system
2100043 we are now all going to work together with the administration to see that this is implemented as rapidly as possible
2100044 and i want to urge the loan servicers now that this is about to become law to show some forbearance for troubled borrowers who may qualify for the program
2100045 i then make a sustained argument from the linux experience for the proposition that
2100046 good programmers know what to write great ones know what to rewrite and reuse
2100047 if im correct theyll help you understand exactly what it is that makes the linux community such a fountain of good software and help you become more productive yourself
2100048 every good work of software starts by scratching a developers personal itch
2100049 treating your users as co developers is your least hassle route to rapid code improvement and effective debugging
2100050 in fact i think linus cleverest and most consequential hack was not the construction of the linux kernel itself but rather his invention of the linux development model
2100051 if you treat your beta testers as if theyre your most valuable resource they will respond by becoming your most valuable resource
2100052 smart data structures and dumb code works a lot better than the other way around
2100053 perhaps this should have been obvious its long been proverbial that
2100054 when you lose interest in a program your last duty to it is to hand it off to a competent successor
2100055 put that way the question answers itself linus was keeping his hacker users constantly stimulated and rewarded stimulated by the prospect of having an ego satisfying piece of the action rewarded by the sight of constant even daily improvement in their work
2100056 if you have the right attitude interesting problems will find you
2100057 the next best thing to having good ideas is recognizing good ideas from your users sometimes the latter is better

2100059 it scrubbed away the rough edges on my heels and toes it only took a few minutes for my feet to feel smother and softer
2100060 it made my feet feel a little bit softer but i didnt notice too much of an improvement id definitely still need to use an exfoliator to get the smooth feet i was hoping for
2100061 it wasnt an instant relief but it made my rough skin feel soft after a few uses plus it was way better than using a pumice block which i find really uncomfortable
2100062 in a way that does not degrade the natural resources on which farming and food production ultimately depend

2100094 but then the 1950s it was not as easy to see as it is today that when you make a powerful technology available to human beings with normal form of egocentric consciousness planetary disaster is inevitable moreover the point had to be made that the egocentric predicament was not a moral fault to be corrected by willpower but a conceptual hallucination requiring some basic alterations of common sense a task comparable to persuading people that the earth is round rather than flat

2100125 i dont think we have a goal scorer so that means so we emphasize keeping possession more and getting numbers forward so we need to be more patient with possession and get numbers forward and everybody into the attack
2100126 i think we tried that against norway and thats how well win against japan
2100127 were not going to beat japan by launching long balls our center backs and midfielders have to dictate tempo
2100128 the biggest factor is the adjustments were making offensively and defensively

2100138 forecasts of strong global demand for oil in the long run coupled with diminishing supplies has prompted the emirate to allocate investments of up to 20 billion to raise its oil production capacity to 3 5 million barrels a day by 2010 up from 2 7 million barrels a day at present
2100139 i dont think it is possible a good few oil projects would have to contribute to such a target and with the shortage of materials and labor the whole industry is suffering from delays

2100146 what i hear from our customers is that they love downtown asheville because its different because it doesnt have high rises because it has small businesses you dont see anywhere else in the country
2100147 weve worked hard for 27 years to make downtown viable for the emerging artists writers musicians galleries and bookstores why we think well make asheville better by having a tiffanys store is beyond me if the small businesses cant afford to stay downtown were changing what this town is and its not going to be attractive to tourists period
2100148 i hope we could handle it but im not 100 percent sure in all honesty that we would survive
2100149 speaking from my experience of the six months we had construction on haywood for the water pipes that was a really hard time this development is two years and how much do you want to bet its going to take longer no small business has the funds to stay open for three years without sales coming in and why would customers come down here if theres dust and explosions everywhere

2100173 toyota and honda may well have a choice simply put if they corner the lanthanum market for their batteries excluding the growing market for rechargeable tools then there may be none left for cracking catalysts i e no gasoline to fuel them so no car sales so they need to think about the impact of their lanthanum purchases it is likely that toyota who have a large share in the only company in japan making batteries for hybrid vehicles have a forward looking purchasing policy and probably have sufficient metal for the next 2 years or so the price of lanthanum la metal is currently about 13 kg and for the oxide 9 kg compared with 8 5 and 4 75 at the beginning of the 2008 year and 4 50 and 2 a year ago spot prices of 16 kg la 2 o 3 have been quoted in japan recently so clearly there is a measure of concern toyota has announced that their first lithium ion battery hybrid will be in production in 2011 and that 1 million hybrids is a target for 2011 whereas two to three years ago they were considering 2 3 million in 2011

2100234 there is significant pressure on the private rental market at this time and the removal of bedsits adds to and compounds an already difficult situation
2100235 weve been inundated with calls from students asking about accommodation as have the unions in trinity and ucd there is a small window of opportunity for students particularly for first years to try to get a place
2100236 these standards must reflect the general quality of life improvements in ireland over the last 10 years
2100237 some of the worst accommodation that students had to live in were the bedsits particularly during the mid 1990s

2100283 its going to exacerbate the worker shortages in areas outside the oilsands its pretty extreme
2100284 what is it thats holding them back do they want complete unfettered right to invest and grow
2100285 it kind of contradicts their whole were trying to grow responsibly and we have an eye to the environment it really does contradict that because it sees full steam ahead
2100286 its gotten to the point where its going to be damaging
2100287 its an opportunity for the government to say look here are some new environmental regulations and why dont you guys invest some money in meeting these things before we allow you to expand any further
2100288 its pretty clear the pace isnt slowing down at all
2100289 we continue to believe that the most appropriate response from government is to explicitly address the pace of development in terms of the rate in which they approve projects and the manner in which they stage project development over time
2100290 so as long as the government permits the industry to get away with focusing on quantity instead of quality theyre going to continue to do that
2100291 of course its worth it to continue on but we have make sure that its not only economically sustainable its got to be environmentally sustainable so those two things are really critical going forward
2100292 environmental technologies and everything else thats going on with new processes to try and make sure that we can get both

2100336 were thankful the coroner accepts that richard and joe were hard working men and very good at their jobs and pleased no blame was placed on the pilot
2100337 our hope is this sets a precedent richard and joe havent died without reason if commercial pilots killed and maimed by aviation fatigue in the future dont have that insulting false finding pilot error recorded against them
2100338 it will be even better if overwork induced aviation fatigue ceases to be a cause of death for employee pilots
2100339 the caa stands by its accident investigation report which was accepted by the coroner that noted that fatigue was one of several factors to the accident and not the sole cause of the accident
2100340 our company and the industry as a whole are actively looking for a fatigue management plan that fits our work practices the industry is taking it seriously and addressing it
2100341 the caa expect us to have a fatigue management plan in place and weve got to have one that is workable
2100342 they are far more aware of the possibilities of fatigue than they used to be

2100380 qu l stima que seas tan jov n y ya hayas perdido la ilusi n
2100381 este espect culo bochornoso est por debajo de mi inteligencia
2100382 fui a harrison que estaba ah fuera en la nieve rodando el episodio de las aventuras del joven indiana jones y le dije que ten a una idea y que cre a que pod a plantearme otra pel cula de indiana jones le encant o r aquello pero cuando le dije que girar a alrededor de los alien genas cambi de opini n y me respondi que no quer a hacerlo
2100383 no me gust en absoluto as que me negu rotundamente comenta ford siempre hab a existido un elemento m stico en las historias de un arque logo que lucha con los misterios de culturas antiguas pero pens que el nuevo ngulo no aprovechaba nada de lo que hab amos hecho anteriormente
2100384 yo insist en que funcionar a en que deb a darle una oportunidad recuerda lucas y harrison dijo que se lo comentara a steven a ver qu pensaba l steven se quej de que ya hab a hecho muchas pel culas de este tipo y que no cre a que debi ramos mezclar los g neros yo persever aduciendo que era perfecto que era una pel cula de ciencia ficci n de serie b y qu podr a ser m s divertido que aquello aparte encajaba con la edad de indy porque ya estar a entrado en los sesenta sin embargo se resist an a la idea
2100385 todos los filmes de indiana jones hab an tenido conceptos paranormales explica spielberg por lo que a george se le ocurri que quer a hacer una historia paranormal que fuera un cruce entre fen menos ps quicos y ovnis pero yo ya hab a hecho e t y encuentros en la tercera fase y estaba m s que harto de extraterrestres as que me resist a la idea durante muchos a os
2100386 se trataba de que indiana jones estuviera implicado en lo de roswell dice lucas y los alien genas eran el mcguffin
2100387 despu s de m s de un a o de trabajar estrechamente con steven spielberg desarrollando la historia yo hab a terminado un gui n que a l le encant y esperaba poder rodar sin embargo george lucas ten a ciertos problemas con l y le puso freno para reescribir l mismo el material
2100388 the franchise really depends on me coming up with a good idea
2100389 and that series is very research intensive so were doing research now to see if we cant come up with another object for him to chase hopefully well come up with something
2100390 eran humanos que jugaron a ser dioses y se autodestruyeron
2100391 entonces contratamos a david koepp que dijo que no iba a venir de uno a otro cuenta lucas desde ese momento yo le comentar a a steven lo que quer a que pasase y l se lo dir a a david por lo que era una especie de h brido que consist a b sicamente en que yo le dec a algo a steven y l decid a qu explicarle a david y luego este ltimo intentaba interpretar lo que le dec a steven
2100392 al final acud a un viejo amigo y colaborador que ya hab a escrito para m anteriormente de forma fant stica empezando con parque jur sico hablo de david koepp dice spielberg
2100393 david est en contacto con la humanidad de las cosas pero tambi n con el arte de las pel culas explica spielberg habla el mismo idioma que los aficionados al cine y posee el ritmo de las pel culas de la saga de indiana jones e incluy todo eso en su primer borrador sonaba ten a el sabor y parec a un filme de indiana jones fue la elecci n perfecta
2100394 gilsham you obviously did the plane on the treadmill wrong because a plane will only take off when air passes over the wings and the plane isnt meant to move froward at all
2100395 it depends on whether the airplane can reach takeoff air speed within the runway available but generally yes
2100396 if its just to see if the airplane will move forward then it will ill agree with that
2100397 a plane can overpower a treadmill but if a plane were only able to get the wheels to spin at 129 mph while all wheels were on the ground wouldnt the plane stay still on a tradmill going 129 mph
2100398 can an fixed wing aircraft with zero ground speed produce enough lift to become airborne
2100399 can the engine overpower the treadmill so the plane can still move forward despite the treadmill
2100400 please dont reproduce its pretty simple a harder problem for me to solve is how to kill people through the internet
2100401 if a plane moves forward at speed v and the conveyor moves at speed v does the plane take off
2100402 will a plane on a conveyor belt moving at the same speed as the plane in the opposite direction take off
2100403 the treadmill can move infinitely fast and the bearings and tires can take any speed without exploding
2100404 no the plane will not take off if its velocity is equal but opposite to the treadmills velocity
2100405 hey the conveyor cant stop the plane from moving forward the question tricked me
2100406 the plane is not magically levitating while standing still it is moving forwards as usual and ignoring what the ground underneath it is doing which is the entire point of having a plane really
2100407 wow thats actually a lot of friction im going to struggle here
2100408 but what if they adjusted the experiment so the plane cant move
2100409 what if you just turned off the engine or chained the plane to the conveyor belt can it take off then
2100410 what if the conveyor belt was as in the last example moving 25 mph relative to the ground and the plane was moving the opposite direction 25 mph relative to the conveyor belt this means that the plane has 0 velocity relative to the ground
2100411 i think you are missing the point as the principle of the conveyour is for the plane to remain physically stationary if that is not the point then what is the point
2100412 an airplane cannot take off from a runway which is moving backwards like a treadmill at a speed equal to its normal ground speed during takeoff
2100413 thats not quite true there is some frictional force so at some very low level of thrust the plane would remain stationary mythbusters should have show the plane 1 moving backward ie before it started thrusting 2 in a steady state ie forward thrust frictional force and 3 moving forward and shown the different thrust levels to see how negligible the frictional force truly is
2100414 given an engine thrust that lifts a plane into the air on a runway how much additional thrust is needed to lift the plane if the plane is on a conveyor belt moving in a backwards direction
2100415 make the conveyor move faster backwards to counteract the extra power of the engines
2100416 a conveyor belt moving in the opposite direction of the wheels and at the same speed as the wheels were turning
2100417 but i though you were asking if a plane could take off it was on a treadmill and not moving relative to the surroundings
2100418 if a plane is on a conveyor belt and the conveyor belt moves backwards at the same speed the plane moves forward will the plane take off
2100419 if a conveyor cancels out the forward motion of a plane
2100420 does the propeller produce enough windspeed over the wings for that particular a c to have the lift for takeoff
2100421 can a plane take off on a conveyor traveling at the planes takeoff speed
2100422 an airplane cannot take off from a runway which is moving backwards like a treadmill at a speed equal to its normal ground speed during takeoff
2100423 moving backwards at a speed equal to its normal ground speed during takeoff
2100424 an airplane cannot take off from a runway which is moving backwards like a treadmill at a speed equal to its normal ground speed during takeoff
2100425 if people in the fucking observer and the guardian wanna get on their high horse about it theres not a great deal i can do

2100441 please take a chair i see bbc drama have sent you over for initial discussions re your book
2100442 i understand they intend adapting your childrens book as a tv series whats the title of the book
2100443 yes rhonda and the gardener now i believe it is set in the 1930s is that right
2100444 yes the story is set in a very expensive boarding school for genteel young ladies from well to do privileged families whose allegiance is to england the flag the english way of life its traditions customs history the king and the empire well when we used to have an empire that is
2100445 right first off i can already foresee a small problem here
2100446 well we are obliged to use black children in the production
2100447 but hang on this is set in the 1930s in a small english seaside village i hadnt included any black children because there werent any
2100448 be that as it may but we will still have to include 4 caribbeans and two asians
2100449 but that will kill the authenticity of the whole story
2100450 now look here treasure i dont want to appear flippant but by the same token the headmaster in my story might just as well be a stark naked papuan elder wearing exotic bird feathers with a bone through his nose and sporting a penis sheath for christs sake
2100451 thats very true miss appleton and that is certainly a possibility that i and the program people cannot rule out and most certainly will explore at a later date
2100452 you are making a complete mockery of my whole story
2100453 well as a conciliatory gesture let us see if we can meet you half way here
2100454 as a small compromise what if we change the location of the school to birmingham set it in the 21st century in a government school and then we can easily accommodate hundreds of kids of color
2100455 well i am sorry miss appleton love to help you but if we cant insert a half a dozen of kids of color it cant go to air simple as that bbc policy

2100472 agents set valuations partly according to what they believe they can achieve from buyers on their books and a true valuation ultimately is what someone and their lender is prepared to pay in one case we sold a flat for 362 000 that had been on the market with another agent for 350 000 for three months with no interest poring over internet house prices cant prepare you for that
2100473 everyone should drop their price 25 that would get prices down to a level where banks are willing to lend everyone saves in interest payments and stamp duty estate agents get to keep their jobs

2100476 tegenover de media klopte justitie het hele verhaal op de marokkaan zou verhaal hebben gehaald vanwege mijn rol in de verdwijning van zijn twee landgenoten maar iedereen kent die marokkaan als dorpsgek die hier het verkeer regelt het had niets te maken met die moordzaak toch vond justitie het nodig om dat verband te leggen waardoor er krantenkoppen verschenen als moordverdachte slaat marokkaan in coma zo word ik de hele tijd gepiepeld

2100485 there was around 80 of them gathered and then there was a fight between two of them and the gardai were called but when they arrived there was a big surge of young fellas towards them and it turned into a full blown riot
2100486 i looked out and saw a young lad pulling a black handgun from a haversack and waving it around before shoving it down his trousers
2100487 they were shouting up to us that we were rats and said there would be more trouble to come
2100488 then just before midnight i saw two gardai knocked to the ground and attacked and a female member was blocked into a corridor we were terrified for them
2100489 the thugs were breaking bottles and bricks and running at people with them they were absolutely off their heads
2100490 we wonder if the cctv cameras here are working at all because there didnt seem to be any fear among the mob
2100491 there was a report of one car damaged but we have not had any incidents of firearms being reported to us
2100492 we would be aware of the sensitivities in the area at the time and would try to react accordingly
2100493 all we want is to get out of here they can do what they like with the flats after were gone but if things keep going the way they are somebody will be killed an innocent person will lose their life and then it will be too late
2100494 there is ongoing co operation between the gardai and dublin city council with regard to estate management issues

2100510 twenty four hours before the opening of the olympic games in beijing rfa hasnt received an entry permit for our tibetan service broadcaster u s citizen dhondup gonsar we deplore this stonewalling by the chinese authorities
2100511 withholding media credentials and visas is standard practice by governments hostile to free expression which is enshrined in article 19 of the universal declaration of human rights we urge the chinese government to show the world it no longer fears uncensored media in local languages as is fitting for an emerging world power and olympics host
2100512 we call on the chinese government to immediately issue mr gonsars olympic entry permit and on ioc president jacques rogge to demand in the spirit of free and fair competition that the games embody that mr gonsar be permitted to cover the olympic games

2100515 thats the type of football team we have to be and thats the personality we have to have
2100516 thats the thing our players are getting to and thats the thing we are getting to as a staff we have to be a tough minded football team
2100517 from the first time coach briles addressed us its been great
2100518 he comes in with a winning attitude thats what we needed i love this new coaching staff
2100519 were going to be better than weve been in years every year weve lacked something we would start off real strong and then fall off to the wayside i think this year we can finally put it all together for 12 games straight and hopefully make it to a bowl game
2100520 it might be decided as we jog out on the field for season opener pre game
2100521 we just consider those opportunites for guys to make plays to win football games and thats all were thinking about
2100522 were not trying to be cute or different or anything like that what were trying to do is give our team a chance to win
2100523 one of the first meetings i had with the cornerbacks in my office i saw we had two guys on scholarship at any university much less a big 12 university you need more people than that in the room
2100524 so we started looking for some opportunities to move some people over to create some competition and get our best guys on the field and thats what has transpired
2100525 the linebacker crew i think is going to be the strength of our football team because weve got a bunch of guys there that can play
2100526 they really do a great job of complementing each other because theyre all really good football players
2100527 its a great advantage for us because we have six or seven that can play so were in good shape as far as that goes with our depth issue
2100528 sure its boyish humor perhaps to wish for something like that but at the same time its something people feel very strongly about theyre concerned about where he would take the nation
2100529 im pleased that in our discussions with ontario that weve been able to get to this place where the federal government can join in the support
2100530 its good news for the greater toronto area for sports facilities and its good news for ontario its good news for canada
2100531 one has to look at a couple of major issues here
2100532 one is the cost of security who bears what part of the cost for security theres also the question of infrastructure investments because a lot of the investments that relate to the pan am games relate to permanent infrastructure which can be dealt with in different ways with the federal infrastructure funding that we have available

2100627 there was an incident on the gold coast recently where the police were chasing a fellow who hadnt stopped for some mundane reason
2100628 they couldnt catch up with him so they tasered him the use of the taser which is touted as an alternative to the police drawing their gun and shooting is being used in ordinary everyday mundane policing situations

2100768 the second thing is that we have not only done that but we have taken that launcher again at full scale out to the west coast and just as recently as yesterday july 30 i got the results back from the latest round of tests

2100788 the program is scheduled for thursday october 20 2005 at 1 30 p
2100789 when i started doing yoga with mandy i noticed many things
2100790 my legs getting leaner my arms getting stronger and most importantly an inner strength i feel like im getting a meditation a workout and time with my friend all rolled into one hour
2100791 in terms of funding priorities we continued our focus on critical national preparedness capabilities which of course are consistent with our national preparedness guidelines and the national response framework which we released at the beginning of the year
2100792 a particular focus has been improved explosive device deterrence prevention and protection
2100793 almost every single terrorist act in the west since september 11 has involved an ied
2100794 when we prioritize ieds as a focus we are prioritizing what is far and away the greatest threat in the west with respect to terrorist attacks
2100795 it does not mean that were limiting this to the very kind of sophisticated improved explosive devices and roadside bombs you see in iraq and afghanistan this is a much broader category
2100796 not manufactured as part of a military program or some institutionalized way of making bombs
2100797 thats one of the reasons weve tried hard to make sure that we fund projects that are capital investments or investments in training capabilities and not investments in simply regular operating expenses
2100798 i think one of the things were going to look to are what are the quality of the applications coming in for as we start to see applications coming in for things that look more like ordinary necessary expenses and less like investment in real terrorism capabilities were going to know we need to start to perhaps shift our priorities either to other communities or maybe other kinds of programs
2100799 one of the things im pretty focused on and i hope my successor will be is making sure that the homeland security program doesnt begin to become so broadly defined that it is essentially a general revenue sharing or block grant program
2100800 i feel confident that cities states and regions are continuing to learn how best to apply the grant money they get from dhs so that it has the greatest possible effect on the security of their communities
2100801 grants will assist states and vulnerable cities better prepare and respond to acts of terror natural disasters or other man made emergencies
2100802 so this type of money with the support from the federal government gives the states and the territories more of an opportunity to continue to make investments to better prepare their jurisdictions
2100803 ive always maintained if youve got us ready to go and equipped very well for a natural disaster its very easy to transition into the homeland security arena the terrorist arena
2100804 no lo conozco pero escuch que rudy ulloa el choferata de kirchner anda con 100 palos verdes y lo quiere comprar

2100841 there is an increasing capability of the iraqi security forces
2100842 they have grown tremendously even in the 11 months weve been here the capability of the iraqi security force has certainly contributed both the army and the police the sons of iraq are part of the security elements in the northern provinces and they have helped in some areas like hawijah samarra and some other places
2100843 are starting to get their act together and providing jobs for people
2100844 were starting to transition those elements into other organizations such as a civil service corps to help rebuild roads pipelines projects things like that

2101035 user led content production is build on iterative evolutionary development models in which often very large communities of participants make a number of usually very small incremental changes to the established knowledge base thereby enabling a gradual improvement in quality which under the right conditions can nonetheless outpace the speed of product development in the conventional industrial model
2101036 such modes of content creation involving large communities of users who act without an all controling coordinating hierarchy operate along lines which are fluid flexible heterarchical and organized as required by the ongoing process of development they are more closely aligned with the emergent organizational principles in social communities than with the predetermined supposedly optimized rigid structures of governance in the corporate sphere user led content creation in this new model harnesses the collected collective intelligence of all participants and manages though in some cases better than in others to direct their contributions to where they are best able to make a positive impact

2101130 we are very pleased with the results and acceptance of our educational offerings and the global reach we have achieved in such a short period of time
2101131 we are currently busy introducing the specialist and master component of our enterprise 2 0 certificate program which addresses how to improve collaboration using web 2 0 tools like wikis blogs rss and social networking within an enterprise i am extremely pleased with the content of the training program which should be a must have for any organization that wants to improve knowledge sharing retention and innovation
2101132 given this is an ambitious target and we dont know in detail how to limit greenhouse gas emissions to realise a 2 degree target we should be prepared to adapt to 4c
2101133 even if we get the best possible global agreement to reduce greenhouse gasses on any rational basis you should be preparing for a 20 risk of temperatures increasing by more than 3 5c so i think bob watson is quite right
2101134 we are very happy with the performance of our first round of sites and look forward to getting the rest of our stars online

2101150 they did an excellent job i think they did very well and i think everyone learned a lot

2101168 during the recruitment process judge rosenberg former mayor of the city sent an e mail to the council with a recommendation regarding one of the applicants apparently under the mistaken perception that the city council was responsible for appointing the chief of police
2101169 against these strong privacy interests there is no strong public interest in disclosure the only possible public interest served by disclosure of the e mail regarding the unsuccessful applicant is to assist the public in determining whether the city manager is accurately carrying out his responsibilities in investigating and approving applicants for the police chief position however such checks on the process are not necessary when the top five applicants were interviewed by panels made up of various individuals including local residents disclosure of the e mail would serve no other purpose than to embarrass the unsuccessful applicant and unnecessarily intrude upon the privacy of both the applicant and the author
2101170 petitioner disagrees with the citys assertion that this would be only public interest served by disclosure
2101171 the overarching principal is to protect the privacy of the individual and the principal must be applied in this case not withstanding the circumstances under which the case is now before the court in balancing the public interest in disclosure against the competing public interest of preventing secrecy in government the court finds based on this document that disclosure would be an unwanted invasion into the privacy of the applicant and the court finds no compelling public interest in disclosure and the need for protecting the privacy of individuals in this class of circumstances clearly out weighs any public interest in disclosure

2101173 it seems like every meeting is so confrontational last tuesdays meeting what happened was we were on the question part and greenwald asked several questions and it was already about 12 minutes for that if i give one council member five minutes i try to allocate five minutes for the other she was debating she was badgering she was in a way insulting the consultant
2101174 im trying to be more effective and efficient in our meeting so we can address our business
2101175 im hoping we can work a little more collegially on the council
2101176 they have to decide how they want me to run the meeting so ill be putting more on them if theres a complaint about how im running the meeting i want to ask them what they want me to do im looking at whats best for davis not whats best for our council members
2101177 asmundson too expressed concerns about the cost of the projects the estimated cost for the wastewater plant upgrade which is required by the state rose by about 50 million in the past six months
2101178 i am at mayor your new policy of only having fifteen minutes of public comment before the meeting starts its not democratic it shuts down opposition it shuts down good ideas i get inspired by listening to public comment from people it shows lack of flexibility and you are doing a great disservice to the citizens who want to participate in government and their sense of empowerment you wonder why people dont sign up to be on commissions well when you give them fifteen minutes public comment for all the issues it really shows that you are not interested in what people have to say i really urge you to get the citizens involved and not belittle us by allowing only fifteen minutes of public comment
2101179 also the scheduling of these issues to have a controversial issue like the general plan update which was affecting the entire community to schedule it at 5 00 when people like myself have to take off from work to get here this is not what our city is about davis is supposed to be a model of democracy
2101180 let me just talk a little about the public comment at first this was supposed to be just a workshop but we decided to put 15 minutes for those to speak that couldnt make it to public comment at the regular meeting if there are needs to have more discussion well have it at the end what im trying to do here is trying to juggle conflicting demands some council members dont want to have too long meetings some council members dont want to have that many meetings but we are trying to make sure that we are having a healthy public engagement and were going to be looking into how we can do that the fifteen minute rule if we have to go on we have business to take care of the council met at five oclock we have other business to do i wanted to make sure council had an opportunity to have dinner before too long and so thats why the fifteen minutes
2101181 i share the concerns that a number of the members of the public had for example when you said that initially you were going to have a workshop without any public comment we always when we discuss any item have always had public comment its been understood that it is not something that is at the discretion of the mayor
2101182 i personally feel that limiting public comment is a huge mistake in terms of time theres been very few times when public comment really is very long and when it does its usually because there is a room full of young children who want to keep a hockey rink open or something and youre not going to want to cut them off i guarantee you and its going to look very bad when you let them talk for a half an hour but you havent let other citizens talk for over fifteen minutes it will look arbitrary and capricious
2101183 how it would be financed is a question about borrowing money more significant to davis citizens is how it is going to be repaid or in other words what is this going to cost me i dont suggest i have the precise answer but i do know that based on mortgage amortization tables 450 million at 6 percent over 30 years has an annual payment of approximately 32 4 million or about 500 for every man woman and child now in davis every year for the next 30 years plus the surface water given this cost i offer my thanks to council member sue greenwald for asking hard questions we cant avoid upgrading the treatment plant but it would seem to me that a serious discussion of water conservation measures ought to have as much or more priority for the council as how to finance such a project conservation often costs much less than increasing supply
2101184 in my 4 years with her on the dais she never had her questions ready i think i remember one or two draft motions but mostly she does it on the fly
2101185 i wonder what would have happened if sue has said okay give someone else a chance but please i would like to ask a few more questions at the end
2101186 as for the costs it seems sues estimates are much higher than staffs i would like to know how both get their numbers
2101187 sue greenwald unprepared what a preposterous statement by mike harrington right out of the karl rove handbook
2101188 wow that comes to a half billion dollars for both projects
2101189 vanguard you started this in the middle of her questioning so it doesnt seem as tedious as watching the entire questioning or sitting through it
2101190 i should add that dpd never called me to ask where my figures came from
2101191 i think if the mayor had simply asked the councilwoman to postpone her questions until other council members had a chance to ask questions and the councilwoman didnt immediately fly off the handle this whole sad story couldve been avoided
2101192 she should write down a list of short questions in advance and then ask them and let the expert answer without interruption
2101193 in response to the citys request we will ask the board to consider adopting a new cease and desist order at its april board meeting
2101194 however its time to make sure the city fully understands how serious we are about protecting our regions precious groundwater resources from unnecessary pollution that impacts its beneficial uses
2101195 i have discussed this problem with a state regulator and with a number of private sector wastewater treatment engineers none of them feel that we will be fined or forced to resort to the more expensive reverse osmosis
2101196 overall this is impacting 1 000 positions throughout the u s impacting every u s location
2101197 we dont have an exact number at this point but between the two facilities 16 percent of the 1 000 will come from the asheville arden and fletcher facilities

2101340 the classic is that theres always some new cure for cancer that comes out
2101341 and unfortunately people become disappointed when it doesnt come to fruition but part of that is because it was preliminary findings and then when there are more mature findings or when its analyzed a different way with a larger sample size it really didnt come out to those same findings

2101354 rather than trying to scare children who dont make either policy decisions or even household economic decisions in the first place we should be teaching them basic science and principles of fair play
2101355 instead of encouraging kids to commit suicide as a way to protect the environment we should teach them that the natural environment in rich countries is actually improving
2101356 for example the air and water are getting cleaner and forests are expanding
2101357 we should teach kids that free markets increase productivity and spur technological progress so that people can use less and thus spare more land and water for nature the prosperity that comes from economic growth reduces the size of peoples environmental footprints

2101399 we agree with tamsyn that its a problem but its a problem that the ioc international olympic committee is throwing enormous efforts at to solve
2101400 i think the best attitude for athletes here is to concentrate on their performances and leave the detection of cheats to the appropriate authorities
2101401 the international olympic committee has a responsibility to ensure that we have a fair games and that means a proper and rigorous approach to testing so that everyone has a fair chance everyone has a fair go and that our athletes are on the same level playing field literally as everyone else

2101490 an attack would be unlikely to stop the iranian nuclear program
2101491 u s policy statements calling for regime change are more likely to serve the interests of iranian government agencies interested in cracking down on those who advocate expanding civil liberties rather than to advance u s policy interests

2101526 he believes that broadening the definition would enable a critical care doctor to keep a patient alive for an hour or two longer even when hope of recovery was gone to enable organs to be collected
2101527 we may need to seek legal advice the mental capacity act doesnt define the phrase clearly
2101528 i think one of the concerns about too widely construing best interests is that there is currently a strong drive to implement living wills in practice and in legislation one of the key problems with living wills is their application in circumstances where it would obviously be contrary to best medical practice enacted in the best interests of the patient it is no surprise that the pro euthanasia people are very interested in living wills because they see an opportunity to use the denial of treatment that would be encouraged as the content of a living will as a form of soft euthanasia
2101529 this article suggests changes should be made to the life support laws so that organ donors wish to donate their organs can be granted because removing organs for transplant may be in a donors best interests
2101530 the central issue here is is it in the best interests of an organ donor to have their organs donated when they die
2101531 it is bizarre to suggest that the giving of organs will benefit the giver so much that it is essential in their best interest when they are dead
2101532 chris rudge suggests that donors best interests should be drawn more widely to include honouring a wish that his or her organs should be used to help others
2101533 it should be the dying donors best interest to be honoured and respected in life and death because of their inherent human dignity and if this is contradicted by manipulation or exploitation of the dead persons body in order to harvest organs then it is not in the best interest of the donor to have their organs donated it is worrying that this best interest language could be used to trade off respect for the dead and harbour living dead cadavers in order to increase organ donation transactions
2101534 alarm bells rang when i read i would like to see a recognition that a patients best interests can encompass aspects beyond the purely medical another slippery slope i fear
2101535 living wills euthanasia holland springs to mind here as having something similar etc would all be made much easier to introduce abortions too up to full term and even infant killings could be justified under such a policy who would judge the global best interest of a patient a doctor a panel and would anything written or expressed then become legally the patients best interest or even legally binding even though in reality it isnt at a time when the state wishes to take control over our bodies see my earlier post and has made consistent progress in this direction for years now it would be so easy for them to further their aims if this were to become the norm i feel that chris rudge is thinking one dimensionally at present and doesnt seem to have considered the broader picture yet

2101552 and this is the will of him that sent me that every one which seeth the son and believeth on him may have everlasting life and i will raise him up at the last day
2101553 being born again not of corruptible seed but of incorruptible by the word of god which liveth and abideth for ever

2101578 the casualisation of work in many sectors and industries in new zealand has been a major concern for unions over the last few years many sfwu members in the food processing sector are worried about how their employer is using temporary workers instead of hiring full time permanent staff workers are also worried the poor conditions offered to temp workers and the lack of job security recently sfwu members at griffins eta in auckland have been on a recruitment drive to get temporary workers to join the union and air their issues this month griffins wiri members recruited 46 workers and are now seeking to elect a delegate from amongst them to represent the issues of temps employers argue that temp workers are good because they can be brought in when permanent staff need a break or are sick however on some union food sites the ratio of casual staff to permanent staff is creeping up on some sites one third of the workers are casuals or temporary workers the following points have been raised by temp workers at recent union meetings we need to talk with and organise temporary workers on our union sites temporary workers are not the people that the union needs to be criticising criticism needs to be levelled at the employer for hiring temp staff and trying to undermine hard won working conditions for unionised permanent staff there is goodwill from union delegates and workmates who feel their temporary workmates are getting a unfair deal temp workers want to join the union so they can address the issues they have with job security etc including temp workers with permanent workers in the union has led to a feeling of stronger unity on the job at food work sites
2101579 labours steve maharey contends that the jobs that are appearing are
2101580 the proposed changes demonstrate once again our government s commitment to protecting the most vulnerable members of the workforce and to providing an employment environment that is conducive to all parties conducting their relationship in good faith
2101581 under the changes the department of labour will develop a code of employment practice for casual and non standard employment which will make it easier for employers to understand and comply with their obligations to casual and temporary workers
2101582 the code is also expected to help employees understand what they are entitled to by law
2101583 an awareness raising campaign that aims to increase workers knowledge of their statutory rights in the workplace is also planned
2101584 at present only the employment relations authority and the employment court have the power to decide whether an employee has a fixed term contract or is actually a permanent employee an amendment to the employment relations act will extend this power to labour inspectors giving employers and employees a simpler process for confirming their status
2101585 the rights at work for casual workers are about to get better and no party should stand it the way of this much needed law change
2101586 there is an army of casual employees often low paid workers many of whom are totally insecure about their terms of employment their hours of work their entitlements to sick leave and holidays and their employment status in relation to any workplace problems
2101587 the insecurity of their employment makes it difficult for them to assert their rights and also effects many other aspects of their lives in areas like housing stability access to loans and superannuation savings
2101588 of course there are instances of genuine casuals where the arrangements are necessary in normal business operations
2101589 that casualisation of working hours should be opposed and legislation should entitle part time workers to a basic minimum number of hours pay per day

2101804 the john mccain of 2008 is not the maverick of 2000 on the most urgent national security challenges we face iraq iran and al qaeda in afghanistan and pakistan there is no day light between george bush and john mccain he has embraced president bushs failed policies and will continue them its unfortunate hes changed so much in just eight years
2101805 the mccain campaign is determined to give their paris hilton ad a run for its money in the desperation department and theyve succeeded only in shining a light on the fact that the john mccain of today is unrecognizable from the john mccain of just a couple years ago the real question is what happened to the john mccain we used to know and why he changed overnight into a george bush nominee with a karl rove campaign the new john mccain supports the bush tax giveaways for the wealthy he once denounced opposes his own immigration bill flip flopped on torture and runs negative ads after calling for an honorable campaign frankly it tells you everything about this election that the mccain campaign spins its wheels recycling what we said about john mccain way back when while scrambling and sputtering to explain away governor pawlentys praise of barack obama today

2101831 members of the apache nation extend a gracious gesture of solidarity with all indigenous peoples in inviting our earth family to join in prayer for a blue sky opening ceremonies in beijing on 8 8 08
2101832 on 8 8 08 we are including prayers during our second big bear medicine wheel around southern californias san bernardino mountains to purify beijings atmosphere to help enhance a beautiful blue sky opening we ask you to join in also praying for clear blue skies in cities around the world like l a
2101833 we believe that the blue skies may continue if humanity also focuses during the games on going back to respecting mother earth by using her natural products in our homes and workplaces
2101834 cancer causing toxic chemicals in our household and beauty products then escape and become a significant environmental pollutant
2101835 in blessing mother earth and her skies we are celebrating and empowering feminine energies the grandmothers say these prayers are healing and returning the original beauty and sweetness back to all womens hearts
2101836 women can do wonders to purify the planet since they buy the family products combining chinas green steps and these other practical and spiritual solutions with the planets aligning on 8 8 08 could make this a pivotal green olympics

2101847 democrat sounds like democracy which is what people signed up for when they came here but the word for republican in chinese sounds a little too close to the word for communist party
2101848 theres uneasiness in the image of a black president particularly among naturalized citizens who have grown up in monocultures
2101849 young asian americans have become dramatically more involved in the 2008 presidential campaign obama can take a lot of credit for that
2101850 i like a tough guy who can get the job done

2101852 i dont know i just do not seem to have to motivation to post on it any more
2101853 i have to admit that even as a tory i have quite a lot of time and no small degree of respect for boris do i agree with him not that often having watched him operate its clear that it would be very unwise indeed to be taken in by the bumbling upper class twit of the year routine that most people will associate with him from his appearances on have i got news for you look past the bunter ish public schoolboy act and watch him at work in a more serious political arena and it quick becomes apparent that hes no fool and pound for pound possibly the sharpest political operator in the current tory party certainly not an opponent to be taken lightly

2101856 i happen to believe that we will come out stronger if people feel that their voices were heard and their views respected i think that is a very big part of how we actually come out unified
2101857 because i know from just what im hearing that theres incredible pent up desire and i think that people want to feel like ok its a catharsis were here we did it and then everybody get behind sen obama that is what most people believe is the best way to go
2101858 we are trying work all this through with the democratic national committee and with the obama campaign
2101859 we are working together to make sure the fall campaign and the convention are a success
2101860 at the democratic convention we will ensure that the voices of everyone who participated in this historic process are respected and our party will be fully unified heading into the november election
2101861 its important that her supporters have a voice in some way
2101862 she is a duly registered candidate who got a lot of votes and she is going to do what she wants to do
2101863 you dont have to be a delegate or party insider to witness this historic moment firsthand

2101865 they contributed to the candidate in this race that is most in favor of fueling and juicing big oil prices while working families are getting hit at the pump and the pocketbook every single day
2101866 they have contributed 2 million to john mccains campaign more than a million in june
2101867 the 2 8 billion that obama gave the oil companies in the 05 energy bill would have bought a lot of tire gauges
2101868 although health care leaders say long term care is important to include in health care reform plans the presidential candidates have not yet addressed this issue which is certain to become an increasing concern for american families
2101869 federalizing the cost on long term care is going to be much more expensive than the current system
2101870 the extent that you could actually make the premiums pay for it would be far better than putting it on trust funds
2101871 were making huge strides in medicaid by moving long term care away from institutions we would lose that momentum if the federal government took it over

2101878 we need to reinforce our feeling that they need to keep the pressure on government to make sure the central newfoundland regional health centre gets all that it is due
2101879 any time you can focus attention on something it is the awareness that makes it works

2102008 i have a deep faith so i draw from the christian faith
2102009 the problem with his view of sin is its a decidedly non christian view of sin sin is a transgression of gods laws not an individuals values
2102010 h e is confused about what christianity believes which isnt unique because many people who identify themselves as christian are equally confused but second his lack of a moral compass
2102011 im praying for unexpected unanticipated unforcasted rain that starts two minutes before the speech is set to begin would it be wrong to pray for rain
2102012 the purpose of the federal law is to combat recreational drug use not to regulate a states medical practices because the federal law does not compel the states to impose criminal penalties for marijuana possession the requirement that counties issue cards identifying those against whom california has opted not to impose criminal penalties does not positive conflict with the us controlled substances act
2102013 this latest appeal is not about politicians seeking clarity in the law its about the supervisors opposition to any use of medicinal cannabis
2102014 the supervisors arrogant behavior is an affront to their constituents and a gross waste of taxpayers dollars
2102015 a patient to periodically renew a doctors recommendation regarding medical marijuana use
2102016 im sitting on the back deck of a bed and breakfast in old perlican
2102017 i wondered if they would be interested in negotiating to lease the property for a tower
2102018 i was told they would get back to me i called them a couple of times since and im still waiting for them to get back to me
2102019 yet they have a cell tower at the new golf course at pitchers pond whiteway
2102020 that seems a little silly i know businessmen love to do business on the golf course but i think its a public necessity to have good cell phone reception these days its not a luxury item any more
2102021 id rather take the time and get it right and put it out and be proud of what i put out instead of just rushing it because people are expecting it to come out soon
2102022 i was working part time at a gym i was finishing up my schooling and i was trying to get out of fishing but i had no plan
2102023 i cant drive around from here to vancouver in my car selling cds from my trunk
2102024 so im only going to release it when everything is in place and i can do it properly
2102025 i studied the writing a lot more trying to get better at my lyrics every song you write is hopefully better than the last one you kind of learn as you go
2102026 i think finally my song writing has matured enough where i feel that its worthy of some national attention
2102027 some of the music on the cd theres some of the lighter stuff theres still some rock
2102028 were moderate rock but there is a lot of singer songwriter stuff and some of it is kind of down east sounding theres elements of that
2102029 overall i think its a better group than we were last year the bulk of them that are left they all seem to be artists theyre not just singers
2102030 the new crop of idol is out so with the exception of my east coast support of course the national exposure its still there but im not in peoples minds anymore
2102031 thats why ive really got to make sure that this is the right product now i have to go back to the grassroots level and win the fans one by one and sell cds one by one
2102032 so were kind of starting back from scratch in a way but were starting from scratch a lot higher up on the ladder than we were last time

2102039 um hi im really sick with this baby im x weeks pregnant and i wanted to know if you had any good tips
2102040 hi im 14 weeks pregnant and i have a headache i took tylenol hours ago and its not helping can i get a prescription for something stronger
2102041 but its a headache i can barely see to drive i dont need anything too strong just something more than tylenol
2102042 you need to see a doctor have you tried laying down in a dark room
2102043 hahahahaa i have kids laying down in a dark room doesnt happen unless i chain them to a wall somewhere
2102044 the office is closing anyway if its so bad you can go to the er
2102045 yes you do have an infection why didnt you see your ob
2102046 this is nurse ratched from obs just calling to remind you about your appointment tomorrow
2102047 the appointment is very important pre eclampsia is very serious you could die

2102049 oh you should have called first we might have wanted you to go straight to ultrasound
2102050 studies are showing that the addition of fluoride to municipal water supplies is having little effect on oral health
2102051 instead the recent studies provide mounting evidence that fluoride can adversely affect the neurological development of children
2102052 so technically were still in the experimental stage after 60 years
2102053 has been controlled for far too long by the dental lobby
2102054 theyre preoccupied by one tissue the teeth whereas the opponents of fluoridation like myself see the body slightly differently
2102055 i believe health canada is not giving the citizens the truth on this issue
2102056 no studies have investigated a possible relationship between fluoridated water and lower iqs in children arthritic symptoms in adults underactive thyroid glands increased bone fractures in children and earlier onset of puberty
2102057 the science has not been done in canada if you dont look you dont find
2102058 i think there is a very strong case for the precautionary removal of this mass medication from our drinking water
2102059 there are studies which show changes in iq from populations exposed to fluoride in drinking water the thing is if you look at an individual you never really know that they may have been five points higher on the iq scale
2102060 we rely on science and expert reports from around the world

2102071 is arranged marriage for you now you can find out

2102073 why would i care about your life how can anything substantial regarding ecclesiology come from people who do not have the proper credentials who are self publishing why would i want to read material that has not gone through the rigors of selection and editing
2102074 the best way i think to do that is to have a strategy so that my delegates feel like they ve had a role and that their legitimacy has been validated
2102075 it s as old as greek drama theres a catharsis everybody comes and they want to yell and scream and have their opportunity and i think that s all to the good
2102076 i dont think were looking for catharsis i think what we are looking for is energy and excitement about the prospects of changing this country and i think that people who supported a whole range of different candidates during the primaries are going to come out of that convention feeling absolutely determined that we have to take the white house back
2102077 shes campaigning for me in nevada and florida she is very enthusiastic about the need for a unified party i think we are going to have a terrific convention as is true in all conventions were still working out the mechanics of the four days our staffs are in communication my staff with senator clintons staff but i dont anticipate any problems
2102078 hes been very supportive i thought he showed extraordinary restraint in a fairly provocative interview
2102079 i couldnt ask for him to be any more gracious or supportive since the campaign ended
2102080 we are going to correct that this week hopefully with your help
2102081 im going to see my grandma who i havent seen in almost 18 19 months and who is getting to the age where i want to make sure i am spending time with her on a consistent basis so that she can see her great grandchildren and i want to spend time with those children as well
2102082 we had a very long primary the longest primary in history
2102083 so i can imagine folks need a break from politics and they didnt really get one like they normally do
2102084 the electorate has spoken but we dont care because we know better
2102085 in a 13 minute session variations on that same question of mrs clinton and how to assuage the feelings of her supporters in denver were asked several times to hear mr obama tell it there is really no problem no controversy other than the one the press seems intent on creating
2102086 the most recent new york times poll puts her favorability rating among democrats at 70 percent and mr obama s at 66 percent
2102087 in a 13 minute session variations on that same question of mrs clinton and how to assuage the feelings of her supporters in denver were asked several times to hear mr obama tell it there is really no problem no controversy other than the one the press seems intent on creating
2102088 look obama won the democratic primary fair and square no matter how flawed that process may be
2102089 during the primaries hillary clinton clearly demonstrated that she has widespread and enthusiastic support among democrats that needs to be acknowledged at the convention
2102090 there is nothing worse then a winner who won t stop reminding people they won
2102091 i voted for hillary and i m still angry about how disrespectful he was of the clintons legacy and their history of working for poor middle america he pretended to take the holier than thou attitude while making press out of nothing seriously a bowling game
2102092 without white women over the age of 30 by a large margin obama will not win in november
2102093 further obama doesn t appear to have any natural instincts for getting into a knife fight and as things get tough i would be hard pressed to think of anyone better to have in a fight against mccain and whatever vp candidate he picks
2102094 so now the republicans are going around this is the kind of thing they do i dont understand it theyre going around sending like little tire gauges making fun of this idea as if this is barack obamas energy plan
2102095 now two points one they know theyre lying about what my energy plan is but the other thing is theyre making fun of a step that every expert says would absolutely reduce our oil consumption by 3 to 4 its like these guys take pride in being ignorant you know they think its funny that theyre making fun of something that is actually true
2102096 because this is serious business instead of running ads about paris hilton and britney spears they should go talk to some energy experts and actually make a difference
2102097 just shut up you old bat write the check put the bumper sticker on your car the sign in your yard and pull that lever for whoever we prop up in front of you
2102098 sen obama amp supporters still don t get it and apparentrly never will
2102099 as the saying goes with friends like that we don t need enemies hillary supporters are of voting age they don t need to be placated like small children they need to get off their hypocritical asses and support the candidate with the vastly superior policies whether they like him or not
2102100 no one individual takes precedence over the best interests of one s country not even a clinton
2102101 for the good of the nation and party im conceding to hillary and accepting clinton obama
2102102 outcast low down you cant make it youre nothing youre from nobody subclass underclass
2102103 when you see jesse jackson when my name goes in nomination your name goes in
2102104 your petty vindictiveness could not possibly be any more transparent
2102105 get over it stop being so ridiculously selfish and hypocritical it is an embarrassment that jesse has to continue to contend with the likes of you
2102106 jackson supporters don t need to be placated like small children they need to get off their hypocritical asses and support the candidate with policies vastly superior to george bush whether they like him or not
2102107 energy and excitement about the prospects of changing this country
2102108 people who supported a whole range of candidates are going to come out of that convention feeling absolutely determined that we emphasis mine have to take the white house back
2102109 really no problem no controversy other than the ones the press seems intent on creating
2102110 why is chelsea clinton so ugly because her father is janet reno
2102111 so there you have it obama just stated for the record that there is no need for the democratic party to unite and that he has no need for hillary clinton voters to support him in november shall i tick off the list of battleground states obama will lose if he doesn t get the hillary vote without white women over the age of 30 by a large margin obama will not win in november
2102112 polling shows that mrs clinton remains as popular among democrats these days as mr obama despite his having campaigned for two months as the party nominee
2102113 so there you have it obama just stated for the record that there is no need for the democratic party to unite and that he has no need for hillary clinton voters to support him in november
2102114 if the process is at its core flawed then how can any outcome be considered to be fair and square

2102121 seit marcel duchamp seine ready mades industriell gefertigte und vom k nstler lediglich signierte gegenst nde ausstellte wei man dass ein objekt ein urinal ein flaschentrockner o in dem moment zu einem kunstwerk werden kann in dem der k nstler es dazu bestimmt
2102122 interessant ist der vorwurf den beuys duchamp machte nicht die ready mades st rten ihn denn die entsprachen auch seiner gleichung von kunst und leben im sinne von jeder mensch ein k nstler sondern das kalte schweigen
2102123 wenn jeder bildender k nstler werden oder es zumindest versuchen kann wird keiner erfolg haben zum erfolg ben tigt man ein minimum an aufmerksamkeit das ist nichts neues neu aber ist dass es keine logische verbindung mehr gibt zwischen der laufbahn die jemand beruflich oder von der ausbildung her beschreitet und der aufmerksamkeit die er erh lt um erfolg zu haben gen gt es heutzutage zu wissen wie man sich verkauft
2102124 je unsichtbarer die kunst im rahmen ihres traditionellen kanons wird umso mehr muss der k nstler mit subversiven mitteln f r seine sichtbarkeit sorgen und auf diesem gebiet haben die lebenden k nstler im vergleich zu ihren vorg ngern allerlei tr mpfe in der hand sie k nnen sammler treffen und versuchen deren interesse zu wecken was legitim ist sie k nnen aber auch auf die nachfrage reagieren was weniger legitim ist wenn man bedenkt dass ein k nstler sich zuallererst dadurch definiert dass er ein risiko eingeht dass er werke schafft die das publikum nicht erwartet
2102125 ein amerikaner in paris auch der gleichnamige film 1951 von vincente minelli gedreht wurde ein gro er erfolg ihm folgte eine ganze serie ber k nstler und ihre frauen in paris beginnend mit irma la douce und vincent van gogh gespielt von shirley maclaine und kirk douglas

2102175 the presumptive democratic presidential nominee is heading off for hawaii on friday for a break that will be his last before the november election
2102176 the house is going to have its own gang of republicans and democrats who want to push for more drilling to relieve gas prices the democrats in the group led by rep neal abercrombie d hawaii will be bucking speaker nancy pelosi d calif who earlier thursday called efforts to open up new areas to drilling a hoax abercrombie announced late thursday that he and rep john peterson r pa one of the loudest voices for more drilling will form a bipartisan working group to discuss energy issues
2102177 the people are standing up and saying yes we can
2102178 simply standing up and saying you cant drill your way out of this doesnt work
2102179 now the latest scheme is well were going to drill offshore
2102180 this is not real i know its tempting the polls say the majority of americans think thats one of the ways were going to solve this problem but its not real
2102181 i think john mccains proposal for a three month tax holiday is a bad idea
2102182 in this campaign john mccain is offering the same old gimmicks that will provide almost no short term relief to folks who are struggling with high gas prices gimmicks that will only increase our addiction for another four years

2102193 a woman would be great because that would help get the hillary people on board but someone not a washington insider someone with a bright mind someone who cares about civil rights but who who perhaps someone who could re awaken the dreams and visions of my father and the feelings of hope that the country had then
2102194 i am want the american people to see who i will ask me to help me govern as a result i am announcing today
2102195 i think it is bad for the universitys reputation if it is seen not to be independent of government meddling
2102196 universities traditionally stand on their independence and there is hardly a government in the world who would do what danny did
2102197 i would have to question an academic who would want to take the presidency after that
2102198 what should the new president expect from danny williams to me that raises a big question for me i would really question an academic who would want to take that position
2102199 we would have argued 50 years ago that a universitys independence as a research body would be compromised by governments that are heavy handed like that
2102200 having said that 50 years have gone by and one could easily accuse universities of gleefully getting involved in areas where interference with independent research is commonplace i think universities should be independent and they have less legs to stand on these days than they would have had 50 years ago because of corporate sponsored research

2102221 he does not want to put himself in a position where voters might begin to question his ability to be a strong lawmaker and the fewer public appearances he has with extended speech requirements probably the better it is for the campaign
2102222 on the other hand it is going to cause some citizens to be concerned about whether he can be effective as a persuader in the united states senate so it could have a mixed result
2102223 he does not want to put himself in a position where voters might begin to question his ability to be a strong lawmaker

2102225 nobody should stand at the courthouse door to predetermine who has access to the courts he said
2102226 my point is that anyone can sue anyone else even god said chambers in explaining his cause of action
2102227 if i had just stood here and said the courts should be open to everybody then you would all have yawned this lawsuit grabbed attention
2102228 nobody should stand at the courthouse door to predetermine who has access to the courts

2102239 we are working together to make sure the fall campaign amp the convention are a success at the dem convention we will ensure that the voices of everyone who participated in this historic process are respected and our party will be fully unified heading into the november election
2102240 but advisers to the new york senator hrc said she will almost certainly not ask to have her name placed in formal nomination at the convention avoiding a divisive vote on the night obama is expected to become the democratic partys first black presidential nominee
2102241 hell who other than the stones do we expect to be doing big venue tours at that age

2102246 bottled water sales have fallen garden centres have reported a 10 per cent rise in the sales of vegetable seeds in the past 12 months people are saving money by growing their own potatoes and carrots they are turning off their central heating for a few more months of the year and ditching their second car rather than buying an electric runaround and instead of carbon offsetting their holidays they are simply going on fewer of them its the downturn that has made greenery look unappetising but it may yet prove to do more than anything to save the planet
2102247 what if the current impasse ends up being more costly for the clintons

2102250 obama told reporters on his campaign plane that he talked separately this week to clinton and her husband the former president and that they were enthusiastic about having a smooth convention at the end of the month in denver
2102251 but during the primaries reasonable thinkers among the leadership knew that obama was unelectable he had zero executive experience and a history of embarrassingly extreme leftwing associations and ideas yet they were cowed against their inner judgment by a coalition of the media the soros club financiers the idealistic youth the clinton averse the new racialists and the professoriate to make a choice that had little to do with winning though obama is still the darling of the drive bys his gaffes reversals straddles and threats to strangle the economy is registering with the voters he is a loser but what if a crack forms and obama misses on the first ballot in denver when a hollow abilene consensus begins to fracture a high velocity implosion will follow
2102252 that evening joe brings out the bourbon and we talk late into the night about obama and his problems with rednecks
2102253 its not so much that we cling to guns and religion but guns and religion cling to us as a matter of culture
2102254 in the days before the convention started the other candidates withdrew
2102255 obamas popularity peaked in february and tanked through june it experienced a brief resurgence with the flurry of activity surrounding clinton suspending but not ending her campaign in early june then collapsed back into its nadir again

2102262 dont go into corporate america you know become teachers work for the community be social workers be a nurse those are the careers that we need and were encouraging our young people to do that but if you make that choice as we did to move out of the money making industry into the helping industry then your salaries respond

2102266 might be too subtle a point for some dogs tutorial on thugs
2102267 here is a man who grew up in a broken home whose father left at a young age and who was raised by a single mother its an admirable story of rising from rags to riches one that resonates
2102268 hes obviously not in the same league as britney spears or paris hilton theyve gone way too far with that but weve seen where strategies that have been derided by commentators have been effective with voters
2102269 but obamas not an elitist thats not a sustained campaign tactic here was someone who grew up with nothing verses the son of four star admirals its a nice try and a good diversion in the first part of august but painting him as an elitist is not a winning strategy going into the fall
2102270 in 2006 the chicago tribune reported that mrs obamas compensation at the university of chicago hospital where she is a vice president for community affairs jumped from 121 910 in 2004 just before her husband was elected to the senate to 316 962 in 2005 just after he took office and that does not count the money mrs obama receives from serving on corporate boards
2102271 mccain told those gathered for a town hall meeting that obama is a talented orator with an agenda that could be boiled down to simple policies the arizona republican opposes
2102272 the decision by the jury will now go through a number of reviews as provided by the rules and regulations of the commission
2102273 hamdan is now considered a convicted war criminal and is no longer considered an enemy combatant and will be held separately from the other detainees at guantanamo because of his new status

2102276 i hope the day comes that you are able to return to your wife and daughters and your country
2102277 we all know that obama is helping to pay off hillarys campaign debt and we also know that if the roles were reversed she would never entertain the thought of helping obama
2102278 isnt treating hillary with kid gloves the exact same kind of sexism that her supporters get so mad about
2102279 wanna bet tomorrows nydn editorial wont be so complimentary of the gitmo process

2102283 democracy my ass this about the sore losers clutching on their shattered dream for one nanosecond more
2102284 allowing the impression that hillary rodham clinton is off the short list for running mate bears some cost for barack obama his former rival and her husband are upping the ante
2102285 this is not the time for power politics and self aggrandisement
2102286 bill clinton set for speaking assignment at the convention note msnbc practically taking credit after the all day whine the comments are very interesting as well
2102287 i appreciate the response but my concern is not obama hes like a puppy that goes to whoever calls it its the people and i use the term loosely around him that make me apprehensive
2102288 mike gravel has a better chance of being the next vp than hillary

2102306 working together through programs like this one we hope to raise awareness of how we can better protect ourselves against identity theft and rid our homes and offices of unwanted clutter at the same time
2102307 i happen to believe that we will come out stronger if people feel that their voices were heard and their views were respected i think that is a very big part of how we actually come out unified
2102308 no decisions have been made and so we are trying to work all this through with the dnc and with the obama campaign
2102309 we are working together to make sure the fall campaign and the convention are a success at the democratic convention we will ensure that the voices of everyone who participated in this historic process are respected and our party will be fully unified heading into the november election
2102310 the abc article noted that she is not ruling out having her name placed in nomination this is actually a pretty substantial bargaining chip to have in her back pocket if you look at the mechanics of having your name placed in nomination
2102311 but what about the last 8 years of fiscal irresponsibility and incompetency
2102312 how come the democrats dont want oil drilling off the coasts
2102313 afford medicine or my brother and sisters not be able to go to college so you can have the satisfaction of hillary winning in eight years
2102314 womens issue also he is the divider by alienating the clintons who built up the party in the 90s he is sounding more like a spoiled brat who just wants to live off the older democrats successes
2102315 no matter what you did say fabricate exaggerate allude to conjure up pass along shout whisper fantasize publicize propagate proliferate cause tears about cause fears about stomp your feet over scream your fears over pollute dilute spin fold staple or mutilate hillary the end result will be the same its going to be obama
2102316 he later clarified that he didnt mean cash grants but his initial words were awfully vague
2102317 if you dont nominate me as your veepee i cant still be the spoiler at the convention it is a threat by hrc and it may do great damage to party cohesion if this threat is carried out i support her been consider for the vice presidential candidate but her resort to blackmail is pathetic
2102318 own democrate party do you really think hillary cares about you or women or her passion for health care taht obama wants the same thing and will give hillary to be head over that and all will get it
2102319 if there is not an explanation thats satisfactory acceptable and meets high moral standards the answer is no he would not be a prime candidate to make a major address to the convention
2102320 i feel theres hope now that hillary may get the nomination
2102321 one reason why this will never happen it would completely sour clintons chances of ever being the nominee again
2102322 if i am going down obama is coming down with me
2102323 turned me around and started kissing me and that was a real shock i first pushed him away i just told him no he tries to kiss me again he starts biting on my lip and then he forced me down on the bed i just was very frightened i tried to get away from him i told him no he wouldnt listen to me
2102324 i will make sure that we keep you up to date and involved with all of the convention activity
2102325 i dont think were looking for catharsis i think what were looking for is energy and excitement about the prospects of changing this country
2102326 senator obama and i share the goal of ensuring that the voices of everyone who participated in this historic process are respected
2102327 i happen to believe that we will come out stronger if people feel that their voices were heard and their views were respected i think that is a very big part of how we actually come out unified
2102328 because i know from just what im hearing that theres incredible pent up desire and i think that people want to feel like ok its a catharsis were here we did it and then everybody get behind sen obama that is what most people believe is the best way to go
2102329 no decisions have been made and so we are trying to work all this through with the dnc and with the obama campaign
2102330 sen clinton is 100 percent committed to helping barack obama become the next president of the united states
2102331 she is very appreciative of the continued commitment of her supporters and understands there are passionate feelings around the convention while no decisions have been made at this time they will be made collaboratively with sen clinton and her staff the dnc and sen obamas campaign and released at the appropriate time
2102332 hillary please dont accept vp nor a cabinet position do not bolster this frauds chances 4 years of mccain is far better than even 1 day of barry the fraud posted by borat obama august 07 2008 at 09 24 am
2102333 we spent most of last night working on a fix for a worm which was targeting people on facebook and placing messages on walls urging users to view a video that pretends to be hosted on a google or youtube web site
2102334 less than 002 percent of people on facebook have been affected all of whom we notified and suggested steps to remove the malware
2102335 if we get a report of a bug or a hole from a user a security researcher a reporter blogger or anyone we check it out and fix it as quickly as possible
2102336 in fact we appreciate it when help comes our way from the many security experts and organizations out there
2102337 due to the inability of dr major and the board of directors to work together effectively
2102338 i believe there should be no censorship but if someone publishes something which for example incites law breaking or violence they should be punished through the courts it is illogical to say people are law breakers before they speak let them speak first and then be responsible before the law this is the only logical approach
2102339 the state committee has always refused to tell people which literature is banned
2102340 freedom of information i everyone is free to look for acquire transfer prepare and distribute information ii freedom of mass media is guaranteed state censorship in mass media including press is prohibited
2102341 either we have censorship in which case there should be a law or we dont
2102342 i believe there should be no censorship but if someone publishes something which for example incites law breaking or violence they should be punished through the courts it is illogical to say people are law breakers before they speak let them speak first and then be responsible before the law this is the only logical approach
2102343 ive seen some texts that say it is halal permissible to kill non muslims or muslims who dont believe correctly
2102344 but the police or the national security ministry nsm secret police should be the ones who should identify the publishers of such bad literature
2102345 take control of the production import and distribution of religious literature items other religious informational materials and give its consent on the bases of the appeals of the religious institutions and relevant state bodies in accordance with the established procedure
2102346 people also have to trust those doing the expert analysis
2102347 i dont trust the state committee for work with religious organisations
2102348 from my perspective punishment for an offence such as confiscation of books is only lawful by decision of a court a court should decide this not officials
2102349 the possibility has to be there to challenge the decisions of any executive body
2102350 in court there is the possibility of comparing decisions openly this is the civilised way
2102351 there are youth who read and follow these ideas if we allowed publications freely thered be anarchy books have influence
2102352 if a book is connected with religion the printer will ask to see permission in writing from the state committee including the number of copies they are allowing to be printed
2102353 we have the desire to print literature here but it demands a lot of energy and money
2102354 whether or not there is permission from the state committee
2102355 we have to observe some formalities over publishing bulletins and importing books but there are no basic problems now
2102356 we had to give it to our brothers in dagestan
2102357 we can bring in only two or three christian books
2102358 if there werent such restrictions we could bring in what we like
2102359 in general any censorship of religious literature would be a violation of osce commitments
2102360 16 in order to ensure the freedom of the individual to profess and practice religion or belief the participating states will inter alia
2102361 in about 2005 one devotee had about 25 books confiscated by azerbaijani customs when they were returning by train from russia through dagestan officers said this is a religious book and of a different faith
2102362 if its 50 or so copies many wont accept it either because they are muslims or because they are afraid of the police
2102363 the shop doesnt need permission from the state committee to sell books
2102364 but they keep a close watch to check that they dont sell banned literature
2102365 each title and the quantity we want to import needs to be approved
2102366 this also applies for locally produced religious books legally they should respond within one month but in practice this is often between four and six months
2102367 how can you get examples in to the country for the committee to approve if you cant legally import them without permission
2102368 the job of controlling religious literature is done by the state committee for work with religious organisations
2102369 do you have any further information about this amazing woman

2102639 we live in an insecure uncertain world it is also a time of opportunity

2102741 the cost of borrowing money has been escalating on a daily basis and because we are operating in a hyperinflationary environment it has become increasingly difficult to get clients who come in to borrow
2102742 in instances where they do come in they are put off by the high interest rates because these have to be constantly reviewed to enable the industry to succeed

2102749 i cant assure you that this train wreck isnt going to happen but i will do everything in my power to see that we avert it
2102750 should this happen dhl will cede significant elements of cost and quality to one of its chief competitors consumers all over america would suffer
2102751 government is too big he wants to grow it taxes are to high he wants to raise them
2102752 congress spends too much and he proposes more we need more energy and hes against producing it were finally winning in iraq and he wants to forfeit
2102753 we think we have a pretty good estimate of how much abu nabaa solicited
2102754 the 2004 opinion is very clear but throwing the regulation into the mix muddies the water the fec could revisit the issue
2102755 instead of this so called civil rights bill for example that says you have to give preferences to minorities i think the american people are going once they see the obamanation theyre going to demand a tweaking of that and say you have to put the majority into office
2102756 large numbers of these people really seem to think that an obama election would benefit them hugely
2102757 obama wins demo nomination a black flag for white america
2102758 will be a clear signal for millions of our people
2102759 obama is a visual aid for white americans who just dont get it yet that we have lost control of our country and unless we get it back we are heading for complete annihilation as a people
2102760 it doesnt really matter if obama wins the election or mccain wins the election
2102761 neither of them are going to try to fight to preserve the white race or heritage
2102762 those were the good old days for straight white males but for everyone else it was a pretty raw deal
2102763 the revolution if you will in 1776 brought the 13 colonies together against the king and the same thing can happen now against martin luther king with the 50 states
2102764 see richard doesnt really mean what he says its popular for him to say it thats the way he makes a living
2102765 same as jesse jackson some more of our black revolutionaries who make a living off of keeping things emotional
2102766 i dont think the majority of white people are thinking that way anymore
2102767 im concerned that once he gets in office that he wont be recognized as an american president
2102768 we are made up of people of every conceivable racial background
2102769 earlier this week obama told an audience make no mistake the oil companies have placed their bet on senator mccain it looks like edwards admits to affair
2102770 we believe that standing up for our country means standing up against sexism and all intolerance demeaning portrayals of women cheapen our debates dampen the dreams of our daughters and deny us the contributions of too many responsibility lies with us all

2102776 caro p te la forme ses t tons un peu moins
2102777 you could argue that nobody is ever ready to be president i mean i certainly learned a lot about the job in the first year
2102778 the constitution sets qualifications for the president and then the people decide who they think would be the better president i think we have two choices i think he should win and i think he will win
2102779 i thought he showed extraordinary restraint in a fairly provocative interview
2102780 i couldnt ask for him to be any more gracious than hes been and supportive since the campaign ended
2102781 working together to make sure the fall campaign and the convention are a success
2102782 at the democratic convention we will ensure that the voices of everyone who participated in this historic process are respected and our party will be fully unified heading into the november election
2102783 i happen to believe that we will come out stronger if people feel that their voices were heard and their views were respected
2102784 i mean everybody comes and they want to yell and scream and have their opportunity and i think thats all to the good because then you know everybody can go ok great
2102785 since the delegate count is so close what if you are called up for nomination and what if you do win by a narrow margin
2102786 that is not going to happen not going to happen look what we want to have happen is for sen obama to be nominated by a unified convention of democrats
2102787 the best way i think and i could be wrong but the best way i think to do that is to have a strategy so that my delegates feel like theyve had a role and that their legitimacy has been validated and that kind of you know there is a catharsis
2102788 i have said repeatedly that i will do whatever sen obama asks me to do
2102789 i am really focused and enjoying being back in the senate and working on behalf of my new york constituents this is sen obamas decision and his alone and i am going to respect the privacy of that process by not discussing it
2102790 our polling tells us that americans are still not tuned into what the candidates might do to fix the economy

2102793 roundtable events heavily tilted towards women to discuss the pressures the economy is placing on family finances and how mccains plan would help
2102794 provide compelling set of programming and surrogate activity to drive media interest
2102795 mobilize economists in target states supporting the mccain plan to engage the media in support of our plan
2102796 use prominent economists to bolster the intellectual case for the mccain plan
2102797 as local surrogates for the mccain plan write letters to the editor op eds and participate in surrogate events
2102798 draw the parallel with the same kind of bold leadership that mccain demonstrated in pushing the surge strategy that allowed us to win in iraq need that same vision intensity and leadership to attack our economic problems

2102814 clara that doesnt add up you cant be a democrat today and be self reliant the whole principle of the dnc today is that the government should help you get dressed every morning and theyll send the oil execs to your home to do this since its their fault and by the way youve had to have had your brain surgically removed if obamanomics makes any sense to you you dont have to be for mccain but how can you be against laws of supply and demand question if oil companies are forced to pay a windfall profit tax who do you think ultimately pays for that tax dont feel bad if this stumps you and you are an obama fan apparently he doesnt know the answer to this either

2103074 a time to lead confirms the rewarding benefits of military service at a time when such service is experiencing considerable strain it also includes a comprehensive description of americas current national imperatives which deserve serious consideration
2103075 this is a primer on leadership forged in battle and by decades of experience this isnt just a book its a manual for leading people and living a good life
2103076 whip smart sassy with a mouth as foul as a sailors 28 year old sergeant kayla williams tells what its like to be a female soldier in iraq

2103078 you draw so you must want to make a manga right

2103080 the success of the mamma mia soundtrack and cast recording further solidify the power of the franchise with its ever growing popularity the music continues to resonate with audiences of all ages and these recordings have taken on a life of their own we are proud and excited to be part of this continued phenomenon
2103081 we didnt have to think about it it was in the fingers
2103082 because it wasnt going to be a good photo op
2103083 my wife is divorcing me but her birthday is next week i need a card for that
2103084 the confidence people have that they will be able to exchange such money for real goods and services whenever they choose to do so
2103085 higher than expected feed and fuel input costs at our jennie o turkey store segment were the primary reason for the shortfall in our third quarter results
2103086 a high proportion of our business over the year has been secured through rigorous selection processes while it is extremely satisfying to regularly prevail the cost of sale can be significant it is important that we maintain a healthy balance sheet
2103087 i see the next 12 months as a consolidation period
2103088 his usual practice was not to drive to the pub
2103089 he had planned to get a lift home with a friend but his friend changed his mind and decided to drink
2103090 were you expecting a fine it doesnt happen youve got the wrong target here
2103091 imprisonment is an appropriate penalty for somebody who wont learn a lesson you can undergo that through an intensive corrections order
2103092 ive really got to wonder what possesses some people when they write references
2103093 are they aware of your drinking problem lack of responsibility and failure to consider the public
2103094 especially in a matter as high profile as this the court was disappointed that much of the testimony particularly as it related to public figures within the state of new jersey and the dirty laundry associated therewith needed to be aired in the public and in the press
2103095 the mcgreeveys clearly had agendas as previously addressed their anger seemed to override any ability to testify credibly or to be reasonable
2103096 mr mcgreevey is not seeking employment because he does not need it to sustain himself
2103097 its hard to imagine a more favorable ruling for jim mcgreeveys position
2103098 although the victimization continues i am stronger for the experience
2103099 the question arises what this storyline has to do with the title
2103100 you can sell anything in india creating the right hype
2103101 leisure time sedentariness has resulted in a caloric deficit that potentially could account for the entire obesity epidemic
2103102 we think we have a pretty good estimate of how much abu nabaa solicited
2103103 the 2004 opinion is very clear but throwing the regulation into the mix muddies the water the fec could revisit the issue
2103104 if its such earth shattering stuff whats been going on since 2005
2103105 why is he on the street if they think its that important
2103106 the thinking now by the psychiatrist and counselor is that my symptoms may not be those of a depression or a bipolar disorder they may be that of a paranoid personality disorder
2103107 i get incredible paranoid delusional thoughts at times and theres nothing i can do until they go away either by themselves or with drugs
2103108 if he really was the guy and he acted alone then thats pretty scary because thats a lot of damage that can be done by one person
2103109 usamriid is not like being in a shack in the wilderness its interacting with people in a pretty secure place
2103110 were not claiming that terrorists are able to do this to all passports today or that they will be able to do it tomorrow
2103111 but it does raise concerns over security that need to be addressed in a more public and open way
2103112 it is of deep concern that the technology underpinning a key part of the uks security can be compromised so easily
2103113 no one has yet been able to demonstrate that they are able to modify change or alter data within the chip if any data were to be changed modified or altered it would be immediately obvious to the electronic reader
2103114 the pkd ensures that e passports used at border control points are genuine and unaltered in effect it renders the passport fool proof however all states issuing e passports must join the pkd otherwise that assurance cannot be given
2103115 i want to reiterate on his behalf that the united states supports georgias territorial integrity and we call for an immediate ceasefire
2103116 we urge all parties georgians south ossetians and russians to de escalate the tension and avoid conflict
2103117 i cant assure you that this train wreck isnt going to happen but i will do everything in my power to see that we avert it
2103118 should this happen dhl will cede significant elements of cost and quality to one of its chief competitors consumers all over america would suffer
2103119 government is too big he wants to grow it taxes are to high he wants to raise them
2103120 congress spends too much and he proposes more we need more energy and hes against producing it were finally winning in iraq and he wants to forfeit
2103121 part of my fascination was due to the fact that i had relatively zero knowledge about the adult film industry
2103122 prior to watching the movie and like many other mainstream people i had preconceived notions about the industry and the people in it
2103123 according to our research and the people weve spoken with john holmes was a chameleon he had the ability to be whatever people wanted him to be at any given time
2103124 he could be very crafty and he was street smart but he was also bright funny and as most people know he had the ability to fabricate and tell entertaining stories that would go beyond the realm of believability
2103125 the economy is limping along and businesses are doing whatever they can to remain competitive
2103126 so we had fewer people working shorter hours and producing more
2103127 we were harmed by the very people who took an oath to protect us
2103128 they were the reason we bought this house because it had a big yard for them to run in
2103129 cheye and trinity we support you friends and citizens of berwyn heights
2103130 i was completely stunned because those dogs didnt hurt anybody they barely bark
2103131 she gave me a big hug and she said if the police shot your dogs dead and did this to you how can i trust them
2103132 i dont want people to feel like that i just want them to be proud of our police and proud to live in prince georges county
2103133 we are trying to move as quickly as possible but let us see how the opposing parties move
2103134 at the present moment it does not appear that the army will support him they will definitely not make any mistake of opposing the will of the people of pakistan
2103135 it is a very difficult time but at the same time it will be a very historical time if the remainder of the military dictatorship is removed
2103136 this tells us there is another face of adoption it is more complex than we had thought
2103137 weve seen an increase in same sex couples adopting and this is a trend all over the country
2103138 if you think about same sex couples gay men who want children really have to adopt but gay women can have their own children i dont see as many gay female couples adopting as gay male couples
2103139 it is not just white married couples who are adopting children
2103140 because the characteristics of children that women and couples seek to adopt may not correspond to the characteristics of children in the foster care system women and couples may seek children from outside the foster care system to adopt
2103141 i hope the day comes that you return to your wife and daughters and your country and youre able to be a provider a father and a husband in the best sense of all those terms
2103142 i would like to apologize one more time to all the members and i would like to thank you for what you have done for me
2103143 anyone think there was a connection between mrs clinton s mild musings of disruptive action at the convention and the sudden appearance of a speaking slot for bill

2103151 im confident that scott will help us continue to ramp up our it capabilities as we move toward our first broadcasts
2103152 one of scotts main goals is to ensure that the new launch of our viva site will give more information to our shareholders and the investment community
2103153 although we as a corporation will make efforts we will not easily be able to absorb such radically high oil
2103154 if oil prices continue to rise we will also have to consider reviewing operations further
2103155 certainly we would like to raise fuel surcharges to absorb
2103156 but considering its effect on the market we would not be able to raise surcharges as we did before

2103160 in rom hatte man mal wieder den leib christi in kirche im eigentlichen sinne und kirche im nicht eigentlichen sinne eingeteilt wobei nat rlich alle anderen kirchen au er der r misch katholischen als nicht eigentliche kirche bezeichnet wurden
2103161 ich habe mich in jedem fall sehr dar ber ge rgert
2103162 du bist protestant und du bist liedermacher jetzt ist es zeit f r einen protestsong einen imagin ren spaziergang mit benedikt
2103163 viele katholische priesterkollegen und viele geschwister aus dem katholischen bereich haben mich ermutigt diesen song zu ver ffentlichen
2103164 denn ich w re wirklich gespannt wie dieser sehr kluge und weise mann auf meine fragen antworten w rde und zwar so da sie nicht nur innerkatholisch verstehbar sind
2103165 es gibt nat rlich auch dieses wiedererwachende seltsame katholische selbstbewu tsein das sich tats chlich f r etwas besseres h lt
2103166 mission die den anderen bevormundet ihm angst macht und ihm seine kulturelle identit t einfach wegnimmt lehne ich komplett ab
2103167 ich glaube jesus wollte niemals den apparat kirche weder katholisch noch evangelisch oder sonst wie
2103168 ein drittel hat nicht geklatscht zwei drittel haben euphorisch applaudiert und sind zum teil auch aufgestanden
2103169 wie gut ist es da es eine schwesterkirche gibt in der man dinge sagen kann die wir genauso sehen aber nicht formulieren d rfen weil wir sonst rausfliegen w rden
2103170 es gibt ja im grunde keine streitkultur in der katholischen kirche
2103171 in rom hatte man mal wieder den leib christi in kirche im eigentlichen sinne und kirche im nicht eigentlichen sinne eingeteilt wobei nat rlich alle anderen kirchen au er der r misch katholischen als nicht eigentliche kirche bezeichnet wurden
2103172 ich habe mich in jedem fall sehr dar ber ge rgert
2103173 kyle everyone always says you can pull out when you want to but when youve started youve started
2103174 smith was in george karls doghouse for much of 2006 2007
2103175 smith doesnt draw a lot of fouls but he does have the explosiveness to get in the lane and finish or create for others
2103176 smiths primary competition isnt anthony carter its allen iverson hes not a point guard hes a 2 guard
2103177 iguadola is an athlete that just happens to play basketball hes a good player but hes not very skilled hes explosive and hes the best defender of the three but theres no way i would take him over j r smith
2103178 i couldnt find any data to support this but i believe smith and anthony were the highest scoring duo in the league before the incident in new york
2103179 also i think you guys are overrating iguodalas playmaking and ball handling skills he can penetrate going to his right but his left hand is suspect at best
2103180 were gonna have a lotta water comin down this way
2103181 they expected dolly to make landfall but what they didnt expect was this ferocious winds
2103182 one day jesus told me that he would cause a chastisement to fall upon the most beautiful city in our country probably warsaw this chastisement would be that with which god had punished sodom and gomorrah i saw the great wrath of god and a shudder pierced my heart i prayed in silence 39
2103183 because of the evils and injustices that accompany all war the church insistently urges everyone to prayer and to action so that the divine goodness may free us from the ancient bondage of war
2103184 i thought the priority had to be on finishing the war
2103185 the payments are intended to historically recognize the terrible fate of budapest jews amidst nazi persecution
2103186 cannot compensate people for the suffering or loss of family members
2103187 you could always hear dad at the games he always had the loudest roar and sometimes thought he was the referee judge and coach
2103188 he also taught us how to be strong and survive on a few hours sleep the cows still had to be milked when you had a hangover
2103189 he taught us to always support and respect others and to never give up
2103190 you wouldnt think an old man could crash tackle kids to the floor
2103191 bryan had a lot of influence over the shape of this town not only as a councillor but also in his work with council as a town planner
2103192 sexually explicit software resident on the citys computer system or accessed via city owned computer hardware is not appropriate and will result in disciplinary action
2103193 shah rukh khan who has great fans in uk has never been able to get this big opening in united kingdom
2103194 rajeeva and imfrz you two are losers and big fanatic of srk you pair of idiots
2103195 you can publish a phone directory with just his name and yet it would be a best seller he is the superstar with the midas touch at the box office
2103196 i think that will be the biggest bore to hit indian screens rab ne bana di jodi
2103197 the name of this film is pathetic srk only does the same crap over and over and over again when is he going to act
2103198 atleast with akshay it was a one man show in singh is king
2103199 akshay has been the highest paid actor in india since the last 2 years
2103200 well he is not number 1 now is he its akshay
2103201 srk is media made everyone knows this if his rnbdj came out next week it would be a flop
2103202 its been the biggest disaster on indian television by a filmstar
2103203 and all abs fans were desperately promoting saawariya and it was not as if saawariya was not being promoted
2103204 if i remember rightly both father and son did a special appearance in oso
2103205 salman khan nearly beat him up at his party what power you talking about
2103206 this is not necessarily a campaign to the average person in greater cincinnati were really going to the business community and the people that fly regularly to remind them how important to our economy this airport is
2103207 cvg is the premier international airport serving ohio kentucky and indiana and one of the finest in the america it is an exceptionally knowledgeable industry resource to anyone who cares about where air travel is heading and why
2103208 our educational philosophy is that its important that all childrens needs be met
2103209 children in middle school have different needs it doesnt take a separate building to meet those needs we strive to meet the needs wherever the children are
2103210 they are more capable of abstract thought so they need lessons that require more reasoning they have a strong need to feel a sense of belonging and this is a huge stage in moral development so they need more assistance in making moral decisions
2103211 this was an opportunity to acquire one of the largest multi tenant business campuses in southern california that provides the flexibility of offering 100 percent office build out and flex and industrial space in one project
2103212 this variety of product appeals to a diverse set of tenant types and the diversification helps limit risk exposure to any one tenant type enriquez noted
2103213 there are millions of things that could keep you awake at night
2103214 there is no one big problem but the technology is very complex anything can happen and there are lots of small things
2103215 after you have served your sentence i dont know what happens
2103216 i hope the day comes when you return to your wife and your daughters and your country
2103217 hell still be retained as an enemy combatant after he serves his sentence
2103218 but as an enemy combatant he then becomes at that time eligible for the annual review board process to determine whether hes eligible for release or transfer
2103219 this sends a long shot across the bow to the political ideologues who hoped that the military would serve as their pawns
2103220 a vindication of the military not of the military commissions
2103221 if anything its a vindication of the system it proves that this system is very fair and impartial and capable of prosecuting war criminals
2103222 they chose to make this a test case for future cases to be tried in guantanamo but they never imagined that it would result in such a stunning rebuff
2103223 watch the disease progress in a dish that is to watch what goes right or wrong
2103224 i think well see in years ahead that this opens the door to a new way to treating degenerative diseases
2103225 represent a collection of degenerative diseases for which there are no good treatments and more importantly no good animal models for the most part in studying them
2103226 the hope is that this will accelerate research and it will create a climate of openness
2103227 at least for the foreseeable future and i would argue forever they are going to be extremely valuable tools
2103228 det r viktigt att h ja kunskapsniv n hos b tfolk
2103229 theres only one guy whos going to like this place by the end of the week
2103230 the course is 7 500 yards long the greens are firm and the pins are tucked away
2103231 they are sucking the fun out of the major championships when you set it up like that
2103232 i sound as if im moaning which i am but its a great shame
2103233 its a fantastic golf course they are great greens and they are playable but there is no need to play it as it is
2103234 to stop the ball on that green when theres a lot of breeze from behind that was good
2103235 with aids the largest single cause of premature death in africa we cant talk about better lasting development there without also committing to stay the course in the long term fight against the disease
2103236 and it makes it harder for the imeems of the world to maintain their rates
2103237 myspace is limited to people who use myspace whereas these widgets can be used on any platform so they have access to a broader audience we are also starting to see ads within those widgets
2103238 i definitely think myspace has been paying attention to what they are doing
2103239 our original investment is worth a great deal more than what we paid for our original investment
2103240 he is a terrific ball handler with great passing ability and court vision
2103241 he brings added veteran leadership and playoff experience to our backcourt
2103242 we sort of suspected itd be big as soon as we heard she was into it the fact that mccain sort of haphazardly used her in his campaign ad and now the fact that shes responding to him is just too good
2103243 i was sitting in my car making phone calls and i just had five minutes of down time
2103244 i happened to be listening to air america the progressive radio station and they kept talking about this paris hilton britney spears and john mccain ad and i thought oh my god shes got to respond
2103245 her parents were also involved which is nice her parents are looking out for her and they also wanted to know she was being protected because i think they knew this piece was going to be big
2103246 i havent seen the ad i rarely look at these ads
2103247 we highly value our relationship with ms knowles it is categorically untrue that loreal paris altered ms knowles features or skin tone in the campaign for feria hair color
2103248 the attention ive gotten since ive been here has been overwhelming the bottom line as we all know is to win games thats what im here to do
2103249 i cannot tell you where the tree is going to be for obvious reasons because itll be stripped bare in about 30 seconds
2103250 if you had picked a number higher you wouldve gotten more money on your metrocard
2103251 let me warn you that when you get on and off the train during rush hours just be sure to follow your blockers
2103252 you win the super bowl and i promise you will get a key
2103253 the future is now i dont have 17 more years to play i dont think i want to give the new york jets and the people of this city the best year possible believe me
2103254 to a certain degree i dont know what im getting into
2103255 im here for one reason not to do commercials broadway all those things
2103256 hopefully i can bring as much excitement throughout the year as weve had the last two or three days
2103257 time will tell but i dont want to say be patient
2103258 i have to get a lot done in a short amount of time they wouldnt have signed me if they didnt think i could do that
2103259 i left the hospital today just after 12 noon memphis time
2103260 cest vrai je trouve que recevoir de largent parce quon a des conomies est injuste
2103261 we are not going to base our campaign on the concerns of so called campaign strategists on cable tv
2103262 the price mccain paid for his partys nomination has been to reverse himself on position after position
2103263 that doesnt meet my definition of a maverick you cant be a maverick when politically its important for you but not a maverick when it doesnt work for you
2103264 weve been through two very tough elections at the national level and its very easy to lose confidence
2103265 there have even been rumblings that the obama campaign had grand openings for these offices but only had them on 10 day leases its a complete sham
2103266 if you drive past the office here in muncie it is a vacant store front no signs no staff no one home
2103267 the indiana debate commission has worked diligently to organize debates
2103268 governor daniels has agreed to participate in all three debates governor daniels believes the debates will be an excellent opportunity for him to discuss with hoosiers the great progress indiana has experienced in the last four years and further share his positive vision for the future
2103269 i think its the candidates who get sticky about it
2103270 the working men and women of the afl cio are united in our commitment to make jill long thompson our next governor
2103271 along with dennie oxley she will work to bring real economic opportunity and good paying jobs to every community of this state and after four years of mitch daniels failed policies that will be a welcomed change
2103272 jill long thompson has always stood with working people and we are proud to stand with her now she has the experience to lead our state forward to grow the economy and to restore the promise indiana once held for our citizens we proudly endorse her candidacy and look forward to working alongside her over the next four years to put indiana back on track
2103273 dennie and i are honored to have the support of the members of the afl cio and its affiliates in this campaign
2103274 we are in this race to rebuild our economy and give working hoosiers across the state more economic opportunities
2103275 as indianas next governor and lieutenant governor we pledge to work with the men and women of the indiana afl cio to revamp our tax code invest in education attract new good paying jobs and protect the jobs we have here in indiana
2103276 these are not easy decisions we have to deal with
2103277 we recognize when we lay off a person its somebody who needs the income and we dont make the decisions lightly
2103278 one week ago 50 house republicans took this hill on behalf of the right of every american to enjoy energy independence thanks to the leadership of john boehner and roy blunt and thanks to the sacrifice being made by dozens of members of congress and their families we have held this hill for one week but still there is no sign of speaker nancy pelosi or any house democrats in the peoples house republicans in congress have taken this stand on capitol hill and across the nation in town halls and coffee shops to protest the fact that congress took a five week paid vacation without ever taking a vote on giving the american people more access to american oil from the floor of congress to the farm fields of indiana i have heard from everyday americans and they are with us they think this congress should go back to work immediately and pass energy legislation that allows more drilling into our domestic resources
2103279 she will do a hell of a lot better than me in certain areas she is better organized and does a great job of bringing people together
2103280 she has a real good managing style and always thinks of other people
2103281 since the 21st amendment passed 75 years ago indiana like many other states has relied on an effective alcohol distribution system with safeguards in place to keep minors from purchasing alcohol without the face to face transaction requirement a minor could easily order alcohol from a winery online or over the phone and have the alcohol delivered to his or her doorstep all without legitimate age verification and with no accountability for the persons selling or delivering the alcohol we are pleased the appeals court ruled strongly in favor of maintaining the face to face transaction requirement
2103282 they simply told me that due to economic conditions they were eliminating my position
2103283 we know the kankakee can be canoed but we dont have any materials to market that
2103284 its ready for implementation its just a matter of getting some of the communities on board with landing places
2103285 lets do two or three subdivisions and get something done
2103286 i think our county engineer knows where our problem areas are in the county in my opinion the lake county council voted thursday for a brief thaw in the two week old hiring freeze
2103287 prohibit crimes that are committed against individuals or groups on the basis of race creed color ethnicity national origin disability gender or sexual orientation and to prosecute those who are engaged in or encourage such harmful activity
2103288 we are looking at a meeting point somewhere in the middle
2103289 it would have to be egregious 80 or 85 mph we dont know yet
2103290 all day today theyve been bombing georgia from numerous warplanes and specifically targeting the civilian population and we have scores of wounded and dead among the civilian population all around the country
2103291 in the sustainable management of our forests we maintain local jobs such in regional communities and that is really important
2103292 the opening ceremony is about the spectacle rather than just the australian team
2103293 the american people have been telling us for months that the house is on fire and the democrats just showed up at the scene with a squirt gun
2103294 they want us to tell the american people that the senates time would be better spent on other things that its time to move on well republicans have a three word response for the democrat leadership no we wont
2103295 americans will see them holding up the vote on liheap i think that will be a tough vote for those republicans
2103296 now more than ever we need skilled attorneys to ensure that freedom of speech is protected during the convention and that arrestees receive immediate and effective representation so their rights are not curtailed
2103297 i decided to post this here instead of emailing nikon rumors so i can keep my anonymity and my job i work at a high end camera store and friday of last week our nikon rep came into our store and gave us a bit of information about a brand new nikon p amp s camera the p6000 is coming and it will have raw and higher resolution however he said that nikon is coming out with a high end p amp s camera above the p6000 that will use the 10mp aps sensor from the d60 and be geared toward pros and serious enthusiasts this is a definite fact no b s we could not get anymore info out of him as far as body design or lens focal length well just have to wait and see he did say that he is pretty sure it will be announced at or before photokina

2103344 for the first time weve used rnai to dramatically suppress hiv infection in an organism
2103345 apparently the sirnas kept hiv from entering most t cells and kept it from replicating when it managed to slip inside
2103346 im not saying weve developed tomorrows therapy but this is a major step forward
2103347 weve used a small animal model for hiv and proven that rnai works in that model
2103348 the number one problem with the current antiretroviral drug regimens is toxicity

2103359 a significant risk of injury or death is not supported by the data
2103360 less injurious than either the baton or empty hand physical control
2103361 no use of force technique available to police officers can be considered safe every use of force encounter between the police and a citizen carries with it the possibility for injury for one or all of the participants however unexpected that injury might be
2103362 the whole point was to look at all subjects and situational features to see where the problems lay in injury and death the benefit of doing that is you dont only restrict your evaluation to bad outcome you look at the whole denominator
2103363 use of force by police officers is really really low in two years and 827 000 face to face interactions use of force occurred in 0 07 per cent
2103364 that database isnt available anywhere else in canada to my knowledge were the first agency to develop it we could search hundreds of incidents to compare subject injuries officer injuries
2103365 were trying to come up with a retrospective look at police use of force and in custody death and looking to see if theres a safest way of managing these types of events

2103399 developing strategies to unlock additional value in canaccords businesses and continuing to execute great ideas for our clients
2103400 while the comparison of canaccords current results with the same quarter in the prior year one of canaccords best three month periods ever is not attractive it should not overshadow the progress we are making in creating a canaccord that is stronger more efficient and more competitive in our chosen markets
2103401 we believe we are very near the end of this long process during which protecting our clients interests has been our principal concern
2103402 a hallmark of that priority is that the purchase agreements for eligible abcp are in place and fully funded and we await only the final court approval of the restructuring process once that is received we expect a further five or six weeks will be required for clients to receive their funds

2103412 ik denk dat er nog niet zo heel erg veel educatiefs met de mobiel gedaan wordt maar dat de mobiel wel heel erg tot de verbeelding van veel mensen spreekt omdat er zo veel mee mogelijk is het nadeel van de mobiel is alleen dat er niet een duidelijke standaard os is symbian windows mobile os x niet alle mobieltjes de zelfde mogelijkheden hebben qua internet mms gps camera e d dat er zoveel verschillende user interfaces zijn en het werken met een mobiel is voor veel mensen helemaal niet zo makkelijk als het soms lijkt het is dus heel erg lastig om je onderwijs zo in te richten dat alle leerlingen er met hun eigen mobiel aan kunnen deelnemen en dan vooral om hier goede ondersteuning op te leveren daarnaast kost een mobiel nog steeds veel geld misschien niet voor mensen die een baan hebben maar zeker wel voor studenten en al helemaal voor scholieren scholieren zullen geen eur 10 in de maand over hebben om mobiel te kunen internetten omdat dit zo handig is op school en ook voor dat beltegoed hebben ze wel een betere bestemming dan school sms jes en heel misschien overschatten wij het gebruik van de mobiel door jongeren ook wel ik vermoed dat de mobiel door veel jongeren voornamelijk voor bellen en sms en gebruikt wordt en maar relatief weinig voor andere zaken voor het gebruik van computers gelden deze beperkingen veel minder iedereen heeft tegenwoordig met uitzondering van mac gebruikers maar laten we eerlijk zijn dit percentage is relatief erg klein een windowspc waar hij of zij mee kan werken die precies hetzelfde werkt als de windows pc op school en als de leerkracht heeft die de school nog eens beschikbaar stelt en waar de school ook alle kosten van betalen internet en de pc wordt waarschijnlijk in tegenstelling tot de mobiel wel voor veel meer verschillende zaken gebruikt zowel prive als voor schoolwerk ik denk overigens wel dat er een toekomst is voor het educatief gebruik van de mobiel maar ik weet niet of deze zo ingrijpend zal zijn als men nu op conferenties durft te beweren ik denk dat tegen de tijd dat de mobiel daadwerkelijk een standaard tool is van studenten zoals de vulpen en rekenmachine dat nu is dit een heel ander apparaat is dan dat wij nu kennen

2103750 i was asked the question if i was totally committed to the packers i know thats well documented and i posed the same question back to them and i dont think either side could totally commit after all thats happen i know people said you need to put the personal issues aside and i agree but i couldnt do it
2103751 we got to a spot where we felt comfortable with things
2103752 really we had a cursory monitoring situation going on we just kind of put an oar in the water
2103753 its a tough decision one i never thought i would have to make but i am excited about the opportunity
2103754 ive always felt throughout my career that when im on the field i give us a better edge i think any good player any good competitor should feel that way its not being cocky its being confident
2103755 god only knows the one thing that i know is that when i play i play 100 percent it may be ugly it may not be pretty but i give it everything ive got
2103756 i am looking forward to seeing brett favre in a new york jets uniform he represents a significant addition to this franchise and reflects our commitment to putting the best possible product on the field
2103757 mike tannenbaum and his football administration staff did a great job of navigating this complex process
2103758 i have all the respect in the world for chad as a person and a player
2103759 he gave his heart and soul to this organization for a long long time
2103760 first at the bottom as it were of roman society in forming its ultimate unit was the family the most important feature or element of this family group was the authority of the father
2103761 the early roman boys upbringing was founded on a profound conviction of the power of example first of the father himself as a representative of virtues peculiarly roman but also of the great prototypes of roman valor in the boys family and national history who were presented to him as men worthy of admiration
2103762 in the good old days that is of the republic every mans son born in wedlock was brought up not in the chamber of some hireling nurse but in his mothers lap and at her knee and that mother could have no higher praise than that she managed the house and gave herself to her children
2103763 religiously and with utmost delicacy she regulated not only the serious task of her youthful charges but their recreations also and their games the idea of entrusting the training of a future roman citizen to the incompetent guidance of a slave was repellant to the roman mind at this time
2103764 from this time on in rome we witness an epidemic of divorces at least among the aristocracy whose matrimonial adventures are documented
2103765 for behold the lord the eternal of hosts doth take away from jerusalem and from judah the stay and the staff the whole stay of bread and the whole stay of water the mighty man and the man of war the judge and the prophet and the prudent and the ancient the captain of fifty and the honorable man and the counselor and the cunning artificer and the eloquent orator
2103766 t he child shall behave himself proudly against the ancient and the base against the honorable
2103767 as for my people children are their oppressors and women rule over them o my people they which lead thee cause thee to err and destroy the way of thy paths
2103768 the most important predictor of criminal behavior is the fathers absence
2103769 the two parent household has been universal across both time and geography
2103770 have been linked through marriage to their children and their mothers not only has the primacy of motherhood never been questioned we also have never doubted the children need fathers until now
2103771 and ye have forgotten the exhortation which speaketh unto you as unto children my son despise not thou the chastening of the lord nor faint when thou art rebuked of him for whom the lord loveth he chasteneth and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth if ye endure chastening god dealeth with you as with sons for what son is he whom the father chasteneth not but if ye be without chastisement whereof all are partakers then are ye bastards and not sons furthermore we have had fathers of our flesh which corrected us and we gave them reverence shall we not much rather be in subjection unto the father of spirits and live
2103772 i really enjoyed just being in a race car again and the test has increased my anticipation for the petit le mans in october
2103773 ive wanted to drive a p1 car for a very long time so its exciting to finally get that opportunity the test went really well and the car felt superb and very good to drive
2103774 creations regular drivers jamie campbell walter and stuart hall were also around to give me some tips and i found that really helpful the team are very professional and have a great track record and im confident well work well together
2103775 ive been waiting a long time to get back to the alms i have so many friends there and really enjoyed my time in the championship ive had a lot of success there in the past and hopefully that will continue
2103776 there is no doubt in the courts mind that mr dierker is the least culpable
2103777 though mr dierker may not have known the outer limits of the fraud that was perpetrated he knew of the fraud
2103778 my prayer today is that the court will consider the life that ive lived
2103779 quite simply the life that defines me as a human being
2103780 we analyzed the costing model being used by utilities in commercial and industrial settings and recognized immediately that a similar model will be necessary in the residential sector once there is a massive influx of cfl bulbs to replace incandescent bulbs
2103781 as utility companies and lighting manufacturers have begun to digest the scope of the transition that is beginning to occur they are realizing the importance of high power factor and the ripples this issue will cause purespectrum has consistently approached the development of our technology from a universal perspective in the sense that we have created technology to satisfy the needs of manufacturers end users and energy providers
2103782 it is important that a definitive study be performed within the industry to insure that we know what will happen to power quality across the grid as millions upon millions of low power factor cfl bulbs are introduced
2103783 were not sure how big the issue will become but we know that it could be problematic
2103784 while there is no data that declares that a massive influx of low power factor cfl bulbs will have a negative impact on power quality in the u s we believe this issue will become extremely important during the next five years
2103785 we know our technology provides a cost effective solution to this potential problem and we plan to work closely with utility companies to develop a more complete understanding of this issue
2103786 the administration is trying to set the stage for a last minute fire sale of commercial oil shale leases in western colorado despite the fact that we are still years away from knowing if the technologies for developing oil shale on a commercial scale are even viable
2103787 the company is two years into its 10 year research and development leases shell will make a decision on commercial leasing closer to the end of that decade shell spokesperson tracy boyd said the company wont be ready for commercial leasing until probably 2015 boyd said
2103788 currently there is no oil shale industry and the oil shale extractive technology is still in its rudimentary stages
2103789 bush lifts executive ban on offshore drilling why it matters and why it doesnt
2103790 mccain calls for more offshore drilling what else would he say in houston
2103791 offshore drilling ban opens door for other domestic oil options

2103793 it isnt the job of the trenton times to make theology for the catholic church and catholics wont make the mistake of accepting it without recognizing the ruse that it is
2103794 u s bishops vote your conscience catholics urged to weigh stands on all issues
2103795 single issue voting like simply choosing the anti abortion candidate is out
2103796 each candidates view on the entire spectrum of social issues including the war in iraq health care housing the plight of immigrants as well as abortion
2103797 its hard to find a candidate who supports all of the churchs teaching its a difficult time to decide how were voting especially this year
2103798 doctrinal note on some questions regarding the participation of catholics in political life
2103799 this organization plays a critical role in our research enterprises and it is essential that its leader be well versed in every aspect of technology transfer from patents and licensing to business development and venture financing issues
2103800 tony has all the specialized knowledge needed for the job and hes proven himself as an effective organizer and administrator
2103801 with tony you have leadership that really is attuned to the needs of our faculty
2103802 he is service oriented hes a problem solver he has the ability to affect the culture in this arena in a positive way
2103803 we are currently in the process of looking at how we might reorganize iurtc to better serve faculty
2103804 we want to figure out how we can simplify what we are doing helping researchers through the process of taking their discoveries and creations and translating them into marketable products we want to make the universitys finest work available for the benefit of hoosiers and others around the world
2103805 we want the iurtc to be a grand facilitator between the university community and the world beyond
2103806 on the outside we have capital providers and companies interested in licensing our technologies on the inside are our impressive and productive researchers we need a strong bridge between them thats an engagement effort we need to make sure the outside stakeholders have every opportunity to access the vast resources our university provides
2103807 fundamentally the work of the iurtc should enhance the academic and research missions of the entire university system
2103808 our success in this area has helped create a revenue stream that flows back to the university in such a way that supports everything we do from research to teaching to service and everything in between
2103809 show me a word that rhymes with pavement and i wont kill your parents and roast them on a spit
2103810 back then you feel sort of indestructible and you have all the time in the world and also there was a feeling of anticipation that there wasnt much out there people were really interested in what we were going to do next on a wide level i also knew already after we made slanted enchanted which had a lot more success than what wed already did that i had this idea to make this completely different kind of album so i felt pretty confident
2103811 maybe some groups do that and they dont even have any new songs theyre just sort of blown away that it even happened and slanted enchanted was kind of like that for me but i already knew that we were gonna use bass on the next album and that it was going to sound big and melodic and have a different colour and a different feeling now its more like we have every two years to do this and we feel often like were yelling into a cavern people are still listening and connecting but its not the same feeling
2103812 there was also less riding on it in a certain way not in the fact that there was less people listening but now the older you get time gets a little more precious it feels like everybodys got a big life everyone in the bands busy so you have to say oh well practice this day whereas when youre 24 or 5 with your friends and youre all living in the same house theres nothing to do except watch tv and go to work and drink beer or whatever i think that benefits the younger man
2103813 of all my stoned digressions some have mutated into the truth
2103814 i like a lot of crazy guitar music from the 70s and the 80s too generally i generally know my way around the 90s and i didnt really want to know my way around the 80s i feel like i know what i like from that time so the 70s and the late 60s are still a point of discovery for me as a fan of music there were a lot of records in the wake of albums by the beatles and hendrix and cream and these big bands you never need to hear again little guys getting it wrong and releasing albums that sank like a stone i listen to that music more and thats led for better or for worse to more instrumental parts and more solos that was kind of the name of the game back then
2103815 i dont know yeah its alright i try to leave it not so narratively like my friend david berman in the silver jews his songs are kind of airtight in a certain way im just not capable of that
2103816 you can only do what you do and im just kind of a california kid you know just a little bit hang loose id like to be in that vague but more than the sum of its parts sort of area but sometimes ill just be funny i just wanted to be original i guess i dont really care about the meaning if no one else is doing it thats a good start within reason
2103817 after the glow the scene the stage the set talk becomes slow but theres one thing ill never forget hey youve gotta pay your dues before you pay the rent
2103818 thatd be fun to see one of pavements first big shows was with my bloody valentine at this thing called the new music seminar in new york which still goes on they were great they were famous for being real loud of course and they were but you had ear plugs in of course which you should at 90 of shows if youre going to be up the front so it wasnt too bad
2103819 i think i would go just because i dont mind a certain kind of nostalgia and from reading about it in mojo it seems like a genuine thing compared to some reunions i mean they genuinely want the money but they also genuinely love the band and want to play the songs
2103820 yeah i think it would if we did it right i think if i was going to do something like that i would just do hit after hit whatever a hit is for pavement because youre going to be playing at some festival with todays chart topper or somebody with at least four hits so i would just want to play songs that people liked
2103821 i dont really see it happening for pavement any time soon theres gotta be somebody who doesnt do it besides us and the smiths
2103822 people would love it but even though its a hard ass approach you gotta hand it to him for sticking to his guns and saying
2103823 nine times out of ten im not the guidance type ive been sitting on a fencepost for the brunt of my life
2103824 i was hoping that it would have a different feel to it hopefully a good feel sort of an improvisational temporal thing like a diy record from the 80s bands like the desperate bicycles or the homosexuals these are british bands that were kinda on the outside of punk rock and post punk they just said well do everything ourselves well record ourselves well do it really cheap and make a 7 with a black and white cover everyone can do it so that was kind of the spirit of that record not to make it too perfect and i really didnt think anyone else deserved to have their name on it
2103825 generally not it seems to be with guitar bands theres a divide theres the angular gang of four dance punk is cool thing and then there are more song based guitar bands who still like it loud but sing melodically and arent too retro and they like pavement
2103826 its surprising with how well known we are that weve never had one superstar say they like us like pete townshend or like how david bowie is always coming out for bands saying the arcade fire is great i guess radiohead but theyre like our age they said they liked it but not these old geezers i dont know why its probably a good thing really those geezers theyre not gonna go out to a gig really unless theyre especially asked and they have a nice air conditioned place to sit and its private thats kinda disappointing well it wouldnt really make me feel that much better if neil young came out and said thats alright
2103827 someone trying to reach over my top shoulder into my top pocket or into your bag if your not looking
2103828 we look at the areas that are experiencing the most problems and deploy more plain clothes and uniformed there to address those issues
2103829 what weve seen is that these very high gas prices have had a very very strong impact
2103830 when you see yourself doing something badly and nobodys bothering you to tell you anymore thats a very bad place to be your critics are the ones telling you they still love you and care
2103831 in an era where media consolidation is occurring at an all too rapid pace its essential to look for alternative news sources that are free from corporate bias the future of our rather stupid species depends on it sites like yours have made a massive impact on me over the last year im very grateful
2103832 spiderednews is a really good resource thanks for the effort and time you put in to providing it

2103843 commit to short but highly engaged bursts of absolute attention and presence and watch the magic unfold
2103844 arizona courts have clearly ruled that prison officials cannot stand in the way of the medical needs of women prisoners
2103845 its regrettable that we need to take extra steps to ensure that sheriff arpaio follows the law
2103846 the courts have already confirmed our position that arizona prison officials cannot ignore the medical needs of prisoners simply because they do not agree with the decision to end a pregnancy
2103847 now given the disregard of the court ruling by sheriff arpaio and his staff it appears that we need to spell out the law more clearly to protect future women detainees
2103848 i got meal costs down to 40 cents a day per inmate it costs 1 15 a day to feed the departments dogs now im cutting prisoners calories from 3 000 to 2 500 a day

2103863 trade champ corners are too replaceable in this league to have so much stock in a single one currently champ is just passing his peak when it comes to trade value and the broncos have the wrong formula right now
2103864 mike greenberg reminds me of the little punk on the playground who wont stop talking about the stupidest things then after you beat the tar out of him he gets right back up and keeps talking golic on the other hand is a blowhard who thinks he can say anything because your punches cant get thru that subcutaneous fat layer

2103870 its official 07 saints worst saints team ever theyre the worst saints team ever because we never had a team with this much talent and played so pathetic this offense is so terrible from the play calling to the players i dont realistically see a victory coming anytime soon the panthers gave them the game on a silver platter several times and being the generous jacka e they are they just gave it back to them
2103871 we feel strongly that sports and music go hand in hand we decided to ask some of our favorite musicians to give us an inspirational lyric that gets them pumped up and ready for any competition these lyrics will be screened onto a limited number of t shirts and available starting on the 8th at our stores the proceeds from this project will go towards a china earthquake relief fund

2103880 the housing market has returned to earth fast and hard
2103881 volatility and disruptions in the capital markets became even more pronounced in july
2103882 it means that market is not going to exist at all its barely hanging on now
2103883 china is more open i think its the best religious freedom improvement in the last few hundreds of years and i think the believer in china is practicing more religious freedom than before thats not to say were perfect we still have a lot of room to grow
2103884 they are on the run because of the olympic games the government did not like them in beijing or some of the cities where some of the events are being held and they were afraid they would meet with the media and say something they wouldnt like
2103885 engaging in the printing and distribution of a large number of illegal publications
2103886 unfortunately there has been a crackdown on house church leaders in wake of the start of the olympics
2103887 please join me in praying for all those in prison its a travesty that hundreds of christians sit in prisons while the chinese government pats itself on the back for its hosting of the games
2103888 most of them are more quiet particularly those in cities where olympic events are being held many of them were warned by the authorities not to do anything until after the olympic games
2103889 theyre more focused in prayer theyre more focused on one to one evangelism particularly the government church because religious freedom does not allow anyone to go out to the street you have religious freedom inside the church not outside the church
2103890 the first half of 2008 has been as difficult an operating environment as we have encountered for some time presenting both general and specific challenges to rbs
2103891 the results we have published today demonstrate progress in a number of important areas and it is all the more unsatisfactory therefore that they record a loss as a result of our credit market write downs
2103892 we are determined to ensure that the inherent strengths of the groups diverse business model are not obscured in this way again
2103893 i concluded that an active sexual relationship between two people of the same sex might therefore reflect the love of god in a way comparable to marriage if and only if it had about it the same character of absolute covenanted faithfulness
2103894 if im asked for my views as a theologian rather than a church leader i have to be honest and admit that they are as ive said
2103895 my four children who were sleeping woke up to the noise of the elephant breaking the wall
2103896 some parts of the wall fell near the bed but luckily they were not hurt
2103897 i havent finished repaying my loans from bdfc to build this house
2103898 all we could do was run away and watch the beast attack my house
2103899 i lit a fire stayed put and sang my gurma prayer theres nothing else i could do nothing can drive them away except our prayers
2103900 every time theres an attack on our farms officials come and assess the damage but there is no compensation of any kind
2103901 we are trying to identify plant species that offend the elephants and will encourage people to grow these around their fields
2103902 i wish the government would come up with some kind of solution it would give us peace
2103903 nearly half of those surveyed expect their household finances to worsen over the coming year
2103904 the july reading of 39 6 compares with a reading of 74 7 in july 2007
2103905 the double whammy of higher interest rates and budget cutbacks made irish consumers notably more gloomy about the outlook for their personal finances in july
2103906 rising borrowing costs and the risk of an increasing tax burden or at the very least the absence of the cushion that generous budgets had provided in recent years mean the squeeze on household spending power is becoming even more painful
2103907 the velocity was there obviously he had a great cutter tonight his changeup is still not there the curveball was good next time hell be even better hell be going 85 pitches and hell be a little more crisper

2103910 having something like this is important because often the only time the public gets to meet the people who work in emergency services is when they need help and call 911
2103911 this way theyll get to meet them and see what we do ask any questions they may have
2103912 each of these agencies will be bringing two or three vehicles with them
2103913 well have police cars ambulances fire trucks a little bit of everything
2103914 people will get to see all the new equipment and the new technology weve added since then
2103915 my wife edna passed away four years ago after 52 years of marriage
2103916 i decided to apply because i had always been interested in law and i wanted to keep my mind active and capable
2103917 ive always had a great interest in criminal law and when my dad joined the course i thought it would be nice for me to go along and keep him company then my daughter applied and told me she would be joining me
2103918 its difficult for my dad being partially sighted but the lecturers have been marvellous he records the lectures and plays them over and over and he has special software that scans the text books and reads them aloud
2103919 and i think my daughters achievement is greater than mine to get through the first year she has two young children at home but still manages to study
2103920 the university gave my dad a chance they didnt turn him away because of his age or his partial sight i think the facilities are second to none the law libraries and the computer facilities are marvellous the lecturers are very understanding they know we are coming into this as beginners
2103921 ive been interested in law for years and being home with the children i thought it was a good time to start a degree while im not working
2103922 ive really enjoyed my first year its been difficult but my husband kevin is understanding and he takes over looking after the children when i need to study
2103923 after being promoted by michael corleone to don of new york players expand to new cities as they build up their families through extorting businesses monopolizing illegal crime rings and defeating new families in an effort to become the most powerful mob family in america
2103924 64 bit operating systems are becoming more mainstream and finally enable user memory to shed the 2gb limitation of 32 bit os
2103925 moreover the latest multi core systems are capable of simultaneous execution of highly complex workloads each commanding its own virtual memory space in that scenario the only way of avoiding data collision without writing back to the hard disk is the migration towards super high memory densities
2103926 estados unidos cree que el pueblo de china merece la libertad fundamental que es el derecho natural de todos los seres humanos
2103927 estados unidos se opone en rgicamente a la detenci n de disidentes pol ticos defensores de los derechos humanos y militantes religiosos en china
2103928 nosotros pedimos una prensa libre libertad de reuni n y derechos laborales no para suscitar el antagonismo de las autoridades chinas sino porque confiar mayores libertades a su pueblo es la nica forma en que china podr desarrollar plenamente su potencial

2103932 i spend a lot of time with catholic intellectuals and no matter how liberal they are and inclined to support democrats they speak with vehemence about the exclusion of caseys father from the 1992 convention
2103933 they dont accept any of the explanations i think it would be a dramatic act of historical rectification that would resonate with catholics

2104106 port obrien is the name of the site of a port on kodiak island in alaska there used to be a salmon cannery there its where my parents met in the late 60s since then its been abandoned bought out and boarded up probably never to be used again i liked the image a once bustling community where people from all over the world would come and now its been taken over by trees and its dissolving into the bay kind of beautiful
2104107 i think that just being so isolated up there all the time just makes you focus on feelings or emotions that you wouldnt really focus on otherwise the dichotomy between between being away from everything and then being in the city the rest of the year is really interesting i think most of the inspiration comes from that the difference there not just being in alaska or being at sea but the transition periods
2104108 i understand it definitely because the sea and the ocean and ships and sailing are pretty easy metaphors to use and have been used probably more than anything in the history of literature and music and films i think how were different is maybe that weve actually been on boats and been out at sea and know how to tie knots and navigate with charts not saying that were better than them or anything its just a different way writing songs from a more literal standpoint
2104109 its kind of annoying i cant really lie so many bands especially where were from their press photos are them on a boat
2104110 the sea faring thing is so trendy if you go into urban outfitters everything has anchors on it and all kinds of sea faring things its just funny when you come from the authentic alaskan bullshit its like thats not really what its about
2104111 its a bunch of fat macho sexist drunk people on boats thats the real situation
2104112 riders on the storm by the doors that song kicks ass
2104113 it just happened to be the one we wrote that had the most potential to be that way in the future maybe therell be more like that that song was like two chords and so is pigeonhold and rooftop song is three chords we like to keep it simple
2104114 we usually rely pretty heavily on audience participation teaching people the lyrics to the songs and having them sing with us this kind of separation between the audience and the band is kinda hard to do at home we have big crowds all across the west coast but in the middle of the country its alway like this its fun though
2104115 most of the shows we played in england it seemed like most of the people were just there for johnny marr and they didnt really care that much about the music but in the us theyre like the top band
2104116 yeah i totally fell in love with him he fell a little bit in love with cambria too i didnt like that too much we smoked his wifes pot though that was amazing
2104117 thats like our only rock star story the rest of the time is just reading star wars books and listening to mariah carey in the van

2104125 we ran into some obstacles it was a hard process we didnt know what to do because the cemetery posed a problem we talked about physically moving the church diverting the road finally we found a way that worked
2104126 people of all ages can come and have fun and we have a lot of interesting new activities this year
2104127 its a lot of work for our little church but we enjoy doing it
2104128 everyone is invited and everything is open to community we really want people to come
2104129 and if they have to miss it we are always doing lots of other community activities
2104130 i believe that i have the leadership skills necessary to move the city clerks office forward
2104131 having something like this could help attract more immigrants to the area
2104132 thats the hope pictou county is extremely diverse and having a group to help welcome new immigrants and make them feel at home could make them want to come here
2104133 if the council can get off the ground theres the possibility that they can contact local employers and work with them to attract and retain immigrants
2104134 lots of employers locally really value having a diverse workforce
2104135 we want to get people together and brainstorming to develop what role a multicultural group could play
2104136 the meeting will be a kick off to get everyone who is interested in it together in the same room where they can talk among themselves and figure out if they want to form a multicultural group and what they want it to do the group will decide what route it will take
2104137 some people assume that something like this is already going on and theyre surprised that its not

2104153 some guy just pulled up to the curb and gave her five grand was it in a paper bag i dont believe this
2104154 i would have thought this was a matter of common sense i have certainly seen more people on the buses with prams than in a wheelchair
2104155 but of course parents choose to put their child in a traditional pram and wheelchair users dont have a choice so if a driver lets a mother on and three stops down the road a wheelchair user gets on the wheelchair user should take priority
2104156 that requires goodwill on the parents behalf but im sure most parents would understand the situation and there would also be pressure from other passengers
2104157 were starting a letter writing campaign weve asked everybody in the facebook group to write we never really wanted this to become a big issue but we just want them to come to a better agreement
2104158 i think nows the time for lothian buses to back down and say theyre sorry theyve made a mistake
2104159 in order to ensure that wheelchairs can be accommodated on our vehicles we are unable to carry prams as they cannot be folded
2104160 we can however carry one unfolded buggy if the wheelchair space is unoccupied
2104161 i have only used the card a handful of times since the ban on prams was enforced
2104162 this whole situation has caused me a lot of distress and upset i have been unable to see friends and get around the city with ease

2104304 its been an ongoing process i wasnt really sure what was going to happen as i told brandon dont worry about something you have no control over i said what you have to do is try to be the best person you can possibly be on a day to day basis go out there and take it day by day do the best job you can on the football field i said you have to be a leader not only on the football field but in the community as well you have to prove to people that you want to be one of the top players who have ever played here you have to be like a guy like rod smith who lives it and does it thats the challenge for brandon and he is taking it day by day ive been pleased with how he has handled himself you cant do anything about the past but you can do something about the future i like the way he has handled himself both on and off the football field and thats what he has to concentrate on
2104305 there is no question about it he has grown up since hes been here as a football player and knowing how to practice and how to handle himself ive seen him grow day by day he understands what it means to be a leader as an athlete and be a leader in the community and help kids he wants to do those types of things hes a guy that has a big upside not only on the field but off the field hes a natural leader he is going to show people in the community that this isnt talk this is something that he is going to prove to not only denver but the county that hes not only a great football player but hes a quality person
2104306 you cant worry about those things rb ryan torain today he broke a little bone in the radius in the upper part of the elbow he broke a bone he is going to be out anywhere from probably six to eight weeks depending on what the mri shows thats football you are going to lose guys to injury there is nothing you can do about the situation at hand except get better and brandon to me is doing things the right way he is going to go out there and try to prove himself that he is not only a great player but a consistent player and he has to prove to everybody that he can be a great player off the field as well its a great challenge ahead i like the way he has handled is thus far and hopefully he can keep it going
2104307 its a big loss i thought he had a chance to compete to be the starting running back hes one of the most gifted running backs ive been around for a long time he is very similar to terrell davis when he came in obviously he has a setback that he has to deal with its tough with these guys he has to take it day by day as well but any time you break a bone in that elbow area obviously its a setback im just hoping there is not too much ligament damage but we will find out obviously after the mri
2104308 it took him a while to get back into football shape i think it took him about four or five days to get back into football shape even though he ran for a month and lifted for a month there is nothing like wearing those shoulder pads its not only him but a number of our guys as well he has been looking good and i just like his mindset i just said hey dont worry about something you cant control worry about what you can do today and be the best at what you can do i think thats what he is doing both on and off the football field that gives him a chance to have a great future
2104309 i cant answer that at this point the chances are we will keep it very close to what the game plan would be if he was playing in the first game we havent talked in detail about that
2104310 you have a number of running backs and the reason why you have to have depth is because of what we went through today wit h ryan there are running backs that get banged up every once in a while and if they do you have to have some guys that are proven and some guys that have some ability i think we have a little combination of both
2104311 it is unfortunate to lose a player like that for two games it hurts but that is why we brought in more receivers we have eddie royal we have good tight ends we have a good offensive line and our running backs are playing really well someone has to step up thats what it boils down to there will be a little more pressure on the offense but there are 13 or 14 games after that depending on whether he gets two or three
2104312 i dont think anyone was that surprised by it we were expecting two to four games and we have heard the rumors for the past few days i dont think anyone was that surprised by it
2104313 brandon is not a bad guy at all i have known brandon since we came in we have been in atlanta together we go to dinner all the time he is a good guy and he means well he has just been in some sticky situations and things he probably shouldnt get into he understands the situation that he is in and he understands that you only get so many chances and i think it definitely hit home with this i dont expect brandon to be in anymore situations like that for the rest of his career probably for the rest of his life
2104314 he is really talented he is a big guy and has good moves he sees the field well he picked up the offense quickly and he was protecting well i think he is still going to be a good back i havent heard what the prognosis is or how long he is going to be out but he will definitely help this team out in the future he will be ready for the second half of the season and we will definitely use him
2104315 he is doing well he has been in there since day one and there is a lot of pressure on him to come in here and start at left tackle in a league with some really good defensive ends and outside linebackers that are coming his way he stepped up and learned the offense he is doing well right now he is picking up the offense well because he has been in there since otas by now he should have it
2104316 i dont think that i have ever had a dead arm at camp my arm is kind of like rubber i can throw for a long time and a lot of balls and only need a little ice here and there my arm feels good right now at the beginning of camp i was taking a lot of reps but we have scaled it back a bit with the throwing i feel fine
2104317 i think it has been good i think that quarterbacks coach jeremy bates is doing a great job for us with calling some plays and working with me at the quarterback position our receivers are playing well and our offensive line is doing a great job i couldnt be more pleased with the way they are playing right now our tight ends and running backs are doing well we have a lot of competition at the running back position right now and with ryan torain down it kind of opens up the door for the other three to fight it out offensively i am really pleased
2104318 i am playing well i am making mistakes still but that is all part of it i have a good feel for the offense we are doing a lot of stuff right now we are kind of feeling some stuff out right now to see what direction we want to go we have gotten a lot of plays in it has been really good
2104319 any time you lose a guy like brandon for a couple games it is going to hurt he does some things on the football field that not many people can do he opens up some big windows for me and he is an easy target i have a lot of confidence in d jack darrel jackson keary colbert eddie royal and our tight ends we will split them out some and use them a little bit we are going to have to make due we dont have any choice with it we dont make the decision so we are going to have to move on and make it happen without him
2104320 i feel like i am normal again it was tough from october through april not knowing what was going on and being fatigued it was difficult i feel normal now i feel like i did a couple years ago i am back at my weight and i have my strength back it feels good to go out there every day and be consistent
2104321 all i can do is come out here every day and try and be the best player i can be my job right now is to be a leader in this team and get the guys out there better i believe in our system and i believe in what we are doing around here i expect those other young guy receivers to go out there and have no drop off at the receiver position
2104322 all i can do is come out here and be the best i can be im just out here to work hard
2104323 its just being more responsible its just being the best i can be in the community and on the field that is all it is its not hard its not rocket science like i said i have a job to do and i plan on getting it done
2104324 it is three games i guess if i do some things it might be two all i can do is take everything in and continue to work hard ive got guys out there that have to get ready for this game so i can be a leader verbally and with my actions
2104325 im not sure but im pretty sure i will find out in the next couple of days
2104326 like i said im just going to do what i am supposed to do whether it is off the field or on the field and get past this one thing about our organization our team is that they make it easy for me to come out here and not have the weight of the world on my shoulders like i said i gave that weight for someone else to carry
2104327 i am not sure it is wise to pack this

2104378 but you do it borrow when theres mass unemployment and spare capacity in the economy to be used by the new spending
2104379 if you borrow try to increase infrastructure capacity when there is no spare capacity in the economy as now in new zealand all you get is inflation
2104380 new zealand has a large pool of capital that isnt used locally very productively
2104381 in this you greatly rejoice though now for a little while you may have had to suffer grief in all kinds of trials
2104382 the data speaks for itself it took a good three years for the industry to recover from the downturn in 2001 when it had a 5 drop in capacity and a 7 drop in flights steady annual growth since 2002 looks set to plummet in the fourth quarter this year with an unprecedented global decline of 7
2104383 it looks quite possible that we may be facing a far more severe global downturn than we have experienced before the industrys resilience will be pushed to its limits in the coming months with carriers airports and passengers alike all waiting and watching for a glimmer of light at the end of the tunnel

2104453 we had an incident which prompted the review of our approach to e safety to gain access to the system pupils do not need a password they just enter their user name this meant that pupils could undertake activities on different logins which caused some disorder as several pupils took advantage of the loophole it emerged that pupils were sending offensive messages to each other via a word document and leaving messages on logins that were not their own
2104454 we are fortunate enough to have a very successful relationship with hinchley wood school which always offers us an enormous amount of support for instance it even shares some of its resources with us which is invaluable
2104455 as a school we feel that this is a powerful tool that has many beneficial features firstly it identifies any risks as we are able to pick up unacceptable words phrases and images secondly it records the issue so if a student is using inappropriate language for instance a screenshot is created consequently this allows us to take appropriate action such as educating the pupils further
2104456 every time we undertake research on the internet we explain the e safety message in a recent assembly we did a rap about e safety and used a powerpoint presentation to explain a real life role play with methods like these the message is more likely to be absorbed
2104457 a pupil was writing a message to another pupil that contained many swear words the pupil did this in a word document and then promptly deleted it the power of securus is evident here it detects words that have been deleted without being saved both online and offline which is a highly sophisticated aspect of the solution
2104458 monitoring is far more effective than internet blocking alone it has set clear boundaries for our pupils and helped us educate them about e safety we have found that it is an effective deterrent
2104459 sometimes the incidents are quite innocent and they are still highlighted but it allows us to keep a close eye on the situation which we will continue to do
2104460 it is important that our pupils are thoroughly educated in both the opportunities and the dangers that technology presents

2104507 the most noticeable was a back room presentation on the capcom usa booth that saw three
2104508 the importance of consumer feeding off of popular amusement titles can be seen in the efforts that sega and namco are placing into their respective tekken 6 and new virtua fighter fighting title launches
2104509 differences in the actual ps3 performance of tekken 6 against the dedicated amusement hardware version with the possibility of no new console hardware till at least 2013 the opportunity for amusement to push the envelope with performance is obvious
2104510 this outdated misconception is tinged with a little bit of disdain about the closed shop nature of video amusement a number of writers in the console sector were shocked by the explosion in fan interest in street fighter ivs arcade appearance

2104550 trust plays a crucial role in the provision of financial services and is fundamental to effective customer relationship management
2104551 our studies consistently demonstrate that the younger age groups are far less trusting of financial services providers than older customers
2104552 without active management of customer relationships in these target markets there is a real danger that many financial institutions will be exposed to declining levels of consumer trust in the longer term

2104554 the most important thing is staying on top of your finances
2104555 make sure you are meeting all your priority financial commitments before anything else and try to build a budget around that if you find you cant meet those commitments seek expert advice as soon as possible
2104556 we would also advise people to save as much as possible because that little bit extra could come in very useful if things get tight
2104557 its important to distinguish between the different elements of the economic downturn were currently experiencing
2104558 the credit crunch primarily affects people looking for credit particularly homeowners who may be faced with large arrangement fees or higher payments when they remortgage and also those looking to obtain loans and new mortgages
2104559 people who arent reliant on credit or homeowners who have a long term fixed rate on their mortgage may well have been largely unaffected so far
2104560 but its now very possible that we will see the knock on effects of the weak housing market combined with rising costs of living higher unemployment increasing amounts of people struggling to meet their comments and more people facing problems with debt
2104561 even if it does get to that stage there are still things you can do seeking professional debt advice from an expert debt adviser is essential if you find yourself in financial difficulty
2104562 there are a range of debt solutions available to meet different situations including debt management plans ivas individual voluntary arrangements debt consolidation loans and remortgages etc one of these could be a lifeline if you find yourself with unmanageable debt which is a growing threat in the current economic climate

2104616 air supremacy over japan could have exerted sufficient pressure to bring about unconditional surrender and obviate the need for invasion based on a detailed investigation of all the facts and supported by the testimony of the surviving japanese leaders involved it is the surveys opinion that japan would have surrendered even if the atomic bombs had not been dropped even if russia had not entered the war and even if no invasion had been planned or contemplated
2104617 no effort was made and none was seriously considered to achieve surrender merely in order not to have to use the bomb
2104618 to browbeat the russians with the bomb held rather ostentatiously on our hip
2104619 there was never any illusion on my part that russia was our enemy and that the project was conducted on that basis

2104638 this is a preview of what is to come during the fall election campaign
2104639 hillary clinton is currently supporting barack obama for a variety of reasons
2104640 if he loses the 2008 election he probably wouldnt get a second shot at the presidency
2104641 a s you combine a strong african american base with progressive white and latino voters i think it is a recipe for success in the primary and in the general election
2104642 when you combine an energized african american voter base and effective coalition building with other progressive sectors of the population we think we have a recipe for victory
2104643 i am proud to stand with senator dodd senator feingold and a grassroots movement of americans who are refusing to let president bush put protections for special interests ahead of our security and our liberty

2104655 i know we cannot be the personal guardians of every individual who gets behind a car
2104656 by refusing to blow into a breathalyzer or submit to blood alcohol at a hospital this defendant on that particular evening improved his overall position with respect to how he was going to be treated by the criminal justice system

2104672 reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation in developing countries has been the focus for the international community since the united nations climate change conference in bali last december but this is also an issue for australia
2104673 protecting the carbon in australias and the worlds natural forests is no longer an option it is a necessity
2104674 if natural forests continue to be cleared and degraded then the c02 released will significantly increase concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere the carbon stored in natural forests is a larger and more reliable stock than the carbon stored in commercially logged forests and plantations

2104720 imagine schools that are open all day and offer after school and evening recreational activities and homework assistance and suppose the schools included child care and dental medical and counseling clinics or other services the community needs

2104722 money is used so loosely in public education in ways that few understand and that lack plausible connections to student learning that no one can say how much money if used optimally would be enough accounting systems make it impossible to track how much is spent on a particular child or school and hide the costs of programs and teacher contracts districts cant choose the most cost effective programs because they lack evidence on costs and results
2104723 like kids need so much we should totally give them everything they need in one place
2104724 yeah like there should be like a food thing and a health thing and a sleeping thing
2104725 isnt that what a childs home is for shouldnt we only step in to assume parental responsibilities for individual children when parents have demonstrably failed
2104726 no way man youre a square you and all of those square parents need to shut up and like get with the plan why should we let those square parents do stuff when we can do it like awesomely
2104727 yeah give me another hit i know that me and my friends would be like super awesome at the food stuff and the like caring for them stuff
2104728 but arent you guys already providing kids with meals and still you cant teach them to read very well what makes you think that you could handle providing more services when you cant do what youre already supposed to do

2104778 members of mr olmerts party kadima and of the governing coalition need to ensure that all substantive negotiations with arab leaders are suspended until a new prime minister assumes office

2104789 to those who say the costs are still too high i ask them to consider whether the costs of oil and coal will ever stop increasing if we keep relying on quickly depleting energy sources to feed a rapidly growing demand all around the world

2104827 whenever the pedowitz report comes out the next few minutes the next decade it will be a measure of the nbas promise to make its referee program more transparent in hopes that a greater level of understanding among fans and media will help restore the lost credibility the ultimate handling of his work will be symbolic as much as practical in truth much of the lack of understanding among reporters is because too many dont take the time to understand the league has been more than willing to pull back the curtain fans cant know if the press doesnt get the stories out its a bad start that the nba isnt able to say nearly a year after pedowitz was hired for the internal review whether all the findings will be made public or some will be held back
2104828 and one last question thats been getting asked a lot what about a guy getting far more overseas than he could get paid in the nba yes yes yes nothing better than competition for the nba with the exchange rate 25mm a year paid in euros is the equivalent of about 12mm paid in euros just a few years ago so nba players look like bargains if we lose a few players thats not a bad thing in fact a couple all stars going over there is a great great thing let me explain why lets say for the sake of example a couple players got 25mm 50mm or whatever a year pay and they play on teams that just dominate they rip apart every team they face what happens next people wonder who the best teams in the world are when that discussion becomes serious the nba and those winning overseas teams get paid
2104829 bryant is the redeem teams no 1 redemption seeker the american basketball player with the most to gain kobe cant dominate these olympics the way michael phelps can and he cant touch his countrymen the way yao ming or liu xiang can but by winning a gold medal and reestablishing americas dominance in a sport it was supposed to forever own bryant can go a long way toward cleansing his legacy

2104831 like milan or something like that where i grew up or something like that peace out

2104833 we wanted our staff to have cellular connectivity throughout the complex and we decided to purchase a system ourselves to speed deployment and provide multi carrier coverage
2104834 adcs interreach unison system was clearly the best of the systems we evaluated because it offered high performance with high cost efficiency and it could support multiple carriers without requiring additional cabling
2104835 our interreach unison product was created specifically to address the wireless coverage challenges of buildings larger than 250 000 square feet delivering strong and consistent performance in dense traffic environments
2104836 like ministry lnv many of our customers are now choosing to purchase their own in building cellular systems to speed deployment of multi carrier coverage

2104892 one of the most highly regarded and appreciated soups in the world
2104893 the idea of making goop that looked like a ground beef milk shake and dumping it into perfectly good stock offered childish pleasure like making mudpies or dropping very large melons from very high places or seeing how far apart you and a friend could play catch with a raw egg before it smashed in one of your hands and yet despite these crude pleasures indeed because of them the end result was one of ultimate refinement
2104894 it will be seen that i do not refer to any vegetable for the clarification if the stock is well carried out it should be possible to dispense with all supplementary flavoring and the customary error of cooks being rather to overdo the quantity of vegetables even to the extent of disguising the natural aroma of the consomm i prefer to entirely abandon the idea of vegetable garnishes in clarifications and thus avoid a common stumbling block
2104895 consomm has to be done perfectly or not at all
2104896 rule of thumb you can read the date on a dime at the bottom of a gallon
2104897 the idea of combining this representative symbol of danish design which qualifies as high culture with patchwork which qualifies as popular culture intrigued me patchwork is like a bubble and squeak of blankets its the leftovers from the workroom and traditionally something people have made together its associated with collectivity for example people used to send patches by chain letters and then one day youd have enough to make an entire quilt

2104899 in yet another example of his extreme hyper partisanship iowa house majority leader kevin mccarthy attacked representative christopher rants for suggesting that making it cheaper and easier for businesses to replace flood damaged or outdated equipment would help businesses recover from the flood and make them more productive and profitable mccarthys own failure in his ever going quest for higher taxes to adopt the federal standards for business equipment depreciation will cost flood damaged businesses millions apparently rants pointing that out has caused mccarthy to fly into a sputtering partisan rage this should come as no surprise as his temper and vindictiveness have often been on display at the capitol verbally abusing widowed grandmothers until they have to be escorted sobbing out of the iowa house chamber and withholding aid from deaf and blind children in order to punish the legislators who represent the districts in which those children live are but two examples of his leadership style once again mccarthy has shown he finds it more important to engage in partisan confrontation than to seek solutions to the very real problems of iowans
2104900 the number 8 is generally considered to be an auspicious number by numerologists
2104901 in china just as the number 7 determines the life of a woman 8 determines that of a man a boy gets his milk teeth at eight months loses them at eight years reaches puberty at 2 x 8 16 and loses sexual virility at 8 x 8 64 the i ching which describes a system of divination using yarrow stalks involves 64 8 x 8 configurations

2104909 shipments in the business jet and turboprop segments continue to rise steadily
2104910 expanding worldwide markets are having a very positive affect on the turbine segments of our industry
2104911 although total shipments in the piston segment are down for the first half of 2008 we believe recent success of the worlds premier general aviation show in oshkosh wisconsin is a good indicator of sustained enthusiasm for the light end of the market
2104912 the experimental aircraft association reported that attendance at last weeks airventure held steady despite uncertainty with fuel prices and strength of the north american economy the energy surrounding the entire spectrum of general aviation remains robust our piston manufacturers continue to generate excitement through new product introductions that incorporate innovative technologies and are paying increased attention to growth opportunities in the international market
2104913 this will lead to worrying short term effects on business and tourism activities in the mid west and west regions
2104914 we must ensure that this short term does not become long term
2104915 aer lingus announced in early june that there was to be a 15 per cent reduction in long haul flights january to march 2009 due to the refurbishment of three aircraft however shannon airport would appear to be taking a much larger reduction than this 15 per cent announced and is losing one aircraft out of the three for this entire period from one daily flight each week aer lingus services from shannon to new york will be reduced to four flights per week and chicago to three flights per week it is imperative that they give a guarantee that these flights will be restored in their entirety from april 1 2009
2104916 for the aer lingus staff at shannon it has resulted in the loss of 50 jobs and there are fears of more losses if the transatlantic services are reduced against the backdrop of full open skies now in operation and with little or any government funding to combat same aer lingus proposal will reduce further the level of transatlantic service out of shannon
2104917 i note with interest that city jet are currently looking into the provision of a heathrow service and hope they will proceed with same

2104921 justice obviously was a huge record for us we took the ride the lightning and master of puppets concept as far as we could take it
2104922 there was no place else to go with the progressive nutty sideways side of metallica and im so proud of the fact that in some way that album is kind of the epitome of that progressive side of us up through the 80s
2104923 theres a certain kind of specific sound to that record peculiar sound whichever adverb you want to choose thats given it a kind of life of its own and a little bit of a vibe all its own there have been a lot of great musicians we admire whove come up and talked about what a great inspiration that album has been to them and to their sound its obviously awesome to be part of that that album also sent us on this whole other merry way because when we came back from touring on that record in 1989 we were like we have nothing more to offer on this side of metallica and that set us off on some other adventures when i think of the nine records weve put out its impossible for me to think of the music without thinking of the experience and when i think of the experience i have warm and fuzzy feelings but i also have questions obviously justice is well revered especially among a lot of our peers
2104924 that album songwriting wise it was just us really showing off and trying to show what we could do
2104925 weve jammed six riffs into one song lets make it eight lets go crazy with it i listen to some of that stuff and its pretty progressive sonically it has its shortcomings but that is the one where we were able to step forward from
2104926 we mixed that record while we were on the road
2104927 thats not an excuse for the way that it sounds but our ears were beat anywhere i go whenever i ask someone what their favorite record is someones bound to say justice its pretty great that across the line someone can jump into your history and feel comfortable
2104928 id have to go song by song i was just listening to 1997s reload and there are a couple of songs on there that i think are absolutely brilliant but as an album itself and as a time justice just isnt a good memory for me but those songs are good i have to try and erase the memory of that experience somehow and let the songs take me
2104929 its always the next one i think the forthcoming is great but theres always a better something the holy grail of guitar sounds i havent got there yet but i will on the next one ill write the ultimate song on the next one the hunger is always there to do it better
2104930 i dont have an excuse i just need a little help

2104943 united manager alex ferguson heard my arguments and i heard his and between the two of us we decided that the best thing for both parties was that i should stay at manchester united next season
2104944 hes never had a complaint about manchester united hes always been treated properly and i have a great relationship with the boy as do all the players
2104945 i think we can put this to bed now its finished the boys a united player and thats whats important
2104946 before any rumours emerge that im unhappy to stay at united i want to make one thing clear and that is that anyone who says that is lying
2104947 i will give my body and soul to manchester united i will be fighting to honour this shirt with the determination and dedication i have always shown
2104948 i want to make it clear that i was the one responsible for this controversy the directors of real madrid are not to blame because it was me who publicly voiced my willingness to sign for real i also ended up involuntarily being the reason for the conflict between the two clubs
2104949 i knew real madrid were interested and had allegedly made a high offer to united
2104950 for a while my intention was that united should accept to transfer me to real and to say anything else would be to deceive people and my own conscience
2104951 the fans have got to understand its very hard when a young boys tempted by all this money
2104952 hes a young lad from madeira and his father died a young man cristiano now looks after his mother sister and his brother so i can understand that money may have been tempting
2104953 the first and almost certainly the last signing we will make this season
2104954 the possibilities of going to real are big but it doesnt depend on me
2104955 this will focus the minds of all concerned to respect the date announced

2104967 im overcome with joy i knew that i would never be able to buy you a new coat for christmas even used coats down at the mission cost too much for me so i prayed to god that he would provide you with a new coat and he did and a finer coat than i ever imagined

2104970 haruki murakami explains that he began running to ward off the ill effects of writing which only became apparent after he sold the jazz club and spent several sedentary years working on his fiction
2104971 but if you want to keep on writing for 10 years for 20 years you have to be practical you have to be strong physically
2104972 at some point you just run out of things to say oh i suppose i can work up a lather and fake some outrage and rip coach scott linehan and the rams again but near the end of the teams 34 31 loss to arizona on sunday afternoon at the ed i turned to my buddy bryan burwell and confessed i dont know what to write about this anymore im low on words short on anger its just a bad team
2104973 a year ago these saints were labeled a team of destiny their march deep into the playoffs was as magical as it was improbable as if their fate had been pre determined and nothing could stand in their way well thats exactly what this season feels like only its exactly the opposite
2104974 those good feelings of semi accomplishment in that locker room are as misleading as the scent of a blooming flower in a sewer the dolphins are still winless today only two other teams are failing as miserably as they are but those two the rams and saints have excuses because new orleans is playing a first place schedule and the entire rams roster is seemingly on injured reserve the dolphins cameron said they got a heck of an effort from lemon lemons passer rating was 56 2
2104975 vamos a hacer algo que la iau no hizo que es discutir lo que sabemos sobre los cuerpos planetarios del sistema solar y alrededor de otras estrellas y discutir el valor de las diferentes maneras de definir los objetos como planetas y lo que eso significa
2104976 dijo mark v sykes director del instituto de ciencia planetaria en tucson arizona
2104977 si surge un nuevo consenso f cilmente anular a la decisi n de la iau no tengo dudas

2104980 tambi n necesitamos hacer hincapi en la importancia de incorporar nuevos descubrimientos para mejorar continuamente nuestros conocimientos sobre los diversos objetos dentro de los sistemas planetarios
2104981 pero tendremos defensores de la definici n de la iau y proponentes de definiciones alternativas que presentar n sus casos

2105118 the amount of revenues from oil is steadily increasing and they cannot be spent without prior approval from parliament and it is not appropriate for a great leader to cause damage on the reputation of his country
2105119 in a democratic country it is not normal to demand the resignation of a government that is support by 70 percent of mps and this only one month after it was formed
2105120 the prime minister has asked the opposition to closely monitor the enormous errors of the government
2105121 the prime minister does not recognize any damages to the countrys reputation made by practices of poor governance by the mismanagement of public funds or by the repeated failures to deliver on all development plans and programmes but only views damages to mauritanias reputation when the democratic opposition exercises its normal plight towards the people and nation

2105142 i was just commenting on what wonderful technology youve given me to complete this mission
2105143 you were demoted for a reason i am sorry that you are paying the price for it now but we cannot afford to break the oath for anyone no matter what the circumstances
2105144 when ive convinced the baron to support us i want my old rank back
2105145 hopefully your mission will be a success and we can afford to get you better equipped
2105146 do not worry if the baron agrees to fight for us or even to simply offer financial backing then all will be forgiven
2105147 roger i am going to disengage from active control of your mind and continue meditating so i can shield you from the baron should he prove to be hostile call me if you run into any banshees or other fey folk we dont think the host could afford to supply fey mercs to keep the baron in check but seeing as they hold dublin and iona anything is possible ill keep a slight mental monitor going though so if i sense anything i can warn you
2105148 beat up one witch doctor and suddenly everythings a struggle
2105149 are you alright i am picking up a slight disturbance in your mental balance to put it plainly youre talking to yourself again
2105150 had to use an adreno buddy one of the ghouls got into the cookie jar and he had to be put down
2105151 roger just remember that if a lycanthrope or a wraith hears you coming you wont hear them coming
2105152 im gonna need a mental barrier against fear also increase my metabolism for the time being im gonna need to be a furnace in case it manages to touch me
2105153 you will not harm the baron i am loyal i am loyal i am loyaaaaallllll
2105154 im red ruin im trying to get him out of here
2105155 not host not the black but the red red dead youll be dead soon but maybe
2105156 no thank you i need to remain alive for now tell me where the baron is and i will do what i can to help him retake the castle
2105157 your fear is delicious let me taste it and i will tell
2105158 roger i am dropping the barrier take your voice box off line we dont want any errant screams attracting unwanted guests
2105159 now i have the strength my mind is lucid but not for long i can create a portal to where they are keeping the baron i cannot go the necromancers that keep him chained they will surely banish me then i could no longer serve
2105160 the pain of death is better than the pain of damnation we serve the baron because the alternative is far worse now come i have not much time before i lose my mind again
2105161 the king desires your power and he always gets what he wants maybe hell let me play with you a bit as a reward
2105162 weve danced this dance before i am not one to fall prey to your seduction and it is only your necromancers holding me here that stops me from killing you
2105163 baron it is only my necromancers here that stops the tainted king from simply twisting you to his bidding bowing to him of your own free will no matter how grudgingly will save you from a life of slavery i believe youll be much more useful if you can think for yourself and king kaledros trusts my judgement i know youll crack one day once the hunger becomes too much
2105164 you can smell my blood pulsing just beneath my skin if you give in now you can have me
2105165 i have always wanted to know what it felt like the kiss of the vampire the sweet pain of it
2105166 you have no idea what this is like you could not possibly want this
2105167 you brought a sonic blade yes give it to me
2105168 i am quite unimpressed with the state of my castle so you are going to do something for me you are to go to the tainted king kaledros and tell him that i find his so called army laughable
2105169 your siege was broken by no more than myself and one representative of the red ruin army
2105170 now that is what i call power you would never have caught me to begin with if you hadnt bribed that nixie to keep putting running water in my way then catching me out after sunrise you will pay now get out of my sight

2105187 gaat u maar rustig slapen de regering waakt over u
2105188 both sen obama and i promise we will end washingtons stagnant unproductive partisanship
2105189 but one of us has a record of working to do that and one of us doesnt
2105190 legitimately tout moments of independence from his party and on some issues such as earmark reform and climate change he and i share goals even if we may differ on how to get there
2105191 the centerpiece of his economic plan amounts to a full throated endorsement of george bushs policies
2105192 all the labels and false divisions and categories that define us
2105193 its interesting that the two parties chose non ideological candidates thats where the independent voters are
2105194 theyre tired of all the bickering and posturing and they want it to stop
2105195 no longer can a republican candidate win by just running up the score with our base
2105196 it would be hard to concede independents in any way because historically democrats have done a little better with independents
2105197 he starts out with this anchor that hes got to overcome
2105198 its not just about iraq its about the economy katrina a mismanaged administration
2105199 you cant just look at the national polls you have to look at them state by state
2105200 it looks like independents are more populist and nationalist than democrats
2105201 each of the candidates appeals to a segment of whats important to independents
2105202 the perfect candidate for independents this year would be a populist nationalist
2105203 i think the best argument mccain can make is that he has a record of change
2105204 hes been able to reach across the aisle to democrats and independents tend to like that
2105205 its true that mccain has had some things to say about climate change and torture and so forth but those arent really the big voting issues this year
2105206 theyre trying to say well he wasnt on the right side before but hes on the right side now and then theyre trying to say look how many times hes gone against his party those two messages dont work together
2105207 he can say oh ill fight for you ill stand up to the special interests etc but i know the one guy whos got the welts
2105208 ive had hearings i have fought the administration tooth and nail on this issue
2105209 i have fought as hard as i can to make my constituents fellow citizens of the state of arizona and this country aware of the threat to our planet that climate change poses
2105210 i know of no record that sen obama has on any aspect of this issue any involvement any legislation
2105211 i think independents are looking for a type of person but theyre also looking for new ideas
2105212 at his age with his vision i think independents will be drawn to him and what he has to offer
2105213 independents are independents because theyre sick of all the political junk and all the political infighting
2105214 barack sees that so clearly he hasnt been here so long that hes been ground down by the game
2105215 its a whole lot tougher to defend a record than it is to defend a lack of a record
2105216 its a lot tougher to defend a vote against a popular bill where a third of it affected your state in a bad way
2105217 if you compare the campaign hes running to the kind of campaign bill clinton ran in 1992 theres no comparison
2105218 a lot of politics is capturing the imagination of voters
2105219 youve got a guy whos charismatic and in a lot of cases that trumps policy but in a lot of cases that also has an impact on policy because theyll follow the candidate and then go along with the policies
2105220 it is not left or right liberal or conservative to say that we have tried it their way for eight long years and it has failed
2105221 it is time to try something new it is time for change
2105222 each will try to shove the other out of the ring
2105223 the campaign that proposes multiple debates is usually the one that knows its in the weakest position
2105224 a lot of independent voters just by their nature tend to be less engaged than the partisans but this kind of event would be so different that it would probably draw people in
2105225 im not saying he has to show that hes mastered the intricacies of every policy
2105226 he just has to show people heres how im going to solve the problem
2105227 as a person of faith of resurrection faith i see death as a friend not a foe and the experience of death is i am convinced a transition from life to life from grace to glory

2105244 hello its that time of year again for the summer outdoor retailer show in salt lake city utah
2105245 nobody from barca has asked me about berbatov there has been no movement on that front all i know is what i read in the papers
2105246 we will have to wait and see what happens it is a question of waiting a bit more and then we will see how things turn out
2105247 all i can say about that is that i know nothing about it either we have a list of forwards and we are working on that not on what journalists or agents are saying
2105248 its a scheme that ranged from street operatives to the ceo of a hospital
2105249 scheme to defraud the medi cal and medicare programs out of millions of dollars
2105250 the hospitals allegedly were aided by a patient recruiting operation on skid row that plucked homeless people from the streets and delivered them with fake medical conditions to the hospitals
2105251 each of the patients received 20 to 30 when they returned to the assessment center after spending one to three days in the hospital according to the suit
2105252 within the past four years hundreds if not thousands of other homeless persons in skid row have been recruited hospitalized treated and discharged in a manner substantially similar as part of a long running scheme to bilk the medicare and medi cal programs out of millions of dollars by causing unnecessary hospitalization for paid recruits
2105253 today we are sending the message that those who would seek to defraud our healthcare system and those who would callously exploit mentally impaired and drug addicted homeless men and women to turn a profit will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law
2105254 these criminals thought they could get away with this scheme because they figured no one cares about the homeless on skid row they were dead wrong
2105255 at first when i saw all these agents in all their shirts i thought it must be a training exercise
2105256 but then i realized it was the real thing they told me i couldnt go back to my work area
2105257 we feel theres a serious intention by the american forces for a withdrawal timetable at the very least
2105258 it should not be considered an end to the mehdi army but its a halfway step to dissolving the mehdi army if the u s began to implement a withdrawal timetable we shall complete the path to dissolution
2105259 it is a good step to repair our mistakes especially sectarianism and sectarian killings we are very sorry about these sectarian killings because some parties supported this violence for their own advantage
2105260 to renounce violence and participate peacefully in the iraqi political process
2105261 as of last night the schedule was one of the issues being discussed between the two sides there is no agreement yet but this is what the iraqis are asking for
2105262 if we find this does not happen and the u s forces change their stance over the timetable we can change direction also
2105263 this will not mean ending the ceasefire it will depend on whats going on the ground

2105271 migliaia di persone hanno perso la loro terra a causa dellespansione delle aree minerarie le morti provocate dal crollo delle cave o dalla vigilanza delle imprese sono fenomeni frequenti
2105272 due tre anni fa abbiamo scoperto che i cinesi stavano comprando quantit sempre maggiori di giada dalla birmania per farne souvenir olimpici
2105273 la avrebbero utilizzata per realizzare souvenir articoli di gioielleria anelli
2105274 devono coprire turni di 12 ore o anche di pi talvolta di notte e con pochissime pause
2105275 per anni la giada in birmania stata usata come un bene di guerra per finanziare i combattimenti prima dai gruppi ribelli di kachin e oggi dal regime birmano
2105276 la giunta ha una partecipazione diretta in diverse miniere in alcuni casi attraverso joint venture con imprenditori privati
2105277 le miniere birmane sono comandate col pugno di ferro dalle autorit militari e dalle societ minerarie
2105278 le condizioni deplorevoli delle miniere includono una dilagante confisca delle terre estorsione lavoro forzato lavoro minorile inquinamento ambientale e condizioni di lavoro insicure per i minatori
2105279 il commercio di gioielli e pietre preziose birmane stato valutato intorno ai 647 milioni di dollari usa nellanno fiscale 2007 2008 da aprile 2007 a marzo 2008
2105280 i dati doganali riportati altrove tuttavia calcolano un valore delle esportazioni di pietre preziose nellanno solare 2007 di 651 milioni di dollari usa
2105281 se i dati sono corretti in entrambi i casi rifletterebbero un notevole aumento delle esportazioni di pietre preziose birmane visto che i guadagni dichiarati nellanno fiscale 2006 2007 erano di circa 297 milioni di dollari usa
2105282 quasi tutti i compratori su circa 300 persone presenti erano cinesi la maggior parte proveniva dal continente solo qualcuno da hong kong e taiwan
2105283 il tutto durato un paio dore verso la fine di unintera giornata di asta
2105284 una aveva le dimensioni di unautomobile unaltra di un grande tavolo ed erano soprattutto queste ad attirare i cinesi
2105285 il prezzo di base dasta per un grosso pezzo di giada grezza delle dimensioni di una sedia era di un milione di euro i prezzi medi per i pezzi pi piccoli variavano tra i 300mila e i 500mila euro

2105300 for over a decade the united kingdom has had a remarkable run with stable economic growth and low inflation
2105301 however strains were emerging even before the economy was hit by major global shocks notably inflation and inflation expectations were on the rise the housing market was overheated and headroom under the two fiscal rules was eroded
2105302 but we could save all the oil that theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires and getting regular tune ups you could actually save just as much
2105303 theyre making fun of a step that every expert says would absolutely reduce our oil consumption
2105304 efficiency experts say that keeping tires inflated can improve gas mileage 3 percent and regular maintenance can add another 4 percent many drivers already follow their advice but if everyone did we could immediately reduce demand several percentage points in other words obama is right
2105305 if our use of fossil fuels is increasing our reliance on middle eastern dictators while destroying the planet maybe we ought to use less
2105306 we can use those twisty carbon fluorescent light bulbs we can unplug our televisions computers and phone chargers when were not using them

2105340 acid rain is one of several pollution problems in asia that need solving in the coming decades but we need to appreciate the potential consequences of that clean up one of which could be an increase in methane emissions as the effect of the acid rain wears off
2105341 the reduction in pollution happens during a stage of the lifecycle when the rice plant is producing grain this period is normally associated with around half of all methane emissions from rice and we found that simulated acid rain pollution reduced this emission by 24 per cent

2105367 sinn feins silence over these arrests is deafening given that they have been very vocal in the past to say that republicans were not involved

2105410 over the last several months we have sharpened our focus as a company on maximizing our efficiency on all levels
2105411 given the current economic conditions we believed it was necessary to hone our attentions on operational efficiency the time has also come to enhance our sales and marketing programs while putting more emphasis to our e commerce capabilities
2105412 in our search for the right person to execute that strategy we received over 50 resumes from qualified candidates interviewed 15 of them and five of them made it to our final round interviews bill stood out amongst all others as the most qualified individual to fulfill our needs
2105413 our companys strategy will continue to consider new development opportunities and existing assets that can be repositioned with the right strategy for each as a new focus we will endeavor to grow our management business the management side of our business has been an evolving process for a number of years whg developed the protocol to the point it was scalable for all kinds of branded hotels in secondary and tertiary markets which has been its forte since the companys genesis however we are now in a position to expand that expertise as an offering to a wide variety of hospitality products
2105414 i think we have some of the most talented individuals in the industry working throughout our properties and in our corporate group
2105415 our assets have been well capitalized and positioned to be leaders in their various markets our brand flags in turn position us to fare well in the economic uncertainty some forecast for our industry in the next couple of years
2105416 i grew up in a family restaurant business in north louisiana in ruston
2105417 then i tended bar and waited tables during my college years at baylor
2105418 that company no longer exists but it was a hotel owner operator franchisee that operated under marriott hilton and a number of other major flags at the time it was based in houston texas
2105419 from there i went to work for the durbin companies which was a private family owned owner operator of branded franchise hotels much like windsor their founder was jim durbin who was president of marriott international for 25 years
2105420 they were a public company and were purchased by barcelo a private spanish company we also operated our own properties until we spun off our own reit highland hospitality and put all of our ownership into that
2105421 one thing i bring to the table is 30 years of experience in managing every major family of brands as well as experience in independent destination resorts with golf courses spas and conference centers those were in both the private and public sectors
2105422 before interviewing with windsor i was aware of its senior management was familiar with the company and its positive reputation in the industry i am very happy to be here

2105428 the grierson awards short listing process was a considerable challenge every year we see productions of the highest calibre entered for the annual awards and 2008 has been no exception despite recent concerns for film makers facing reduced budgets tighter filming schedules and new requirements for multi platform delivery the continuing health of documentary filmmaking rests upon the adaptability resourcefulness commitment and creativity of producers and directors as well as the enthusiasm of audiences for non fiction content delivered through cinema television and online services the grierson awards remain the highest accolade for documentary producers by recognising and celebrating quality work we look forward to the next stage of the judging process in 2008
2105429 but we realized there were no stars in it so that it must be a cloud of gas
2105430 we now think that what were looking at is light from a quasar the bright stormy center of a distant galaxy powered by a supermassive black hole
2105431 the quasar itself is no longer visible to us but its light continues to travel through space and the voorwerp is a massive light echo produced as this light strikes the gas
2105432 from the point of view of the voorwerp the galaxy looks as bright as it would have done before the black hole turned off its this light echo that has been frozen in time for us to observe its rather like examining the scene of a crime where although we cant see them we know the culprit must be lurking somewhere nearby in the shadows
2105433 the nearest active quasar called 3c 273 is 1 7 billion light years further away
2105434 its amazing to think that this object has been sitting in the archives for decades and that amateur volunteers can help by spotting things like this on line
2105435 it was a fantastic present to find out on my 25th birthday that we will get observational time on the hubble space telescope to follow up this discovery
2105436 this discovery really shows how citizen science has come of age in the internet world
2105437 hannys attentiveness alerted us not only to a peculiar object but to a window into the cosmic past which might have eluded us for a long time otherwise trying to understand the processes operating here has proven to be a fascinating challenge involving a whole range of astrophysical techniques and instruments around the world and beyond this has also been some of the most rewarding astronomy ive done in years
2105438 when we got the news about hannys voorwerp we were intrigued to find out what it was and fortunately we were able to slew the telescopes round and get some great images and spectra to study it
2105439 it was only later that we heard the story about how it had been discovered its inspirational that hanny picked out this object from galaxy zoo in her spare time and nobody had ever seen anything like it before

2105445 calling on the egyptian government to respect human rights and freedoms of religion and expression in egypt
2105446 whereas egypt plays a significant role in the middle east peace process and in the fight against international terrorism and fundamentalism whereas the copts egypts largest religious minority suffer from many forms of discrimination whereas the ibn khaldun centre for development studies and its founder ibrahim have been threatened for their work to promote democratic reforms
2105447 a platform for promoting the rule of law and fundamental freedoms
2105448 calls on the egyptian government to end all forms of harassment including judicial measures of media professionals and more generally human rights defenders and activists
2105449 encourages the egyptian government to fully implement and protect the rights of minorities
2105450 basically a non issue and there is no discrimination especially in view of the accentuated attention dedicated over the past few years to citizenship rights
2105451 and such allegations are refuted by the coptic community in egypt first and foremost
2105452 all information circulated about a meeting held between these groups in their coptic capacity and egyptian diplomats in the us are simply untrue
2105453 those are simply fabricated accounts some members of these groups were present in a meeting that el kholi held with members of the egyptian community in general to discuss a wide range of legal issues but not to discuss the actions of the coptic groups

2105470 hemos sido muy cr ticos con el tema de la navegaci n por el ebro y con esta forma de navegaci n y el tiempo poco a poco nos va dando la raz n las ltimas noticias son la sustituci n de esos motores que iban a funcionar con energ a solar por motores fuera borda y la empresa seguramente va a pedir las indemnizaciones pertinentes al ayuntamiento de zaragoza por los problemas de los servicios
2105471 seguimos pensando que es un aut ntico capricho que ha costado caro y que ya viene desde la construcci n del azud con unas f rmulas de navegaci n inadecuadas que est n costando a la ciudad un dinero muy importante y que no tienen ning n tipo de compensaci n
2105472 tenemos claro que pediremos explicaciones y responsabilidades al ayuntamiento de zaragoza
2105473 desde el momento en que se iba a construir un azud que no iba a costar nada que ha acabado costando por encima de los 25 millones de euros desde el momento en que los dragados son continuos y necesarios de forma peri dica que se forman corrientes entre otros no se consigue el objetivo llegar a la expo cuando ya hemos superado la mitad de la exposici n
2105474 todo eso nos lleva a un fracaso de planificaci n que ha costado caro y cuyas consecuencias no acaban aqu porque las posibles indemnizaciones a la empresa pueden estar ah y pueden ir adelante y suponer un aumento de los costes de un aut ntico capricho

2105499 for now i feel ready for the reserves i improved a lot for the under 18s last season and i felt with our good team in front of me sometimes it was too easy and my concentration slipped i have been waiting for my chance to move up and it is here now and i want to be 100 per cent ready to perform for them

2105513 targeted testing of immigrants therefore will increase the opportunity to ensure that hiv positive immigrants are made aware of their status and support expedient counseling prevention and treatment
2105514 from a public health perspective if hiv were treated as a reportable infection through citizenship and immigration canada that would be one way of improving the timeliness of connecting with these folks when they come to canada
2105515 it is under consideration but were in discussions on the issues that were raised in the report
2105516 citizenship and immigration canada wisely decided that people with hiv do not pose a danger to public health or safety
2105517 and so i think its on that basis that citizenship and immigration canada doesnt have a strong connection to provincial health authorities in terms of reporting newcomers with hiv
2105518 i think there are huge privacy concerns that are raised when people with hiv go through the system particularly given the fact that hiv is not something that is easily spread
2105519 but i know there have been concerns expressed over the years of cic not doing a particularly good job in how they communicate an hiv positive diagnosis to people
2105520 so i think theres certainly room for improvement about connecting with care and treatment

2105715 we appreciate the epa taking a careful approach to the waiver request and agree with their determination that it should be denied
2105716 we are deeply disappointed that epa has failed to recognize the very clear signs that the food to fuel policy is causing severe harm to the economy
2105717 it is outrageous that the federal government continues to require and even to subsidize the diversion of corn from the food supply into the fuel supply
2105718 gov perry recognized that a near tripling of feed prices would cost texas livestock and poultry farmers greatly put meat industry employees out of jobs and strain texans wallets
2105719 the same is true across america and unfortunately the decision by the epa today ensures that this will continue to be the case unless congress acts to restructure the ethanol mandates taxes and tariffs
2105720 the bush administration has missed a chance to immediately reduce food prices and more importantly to avoid the certainty of much higher food prices in 2009
2105721 congress and the next administration must immediately restructure our food to fuel policies if we want to avoid runaway food inflation for many years to come
2105722 right now were on super paper mario and we have two more pure hearts to go weve played a lot of mario games and its been great i even went out and bought an old 8 bit nintendo to play the original super mario in its original form its wonderful what nintendo is doing where you can still get that old game on the wii or ds and its much nicer with cooler graphics
2105723 play a lot of mario kart and super mario brothers but he usually has me play the hard levels
2105724 the wii is one of those markets where nintendo owns both the hardware and the software but part of that is because they make such damn good products so its the toughest platform for third party developers we dont have a software or content base ideally suited for it so it doesnt really play to our strengths and were pretty busy with other stuff right now
2105725 thrilled that nintendo has had this kind of success because they took some risky bets and its always nice some bold thinking pay off for them but i dont think well be on the platform
2105726 ahora las definiciones de cultura que existen son incluyentes la del presidente ch vez y la de jos mart y ambas tienen que ver con el arraigo del pueblo venezolano con lo que somos

2105744 i strongly feel obligated to prevent the incedious effort of various organizations to implement the sharia in our country

2105747 when chicago public schools was introduced to the teen health amp wellness database from rosen we were impressed with the quality and variety of the information the look of the web site and the ease of navigation

2105749 it is a great product that will be used to fill a niche in the information market that teens need and want
2105750 the price is affordable the interface is inviting the teacher resources are well done and the possibilities are all there to support quality information searching it will be great having this resource for our students

2105753 this should be high on your list of things to get right getting mixed media on a page when the story allows is like adding nitrous to your news section
2105754 the problem is that without the article that content becomes just another talking head or blurry splodge
2105755 so if you remove the video from the context it fails
2105756 for me a pre roll ad in embedded video is like those banner ads that break up an article page after the first couple of pars
2105757 if you have an embedded video player on the page then it should display a meaningful poster frame the image it shows until the user presses play
2105758 you should apply the same editorial consideration to selecting these images as you would a photograph

2105800 id like to develop my game by playing with various teams and various players in european competition
2105801 from my playing experience against them i know saint etienne are a side who can decide a game when they have to
2105802 they always have a full stadium at their home games i believe it is a joy for a player to be playing in front of crowds like that but id like to be accepted by the supporters first
2105803 i want him to be a fans favourite in st etienne and become a successor to hidetoshi nakata

2105818 i had to use an enormous amount of energy for this divided diet
2105819 it was beyond my imagination that the opposition parties would oppose so many bills for reasons i still dont understand
2105820 the dpj needs more than rosy dreams to become a responsible political party and control the government
2105821 the dpj should back up its policies by identifying its source of revenue instead of just making irresponsible remarks
2105822 people often ask whether we plan on using the two thirds vote again but we havent even reached the starting line
2105823 it is a backward discussion to be talking about the two thirds vote the first thing is to begin deliberations in the diet between the ruling and opposition parties
2105824 i think that peace in the indian ocean where many japanese oil tankers operate is surely in the national interests
2105825 the diet is a place where the ruling and opposition parties discuss issues to find a common goal and i hope the dpj will make the next diet session one that draws out what is necessary and what is a good answer for the people and the nation instead of focusing mainly on politics
2105826 why we need drastic tax reform is to make the taxation system logical
2105827 it is unwholesome to try to cover 80 trillion in government spending with tax revenues of only 50 trillion and if this continues we will end up leaving a pile of debt for the next generation
2105828 i dont really feel macro measures need to be taken in the current situation
2105829 is a difficult country and the current situation is that there has not been much progress on how to conduct the probe

2105833 the over riding goal of house republicans for the next session of the general assembly is to adopt an honestly balanced budget with no gimmicks or tax increases to enact permanent constitutional tax caps for every hoosier taxpayer and allow taxpayers to keep as much of their money as possible
2105834 with committed republican leadership the states prior record of deficit spending will remain behind us and the fiscal integrity of the last three years will be continued
2105835 i am glad governor daniels has finally responded to my repeated calls for tax relief for hoosiers
2105836 unfortunately the governors rhetoric doesnt match reality with his plan hoosiers wont be getting a rebate this year the states surplus was built on the backs of working people as a direct result of the increased taxes property cigarette sales and local income taxes that mitch daniels pushed through at this critical time in our states history we need leaders who will act immediately to reverse our downward economic slide and give hard working families a break from the high taxes that this administration has imposed
2105837 the only person that mitch daniels is interested in protecting is himself and hoosiers are tired of this governor and his out of touch campaign spin while mitch daniels spends millions publicly patting himself on the back taxpayers wont soon forget that his balanced budget was created on the backs of homeowners across this state
2105838 get 1 72 of relief for every dollar of new sales tax

2105847 but tonight things went our way and we caused a lot of things to happen
2105848 we had a couple of blitz schemes that we went to in the second half and got some good pressure
2105849 for most white actors today roles of color from the classics to some of the sensational writing that is currently being done for the theater are not even an option for them because of their race and im not sure why

2105851 now i have more confidence i play four games and i know more my players these two weeks with the players are very important to me

2105853 what often happens to be a limiting factor is that those stem cells can make any cell type so you get a mixture of cell types in your dish
2105854 it does come down to controlling these cells and thats what this paper shows is that by one single gene we can control these cells
2105855 we have a cell type that we can now grow in the culture dish and then really try to push them into specific cell types like pancreatic islet cells liver cells lung endothelial cells that could be of use in the long run for regenerative medicine

2105865 if the federal government is truly serious about doing something with the aids virus we need to take steps that would isolate the carriers of this plague it is difficult to understand the public policy towards aids it is the first time in the history of civilization in which the carriers of a genuine plague have not been isolated from the general population and in which this deadly disease for which there is no cure is being treated as a civil rights issue instead of the true health crisis it represents
2105866 in light of the extraordinary funds already being given for aids research it does not seem that additional federal spending can be justified an alternative would be to request that multimillionaire celebrities such as elizabeth taylor madonna and others who are pushing for more aids funding be encouraged to give out of their own personal treasuries increased amounts for aids research

2105882 na een presentatie van willem karssenberg enige maanden terug bij kennisnet heb ik mezelf gedwongen om dit nu eens echt van de grond te krijgen in de lokalen waar de opleidingen medewerker ict en medewerker beheer ict is ondertussen skype en topdesk ge nstalleerd en in de lessen helpdesk van mijn collega wordt volgend schooljaar deze combinatie ingezet voor beide opleidingen daarnaast heeft een andere collega ondertussen voor de proeve van bekwaamheid van de opleiding medewerker ict skype ingericht om te gebruiken bij de helpdesk achtige kerntaken op de pc s die de studenten tijdens de proeve van bekwaamheid gebruiken is skype ge nstalleerd daarnaast zijn er een aantal schoolaccounts aangemaakt in skype
2105883 waar we vroeger met vaste telefoons werkten of in sommige gevallen met mobieltjes want niet ieder lokaal heeft een telefoonaansluiting kan ik nu met mijn laptop draadloos contact opnemen met de examenkandidaten via skype in de proeve van bekwaamheid ben ik een interne klant die problemen heeft met zijn pc en via skype moeten de studenten me helpen het probleem op te lossen het grote voordeel met vroeger is dat we veel flexibeler zijn met het gebruik van lokalen want overal kan ik draadloos verbinding maken via skype daarnaast heeft iedere student op zijn werkplek een eigen telefoon terwijl in het verleden een telefoon gedeeld moet worden hierdoor was de doorloop van een proeve van bekwaamheid minder want 1 persoon kan maar tegelijk gebeld worden daarnaast kan ik met mijn collega s verspreid over lokalen via skype chatten en informatie uitwisselen dat deden we al met live messenger maar alles met een systeem is natuurlijk veel makkelijker bijvoorbeeld wie wanneer gebeld gaat worden of wie wanneer naar een bepaald lokaal moet gaan de volgende skype stap gaan we in september zetten met de lessen helpdesk

2105976 its a luxury title combining class and substance with unique authority on the equestrian world
2105977 we place great emphasis on providing the quality of content that our readers who are people accustomed to the best expect
2105978 we also ensure that our clients benefit from privileged exposure by limiting and selecting the advertisements featured in equestrio china

2105980 its both informed and glamorous and i think that is key to our success we have developed a reputation for getting to places and events that most titles do not reach weve reported in full colour from some of the most remote polo locations on the planet such as the baroghil festival on the pakistan afghan border where yak polo is the order of the day the shandur pass in the hindu kush the jungle airstrip that doubles as a polo field for the world elephant polo championships in nepal and ridden across the maasai mara with the annual wildebeest migration

2106017 el empate parec a sellado pero la viveza se hizo un lugar fue en un segundo en el que messi por si hac a falta demostr por qu era tan necesario en pek n eso le alcanz a la selecci n para tener un debut triunfal en los juegos que no puede hacer olvidar las asignaturas pendientes
2106018 riquelme y messi los dos de los que tanto se habla sobre su relaci n fuera de la cancha se juntaron dentro donde m s importa

2106200 we are pleased with the ongoing successful integration of our acquisitions from last year
2106201 as much as i wanted to get out there im seriously physically challenged by not being able to hear
2106202 the guys to my left and right dont deserve anything to happen to them because of my personal pride
2106203 hes going to have one hell of a time understanding what people say if he cant get visual cues
2106204 limits his ability to identify enemy locations by sound hear commands from his team leaders hear radio traffic over a squad radio or speak with local nationals in combat which could have negative ramifications to the mission
2106205 hearing loss is present in all forms in the army
2106206 its impossible to validate whether he will lose his hearing more or less in the future i feel that infantry is his best place
2106207 thats kevin wanting to lead his men and do the right thing
2106208 wants to stay infantry this is his life i vote he stays infantry
2106209 i came to terms with myself and realized that i was not as confident in my ability to continue my job
2106210 it was better for me to realize this than to ignore it
2106211 i dont know how to approach commanders and tell them of what my feelings are
2106212 because ive been around long enough to know that ill be looked at as a quitter
2106213 we see cases of soldiers deploying when they did not meet the hearing standards
2106214 the commander has to make the call based on the mission but the doctors should make the case very clearly that deploying cpl x against his or her medical judgment is a decision that could be held against the commander
2106215 this is a disability you dont want to get worse
2106216 you dont want this person to be put in a position where he might hurt himself or others
2106217 they say my symptoms are mimicking signs of depression who the hell knows what that means
2106218 they gave me three sheets of paper with breathing techniques another describing how to imagine being in a happy place and to remind myself to relax when i started getting anxious
2106219 for them to tell me to think happy is what will resolve my issues immediately i have no faith in their judgment
2106220 you cant ask the person to make the determination because emotionally theyre too connected to wanting to overcome their disability

2106226 i know that you the athletes officials and all our supporters will be flying caymans flag proudly in beijing and everyone in cayman will be looking for our flags waving at the olympic pool and in the olympic stadium
2106227 i had an interesting chat with marcus trescothick a few weeks ago and hes happy playing for somerset and hes retired from the international game but i couldnt retire from that
2106228 thats why i kept on saying i couldnt retire because that is what id miss ive retired from one day cricket to make sure that is what im ready for
2106229 i miss playing for england i miss wearing the three lions and the amount of crap thats been written about me not wanting to play and im not interested i love playing for my country it means a lot to me
2106230 it wasnt going very well and i was right to be dropped
2106231 ive had a break out of it and i feel a little bit more refreshed and i feel better than i was and hopefully this is a long road to a more successful 12 months forward than the 12 months ive just had
2106232 to be honest the first ball was not a good ball
2106233 it was a short wide long hop which he smacked straight to gully
2106234 it wasnt as if it was top of off hed nicked and it had been dropped it was just pleasing to get the first over out of the way
2106235 it was an interesting first over i never get too upset about dropped catches it is one of those things people dont do it on purpose it would have been nice but its all about england
2106236 its unfortunate that most of us batters got out to adequate deliveries or loose shots

2106276 it is with good reasons says sancho to the squire with the great nose that i pretend to have judgment in wine this is a quality hereditary in our family two of my kinsmen were once called to give their opinion of a hogshead which was supposed to be excellent being old and of a good vintage one of them tastes it considers it and after mature reflection pronounces the wine to be good were it not for a small taste of leather which he perceived in it the other after using the same precautions gives his verdict in favor of the wine but with the reserve of a taste of iron which he could easily distinguish you cannot imagine how much they were both ridiculed for their judgment but who laughed in the end on emptying the hogshead there was found at the bottom an old key with a leathern thong tied to it

2106279 i think the lesson for conservationists today is that yes the world is full of surprises theres a lot of uncharted territory
2106280 today is a heart breaking day for both the ivins family as well as the victims and the families of the victims of the 2001 anthrax attacks what the public demanded today was concrete evidence instead it was deluged with everything but the government released search warrants investigative tools designed to discover evidence not to serve as evidence and treated these warrants as smoking guns the governments press conference was an orchestrated dance of carefully worded statements heaps of innuendo and a staggering lack of real evidence all contorted to create the illusion of guilt by dr ivins the government would have the american people believe that after seven years and more than 15 million of taxpayer money they have found the individual responsible for the heinous attacks of the fall of 2001 nothing could be farther from the truth in truth bruce ivins was a devoted husband and father who worked for more than 30 years to defend his nation and its soldiers against the terrible effects of anthrax the statements of scientists and co workers at ft detrick are uniform in their support of dr ivins and that has been gratifying to his family just today we were privileged to attend the memorial service for dr ivins held at ft detrick md it was attended by hundreds of soldiers scientists and family members dr ivins was characterized by his commanding officer for his openness sharing humor and curiosity and was lauded for the central role he has played in the protection of the american soldier no one who attended that service could believe that dr ivins committed any crime

2106283 did you know that if you keep 5 more of your customers you will make 35 95 more profit those were the findings of a harvard researcher when he investigated the financial impact of keeping customers around the equation is simple make us stick around usually by making us happier and well make you more money cut out support services make it difficult to talk to you etc and while you might save in the short youll lose in the long term
2106284 acquiring new customers involves costs that can be significant and it may take some years to turn a new customer into a profitable customer
2106285 as customers become more satisfied and confident in their relationship with a supplier they are more likely to give the supplier a larger proportion of their business or share of wallet
2106286 as the relationship with a customer develops there is greater mutual understanding and collaboration which produces efficiencies that lower operating costs
2106287 satisfied customers are more likely to refer others which promotes profit generation as the cost of acquisition of these new customers is dramatically reduced
2106288 loyal customers can be less price sensitive and may be less likely to defect due to price increases this is especially true in business to business markets where the relationship with the supplier becomes more valued and switching costs increase
2106289 since 2005 the planned peace brigade has been limited to its core headquarters unit for which the un has not had any demand as a result denmark norway sweden and finland have submitted a joint written statement that the force should be disbanded and that they will all be withdrawing from shirbrig
2106290 the danish government would rather commit resources to international operations and build up regional peace keeping forces in africa than support shirbrig the force which is based in the royal life guards barracks at h velte north of copenhagen was set up on danish initiative in 1996

2106322 there are a large number of left leaning religious and political organisations that are active these days offering an alternative to the religious right
2106323 a liberal theological perspective involves less traditional views of the divine spirituality and religious authority
2106324 the core of the religious left consists of people who are liberal in both their theology and their political outlook a pattern commonly associated with the term progressive
2106325 another important sub group consists of those who have a conservative theological perspective but liberal views on political issues
2106326 the annunciation of a religious left like the heralding of the religious rights demise has become a growth industry
2106327 it will not succeed for one simple reason the religious left is really a political agenda speaking to christians just as the religious right are religious people influencing politics
2106328 the religious left is nothing but repackaging of politics for non doctrinaire spiritualists it is not a genuine appeal to people of faith
2106329 that works to elect and promote candidates who share our values through grassroots mobilisation raising our voices in the media and paid advertising

2106423 the technology sector is fairly robust because it has become part of the dna of organisations in the private as well as the public sphere
2106424 in the private sphere the rate of growth of spending on technology has slowed but it is still growing year on year businesses see that by spending more on it it takes more costs out in the long run

2106460 in a nutshell people got shorter once they became farmers very short when they urbanised and industrialised then grew since the 1840s in the uk and have been growing ever since
2106461 most estimates put the height of barack obama the presumptive nominee of the democratic party in the 2008 u s presidential election between 6 ft 1 in and 6 ft 2 in 1 2 they rarely show him shaking hands and working the crowd because it becomes immediately obvious how short he is i estimated his height as 56 or 57

2106562 there is no sight of any military presence in the streets except in front of the presidential palace and the tv and radio stations there isnt even a curfew here this situation is calm people are going about their usual business
2106563 i deeply regret the overthrow of the government of president sidi ould cheikh abdallahi
2106564 no to the army we support sidi the elected president
2106565 the events of wednesday were a correctional movement against sidis corrupt regime
2106566 the military has managed to save the country over the years whenever there was a crisis that was caused by unjust rule
2106567 it was a good decision for the military men to control everything
2106568 sidi is the elected president and he had a right to sack any army commander he wanted
2106569 i was terrified but at the same time i was expecting this
2106570 the army deposed the regime of former dictator maaouya ould sidahmed taya in a coup in 2005 and they basically brought sidi to power so they took him down too i dont think theres any need to panic or be surprised
2106571 we lost three years and three days the army has set us back
2106572 let me be clear in my opposition of the coup it is also imperative to boycott the elections under this illegitimate regime the situation is no longer acceptable when a military man changes an elected civil regime in less than an hour
2106573 those weeping for the loss of democracy now are fooling themselves everyone knows sidi ould al sheikh abdullahi was not the real ruler of mauritania and that it was ould abdul aziz all along so nothing has changed really
2106574 they already dont give us any attention things will be even more complicated now

2106629 it the injury was a setback especially mentally but at the same time i think it helped me being away from the media for a while no interviews for three or four weeks
2106630 its really kept me relaxed i havent had anxiety about the whole olympics because ive just been in rehab so i think its really helped mentally
2106631 ive had a lot of treatment on it and this is the olympics so im sure that with all the adrenalin flowing im going to be at 100 percent im going out there to win the gold medal even with all my setbacks
2106632 i was really upset about missing out on the 200 metres i mean i knew that america has up to five great athletes or more so i knew someone wasnt going to make it i just didnt think it was going to me
2106633 i was really upset about it because my goal was to come back with three gold medals obviously im going come up short this time but i hope it will all go well next time
2106634 usain bolt has done something no ones ever done and thats run the 100 metre dash that fast
2106635 hes set the world on fire with the 9 72 the 9 76 and the 9 8sec hes on fire right now and a 19 6 just to top it all off in the 200 it shows that hes an all around athlete
2106636 thats what i respect about him what hes done so far has been phenomenal
2106637 asafa should be the favourite with the most 9 7sec but hes been the dark horse and i think thats how he likes it he doesnt have any pressure on him
2106638 the whole of his country is looking to usain to bring home the gold medal and it only makes sense but hes still a tough competitor and i know hes going to great things
2106639 ive been racing bolt since 2005 in the 200m theyve been some of my best races against him down in jamaica and asafa powells been the 100m king

2106643 the challenge is to take advantage of the new technology and have people actually see a quality difference on the other end
2106644 its adapted very well to the new workflow we put together and its also a very open system at the athens games in 2004 90 percent of our operation was analog with beta sp tape decks and now thats completely reversed we worked closely with our apple integrator simplemente to design an expanded workflow built around final cut studio and xsan we also use panasonic dvcpro hd p2 solid state cameras and our engineers evaluated many different solutions to determine that final cut pro would be the best match weve used a completely tapeless workflow with apple in mexico before but never on location and never on this scale
2106645 and the most important goal is creating a standardized workflow for all of our productions with apple and final cut studio the entire process is transparent to the producer all the work happens in hd at the end of post production we can do all of our down conversions to standard definition and analog as needed all within the same system
2106646 it definitely was the best networking event i have attended in years in terms of the fun kind and warm people that i have met at networking events

2106653 this will be a long journey that will start with liquefied petroleum gas lpg go through imported liquefied natural gas lng and hopefully end up with natural gas from our own shores or our neighbours
2106654 over the past year petrosa has developed this opportunity to a point where there are plans to import lng for power as well as fuel production this initiative will reduce eskoms reliance on diesel as a fuel for the power stations in the cape and obviously make more fuel available for transportation purposes the implementation of this initiative will go a long way towards establishing a viable gas industry in south africa
2106655 south africa is primarily a coal based economy with abundant cheap coal reserves and other energy sources struggling to compete
2106656 the current high prices of gas and the absence of infrastructure such as transmission and distribution make it difficult to introduce natural gas into the south african economy
2106657 viewing south africas energy prospects as a regional issue brings new energy systems into play but it also brings along with it political issues
2106658 for example it is not an easy task to import natural gas from mozambique into south africa to be able to do this one needs to establish intergovernmental customs royalties and profit distribution agreements and the second one starts making it an international trade it starts becoming somewhat more difficult and complicated
2106659 if we have no natural gas in south africa and we want to build energy infrastructure based on natural gas we will become dependent on imports but once the country becomes dependent on imports it becomes dependent on the whole system of trade mechanisms and relationships that exist on that basis and the longer the supply chain the more it is at risk of third party intervention
2106660 for example if south africa starts to import gas from the middle east it is faced with the risk of war in that area which in turn makes a country extremely vulnerable because if by some means an attacker blockades the main shipping lanes south africa will be left with no means of transporting the natural gas through that supply channel
2106661 that said owing to south africas current electricity supply crisis many companies are seeking to establish open cycle gas turbine ocgt plants combustion turbine plants fired by liquid fuel in this instance by turning a generator rotor that produces electricity
2106662 petrosa is however in the process of evaluating the viability of importing lng as a short to medium term solution for its own requirements and for power generation
2106663 it will provide the country with a great environmental benefit
2106664 gas is more environment friendly than coal however the economics for gas based power generation are very dependent on the landed cost of natural gas in general the economics of coal based power generation beat gas fired generation by far
2106665 gas provides opportunities to establish generation capacity away from the traditional coal deposit areas gas fired power generation plants can also be established in a much shorter time than the equivalent coal fired plants
2106666 if it is coming from a deep sea well it will be more expensive than if it was for example readily available in the vicinity of pretoria in terms of the infrastructure necessary to extract it clean it up and deliver it to where people are going to be using it it is important to consider the ease of access to it compared with the abundance of low grade coal south africa is blessed with which cannot easily be exported
2106667 in the bigger context it is may not be gods answer for south africa
2106668 the region needs to find and produce significant amounts of competitive natural gas before it can attempt to establish it as an energy option
2106669 it is exotic it is expensive and quite frankly a complicated car ferrari only makes a limited number of cars a year and only a few are allocated to the south african market and believe me those few ferraris are definitely going to go to the rich and famous the ordinary man on the street can beg all he wants to have it but the chances he will get it are zero coal is equiva lent to a volkswagen it is readily available and easy to use and maintain and relatively affordable
2106670 whether south africa will decide to move away from coal as a primary energy source will depend largely on how the developed world behaves
2106671 if the developed world trading partners start saying that they will not import steel and aluminium from south africa because it has been produced by using dirty electricity coal the country will be faced with an economic collapse
2106672 we continuously argue through the world energy council that this is not a constructive way to move forward the developing world is struggling with energy accessibility and poverty it has to burn coal because it is a simple matter of survival the first world greenies should stop complaining and start helping the developing world to obtain technologies that will allow them to burn coal more efficiently and effectively and assist them in conducting carbon capture and carbon sequestration
2106673 we need to make a strategic decision on whether we can afford it
2106674 the conversion cost that consumers will have to pay to change their current appliances for gas powered ones will be significant and most people will not do it even people in johannesburg who used to have town gas will have to go through a conversion there will need to be a subsidy for people to convert from town gas to natural gas as it has a different composition
2106675 for example if legislation says that one is not allowed to have an electric stove but has to have a gas stove then consumers will have no choice but to change therefore there will be a market to increase supply capacity and that would allow suppliers of lpg to invest in increasing lpg availability but the consumer will have to pay at the moment lpg producers need to consider what peoples choice will be and estimate their share of the energy market before they decide to increase production capacity
2106676 the pipeline infrastructure evolved over the past 43 years and now comprises over 2 084 km of pipelines
2106677 smaller scale gas based cogeneration plants for example pulp and paper industries can produce electricity and steam at higher efficiencies than an ocgt sasol is currently supplying pipeline gas to two facilities in kwazulu natal one in newcastle and the other in richards bay both of which produce both electricity and steam sasol will pursue similar projects where gas availability allows
2106678 at the petrosa board of directors meeting on february 15 this year approval was given for petrosas upstream division to drill the e m west and f o gas wells as well as the e ar5 oil well
2106679 at the same time the board also granted approval for maintenance work on the f be01 gas well currently a non producing well in the fa field
2106680 our chance of success in e m and f o was calculated to be about 83 and 72 respectively according to our team
2106681 one major imperative for petrosa is to ensure security of supply of liquid fuels for our country within that directive lie responsibilities to search for explore find and repatriate to south africa fuel making ingredients to ensure such security of supply these supplies could be in the form of crude or natural gas
2106682 the chances of sasol diverting that back to electricity for consumers are probably low unless we get another jump in electricity tariffs but again there is only a limited amount of gas in the field
2106683 sasol is further exploring for additional natural gas off the coast of mozambique through its sasol petroleum sofala subsidiary which is a joint venture between sasol petroleum international and enh
2106684 they all walked away from the project because the economics do not make sense the investment you have to make to exploit a deep sea gasfield for a little bit of gas to sell into a market that cannot afford to pay top dollar just doesnt make it work
2106685 the main reason why explorers keep going there is that the namibian government wishes to be independent of south africa and wants to exploit this resource they invite companies to come and explore but so far these companies always end up walking away

2106687 in spite of global economic uncertainty and rising inflation outbound travel in asia pacific is poised for steady growth over the rest of 2008
2106688 this is largely due to the fact than income and employment have not been seriously affected by the global credit crunch and higher inflation has yet to translate into higher prices in plane tickets and costs of accommodation
2106689 should these conditions change however the outlook will be very different

2106757 and with such a move the earth commission for thermostatic control will have transformed itself into an orwellian style world government with its own currency army and control over every person and every inch of our planet
2106758 as horrific as such an outcome is if we delay action to combat the climate crisis the carbon dictatorship may become essential for our survival

2106862 the parliament and the government has to work seriously to resolve the situation
2106863 we want to solve the problem not ignite the problem and i came to kirkuk with a message from the kurdish people which is the message of brotherhood love and invitation for understanding
2106864 if there is a shortcoming in the kurdish performance we are ready to rectify it
2106865 kurds are fed up with the crooked policy of malikis government it is time to bring kirkuk back to its origin kurdistan
2106866 malikis government has to prove its influence by ensuring all iraqi factions are represented in the provincial council and not let some parties control the city
2106867 we have fears about foreign agendas by parties inside and outside kirkuk why have all the parties positions unified against the kurds
2106868 today after reading house minority leader christopher rants plan to help those hit hard by the recent
2106869 their proposal is another major warning sign that the republican party has veered terribly to the political right and is completely out of touch with mainstream iowa we have thousands of individual iowans hurting right now many of them with their homes and property devastated we have levees that need repaired or entirely rebuilt we have hundreds of miles of roads and rail that need repaired we have insurance obligations that need to be monitored and federal assistance that needs to be obtained and the list goes on and on and what is the house republican proposal to deal with flood relief tax cuts for big corporations
2106870 this is 122 million over two years that could help middle class families and small businesses recover instead of another handout to big business in non affected areas
2106871 even more appalling is that the republican proposal for flood relief is virtually the same corporate tax cut proposal they pushed before the floods even occurred what a joke

2106883 pei growers have certainly pioneered the effort they have already developed their systems for managing potato production in a very sophisticated way but everybody else across the country needs to collaborate with pei

2106902 we fully expect this to be a competitive election but we fully expect gordon smith to win
2106903 if you look at the presidential poll that also came out it shows obama beating mccain by 3 points
2106904 i think many people in politics in oregon will tell you he leads mccain by more than that so that may be a sign that the sample may lean a little more conservative
2106905 there is no question that this is one of the hottest senate races in the country
2106906 no poll has shown smith above 50 percent which means that more than half of oregon voters are willing to vote against gordon smith
2106907 the ordinary voter is going to say ok do i want someone breaking into my car or stealing my car or stealing my identity no i dont and i want government to put these predators behind bars and pull them off the streets

2106909 its not in the hands of the people not only that special crew that was there last night but those afterward who might respond
2106910 i was also very pleased with the tone of the dialogue
2106911 there was a willingness to listen and be tolerant of differing views sometimes there was a playful antagonism but there was also accommodation it was a very canadian style dialogue underneath it all there was a sense of a need for conciliation
2106912 what im hoping to do tonight is explore our common experiences and try to look towards a future of parrsboro and for common solutions
2106913 like many of you im concerned about the future of parrsboro i think every single one of us shares that concern and we may come at it from different directions so what i think is possible tonight is that by teasing out these differences and listening to each other we can try to perhaps come to a consensus on what parrsboro could be and should be five 10 and 20 years from now
2106914 there are a lot of great things here but if someone is not interested right away and there is no vitality when they drive in they get their coffee and they drive out
2106915 we need to celebrate more about what is here we cant ask people to dig for it we have to give it to them
2106916 right now you ask each other what do you want to do and theres nothing to do
2106917 it should be what do you want to do next there should always be something to do this is a beautiful town for the older generation but the youth are going to be the older generation and you have to keep them happy in order to keep the town going
2106918 a lot of people really dont think they would be allowed to do that and maybe we need to encourage people more and let them know we are a town that wants to showcase our talent

2106949 i am disappointed with the defeat because all the players did not display their full potential
2106950 i think the reason we lost is because physically we were inferior we already have a plan for our next coming two matches and we will prepare and do our best to get three points
2106951 if i had the answer to our problems in front of goal i would fix them right away and finishing is something that we have to work on
2106952 its very disappointing we tried to stay focused but timing wise the goal really hurt us but there are two games left and we are still in with a chance
2106953 this kind of game especially the first of the olympics is tough my boys put up quite a fight and i am very proud of them
2106954 first olympic win and there is nothing better than that

2106958 hey i understand what parents go through i feel their pain i really do but that letter told me once and for all that i had been right all those years ago and im still on target today when i feel this way suburban christianity is frequently not about an honest following of jesus its about an edited reworked jesus who blesses the american way of life and our definition of normal and happy

2106966 humans would have no choice but to establish an earth commission for thermostatic control
2106967 inevitably one day some commissioner will suggest that their work would be more effectively done were they to concentrate on the root cause of the issue the total number of people on the planet
2106968 and with such a move the earth commission for thermostatic control will have transformed itself into an orwellian style world government with its own currency army and control over every person and every inch of our planet
2106969 as horrific as such an outcome is if we delay action to combat the climate crisis the carbon dictatorship may become essential for our survival

2106980 a 13 year veteran of the police service told him he had never seen such a vicious assault in all hit time on the force
2106981 numerous tips had been received both directly from citizens and also through crime stoppers this information and assistance was greatly appreciated
2106982 erheblichen gefahr f r das verlagsgeb ude und das personal

2106984 mohammed war so sanft ich sp rte kaum den stachel des skorpions in seinen armen zu liegen haut an haut war die wonne nach der ich mein ganzes leben gesucht hatte
2106985 i bugged the shit out him i was asking him what could i do should i go into this could i do something in this field i couldnt really grasp what i wanted
2106986 i was like why couldnt i make a music video doing somebody elses songs i felt by doing that first wed be able to open doors for artists like myself
2106987 i knew it was going to take someone like him joel that has the experience with a deaf brother in law seeing what he goes through every day
2106988 so i knew that it was in his heart to help the community
2106989 for me the idea for the first video was to try to get as wide of an audience as we could
2106990 i wanted deaf people to be able to enjoy this hard of hearing people who may not know sign
2106991 we had to ride the special bus to school the short one it was cool
2106992 she worked with me constantly and being in the public schools was good for me because i was able to have the deaf classroom but i was also able to go out to the mainstream classes
2106993 i had both and i think that was really good for me
2106994 i would learn all the lyrics to the song while she was driving
2106995 but the thing that probably drove her crazy was that i would keep playing it the same song over and over again
2106996 we certainly thought for the first step we needed to come out of the box strong
2106997 i want to be able to go to d pan com and see rock songs country songs all different kinds of songs
2106998 in the future we could get into so many different things
2106999 my goal is to create opportunities for deaf and hard of hearing performers directors cinematographers graphic design artists i see it developing relationships with hearing people which doesnt happen that much just like me working with joel and scott i would love to have those opportunities for other deaf people

2107001 mccs cricket activities taking place around the country reflect the breadth and depth of our participation in the game today

2107003 we look forward to seeing some memorable cricket and hope that the hundreds of people involved in mcc youth cricket will go on to play the game for years to come

2107019 vrem sa insuflam oamenilor spiritul respectului pentru natura acest parc este realizat cu multa grija si este darul nostru al oamenilor din petrom pentru timisoreni ne am dorit mult sa l oferim chiar de ziua orasului pe 3 august acest proiect nu ar fi fost posibil fara implicarea partenerilor din primaria timisoara dar mai ales a comunitatii multumim timisorenilor care s au implicat in acest proiect chiar de la debutul lucrarilor faptul ca in prima zi in care a fost deschis parcul este plin de viata arata succesul acestui demers
2107020 am ramas placut impresionat atunci cand am aflat ca petrom a ales timisoara pentru proiectul parcurile viitorului am ales impreuna aceasta locatie care era doar un loc in care copiii incercau sa se joace astazi inauguram un adevarat parc si sincer nici eu nu ma asteptam sa iasa asa de frumos intr un timp asa de scurt acest proiect este un bun model de parteneriat public privat si pentru asta vreau sa multumesc companiei petrom

2107031 mendenhall will give us the ability to keep doing what were doing he might work as our goal line runner if he shows the vision and patience for that and hell kill the clock at the end of the game he should have fresh legs at that point in the game
2107032 rookie running back mike hart ran and did everything in the preseason opener just about as hes done in practice rushing for times for 53 yards and catching three passes for 28 yards it really wasnt surprising when you watch him practice and watch him work we felt like hed have a good game he did everything he was called on to do he had two pass protection pickups he handled those well he caught the ball out of the backfield and ran and made people miss its probably what he has been doing for eight or nine years
2107033 redskins coach jim zorn said rookie receivers malcolm kelly and devin thomas on tuesday need to improve their conditioning and said he anticipates the injured receivers will have a hard time having an impact on the offense early this season
2107034 i sent him an email i know its wrong and i feel really bad
2107035 i just came home one day and i sent him an email not thinking then i thought about it and sent him another email the next day saying i was so so sorry i felt bad the way it was done
2107036 there were a lot of reasons why i was annoyed with him for a number of things
2107037 i reckon that carson was faithful to me i was to him i cant tell you the real reasons for the break up i am going to give him the respect
2107038 i just want to clear one thing up i was never with carson for the money
2107039 when i went to america carson paid for my ticket but i paid my own way
2107040 they want 18 000 from us and were both on the pension and get half of that

2107045 it was mostly ad libbed with russell asking her for advice about hosting the show
2107046 theres also a 9 000 pound elephant in it as in the elephant in the room
2107047 this run is unique in our series because it starts at a higher elevation and remains above 9 000 feet for the entire route with a mix of forests and open meadows the trails provide a cool and refreshing place to run and the opportunity to enjoy a variety of wildflowers still in bloom on the upper reaches of the mountain
2107048 this year it will be prettier than ever the flowers are stunning right now you can run a 10k anywhere this race is beautiful and its a great challenge
2107049 start out slowly because if you go out like youre running at 6 000 feet its gonna kill you give your lungs and legs time to figure out the altitude and then youll be good
2107050 the two titles are bigger than me i am so overwhelmed and excited of which way it might go this year something has to happen something big for the children this is a gift from god he has given me the key to open the doors of the entire east africa and beyond
2107051 i thought i didnt have the chance to win when you from europe to visit africa people think you are special and rich but i want to show the children that we are all equal and i want them to know that we acknowledge them i will do my best to help make changes for underprivileged children
2107052 it is time to give the african children back their voices we are going to do so by knocking on doors and working closely with africans african leaders and not bono or angelina jolie to implement a system that will ensure no african child goes to bed without food

2107090 workers have effectively not had a pay increase in the last number of months
2107091 they will expect us to start lodging claims because inflation hasnt stopped price rises havent stopped energy costs food costs are all increasing
2107092 workers are demanding pay increases to meet with those increases and to keep their pay in line with those and with at least the rate of inflation
2107093 we set out with a view to concluding agreements with employers that would secure peoples living standards pay increases and also secure jobs

2107104 both translation committees nrsv and nasb seemed to have taken more care in their translations of the new testament this might explain my earlier comment that analyzing these verses seemed easier than the previous ones in the ot and i dont think it was simply the fact that my greek is much better than my hebrew the difference in character between the testaments in these translations may just be another instance of a long standing tradition of slighting the old testament

2107108 it seems hard to believe that over one hundred years ago these two lions killed and devoured in a most demonic manner nearly one hundred and forty people in east africa bringing a complete halt to the construction of the british railway
2107109 i think that the incident of the uganda man eating lions is the most remarkable account of which we have any record
2107110 this is one of several major medical fraud investigations that are ongoing
2107111 theres too much money being illegally stripped from public health care programs and the potential impact to those with a legitimate need is too great to let such fraud escape federal prosecution

2107115 i find this all utterly unbelievable its like dark age superstition and malice all thriving with the endorsement of secular institutions here in 21st century america it is a culture of deluded lunatics calling the shots and making human beings dance to their mythical bunkum
2107116 they are increasing security at the republican convention out of fear of me i am puissant fear me o trembling republicans a flick of my wrist and cathedrals tumble to the earth a nod of my head and heathen legions rise up and swarm like flesh eating locusts over the faithful
2107117 by the way i didnt want to single out just the cracker so i nailed it to a few ripped out pages from the quran and the god delusion they are just paper nothing must be held sacred question everything
2107118 its clear that at least this tier of the catholic hierarchy is as deranged as the wackaloons flooding my mailbox
2107119 the center for inquiry has put together two letters on the webster cook affair one to be sent to ucf president john hitt and the other to the catholic league
2107120 theres three or four conclusions to it but i think it showed that the massive annexation that the citys proposing is too great
2107121 i think it also shows that to annex the commercial strip does not solve the problem of immediate expansion and development sure maybe over a period of years there could be some transposition there but i think umas report really shows that no go and get some undeveloped land develop it and get on with the show and were quite willing for that
2107122 while we would like to remain good neighbours to the city as we have in the past we find the citys present plan so unreasonable that we can not in good conscious agree with them and thats why we are opposing the citys annexation proposal
2107123 its really not development its re development with annexation that land will be brought within city boundaries it could then be serviced with city level services so thats water sewer storm fire police all that kind of stuff and subsequently re developed so when cities grow into new areas that have existing development whether its agriculture or lower level commercial development low level services theres change so we can expect markets will be changed we would expect that there would be businesses that would sell by choice and that new businesses come in it could be hotels it could be a big box it could be retail it could be some other form of development that needs that water and sewer
2107124 there are people knocking on the door saying that they need to gain access to the transcanada or they are going to go somewhere else
2107125 were looking at a plan that embraces 30 years into the future there are going to be a lot of uncertainties involved in it but youve got to start somewhere and what people have to recognize at some point it time we have to know what is our sphere of influence what is our area that we are in control of in order that we can develop that plan so that we can hire the engineers hire the consultants do the work lay it out properly zone it properly as well as find the money to finance the project and as is well known in this day and age develop a workforce to attend to the work that needs to be done in order that we can affect an orderly growth plan so at the end of the day we can sit here and talk about individual pieces back and forth all day and i dont know that were going to accomplish anything unless we can agree on a fundamental tenant that yes southwest saskatchewans got to grow the city of swift current also has to grow within that that is all that were trying to do but we do have to have to know the areas that we will control in order that we can plan for that and finance it and bring it to reality so that future generations your children have a place to come and work
2107126 we do not have access to developable land now or in that 30 year period along the transcanada unless were to hopscotch over the rm and that would be cost prohibitive and rather foolish so the direction is clearly defined sooner or later it has to happen or you will wind up with a part of a community inside another community it is simply that orderly plan
2107127 we have in excess of 5 million in improvements in that area from 19th west to the former peavy mart road we feel that we need to be compensated for that we can not just give that as a windfall to the city of swift current
2107128 the reason we recommended the city take that is because the city provides the vast majority of the services to that property so its not about the fields or the traditional agriculture component of that site its the buildings the city provides water the city provides sewer directly to those sites and is jointly providing fire protection theyre providing all the services it should be in the city thats the rationale
2107129 our firm was hired by the city last year to come up with i guess the ideal growth plan for the city for residential commercial industrial and other forms of development
2107130 basically our objective for the report was to find the best case scenario for the city in terms of growth cost effective well planned balanced this is what it is we were solely contracted by the city and in our opinion the best plan
2107131 i think that we felt there was some discrepancies or flaws in the hannah crosby report and we just wanted an independent engineering company to do a report that was completely separate from anything the city did
2107132 therefore know that the lord your god he is god the faithful god who keeps covenant and mercy for a thousand generations with those who love him and keep his commandments
2107133 he who calls you is faithful who also will do it
2107134 but the lord is faithful who will establish you and guard you from the evil one
2107135 and from the days of john the baptist until now the kingdom of heaven suffers violence and the violent take it by force

2107173 well im not a designer i create them for their artistic value theres a lot of work that goes into them but i didnt create the covers its more of a recycling project and i think that people appreciate them for being usable pieces of art
2107174 im reading more since ive begun the project im not one to live in the past but i appreciate the connection to human experiences i love the unknown details of these eras gone by and i think that these books from the 20s and 30s are relatable and accessible on that human level
2107175 ive debated mass producing them of taking them to china but theres an appeal to the authenticity of the work that went into the covers and i want to honor that
2107176 im just going to keep on working things in my life seem to go in cycles and im sure ill have more time for these soon

2107185 the postponement was a unilateral stunt pulled by a board in fear of losing an election contest and was designed to block the democratic process limit accountability and further entrench the board and management team
2107186 ask yourself whether you believe this board was truly serious about exploring alternatives to maximize stockholder value or whether the board was more interested in disenfranchising stockholders we think the answer is obvious

2107188 wenn die finanzielle grundlage da ist und wir langfristig ein erfolgreiches turnier etablieren k nnen mache ich weiter diese berzeugung muss ich schnell haben
2107189 von einigen gab es positives feedback aber nicht von allen
2107190 einen start von rafael nadal halte ich f r realistisch
2107191 the reality is that youve got a military establishment and i think they are really running things
2107192 youve got a military establishment which i think believes it has the power to crush resistance it had the power to ensure there wasnt a free and fair election
2107193 it will take more than that to provide guarantees on property rights and other macro economic issues
2107194 i dont think the market believes that the situation is going to work if its just business as usual
2107195 i do believe that keeping mugabe on as titular president is not a deal breaker as far as financial markets and other investors are concerned
2107196 you dont go from a situation where two or three weeks ago people were being killed in the streets for being mdc then three weeks later you have a nice power sharing agreement in which everybody agrees to work with each other
2107197 oui cest un bon joueur mais bon c tait en suisse
2107198 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices
2107199 if in order to get that passed we have to compromise in terms of a careful well thought out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage i dont want to be so rigid that we cant get something done
2107200 the republicans and the oil companies have been really beating the drums on drilling
2107201 and so we dont want gridlock we want to get something done
2107202 it would repeal tax breaks for oil companies so that we can invest billions in fuel efficient cars help our automakers re tool and make a genuine commitment to renewable sources of energy like wind power solar power and the next generation of clean affordable biofuels
2107203 like all compromises it also includes steps that i havent always supported
2107204 i remain skeptical that new offshore drilling will bring down gas prices in the short term or significantly reduce our oil dependence in the long term though i do welcome the establishment of a process that will allow us to make future drilling decisions based on science and fact
2107205 represents a good faith effort at a new bipartisan beginning

2107229 there are safety measures there are internal cameras on all the major routes and that would include swift current
2107230 really the main thing that stc wants to do is to ensure that all drivers receive the training that they need in the manitoba incident the driver responded in a quick manner to disable the bus and was able to take charge of the situation and that is why we want to ensure that our drivers have all the training that they require and need
2107231 they have cell phones and they have the number of the next location where they are to arrive at the protocol is to call the agent and have the rcmp meet the bus if there is an incident or something like that
2107232 never to this magnitude the last incident was in december of 2004 where it was on a north battleford to meadow lake route and there was an allegation that a knife was present but it was never found and never used the police met the bus and there was really not a serious incident present
2107233 it would be very difficult to do we have 278 locations in saskatchewan where people can come onto the bus it would be very difficult to do we could implement that in larger cities like swift current but it doesnt make a lot of sense right now to do it that way
2107234 we are finding that our numbers are very strong and that they are staying where they were before certainly before the incident we were looking at increased ridership over last year
2107235 i have asked stc last thursday to do a complete review of their operations and provide me with an analysis of whether there is anything else that we can do to enhance security on our buses

2107246 projects funded by taxpayers money tend to lack the spirit of competitiveness and the public entities often carry them out following past practices its difficult for the government to change the custom by itself

2107252 all these people up here in their farms say to us how do you plant your soybeans in 30 inch rows thats too much youll never get the weeds
2107253 theyve been doing it for 10 years and they grow thousands and thousands of acres theyve got the same equipment we have and theyre making a lot of money
2107254 its just different it hasnt been tried and tested here thats all
2107255 the demand for organic product right now is at an all time high
2107256 we as government have been receiving inquiries and producers have been receiving inquiries from all over the place
2107257 the demand is great and its across the board not only just for grains
2107258 right now theres a really big demand for organic not enough supply right now to meet demand
2107259 thats slowly changing but its more of a challenge for organic farmers to find information about production
2107260 its a major learning curve when you cant go to your neighbour down the road and talk to him about what he did
2107261 yeah but now theres an awful lot of people around here that are looking to see how we do
2107262 and i think if we do well well have a lot more people looking at getting into it

2107265 a year after her notorious performance she jokes with the host and looks
2107266 it was improvisational questions and answers with host russell brand just like other promo guest stars ll cool j and pete wentz did russell joked about there being sexual tension and britney shot back i dont feel the tension the other joke was about no one knowing who russell was so she called him by the wrong name ll called him russell bland and britney called him russell brown
2107267 the joke of the whole thing is there is an elephant in the room
2107268 the timing isnt right for the horse mike iavarone of co owner ieah stables and i discussed it and were not going to saratoga there is no reason to rush him back hes coming off a tough race
2107269 the theme of mystery allows us to explore the parameters of myth mythology and suspense dipping into a diversity of ideas from alternate worlds the occult and film noir to sci fi the conspiracy theory and the old fashioned detective story we will push against the borders of mystery and unveil some new truths
2107270 the spears family is very close friends with the the maloof family and vice versa

2107272 she was chatting with friends she looked like she was having a good time
2107273 even allowing for some increase in capacity over the next few years
2107274 the implication is that it will quickly translate into a price spike although there is a question over how strategic stocks might be used to alleviate this
2107275 a good example is energy conservation and improved energy efficiency if you leave that to the market it is simply not going to happen or is going to happen very very slowly
2107276 at one level we should be worried because it means we are going to be running into energy shortages on the other hand maybe its a good thing maybe thats what we need much higher prices to actually get people to start doing sensible things about energy

2107380 lo estoy viviendo como lo tiene que vivir un entrenador ocupado en su equipo y en los rivales con la m xima ilusi n y sabiendo que tenemos detr s a toda espa a y que el momento del baloncesto espa ol es bueno pero hay que refrendarlo con hechos no con palabras
2107381 este equipo tiene calidad el momento del baloncesto espa ol es muy bueno y hay mucha calidad vamos a intentar aprovechar esta calidad para poder seguir diciendo lo mismo despu s de los juegos porque sabemos que las cosas hay que demostrarlas haci ndolas no habl ndolas
2107382 son muy listos jugando son muy vivos ese tipo de jugador que est pendiente de todo se desenvuelven en ese nivel especialmente dimitris diamantidis y theodoros papalukas luego tienen jugadores muy grandes que son tiradores de fuera eso nos crea problemas ese juego inteligente y los apoyos que tienen en ioanis burusis costas tsartsaris y antonis fotsis capaces de defender dentro y tirar desde el per metro hace m s peligrosos a los exteriores
2107383 es cierto que espa a gan a grecia en madrid con muchas dificultades en la semifinal del europeo a falta de tres minutos bamos perdiendo ellos adem s de la preparaci n han tenido competici n el preol mpico lo que han demostrado lo han demostrado en competici n oficial y nosotros en amistosos
2107384 se puede contar con todos los jugadores ya que algunos que han tenido alg n problema muscular como ra l l pez o alg n problema articular como juan carlos navarro est n bien
2107385 hemos llegado al nivel que quer amos eso ahora hay que demostrarlo pero es el nivel que quer amos para empezar los juegos el primer partido de una competici n tiene un plus de mentalidad m s dif cil es muy importante el resultado pero hay que convenir que queremos seguir mejorando durante los juegos y que el primer objetivo es clasificarnos entre los cuatro primeros descargamos la tensi n en cada partido individual no ser igual si alcanzamos los cruces
2107386 en el tercer secreto se predice entre otras cosas que la gran apostas a en la iglesia empezar en lo alto
2107387 its in our moments of decision that our destiny is shaped
2107388 e poich molti cattolici usano metodi contraccettivi senza sentirsi dei peccatori questa politica morale secondo i mittenti un totale fallimento
2107389 la lettera non tocca neanche da lontano la vera questione che al centro della humanae vitae cio il nesso fra il rapporto umano e spirituale fra i coniugi
2107390 e subdolamente a lasciare intravedere chiss quali interessi commerciali a favorire luso del contraccettivo
2107391 abbiamo pensato che lestablishment a roma e in vaticano presti particolare attenzione ai media italiani e che quindi la lettera sarebbe stata vista dalle persone a cui vogliamo che arrivi il messaggio
2107392 ci chiaro che la chiesa cattolica non potr progredire fino a quando non avr fatto onestamente i conti con il paradosso della humanae vitae
2107393 la maggior parte dei cattolici fa uso di contraccettivi moderni ritenendola una scelta morale e considerandosi cattolici a pieno titolo eppure le gerarchie cattoliche negano completamente questa realt costringendo i sacerdoti al silenzio su questo come su molti altri temi legati alla sessualit
2107394 evidentemente sono un problema afferma monsignor gianfranco ravasi neo presidente del pontifico consiglio della cultura da poco giunto a roma da milano perch invadono unarea che ha una sua dimensione universale e simbolica cara a un miliardo e duecento milioni di cristiani sparsi nel mondo
2107395 ci vuole comprensione ed equilibrio anche se sarebbe auspicabile che il comune di roma intervenisse quando la loro presenza raggiunge unincidenza eccessiva ma nemmeno si pu pensare di cancellarla del tutto
2107396 per africa sub sariana si intende lafrica nera cio quella pi colpita
2107397 per africa sub sariana si intende lafrica nera cio quella pi colpita
2107398 lafrica sub sariana cio quella di seconda espansione islamica e quella che in cui gli europei fanno i loro comodi e la chiesa cattolica va ad evangelizzare e insieme ad altre organizzazioni vanno ad portare aiuto la storia ben pi conplicata come puoi ben vedere dalla mappa le zone pi colpite sono quelle del sud africa che con la chiesa cattolica non hanno niente a che fare
2107399 il burundi invece si cattolico al 65 nella mappa cattolica messo solo che un paese di 27
2107400 in burundi landamento positivo visto dalla fine degli anni novanta al 2005 stato seguito da un nuovo aumento della diffusione dellhiv il cattolicesimo in burundi ce sempre allora quando diminuiva era merito del cattolicesimo ora che cresce e merito dell cattolicesimo uguale o forse non centra niente mentre altri paesi non cattolici si trovano al 30 mentre la mappa allo stesso tempo indica 2 paesi con cattolicesimo maggiore al burundi con valori pi bassi di hiv dellafrica come lo commenti
2107401 tuttora la regione maggiormente colpita dalla pandemia di hiv aids qui vivono 30 milioni di soggetti portatori di hiv pari a tre quarti dei sieropositivi del mondo e addirittura il 90 dei bambini infetti dal virus in questa parte del mondo laids rapidamente divenuta a prima causa di morte superando in negativo mali atavici come la malaria o la tubercolosi in 12 stati africani il tasso di diffusione del virus nella popolazione adulta 15 49 anni supera il 10 ossia dieci volte la soglia oltre la quale lepidemia si considera generalizzata
2107402 mentre altri paesi non cattolici si trovano al 30 mentre la mappa allo stesso tempo indica 2 paesi con cattolicesimo maggiore al burundi con valori pi bassi di hiv dellafrica
2107403 africa magrebina e sahariana musulmana africa sub sahariana cristiana per numero di malati di aids vede la parte cristiana di molto prevalente ovvero non c paragone hai scritto
2107404 il cattolicesimo in burundi ce sempre allora quando diminuiva era merito del cattolicesimo ora che cresce e merito dell cattolicesimo uguale o forse non centra niente
2107405 se poi leggi la questione dellamerica latina ti accorgi che linfezione come allo stadio iniziale negli anni 80 in alcuni paesi cito la modalit prevalente del contagio stata finora quella dei rapporti omosessuali fra maschi ma negli ultimi tempi il fatto che il maggior numero dei nuovi casi di infezione riguardi giovani donne fa ritenere che il virus abbia ormai valicato il confine dei gruppi a rischio
2107406 anche qui lepidemia prossima ad assumere carattere generalizzato in verit gi raggiunto nellarea caraibica con un tasso di prevalenza dellhiv aids del 2 3 fra gli adulti il pi alto al mondo dopo lafrica la modalit prevalente del contagio stata finora quella dei rapporti omosessuali fra maschi ma negli ultimi tempi il fatto che il maggior numero dei nuovi casi di infezione riguardi giovani donne fa ritenere che il virus abbia ormai valicato il confine dei gruppi a rischio
2107407 in verit gi raggiunto nellarea caraibica con un tasso di prevalenza dellhiv aids del 2 3 fra gli adulti il pi alto al mondo dopo lafrica
2107408 la modalit prevalente del contagio stata finora quella dei rapporti omosessuali fra maschi ma negli ultimi tempi il fatto che il maggior numero dei nuovi casi di infezione riguardi giovani donne fa ritenere che il virus abbia ormai valicato il confine dei gruppi a rischio
2107409 ostilit del vaticano nei confronti dei preservativi che quotidianamente crea sempre pi orfani dellaids
2107410 lostracismo del vaticano sui preservativi costato molte centinaia di migliaia di vite a causa dellaids
2107411 la chiesa cattolica favorisce la diffusione dellaids nel mondo dice roseli tardelli una redattrice cattolica della aids news agency in brasile sbagliato ha aggiunto a dio questo non piace
2107412 da questo punto di vista i musulmani sono stati pi bravi dei cristiani
2107413 ma negli ultimi tempi il fatto che il maggior numero dei nuovi casi di infezione riguardi giovani donne fa ritenere che il virus abbia ormai valicato il confine dei gruppi a rischio
2107414 mi sembra che tu non possa estrapolare una frase dalla bibbia cos comunque quella frase dio lha detta ad adamo ed eva sposati da dio una frase detta allinterno di un matrimonio
2107415 o pratichi leutanasia su una persona per me non sei cristiano visto che un comandamento dice
2107416 quindi per me i protestanti non fanno parte del pensiero cristiano
2107417 il movimento protestante ha avuto una nascita di ribellione verso una chiesa estremamente corrotta ma ora sta degenerando profondamente
2107418 nel 1935 il razzismo nazista derivante dalle idee darwiniane erano molto moderne molti le condividevano come scienziati dellepoca non sempre moderno vuol dire migliore o giusto
2107419 invece con la chiesa luomo ha una guida tutti si sentono pi responsabili difficilmente si potranno fare guerre uccisioni furti e vari surprusi
2107420 come il padre ha amato me cos anchio ho amato voi rimanete nel mio amore se osserverete i miei comandamenti rimarrete nel mio amore come io ho osservato i comandamenti del padre mio e rimango nel suo amore questo vi ho detto perch la mia gioia sia in voi e la vostra gioia sia piena questo il mio comandamento che vi amiate gli uni gli altri come io vi ho amati nessuno ha un amore pi grande di questo dare la vita per i propri amici voi siete miei amici se farete ci che io vi comando non vi chiamo pi servi perch il servo non sa quello che fa il suo padrone ma vi ho chiamati amici perch tutto ci che ho udito dal padre lho fatto conoscere a voi non voi avete scelto me ma io ho scelto voi e vi ho costituiti perch andiate e portiate frutto e il vostro frutto rimanga perch tutto quello che chiederete al padre nel mio nome ve lo conceda questo vi comando amatevi gli uni gli altri
2107421 dio si presenta come lo sposo del popolo suo che sempre donna
2107422 invita i giudici a non applicare leggi volute dalla stragrande maggioranza dei cittadini italiani
2107423 questo il mio comandamento che vi amiate gli uni gli altri come io vi ho amati
2107424 il fatto che il matrimonio venga negato a chi ha incapacit copulativa perpetua indica limportanza dellatto coniugale sessuale per
2107425 poi quanto destina alla carita carit ahi ahi ahi non so
2107426 il suo suicidio stato concepito e realizzato con lobiettivo di promuovere una legge sulleutanasia
2107427 il cristiano non deve essere ne compatibile col 208 ne con il 2008 deve essere
2107428 il ragazzo rimane vittima di un incidente automobilistico le cui conseguenze sono la paralisi della parte del corpo dalla vita ai piedi di conseguenza di eugenistico non c niente visto che la paralisi non si trasmette ai figli
2107429 la bibbia pu anche essere stata scritta per ispirazione divina ma la mano alla fine sempre quella imperfetta dell uomo che mai pu essere avulso dal contesto storico in cui vive
2107430 1 spiegami come fai a riconoscere la parte giusta della bibbia da quella sbagliata visto che il pensiero degli uomini in continua trasformazione
2107431 la chiesa cattolica oltre a sparire per te in africa che dovrebbe fare
2107432 preservativo il cui uso dipende dal maschio che psicologicamente meno motivato della donna alla prevenzione della gravidanza per il semplice fatto che le conseguenze della stessa non ricadono direttamente sulla sua persona
2107433 il vaticano ha orribilmente tagliato la guerra allaids in due modi primo ha cercato di impedire che gli ospedali cattolici le missioni e le chiese distribuissero i preservativi o ne incoraggiassero luso secondo diffonde la voce che i preservativi non proteggono dallo hiv scoraggiandone in tal modo ladozione
2107434 il vangelo per leggerlo con il cervello la ritengo una cosa sbagliata in parte o meglio non si pu leggere con razionalit visto che leggiamo di una persona che tornata dalla morte che qualcosa di assurdo altri direbbero ridicolo
2107435 ma dellanima non c una prova scientifica che ne dia testimonianza figuriamoci la nascita dellanima
2107436 io so quando inizia la vita biologica di un nuovo essere cio col concepimento
2107437 scritto da e laborto come lo giudichi agosto 02 2008
2107438 i dieci comandamenti vanno seguiti ma usando sempre quella cosa di cui dio chiss poi perch guardacaso ci ha dotati cio lintelligenza vanno inoltre integrati con tutti gli altri messaggi del cristianesimo
2107439 ma dellanima non c una prova scientifica che ne dia testimonianza figuriamoci la nascita dellanima
2107440 e ritengo comunque che concezioni puramente religiose non possono essere imposte in uno stato laico soprattutto quando vanno contro verit scientifiche assodate
2107441 io so quando inizia la vita biologica di un nuovo essere cio col concepimento
2107442 al fine della tua vita che sper che sia lunga avrai la verit e li saprai cosa hai fatto veramente e se ti fossi sbagliato io se fossi in te un pericolo cos grande non me lo prenderei
2107443 quindi ad esempio lo spermatozoo non una nuova forma di vit ma equivale a una cellula del sistema immunitario
2107444 io ritengo che il pensiero greco giudeo cristiano e forse anche il buddhismo abbiano delle verit che dovrebbero essere capite e che non sono cos in contrasto con una sana civilt moderna tutte alla fine parlano di amore verso il prossimo e di rispetto
2107445 mentre ad esempio linduismo parla di caste che qualcosa oggi di impensabile
2107446 ti dir una cosa anche luomo adulto fatto di materiale cellulare
2107447 linquisizione un pensiero opposto al cristianesimo dove si vieta sia il comandamento
2107448 io credo che per un cristiano il discorso sulleutanasia si risolva dicendo che la vita appartiene a dio e quindi leutanasia non pu essere applicata da un credente per quanto riguarda il dolore quello si pu combattere con cure palliative
2107449 certo razionalit bisogna avercela per leggere quei testi per non si deve pi di tanto stravolgere il significato
2107450 cmq la comparsa sulla terra e oltre di un nuovo dna il simbolo di una o pi nuova vita
2107451 e perch abbiamo un cos senso spiccato di attrazione x la figa
2107452 un nuovo essere biologico ha un corrispondente nuovo dna o nel caso dei gemelli 2 esseri un dna
2107453 parliamo di qualcos altro per carit stare qui a spendere fiumi e fiumi di inchiostro digitale su dna gameti embrioni e compagnia bella di una tristezza e di una aridit argomentativa pazzesca
2107454 scritto da enna agosto 04 2008 dite ci che volete per me un uomo esiste quando nato prima solo unaspettativa una possibilit di nascita ed ha diritto di nascere solo le la madre lo vuole poich lei che lo deve accudire allevare educare non si dica lo puo lasciare in ospdele perch venga adottato non semplice convivere con lidea di un figlio che c e non si sa dove sia andato a finire
2107455 al fine della tua vita che sper che sia lunga avrai la verit e li saprai cosa hai fatto veramente e se ti fossi sbagliato io se fossi in te un pericolo cos grande non me lo prenderei
2107456 la conseguenza di un aborto mancato un figlio in pi qui non c il male
2107457 la conseguenza di un aborto mancato una vita di una ragazza che cambia con maggiro resposabilit maggior spese e rinuncia ad alcuni sogni
2107458 comunque io non ho detto che andrai allinferno perch non ti ho giudicato ne bene ne male
2107459 la conseguenza di un aborto mancato un figlio in pi qui non c il male
2107460 b c forse stata massacrata di botte a morte perch non voleva abortire il bambino
2107461 poi avere sogni non per forza un peccato e perch un bambino cresca in condizioni umane bisogna che una madre sia adulta quindi responsabile e che la famiglia possa dargli tutto ci di cui ha bisogno
2107462 guerre napoleoniche per portare idee di libert con la spada e di fratellanza con un dittatore
2107463 posso capire i primi mesi o il primo anno ma come fai a crescere tuo figlio senza innamorartene
2107464 quindi secondo questo ragionamento i poveri non hanno diritto hai figli o forse se una persona povera un ente umanitario dovrebbe occuparsi di questo problema
2107465 bh se non lo vuole ci sono tante coppie che lo accetterebber
2107466 cmq si basta parlare di argomenti futili come religione scienza e filosofia parliamo di problemi importanti per ricordiamoci che mentre noi parliamo della gente che muore di fame c gente che muore di fame davvero
2107467 la fede in dio una cosa privata che normalmente dovrebbe servire a darsi delle risposte quando la logica e la ragione sembrano essere insufficienti
2107468 la religione va oltre e pretende di dare non solo delle risposte il che sarebbe legittimo ma anche delle regole di comportamento che poi diventano leggi e obblighi
2107469 non combatteresti fino allultimo anche andando a interferire nella politica
2107470 tanto per cominciare sei cos sicuro che la chiesa si limiti a rappresentare dei valori e che invece non li abbia creati lei stessa e poi i credenti ci si sono riconosciuti
2107471 per esigenze di culto della popolazione sostentamento del clero interventi caritativi a favore della collettivit nazionale o di paesi del terzo mondo
2107472 i malati gravi che sarebbero pi vittime della famiglia che della malattia ovvero le loro famiglie se li vorrebbero togliere dai piedi per non avere il problema guarda che un pensiero del genere molto poco caritatevole e poi prova ad accettare che un non credente non riesca a considerare un dono di dio la sofferenza
2107473 non combatteresti fino allultimo anche andando a interferire nella politica
2107474 non lo dico io lo dice lorganizzazione mondiale della sanit e vari organismi umanitari perch ti da fastidio sapere che i libici trombano il mio consiglio come tutti i consigli vale per chi lo vuole ascoltare quindi se pensi che siano balle e che il sida non esista nei paesi arabi come dicono le statistiche ufficiali non usare il preservativo semplice no per chi vuole ascoltare invece sappia che in tunisia la polizia vieta alle ragazze di salire sulle macchine dei libici ciao e non te la prendere fratello
2107475 dovreste uscire dallipocrisia di vietare tutto e poi farvi gli affari vostri
2107476 beninteso probabilmente tu vivi da buon cristiano ma io mi domando tutti i clienti delle prostitute sono atei e i bravi italiani che fanno turismo sessuale un po ovunque nel mondo tutti atei e i divorzi li fanno solo gli atei
2107477 guarda che se i cattolici i mussulmani e compagnia bella cominciano a espellere chi non rispetta lo statuto dellassociazione restate pochini davvero
2107478 ma poi il mondo reale li fuori sempre uguale e sempre abitato da esseri umani che non potendo rispettare le regole che loro stessi si sono imposti trovano pi facile farle rispettare agli altri
2107479 vivo e lavoro in un paese mussulmano e ti assicuro che qui ritrovo tutte le ipocrisie dei cattolici anche qui dio o meglio la religione serve a coprire con il suo conformismo le magagne di una societ che non ha pi nulla di spirituale e anche qui le regole sono per i gonzi mentre chi ha i soldi pur essendo molto credente fa quello che gli pare alcool sesso corruzione ecc e anche qui landare in moschea come da noi landare in chiesa una forma di conformismo sociale obbligatorio
2107480 laggravante che qui non puoi nemmeno dirti ateo ufficialmente e la libert di parola lasciamo perdere
2107481 democratic party leaders were pondering thursday what role to give hillary rodham clinton at the partys convention later this month and whether to allow her name to be placed in nomination alongside barack obamas
2107482 i didnt say that i said that theyre working it out
2107483 there was a dozen ideas proffered about how to trigger a war the one that interested me the most was why dont we build we in our shipyard build four or five boats that look like iranian pt boats put navy seals on them with a lot of arms and next time one of our boats goes to the straits of hormuz start a shoot up might cost some lives and it was rejected because you cant have americans killing americans thats the kind of thats the level of stuff were talking about provocation but that was rejected
2107484 proposed within the united states government in 1962 the plan called for cia or other operatives to kill innocent people and commit acts of terrorism in u s cities to create public support for a war against castro led cuba
2107485 operation northwoods was drafted by the joint chiefs of staff and signed by then chairman lyman lemnitzer and sent to the secretary of defense
2107486 it included plans for hijackings and bombings followed by the use of phony evidence that would blame the terrorist acts on foreign governments
2107487 12 and i saw the dead small and great standing before god and books were opened and another book was opened which is the book of life and the dead were judged according to their works by the things which were written in the books 13 the sea gave up the dead who were in it and death and hades delivered up the dead who were in them and they were judged each one according to his works 14 then death and hades were cast into the lake of fire this is the second death 15 and anyone not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire
2107488 18 for i testify to everyone who hears the words of the prophecy of this book if anyone adds to these things god will add to him the plagues that are written in this book 19 and if anyone takes away from the words of the book of this prophecy god shall take away his part from the book of life from the holy city and from the things which are written in this book
2107489 it is done i am the alpha and the omega the beginning and the end i will give of the fountain of the water of life freely to him who thirsts 7 he who overcomes shall inherit all things and i will be his god and he shall be my son 8 but the cowardly unbelieving abominable murderers sexually immoral sorcerers idolaters and all liars shall have their part in the lake which burns with fire and brimstone which is the second death
2107490 does this blessedness then come upon the circumcised only or upon the uncircumcised also for we say that faith was accounted to abraham for righteousness
2107491 as faith without works is void so is faith without righteousness void

2107500 i cannot stand the buckeyes and having to live in ohio and hear those people talk about their team it drives me absolutely nuts its amazing to hear what those guys think about that university and what they think about that football program and ohio state coach jim tressel and all the crap i gotta put up with being back there i just cant wait for two years from now when sc comes to the shoe and i get to hopefully hopefully well have a home game that weekend and i can go up there and watch us pound on them in their own turf and kind of put all the talk to rest because im really getting sick of it and i just cant wait for this game to get here so they can come out to the coliseum and experience la and get an old fashioned pac 10 butt whoopin and go back to the big ten i cant wait

2107503 a lot of bands and artists feel that its hard to get any interest from record labels due to the state most labels are in they all seem to be playing it very safe
2107504 a lot of people think its impossible to have a successful music career without a label but theres a lot of talented bands and artists out there who just havent been lucky enough to get the breaks
2107505 we always believed that it is for the public to decide so often the labels get it wrong

2107763 joel is using his campaign to try and raise awareness about the fact that there are many politicos in the major parties who have lost sight of the national interest in the fog of partisanship
2107764 we support his efforts to try and bring the conversation back to the reasonable middle and encourage all people of goodwill to support his candidacy
2107765 the law says that if he wants to appear on the ballot as the candidate for the independent party of oregon he would have to resign the republican nomination by august 26

2107771 feedback from farmers who have used the once a day milking tool for the first 28 days from the start of proper calving is that cows did not lose condition at the rate that would normally result from twice a day milking
2107772 it enabled cows to recover from the stress of calving not draw as much energy and subsequently body fat reserves to enable them to recover from their negative energy balance quicker and go forward to mating with better body condition score
2107773 this subsequently improved conception rates particularly in the first three weeks of mating
2107774 once a day milking farmers also said they didnt need to feed as much and therefore saved on average 0 5kg to 1kg of dry matter a cow a day for those first 28 days

2107791 sound feet are firmly placed on the surface with legs almost perpendicular there is minimal rotation of the hooves if she is trying to shift weight on her feet it indicates soreness
2107792 the pieces of the lameness puzzle are cow comfort stall size and floor surface
2107793 if you have an older tie stall barn you have to take a close look at the comfort issue because cows are bigger today
2107794 the reason we have claw disease in october november is because of heat stress in the summer and changes in the ration during the summer

2107835 wellbeing programmes can reduce absenteeism and prevent illness caused by stressful work environments which increase the chance of a person developing depression or anxiety
2107836 the acc like many employers the foundation works with have realised that healthcare schemes which only focus on illness are counter productive when a broader approach that focuses on health promotion will produce better results
2107837 they should be congratulated for making the wellbeing of their employees a top priority
2107838 it helps attract and retain high quality staff especially in a tight labour market
2107839 in the case of acc staff the overwhelming majority have used their cards to buys sports equipment pay for gym memberships and so on
2107840 the 250 contribution acc makes to staff activa cards is a small sum in every sense it equates to 0 005 percent of the total salary bill or 68 cents per day per person
2107841 and in return for this investment we get improved employee productivity less sick leave and improved staff retention

2107910 we were told that staff made site visits and looked at various facilities and we were assured that it actually took place to the point of staff letting us know that they didnt make any errors and they know what theyre talking about and just take their word for it
2107911 how is it then that just two months later we have such gross repairs and ironies on the report of the facility that staff missed apparently during their initial inspections
2107912 was told that on july 2 when the city inspectors went out that the properties did meet their general standards and they were fine i understand later that the building and safety department did go out again and maybe some additional things were found that conversation i was not privy to
2107913 it was after the fact and it was not prior to us approving the allocations initially
2107914 councilman it is an after the fact situation the only thing i can assure you is that this will be thoroughly looked at and we will make sure that the provisions for next year are that we take care of it before it gets to you
2107915 an inspection found that they didnt meet several of our municipal codes illegal garage conversions and other various things
2107916 in the daily breeze we found out that this organization had a house in carson and they had some issues there which caused city councilwoman yvonne arceneaux to contact the city manager and found out that we cant give money to somebody thats in violation of our municipal code
2107917 when were dealing again with grant monies and things like that we now have to have documentation before to help us make decisions one way or the other our decision in that room four or five months ago was based upon the verbal advise of our staff you dubose included saying that we did our diligence with this organization and based on your word are asking us to appropriate funding to these organizations and we did that based on your word
2107918 and then we get an article in the daily breeze that makes us go out and repeat on an inspection only to find out that there were gross negligent items there

2107993 la anterior consejera y yo nos encontramos sobre la mesa con unas peticiones de licencia comercial espec fica de descuento duro de la empresa lidl en toda canarias todas esas licencias fueron denegadas con informes preceptivos de la direcci n general de comercio basandonos sobre todo en un estudio de creaci n y destrucci n de puestos de trabajo
2107994 cu les eran los puestos de trabajo existentes en el entorno en aquel entonces
2107995 el presente proyecto de adaptaci n de actividad tiene como objeto describir las adaptaciones de la actividad que va a desarrollar lidl supermercado con el fin de ajustarse a los criterios que rigen en la legislaci n canaria 10 2003 reguladora de la licencia comercial espec fica y las normas de desarrollo para ser considerado como un supermercado
2107996 se le informa que como supermercado no tienen que pedir la licencia comercial espec fica
2107997 descuento duro es competencia del ayuntamiento de la laguna otorgar las licencias de obra y de apertura
2107998 la direcci n general de comercio no pone en duda que lidl se vaya a instalar como empresa de descuento duro porque no puede hacerlo
2107999 in acest moment pe piata exista foarte multi cumparatori cei mai multi dintre ei au deja creditele aprobate de catre banci insa nu cumpara sperand intr un miracol un pret mai mic peste o saptamana sau peste o luna deci cumparatori exista cerere exista
2108000 daca ne uitam cu atentie observam urmatorul lucru in trecut am avut foarte multe apartamente si case pe care proprietarii nu vroiau sa le vanda dar totusi apareau la vanzare la niste preturi astronomice ca poate poate gasesc pe cineva care sa plateasca o caruta de bani toata lumea stie totul e de vanzare conteaza doar cat oferi
2108001 daca in mod normal in bucuresti se vand 2 000 de apartamente pe luna iar in sase luni se vand doar 1 000 de apartamente lunar in luna a saptea ar putea aparea din nou cererea normala de 2000 de apartamente iar in conditiile in care oferta va fi mult mai mica decat de obicei in aceste conditii daca ati fi vanzatori nu ati mari pretul eu cred ca da si atunci vom vedea cine isi va mai permite sa cumpere si cine nu

2108004 i am exercising my executive authority to avoid a full blown crisis and keep our state moving forward
2108005 this is not an action i take lightly but we do not have a budget and as governor i have a responsibility to make sure our state has enough money to pay its bills
2108006 understands how difficult its going to be theres no easy decisions with the state facing a 15 billion budget deficit and having no budget
2108007 the federal minimum wage part goes away and everybody goes back to what they were making
2108008 since when do we start punishing state workers for something that is not their responsibility
2108009 the governor should be threatening members of his own party who continue to obstruct the process of passing a budget
2108010 it would take just two republicans in the senate and six in the assembly to agree on a compromise but they wont budge
2108011 this is not a time to play games with public employees pocket books
2108012 these families are already struggling to provide for their families while grocery bills and rising fuel prices hijack their wallets real leadership from the governor would be to engage in budget negotiations not penalize public servants who arent to blame for the budget impasse
2108013 we find it very frustrating knowing others families in identical situations have had their bilateral operations
2108014 ellie has undergone nine months of assessments and the clinicians at the cochlear implant centre in southampton support bilateral implants for her
2108015 i believe the pct only considered the extra cost of a second implant not how much less her education will cost if she has both ears operated on now
2108016 we believe that morally ellie should have the operation on the nhs
2108017 looking after ellie is a joy and a pleasure but battling to get what she needs has been the worst part of the last nine months
2108018 as a doctor i did not realise the problems for parents of children with special needs this is a classic case of postcode lottery care
2108019 the second implant should really happen for ellie as it will make a massive difference to her and her family
2108020 the current recommendations from nice support unilateral implants for children and adults with severe to profound deafness however under these guidelines bilateral cochlear implantation is restricted to certain conditions including children and adults who are blind
2108021 we will study the updated nice guidance when it comes out next month and will review our current position as new evidence becomes available

2108030 i was nervous being on stage with a couple more dancers in front of a judge but i got used to it
2108031 you need balance you need discipline and technique you have to be graceful in some dances then you also have to be sharp in other dances
2108032 you have to piece those two together kind of mesh them together to come up with a dance

2108035 lacey exemplifies the true spirit of highland dancing her determination to improve and her will to succeed set her apart from other dancers on prince edward island while her passion for dance serves to inspire a whole new generation to celebrate their scottish heritage with enthusiasm
2108036 as a dedicated instructor and role model for younger students lacey has a tremendous impact on the day to day life of the college of piping
2108037 based on her progress thus far i have no doubt that laceys dancing will continue to mature and that she will be highly encouraged by her results in scotland
2108038 getting the message to sportsmen that they have an ally in washington where decisions are made on many issues from access to public lands to funding for conservation programs has never been more important

2108098 you talk about pruning the twigs as if they dont come from deep roots

2108100 plant the seeds of love do not rip out the plants with hate
2108101 you talk about pruning the twigs as if they dont come from deep roots

2108103 i never think that people die they just go to department stores
2108104 what i know is is that if you do work that you love and the work fulfills you the rest will come
2108105 i tried the upper section on a shunt and realised that with the right mental attitude it would go due to the overhanging nature of the bottom section i couldnt reach the holds from the rope so had to try them ground up with the help of bouldering mats the start of the route is brilliant around v9 and on slopers heelhooks and crimps the next section is about v6 a powerful rockover from a fragile crimp to a sloper hang this scary nearly lost it here tricky match on a crimp and then a blind grope round the ar te to a good rugosity and a long move to lovely flutings
2108106 not sure about the grade highball v9 maybe definitely hard e8 for a matless ascent or soft e8 with mats whatever grade its a superb route with superb moves and i had lots of fun trying it
2108107 the amazing geology of the crag is apparent upon arrival the large overhanging upper section is the cross section of an ancient river bed the buttress is in two contrasting sections the lower hard yellow sandstone the jutting upper bunter pebble bed awesome there is no bouldering here at present but a keen eye and big brush might reveal some good problems and there are certainly some interesting looking craglets scattered in the vicinity the best routes are inas chimney s inaccessible e5 6a atlas e2 5c and ground support e1 5b with a couple of highball ish e5s right again on good sandstone inaccessible must rank amongst one of the best e5s in the county and undoubtedly the best on this obscure rock type anywhere the climbing is superb throughout a real experience and a must do tick for anyone capable of this grade
2108108 it was last summer that i started to visit ben nevis again with an eye for new routes in between trying
2108109 this thing is just not the same as something like rhapsody the climbing on that was quite tricky at the time it was my limit but it was right there easy to sling a rope down in a few minutes and get climbing on it with nothing in the way ive done the hard mountain routes like birketts and dunnes too but they were relative to this easy climbing you just turn up put in a day or twos work and crush it this is different the mix of 8c or harder climbing the prospect of a ground fall on the lead and the logistical challenge of climbing this so high on the north face of the ben that is why it will be another level beyond any of the other routes that is what i am after on the whole
2108110 on monday night july 28th i led my echo wall project i was for me a perfect climbing day folk always ask me how doing a degree in sport science helped me do hard routes expecting to hear about little details about physical training practice but the biggest thing i learned was about how disparate the ingredients of a good performance are and how big an effect it has on the rare occasions when they come together at just the right moment monday was one of those days for me the air was so crisp but it was hot kev checked out a big groove i belayed time passed i was waiting for the katabatic winds of the late evening rolling off the plateau and snowfields just above the route at 8pm the chill wind gently got going i waited and waited until the temperature and rock friction was perfect and at 9pm exactly all this preparation over months crystallised and i led the route in a dream state of confident execution it felt easy as every hard route ive ever done has the great paradox
2108111 we have a responsibility to ensure the water source of the river flowing from everest to the sea is clean our target is to keep even more people from abusing mount everest
2108112 the highway will become the major route for tourists and mountaineers who are crowding onto mount qomolangma in ever larger numbers
2108113 the permanent metalled road on mount qomolangma is an attempt to underscore beijings tenuous claims to sovereignty over tibet to achieve this aim china will sadly scar irreparably one of the worlds most beautiful landscapes as well as tarnishing a mountain sacred not only to tibetans but to many people living in the himalayan region
2108114 the chinese say theyre welcoming climbers this autumn for example to the popular 8000m peak cho oyu but state you can have no more than two nationalities on a permit you cant therefore have mixed nationality teams nepalese sherpas theyre saying they may not grant individuals visas anyway and are talking about a week long visa process in kathmandu a lot of the commercial expedition organisers are now climbing manaslu in nepal the worlds 8th highest mountain instead of cho oyu because theyre tired of being messed about by the chinese the chinese seem to be doing everything to keep people out of tibet without actually banning entry sources inside tibet are talking about a big crackdown on tibetans after the games this recent press release about a clean up operation on the north side of everest is clearly propaganda there have been a number of clean up expeditions on the nepalese side of the everest why would you need to close the mountain its obviously a whitewash but sadly some naive media sources in the outdoor world seem to have fallen for it
2108115 up there it was hell during the descent beyond 8000 meters due to the altitude and the exhaustion i even fell asleep in the snow and when i woke up i could not figure out where i was
2108116 everything was going well to camp 4 and on summit attempt everything went wrong
2108117 we were astonished we had to move the fixed lines that took of course many many hours some turned back because they did not trust the lines anymore
2108118 but we cannot descend the same way we came up it was dangerous
2108119 there were still nine climbers above these ropes which meant they had to spend the whole night out in the open
2108120 the next morning they were still there not moving and people during the night had been hit by the avalanche one had died one had fallen at an earlier stage
2108121 three south koreans two nepali one dutch one serb one norwegian and one pakistani have been killed
2108122 it is the worst tragedy on k2 since 1986 when 12 climbers were killed due to exposure
2108123 at least seven climbers are feared dead in an avalanche after scaling the worlds second highest mountain k2 expedition organisers have said there are fears more climbers could have died in the accident in northern pakistan or still be trapped but others did reach safety a chunk from an ice pillar snapped away on friday and broke ropes on a feature called the bottleneck reports said there are reports some mountaineers may be stuck above the bottleneck unable to descend as the fixed ropes are broken
2108124 those are called condoms son men use them to have safe sex

2108179 while we accept the judges view that mr galloway is not antisemitic it is somewhat ironic that in his determination to prove it he has effectively shut down londons only jewish radio station
2108180 we were pleased that mr justice eady recognised the feature was clearly intended as a spoof understood the relatively small scale of the audience and gave us significant credit for the apology we made on our website
2108181 im pleased that this judgment has categorically crushed the slur of antisemitism
2108182 the station initially brushed aside my complaint about the broadcast then refused to agree a form of words by way of apology then published on its website a form of words that i found unacceptable leaving little option but legal action
2108183 im afraid jcom have themselves to blame for any difficulty they are now in the jewish community would doubtless benefit from a serious and professionally run community radio station jcom has fallen well short of that its audience deserves better
2108184 i felt that through their broadcast jcom were demeaning the good name of jewish broadcasting when they slandered george galloway i wrote a letter to ofcom complaining about their programme
2108185 i have no idea how mr galloways solicitors obtained a copy of this letter to use in evidence and it certainly was not my intention for him to use it in any action he could bring against jcom

2108193 os jogadores correspondem a tudo o que lhes pedido e mostram tranquilidade quando as coisas n o correm de acordo com o planeado mesmo antes da partida da primeira m o referi que n o seria nada de extraordin rio se venc ssemos o anderlecht temos muita experi ncia jogadores suficientemente bons e n o queremos ver as nossas capacidades colocadas em causa o resultado alcan ado na b lgica n o foi uma surpresa para n s
2108194 o anderlecht jogou bem e criou nos muitos problemas particularmente na segunda parte quando j n o tinha nada a perder mas creio que nos subestimaram desde o apito inicial do primeiro jogo consideram uma cat strofe perder frente a uma forma o da bielorr ssia nesta partida da segunda m o j estavam mais motivados mas n s fomos mais fortes agora contra o levski vai ser tudo muito equilibrado
2108195 n o um choque uma completa cat strofe h sete anos que jogo no anderlecht e n o me lembro de alguma vez termos sido eliminados t o cedo mas o que podemos fazer agora o nosso advers rio foi mais forte temos de assumir as culpas talvez tenha sido pelo facto de a temporada na b lgica ainda n o ter come ado mas o bate praticou um bom futebol nos dois jogos
2108196 complic mos a vida a n s mesmos entreg mos o jogo em casa e fora acab mos por fazer o mesmo com os dois cart es vermelhos se espero a sa da de alguns jogadores quando somos eliminados temos tamb m de pensar no panorama financeiro temos de perceber de que forma podemos limitar as perdas financeiras talvez atrav s de transfer ncias de jogadores

2108204 it was there i found out they were considering me for a committee
2108205 to this day im still not quite understanding why they werent allowed to vote early
2108206 im not worried about obama hes got plenty of delegates and its not like hes going to lose it
2108207 but i feel like this is going through the motions and im just here to put a democrat in office
2108208 the ordinary voter is going to say ok do i want someone breaking into my car or stealing my car or stealing my identity no i dont and i want government to put these predators behind bars and pull them off the streets
2108209 when fda limited the warning about jalape os to exclude domestic growers new mexico jalape o farmers may have avoided a potentially major crisis
2108210 the tomato and spinach industries saw long lasting effects from the warnings that affected them we hope we dont see the same with the jalape o industry
2108211 first they went after tomatoes and hurt the tomato industry really bad then to start doing the same thing with peppers to go at it without knowing for sure i mean my family eats this food too so i understand theyre just trying to protect us
2108212 if you look at the epidemic curve the number of cases each day during the a drop off in cases after the announcement was made so can we prove that because we announced tomatoes it was tomatoes no we cant prove that did we make a mistake by announcing it no i would say we did not as public health officials we are obligated when we have a strong concern to get the word out
2108213 the problem with produce warnings is that all growers were impacted regardless of the quality of their product and their location
2108214 the warnings cast a shadow on all products involved regardless of the source or the likelihood that they are not the source of the problem
2108215 when you interview somebody a month after theyve eaten a meal many people dont remember exactly what they ate
2108216 the other issue is if you say did you have a hot pepper or a tomato thats ok but some people may not understand the differences between roma tomatoes and round tomatoes or jalape os and serranos
2108217 i had some people call me from phoenix and say they saw on the news a picture of raw jalape os next to canned jalape os
2108218 when you have things like that on tv the public gets confused and were concerned about public perception

2108308 there are more things in heaven and earth horatio than are dreamt of in your philosophy
2108309 when you walk to the edge of all the light you have and take that first step into the darkness of the unknown you must believe one of two things will happen there will be something solid for you to stand upon or you will be taught how to fly

2108314 in dharamsala the heart of tibetan freedom movement in exile all protestors are wearing black head bands and some are dressed up entirely in black clothes to show their solidarity to tibetans inside tibet
2108315 four ngos the tibetan womens association the guchusum ex political prisoners movement of tibet the national democratic party of tibet and students for a free tibet india are organising the protest
2108316 working actively to restore the rights of the tibetan people under international law to determine their own political economic social religious and cultural status
2108317 the situation in tibet is getting worse repression is not abating the religious re education campaign is gaining steam talks between china and a delegation representing the dalai lama are going no where
2108318 its so distressing to see that we are unable to change anything for this reason there are extreme actions like the hunger strike this is why they hunger strikers resisted the police officers who took them to hospital why they shouted that they wanted their freedom
2108319 our protest is not against the chinese population but against their leaders now that china is becoming a world power we are hoping that it will see human rights and religious freedom as indispensable to being a great power
2108320 tomorrow during the inauguration ceremony world leaders should tell china to be a responsible power and insist on solving issues like the tibetan question
2108321 this is a moment of great pride for the 1 3 billion chinese people these games should contribute to promoting the olympic spirit of friendship openness and peace

2108335 take part in our opening ceremony of the olympic games
2108336 the olympic games in beijing are a unique opportunity to focus the worlds attention on the annulment of those rights in tibet and in many other places in the world
2108337 leave it to dustin the cynic but then again i guess he does have a valid point
2108338 there is very little information coming out of tibet but the information we have paints a dire picture of arbitrary detentions and abuse of detainees
2108339 with the torch relay about to enter tibetan areas this should be an opportunity to shine some light on the situation there
2108340 the complete lock down in tibet is allowing human rights abuses such as arbitrary detentions ill treatment and severe censorship to go unreported and unpunished
2108341 hundreds of people languish in chinese prisons for peacefully expressing their opinions in appalling conditions and without their relatives even knowing where they are the passing of the torch should allow journalists a chance to see the actual situation on the ground and promote the free and open olympics promised in the beijing olympic action plan

2108520 id just gotten out of high school and id already started working for an air conditioning and coal company but when carl played i used to walk up to claytons bass and keep time on it carl asked me to come to memphis with them it was the second time i played drums in my life when we got the contract i bought my own drum set a gretsch i still have it today
2108521 we were just like a band today playing the clubs and the record contract was just a thing that happened elvis scotty and bill had come along in the middle of 54 then us by 55 sam had the rest of the sun group with roy orbison and johnny cash who i went on to work with for 40 years
2108522 we just pulled up and parked right there on the curb marion keisker was there and she said yall come and in unload your stuff mr phillips is down the street but hell be back in a minute we went in and played movie magg and when sam walked in he stopped and we introduced ourselves that day we got a recording contract
2108523 we were going to new york to appear on the perry como show and wed ordered a new cadillac from southern motors but it wasnt in yet so we had to borrow a car
2108524 i did most of the driving back then we were leaving from norfolk virginia where wed stopped for a show when stuart pinkham a friend said let me drive i was in the front seat on the outside and clayton was in the middle carl and j b were in the back the drums were in the trunk and the upright bass and all our other equipment was in the car i was leaning against the door asleep and when i woke up i was sitting in the middle of the highway the door had been torn off and the car had rolled the guy we ran into farmer thomas phillips was killed carls brother broke his neck somehow i didnt get a scratch my drum head wasnt even broke
2108525 it wasnt anything that anybody thought anything about there were no big stars back then everyone at sun got started together sam phillips was smart enough to leave all the guys alone and thats what made it happen
2108526 we came in unloaded and set up in this exact spot
2108527 everybody asked us why we always put on the same ending well it was the only one we knew
2108528 it sold a million records for 2 people but not us ricky nelson and jimmy page and robert plant
2108529 now carl his 2 brothers and me were here to record matchbox when all of a sudden in the middle of the session john jerry lee and elvis walked through the door

2108602 retail petrol price rises are not fast to rise and slow to fall
2108603 in new zealand there has been confusing volatility in the price of petrol so the government is going to increase monitoring in order to further improve the transparency of increases
2108604 new zealand is a small player at the end of a global supply chain and cannot influence the crude oil price
2108605 yes the fuel companies are making billions but thats not all from new zealand

2108622 frankly i got hooked on berts lectures which make some of the most challenging philosophy accessible to lay people
2108623 i get a lot of e mails from high school and college students
2108624 they have no hesitation about writing to a professor and asking a question they just send an e mail
2108625 i received an e mail from a devout christian lady who said i said calvary instead of cavalry
2108626 ive been in classes where the professor decided to webcast it and attendance drops there is also a class ive been to taught by a really great professor and even though the class is webcast students still show up its a packed house for every lecture
2108627 it makes me very happy that my thoughts have gone out into the world and make all these other people happy
2108628 but i lose about 25 percent of the students so i have a half empty lecture hall which i dont like one bit they are listening to me lying on the lawn running or doing the dishes
2108629 when you signed up for a paypal account you agreed to their terms which included not giving you over 500 before you registered a card with them yet you then complain when they try and hold you to it this is more another case of understanding what you are agreeing to before you sign or electronically sign whatever the case may be
2108630 they dont have an incentive to send you anything if you make it clear they wont get anything out of it

2108634 it was not a great surprise to get the invitation as i had previously had supper with mr phillips in jaffa but mr blunt pressed dr howells and the next thing i know i am persona non grata for british diplomats
2108635 i have talked dozens of times to other diplomats and i do not think my presence at an official event should be considered as recognising the settlements as not being illegal
2108636 it is childish behaviour they are giving in to a very left wing view it is quite upsetting
2108637 its a most unfortunate action by the mp mr blunt if the settlers were recommended by the ambassador then that should be good enough it is a case of an mp busy bodying himself
2108638 the governments view on settlements is clear all settlements are illegal under international law reports of recent settlement expansion are at odds with israels roadmap commitments and threaten negotiations on a two state solution

2108661 glengoyne has always been excellent at listening to and engaging with their customers they have demonstrated this again by really embracing the concept of user generated content allowing their customers to create and share their own tasting notes
2108662 ive always thought of glengoyne as an unsung hero of single malt whisky http www glengoyne com single malt whisky malt whisky range those who try it tend to fall in love with it and remain loyal and enthusiastic customers yet it has a relatively low online profile our aim is to greatly increase the visibility of the brand and grow awareness amongst those who enjoy single malt but havent had the pleasure of the real taste of malt
2108663 at glengoyne we are lucky to have strong support and good will from across the online world especially from bloggers and independent whisky websites i hope by making www glengoyne com more interactive interesting and visible on the web we will bring some more of their enthusiasm and passion for our whisky to our new site greenparka have done a fantastic job in understanding both the needs and desires of our customers i am delighted with the website and expect it to bring a new more intimate dimension to glengoyne for all visitors old and new

2108676 for the first time she thought seriously about clothes apart from warmth protection and propriety what was the idea of clothes exactly patently the idea was to express something through the medium of shape and colour but express what were clothes just saying look money and sex seemed to be the main commodities on offer here clothes could deny or afirm either of these mary speculated what her own clothes might have to say on the topics of money and sex could clothes express a lack of one and a simple bafflement about the other yes but that wasnt what clothes were in business to do that wasnt clothes line that wasnt what clothes were keen on expressing clothes were interested in other things in abundance and expertise obliquely and perhaps inadvertently clothes also did a third thing they told other people about the soul they encased by dramatiing your attempted lies about money and sex

2108681 companies that calculate and report on carbon emissions from outsourced products and services are to be commended for recognising the responsibility they have beyond their own operations however clarity on where emissions come from is also important
2108682 other industry sectors need to deal with this same issue for example some retailers go as far as also calculating their customers emissions understanding where carbon reductions can be made across the whole value chain should be the focus at this stage when we are in a position to worry about double counting we will know we have reached a sophisticated level of carbon accounting and management

2108778 we maintain our view of axp as the least worst of the group as the company does not have mortgage exposure has not lost money has not raised capital and we dont believe it needs to raise capital
2108779 axp credit and spend metrics appear to have been disproportionately hurt by declining home values geographic concentration and overall consumer stress

2108807 and is taking every step necessary to review and address the issues cited in the report dcaa is committed to supporting any review of its procedures and is prepared to take immediate action to fix any problems found

2108953 shes had to resit last year because of this but got through shes now faced with the prospect of her final two or three years taking these tests which she finds extremely difficult
2108954 this is not a question of a lack of intelligence or a lack of intellect
2108955 they have got to come up with a different way of testing her knowledge
2108956 we take our responsibility to students with dyslexia seriously and we can report that within the two cohorts to have graduated from the peninsula medical school so far nine have done so with dyslexia
2108957 our ultimate responsibility is to produce doctors of the highest quality who are fit for practice and any reasonable adjustments we have made for students with dyslexia reflect this objective
2108958 these can be discriminatory for dyslexic candidates where there are difficulties in the areas of reading and comprehension working memory and visual tracking such as finding the right box
2108959 dyslexics confuse the order of letters because their eye control is not ideal

2108966 around the globe senior executives are generally more engaged than front line managers or individual contributors gen y disengagement levels may reflect to some extent their low seniority since more baby boomers would predictably hold leadership roles increased engagement is an expected outcome from power and position
2108967 often they cant find what theyre looking for because they dont have the experience to know what they want lack of personal clarity can also influence engagement for gen y in particular
2108968 this probably reflects the expanded opportunities as well as its young fast paced knowledge based economy in fact all generations in india are happier than employees in other regions
2108969 engaged employees are not just committed or passionate or proud
2108970 theyre enthusiastic and in gear using their talents to make a difference in their employers quest for sustainable success as a rule increased engagement results in increased productivity and performance its a key business issue leaders need to address particularly in times of economic downturn and uncertainty
2108971 left to themselves disengaged workers are likely to look for their next job or worse collect a paycheck while complaining and not producing if they cant be coached or encouraged to higher levels of engagement their exit benefits everyone including themselves
2108972 there is a very low health threat associated with arsenic in soil levels within the greenway trail
2108973 the arsenic levels are below site specific recreational and residential exposure criteria as determined by environmental studies the majority of the constructed trail contains arsenic in soil within the range that occurs naturally in soil
2108974 in an abundance of caution the city is covering with gravel or mulch any soil that has higher than background level arsenic concentrations
2108975 we do advise that you do not eat or dig in the dirt along the greenway trail or any park both for health reasons and to avoid disturbing the appearance of the landscaping
2108976 i wouldnt jump into bbsi just yet as i expect the price to go into the single digits as the economy in california deteriorates further
2108977 monitoring collection trends very closely due to economic situation very little visibility in directional trends of our revenue stream numerous cross currents in customer base which are mitigating market share gains the current economic climate warrants a very careful outlook into 2008
2108978 things are bumping along the economys not that much better its not that bad we continue to still sign a lot of new customers which is very good and portends that should be stabilized and well exceptionally well i believe
2108979 i dont think we could have turned this quarter or given you the estimates if we didnt see stability in the market i havent seen any branches run off cliffs i havent seen any segment of our business just disappear overnight so that makes me relatively comfortable that were holding our own

2108986 habr teatro en venezuela cuando las cosas que se digan y pasen en un escenario venezolano tengan significaci n para el espectador aun cuando no est n vestidas del color inmediato de sus circunstancias
2108987 dir s que soy grotesco feo absurdo y tienes raz n soy tan contrahecho como t como tu vida y si aqu salgo a que te r as de m es porque yo ya desde mucho antes estoy relamiendo mi carcajada
2108988 al fondo hacia un lado un edificio seco de aristas duras y proporciones monumentales que quiere ser la figura geom trica de un rombo semihundido en la tierra al otro lado una terraza color de pav n cercada por una muralla baja dentada y spera como una hoja de sierra tras de la cual debe adivinarse el mar
2108989 hay una gran diferencia entre escribir literatura en forma dram tica y escribir para el teatro la mejor literatura y hasta la filosof a pueden estar en forma de di logo sin que por ello lleguen a ser teatro fed n es un prodigioso di logo y no es teatro como tampoco es teatro la combinaci n de mon logos po ticos alternos que hac an muchos de los simbolistas
2108990 mucho m s dilectos son los perfumes que las carnes mucho m s alto es sugerir que cantar de plano mucho m s espanta un gui o de acero en la tiniebla que un ca n a pleno sol
2108991 esa es la belleza que debemos adorar la est tica del sugerimiento esto ya lo hacen algunos pero todav a quedan tantos escritores y poetas matem ticos y con olor a miasmas y a subterr neo de templo egipcio que si hay una monta a no sea alta o encumbrada cima es preferible que sea una monta a que dialoga con el sol o con pretensiones de desvirgar a la pobre luna todo menos alta o encumbrada
2108992 flacos y desnudos tan flacos que casi se dir a que se presienten m s que se ven uno acuclillado en el suelo luce una cabellera flava con reflejos gneos como de tiz n semiapagado el segundo posee una dentadura monstruosa igual que un teclaje de piano apilonado hecha para rasgu ar la epidermis del habla el ltimo aparecer de pie y mostrando un solo brazo fetal que le pendular miserable e irrisorio en el hombro como una mucosidad
2108993 no he ensayado g neros distintos con un vano prop sito de enriquecer el registro personal sino en la b squeda inagotable de maneras de llegar m s cerca de lo buscado lo buscado es mi identidad mi explicaci n mi situaci n que afortunadamente no es la de mi sola persona
2108994 antero alb n no es un personaje tr gico porque no siente que ha perdido sino una oportunidad un lance frente a los poderes m gicos su d a ser otro la obra no tiene tesis no trato de demostrar algo ni de recomendar nada simplemente quisiera poder poner al espectador de un modo m s dram tico y sugestivo en presencia de una circunstancia que condiciona su vida de ser humano
2108995 la tebaida es un di logo de ejercicio no es una obra que se preste al juego esc nico ni que obedece a ciertas reglas elementales de construcci n dram tica plantea de un modo divagante y oscuro problemas que no llega a resolver pero as se me plantearon a m y no pod a sino al precio de un enga o dar una soluci n cualquiera a lo que segu a sin soluci n frente a m acaso sea m s para le da y debatida que para representada
2108996 no llev yo al teatro ningunas otras motivaciones o prop sitos que los mismos que est n en mi narrativa y en mis ensayos indagar conocer y expresar una condici n humana peculiar la del criollo ante su mundo a veces el tema no es propiamente local ni importa mucho que no lo sea como en el caso de el dios invisible pero es transparente que sus personajes se expresan desde una situaci n existencial que forma parte de nuestro problema de identidad
2108997 si sta fuera una obra simbolista podr a llamarse la par bola de la civilizaci n si fuera una obra costumbrista podr a llamarse simplemente las murmuraciones pero como carece por igual de prop sito simb lico deliberado y de complacencias costumbristas se llama simplemente ch o gil las tejedoras de esta farsa a imagen de nosotros mismos no hacen otra cosa que tejer el destino con sus palabras
2108998 el teatro es la otra manera de vivir del hombre la otra manera de ser y de realizarse de mirarse a s mismo y de plantearse continuamente su eterno conflicto esa es su inmensa validez y su irremplazable papel bastar a lanzar la m s superficial mirada al mundo de los griegos para darse cuenta de lo que el teatro eso que ellos llamaron teatro y que no tiene mucho que ver con lo que hoy llamamos por el mismo nombre representaba en sus vidas no era simplemente la posibilidad de una catarsis que purgara el esp ritu de sus impurezas y conflictos sino otra manera de seguir realiz ndose sin que apareciera una diferencia muy neta entre lo que pertenec a al teatro y lo que pertenec a a la vida los grandes momentos del teatro han sido precisamente aquellos en que ha parecido convertirse en vida verdadera y en experiencia real no hay que olvidar que el teatro que desapareci en occidente con el mundo antiguo vuelve a aparecer m gicamente como parte del culto religioso la misa misma no es sino una forma de drama lit rgico esto es lo que hace que el teatro sea intemporal y que podamos hoy seg n las circunstancias ver como cosa propia y actual el prometeo de esquilo o el hamlet de shakespeare o la vida es sue o de calder n hace muchos a os tuve la extraordinaria experiencia de ver convertirse en vida y actualidad en la comedia francesa una escenificaci n de la paz de arist fanes eran los d as en que los nubarrones presagiadores de la guerra mundial se acumulaban en el horizonte en que el fascismo levantaba su pu o enguantado de hierro y en que se viv a literalmente en una indefinida v spera de horror por uno de esos milagros que s lo el teatro produce las viejas palabras y la antigua escena se volvieron vida verdadera y lo que all dec an los actores lo estaba diciendo la conciencia de todos los que est bamos presentes en esa hora inolvidable es sta precisamente la grandeza nica del teatro y su incomparable don que ha logrado sobrevivir con toda su virtualidad a pesar de las deformaciones y envilecimientos que un mundo demasiado fr volo le ha impuesto en cada rinc n del mundo en cada momento en que un ser verdadero se enfrenta con la vida se podr a sentir que se alza el tel n

2109000 informacja ta by a o tyle istotna dla rynku i w a nie od niej zale a o czy pierwszy tydzie sierpnia zako czymy na mniejszych minusach
2109001 ich bin der meinung dass langfristig ein kapitalgedecktes system mit einer vielfalt an versicherungsangeboten und einem grundschutz als verpflichtendem kern f r alle bundesb rger das bessere modell w re
2109002 wir haben ein hnliches modell f r ein effizienteres gesundheitswesen schon im jahre 2002 vorgestellt ich halte dessen grundaussagen auch heute noch f r richtig
2109003 in unserem modell aus dem jahr 2002 h tten nach ablauf der umstellungsphase alle einen private kapitalgedeckte krankenversicherung gehabt das hei t das gesch ftsfeld w re f r die kleinen versicherer genauso gegeben wie f r die gro en da k me es berhaupt nicht zu einer verschiebung von wettbewerb wer das behauptet hat unsere modellvorstellung von damals nicht gelesen
2109004 der bestand von beamten und angestellten hin zu mehr selbstst ndigen verschoben
2109005 wenn man sich die demografische und medizinische entwicklung anschaut wird klar dass wir insgesamt viel mehr und nicht weniger kapitaldeckung und damit auch mehr und nicht weniger private krankenversicherungen brauchen
2109006 die gesundheitsreform hat das gesch ft der privaten krankenversicherung erschwert
2109007 da habe ich dann schon ein bisschen ein problem mit meinem glauben an den staat
2109008 respeto la voluntad del jugador pero tengo que defender los intereses del mallorca a capa y espada
2109009 tendremos un buen equipo sin hacer locuras la afici n tiene que tener paciencia y confianza y si se va moy o quien sea no ficharemos para tapar huecos sino lo que necesite la plantilla

2109011 the biostar deal is another example of us looking to broaden our product range biostar motherboards are continuously getting really good reviews but are still low priced so theres really good value to be had
2109012 i think the reason they made that decision is the brand strategy we created for them
2109013 they probably also viewed us as a distributor thats going forward
2109014 the cloud could be much more impactful than the web
2109015 die studie zeigt dass sich trotz nach wie vor hoher preise die differenz zwischen der schweiz und dem ausland verringert hat
2109016 to whom much has been given much will be required and from one to whom much has been entrusted even more will be demanded
2109017 brill dont you dare fucking go to the astoria beer garden if you are going to order a vodka soda

2109020 i already have two deputies but they stay at home with their women
2109021 there must be somebody in the city who can help you
2109022 and i can still see his tired yet determined eyes appealing to us to stand beside him i have no idea what samarra looks like today and i wont believe true progress has occurred there until i see it
2109023 en ese momento alguien tuvo que ver mi reproductor mp3 sin que yo me diese cuenta

2109028 i speak for many people when i say that we are truly glad he is gone
2109029 after watching drug dealers and prostitutes doing business on the street and finding hypodermic needles and condoms left in their yard
2109030 im not into degradation and i feel that prostituting yourself is just about the most degrading thing that a person can do
2109031 turning in double the amount gives us a lot of extra insurance

2109033 quentin is convinced britney will be brilliant shes delighted she thinks it could turn her career around

2109035 though she definitely intends to explore acting roles down the road right now shes concentrating on recording her next album
2109036 el domingo d a 20 julio quisimos ir a ver la obra de teatro que anuncian en la revista veranos de la villa en los jardines de galileo coste 22 euros
2109037 hab a mucho humo en la carretera y al principio pens que se trataba de un tractor pero luego vi lo ocurrido y me qued impresionado

2109040 for some reason the flying girls in skimpy outfits didnt
2109041 i am exercising my executive authority to avoid a full blown crisis and keep our state moving forward
2109042 this is not an action i take lightly but we do not have a budget and as governor i have a responsibility to make sure our state has enough money to pay its bills
2109043 understands how difficult its going to be theres no easy decisions with the state facing a 15 billion budget deficit and having no budget
2109044 the federal minimum wage part goes away and everybody goes back to what they were making
2109045 since when do we start punishing state workers for something that is not their responsibility
2109046 the governor should be threatening members of his own party who continue to obstruct the process of passing a budget
2109047 it would take just two republicans in the senate and six in the assembly to agree on a compromise but they wont budge
2109048 a meaningful discussion on core issues is the only way to deal with californias fiscal crisis not political maneuvering
2109049 forcing public servants into financial hardship or unemployment will not fix our problems it will only exacerbate the situation
2109050 the problem is not with the pay scale or numbers it is with our system of how we take in revenues where we allocate them and how we vote on our budget
2109051 this is not a time to play games with public employees pocket books
2109052 these families are already struggling to provide for their families while grocery bills and rising fuel prices hijack their wallets real leadership from the governor would be to engage in budget negotiations not penalize public servants who arent to blame for the budget impasse
2109053 we are continuing to make progress and i remain hopeful we will have a budget on his desk in the next few days
2109054 all of us need to do a certain amount of due diligence
2109055 coming toward the end of the session i dont know why it took on the importance it did
2109056 we have next year 2010 and 2011 given that timeframe i dont understand the haste in making what i think would be an important decision
2109057 the speaker supports the national popular vote legislation and was disappointed it couldnt cross the finish line on the final day of the formal session
2109058 he remains hopeful we can revisit it soon along with the senate
2109059 each state shall appoint in such manner as the legislature thereof may direct a number of electors

2109225 ioc has defeated the very spirit and principles of olympics by giving china the right to host the games
2109226 china with its largest population in the world certainly deserves this right like any other country but right now it is governed by a communist regime which rules the country through intimidation and violent repression
2109227 china deprives the rights and freedoms of its own people and does not uphold the ideals of the olympics in order to host it at this time not at least after what is happening in tibet
2109228 since march this year many tibetans have perished many dead many missing and still many others going through regular extreme and brutal torture in chinese prisons
2109229 we are in grave concern of what is happening to tibetans inside tibet
2109230 i know how it is being in chinese prisons regular interrogation with torture with medical treatment and food
2109231 it is ironic that world leaders and athletes are now ready to celebrate olympics in a place where the communist regime has massacred thousands of chinese students
2109232 for the past five decades china has brought immense sufferings on tibetans refusing us basic human rights and freedom
2109233 it is the moral obligation of the peace loving people of the world to take a stand for truth and justice and for tibet

2109287 o2 launched home broadband last october and then launched mobile broadband in may
2109288 we were obviously not first to market either time however we were the first to offer home and mobile broadband together and automatic subscription to commercial wi fi hotspots such as the cloud
2109289 things like the bbc iplayer mean that people now want higher bandwidth with higher download limits
2109290 the cloud could be much more impactful than the web
2109291 there was a time when i was happy to just look back at the good work that wed done and move ahead to more good work
2109292 but i was convinced by my colleagues frank spotnitz and david duchovny that there was a great movie to be made and that the time was right and while i wasnt against it they really helped push me in the direction of making the movie
2109293 then in january 2007 they resolved the dispute and literally the next day the movie was back on
2109294 fox felt that there was a window for it and that that window was now
2109295 so really we made this movie for the fans but we also realized that if this was going to be not the last movie we had to make it also for people who might not be as familiar with the show
2109296 we set up to tell a very scary story using two characters who we would introduce you to without that introduction being a burden on the hardcore fans
2109297 we integrated that introduction into the story line we tried to create a good thriller a mystery call it science fiction it works on all those levels and it also works as an x file
2109298 we essentially stuck with the same story although we actually had forgotten some of it
2109299 but these were all good things because when we came back to it we came back to it in a fresh way
2109300 the opening date they gave us was hard and fast
2109301 with about 60 days of filming mostly in vancouver modest budget short prep short post
2109302 we began filming december 10 and finished filming march 19
2109303 but it felt like a hundred days because three of the those weeks were in the snow

2109316 for the past five decades china has brought immense sufferings on tibetans refusing us basic human rights and freedom
2109317 despite that tibetans have fully committed ourselves to nonviolent and peaceful means of protesting chinas ruthless regime it is the moral obligation of the peace loving people of the world to take a stand for truth and justice and for tibet
2109318 a day away from the beijing olympics as the communist chinese government readies to show its seemingly harmonious face to the world we stand to let everyone know the true face of the regime and how it has for forty nine years killed thousands of tibetans and attempted to destroy the ancient and sacred tibetan culture we will not allow the brutal communist regime fool the world

2109559 one item from google alerts caught pabicos attention a special report on the issue from the manila times posted online that same day feb 3 he was surprised that the times report contained sentences and quotes that were eerily familiar pabico found that the times report as well as an accompanying story had lifted several portions of a the stories contained several paragraphs nearly identical with portions of pabicos september 2006 report even several of the quotes in his story two years ago were in the times stories
2109560 this article shows that apparently there is no such thing as a one time plagiarist investigations into cases like these should be done as thoroughly as possible
2109561 its been consciously taught in the classrooms that plagiarism is and will not be tolerated how about in the newsrooms when everyday editors and reporters alike are faced with deadlines do newrooms teach this
2109562 they used to but i seriously doubt if it happens on a regular basis nowadays among other reasons because the new technologies have reduced opportunities for personal interaction i e reporters send in their stories via fax or e mail and in many cases dont have the opportunity to interact with editors
2109563 i know full well how hard it is to defend traditional journalism today the right and the left join in a critique that says there is no such thing as an unbiased nonpartisan journalist and that only the despicable msm mainstream media refuse to admit it the failures of established news organizations justifiably lead to public skepticism
2109564 when we fall short of our own professional standards we lend support to the cynical or na ve presumption that journalism is something anybody can do
2109565 ive given everything i had to compete in these olympic games

2109567 any time we have an opportunity to elevate the discussion get more people interested engaged or talking its a good thing for democracy
2109568 barack wants to focus on new technologies to cut foreign oil dependency and mccain wants offshore drilling well why dont we do a hybrid of both candidates ideas
2109569 we can do limited offshore drilling with strict environmental oversight while creating tax incentives to get detroit making hybrid and electric cars
2109570 that way the offshore drilling carries us until the new technologies kick in which will then create new jobs and energy independence energy crisis solved
2109571 now im just speaking for myself and not the geological survey
2109572 but we are going to need almost anything you can think of all energy sources alternatives and technologies to get us through what paris doesnt talk about is that the electricity to power those hybrid and electric cars is going to have to come from somewhere too
2109573 see what youve done youve got me analyzing paris hiltons thought process
2109574 if she can articulate it it cant be rocket science
2109575 but the candidates dont come out and sum it up this way because their messages are one built around sound bites two built around oversimplification three built around interest groups
2109576 but the average u s household is spending 6 300 a year on fuel costs for their homes and cars thats no laughing matter

2109582 all i know is that based on what weve done today were in better shape than we were for the worlds thats very pleasing at this point and its encouraging and motivating the riders
2109583 yesterday we just had a steady session to help the body acclimatise into a training cycle and awaken it
2109584 but today was more of a hit out what the guys are doing is activation based we tick all the boxes over the course of the session acceleration force production speed and technical aspects as well since the track is shaped differently to what we are used to back home

2109586 this will require consideration by strategics security holders of debenture stock subordinated notes and perpetual preference shares while the negotiations have been continuing there has been a further material decline in the property finance market sector and reinvestment rates
2109587 the issue going forward is the concern for the ranking of all of those should there be a management buyout
2109588 in 1972 a crack commando unit was sent to prison by a military court for a crime they didnt commit these men promptly escaped from a maximum security stockade to the los angeles underground today still wanted by the government they survive as soldiers of fortune if you have a problem if no one else can help and if you can find them maybe you can hire the a team

2109601 the us decision to drop atomic bombs on hiroshima and nagasaki was meant to kick start the cold war against the soviet union washingtons war time ally rather than end the second world war
2109602 was not just a war crime it was a crime against humanity
2109603 the japanese were ready to surrender and it wasnt necessary to hit them with that awful thing
2109604 the use of this barbarous weapon at hiroshima and nagasaki was of no material assistance in our war against japan the japanese were already defeated and ready to surrender
2109605 russia might be more manageable if impressed by american military might and that a demonstration of the bomb may impress russia
2109606 oil prices continue to come down but its unclear what will happen with the prices
2109607 but at the same time u s citizens are making decisions that will carry forward regardless of how fuel prices fluctuate
2109608 weve seen a really dramatic change in buying patterns for different automobiles with big shifts away from suvs pickup trucks and other larger less fuel efficient cars for smaller cars for hybrids

2109618 all americans need to recognize the importance of the service these brave men and women have provided and make sure they have the services they need
2109619 this should not be a partisan or political issue we must send the clear message that we all support our troops and veterans this plan focuses our efforts on getting our military personnel and veterans the resources they need in the best way possible this is the least we can do to repay their service
2109620 if the economics fit for additional expansion it should be evaluated
2109621 everybody is pleased that the pub will be turned into a synagogue
2109622 this is the prime spot in the whole of stamford hill it is a nice big building with two huge halls there is a lot of potential but it is all subject to planning permission which we will submit
2109623 everybody is looking for more space in the area but it is not available
2109624 we have tried for a year to purchase the building because this is an orthodox area the pubs sales have been declining so it is a good deal for everyone

2109628 we are in the process of building a strong campaign organization the size and scope of which this state has never seen before these 29 field offices are in every region of the state including towns that have never seen a presidential campaign office before
2109629 i am exercising my executive authority to avoid a full blown crisis and keep our state moving forward
2109630 this is not an action i take lightly but we do not have a budget and as governor i have a responsibility to make sure our state has enough money to pay its bills
2109631 understands how difficult its going to be theres no easy decisions with the state facing a 15 billion budget deficit and having no budget
2109632 the federal minimum wage part goes away and everybody goes back to what they were making
2109633 since when do we start punishing state workers for something that is not their responsibility
2109634 the governor should be threatening members of his own party who continue to obstruct the process of passing a budget
2109635 it would take just two republicans in the senate and six in the assembly to agree on a compromise but they wont budge
2109636 a meaningful discussion on core issues is the only way to deal with californias fiscal crisis not political maneuvering
2109637 forcing public servants into financial hardship or unemployment will not fix our problems it will only exacerbate the situation
2109638 the problem is not with the pay scale or numbers it is with our system of how we take in revenues where we allocate them and how we vote on our budget
2109639 this is not a time to play games with public employees pocket books
2109640 these families are already struggling to provide for their families while grocery bills and rising fuel prices hijack their wallets real leadership from the governor would be to engage in budget negotiations not penalize public servants who arent to blame for the budget impasse
2109641 we are continuing to make progress and i remain hopeful we will have a budget on his desk in the next few days

2109663 my father is argentinian my mother australian my parents met in jerusalem but i was born in spain my mum travelled a lot with me when i was young and i spent time in india indonesia australia israel and spain i did my undergraduate studies in bologna and came to london in 1998
2109664 it was an interesting experience as i started exploring magic and illusion in my work a theme that has preoccupied me ever since i showed in london at the whitechapel art gallery in 2006 and performed at the victoria amp albert museum during last years surrealism exhibition
2109665 it is a good thing as i get to do a lot of reading and that informs my practice
2109666 what i like is that they were meant to be played by everyone i like the democracy of anyone being able to appropriate that musical skill
2109667 the photographs were done with old obsolete photographic technology and are hand printed they have incredible depth to them
2109668 i am involved in an automatic instrument ensemble and we will be premiering in january i am also aiming to work on a companion piece to this film which will be about the marks grooves and perforations associated with music
2109669 every shot is immaculately composed i think she is going to have a big career it is very exciting to be working with her at this early stage
2109670 i studied in the photography department at the bezalel academy in jerusalem but was first exposed to video art when studying in toronto during my course i made a conscious decision to become more involved in this area and took classes on my return to israel i left israel in 1996 after graduation first to study in new york and then in 2000 i settled in amsterdam i currently live and work in tel aviv and amsterdam
2109671 my work explores the creation of identity in the state of israel the distance i now have from the place i grew up in has created a difference in my views i have a more critical point of view and question more my work has been described as that of a disappointed lover
2109672 i am very connected with the place and i think it is important i continue to make the work i am not a political activist but i care there is not enough political discussion in art
2109673 this piece is very much related to israel my grandparents came to israel from poland in the 1920s and i wanted to explore my polish background my strongest emotion when i got there was where are the jews
2109674 the video is the first part of a trilogy i am currently developing concepts for the second then i will be having a solo show in new york
2109675 the works touch on whatever it is in israel that draws me back to it again and again
2109676 death leaves a heartache no one can heal love leaves a memory no one can steal
2109677 memory is a way of holding onto the things you love the things you are the things you never want to lose
2109678 in the night of death hope sees a star and listening love can hear the rustle of a wing
2109679 its so curious one can resist tears and behave very well in the hardest hours of grief but then someone makes you a friendly sign behind a window or one notices that a flower that was in bud only yesterday has suddenly blossomed or a letter slips from a drawer and everything collapses
2109680 you can clutch the past so tightly to your chest that it leaves your arms too full to embrace the present
2109681 when you are sorrowful look again in your heart and you shall see that in truth you are weeping for that which has been your delight
2109682 give sorrow words the grief that does not speak whispers the heart and bids it break
2109683 sorrow you can hold however desolating if nobody speaks to you if they speak you break down
2109684 we must embrace pain and burn it as fuel for our journey
2109685 every evening i turn my worries over to god hes going to be up all night anyway
2109686 she was no longer wrestling with the grief but could sit down with it as a lasting companion and make it a sharer in her thoughts
2109687 as long as i can i will look at this world for both of us as long as i can i will laugh with the birds i will sing with the flowers i will pray to the stars for both of us
2109688 death leaves a heartache no one can heal love leaves a memory no one can steal
2109689 my niece was doing my hair and she kept answering the phone to schedule other hair appointments
2109690 later while we were at lunch one of my nieces customers approached her about calling to make an appointment we thought wouldnt it be nice if customers could just go online to set up their appointments
2109691 i cant imagine how i managed my business without it
2109692 my clients have benefited because i am not constantly leaving them to answer the phone i have been able to reach a new clientele with the online advertising package
2109693 it was something i had great trepidation about going into
2109694 i had no idea where to start i was so impressed that jana was willing to take the time to explain to me things in a language i could understand im so pleased with the site and know that i can relay on her to help me through the changes as i add more to the site

2109698 certainly not in my history here has there every been anything like this
2109699 everyone has known from the beginning that the mta board is heavily loaded when it comes to the mayors votes on there
2109700 lets not talk about fairness in light of how this came about i think its hypocritical to talk about fairness when it was brought about so unfairly to the mta board
2109701 either way there will be an election so now the question is whether the board of supervisors wants to force the mta to spend the money and go to court take the courts time to have an election that will cost less and will offer less confusion by the action weve just taken were forcing that to happen

2109704 arias was asked three times in court to look at brandy and tell them if he was the man who threatened him with a gun and he said he did not know
2109705 they shouldnt be able to hold him if he cant be identified in court he should have walked
2109706 and the last thing is theres been no proof whatsoever that a gun was involved in the incident
2109707 if i were a jury i guess i might have some real bad trouble trying to find the defendant guilty but im not a jury im only here to see if the people have shown enough to hold the defendant to answer and i must admit that there are some hurdles for them to get over but thats up to them as far as trial is concerned
2109708 thats why his bail is 1 million if he wasnt looking at three strikes his bail would have been lower

2109751 now the major driver with that and the thing causing the growth of technology market to go further is when the price falls through new ceilings

2109943 by any measure southern california is a center of innovation we have some of the countrys top universities spending more than 4 billion a year on research and development and there are more patents issued annually in southern california than in almost any other region of this size the angel network groups have done a good job stepping in at the earliest stages of investment but there are very few groups there to back them up with that first institutional round of funding
2109944 from an investors perspective early stage funds have historically delivered the best returns 35 5 over the past 10 years in my view high net worth individuals family offices and southern california based firms should be looking at early stage investing in this region as a very attractive category
2109945 we are exposed to over 1000 new southern california companies annually and a very small fraction of them will find funding we believe we can do better for both entrepreneurs and potential investors
2109946 its a big loss its a struggle being here today

2109954 joe could always make you laugh he was probably one of the funniest men that i ever knew always had a smile on he never really had a bad day
2109955 and dorothy very much the same way always there to help someone
2109956 in fact i believe she was supposed to take someone to a dental appointment and thats really how this started out

2109960 new media also develops advanced targeting models that accurately project voter turn out and assign vote goals down to
2109961 to out smart out maneuver and out hustle your fierce competitors because its a law of the jungle
2109962 in an electoral system where a small number of votes can swing an election you need every advantage you can get
2109963 i know these guys well they become partners with the campaigns they work with from designing the program to drafting scripts from selecting targets to making the calls in a professional successful way they work as hard to win your races as you do
2109964 the recount also showed that had there been a full statewide recount of all counties al gore would have received more votes than bush however neither campaign requested such a total statewide recount and it was never formally carried out

2109982 the good news is that higher food prices are exactly what is required to restore balance in the market with rising demand and constrained supply the iron law of economics permits no other response in a market economy when demand exceeds supply prices rise higher prices discourage consumption but they also encourage more investment and enhance production
