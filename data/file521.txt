5210008 kalo saya sudah jelas sikapnya mendukung anwar ibrahim karena saya sudah kenal lama dengan dia
5210009 saya tahu anwar sudah sejak lama jadi tidak mungkin dia melakukan hal itu ini hanya karena kepentingan politik penguasa untuk menghambat karir politiknya

5210013 harga sekarang ini lebih disebabkan spekulasi harga minyak di waktu mendatang bukan akibat faktor pasokan dan permintaan
5210014 harga minyak yang turun sekarang ini terutama disebabkan menurunnya permintaan sementara pasokan tetap normal
5210015 meski kita tidak bisa memungkiri bahwa subsidi energi ini lebih banyak dinikmati oleh mereka yang memiliki mobil dan mereka yang memiliki rumah dengan daya listrik yang besar
5210016 hal ini disebabkan karena apbn kita jauh lebih rawan terhadap tekanan harga minyak yang lebih tinggi dibanding jika harga minyak turun
5210017 sebab tidak ada jaminan bahwa penurunan harga minyak akan tetap konstan tahun depan
5210018 kondisi ini saya pikir tidak akan menjamin terus berlanjut di tahun 2009

5210066 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
5210067 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
5210068 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5210069 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5210070 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5210071 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5210072 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
5210073 this was the first chance to put my best effort forward just to see what i could do
5210074 implemented a policy of avoiding ignoring and covering up complaints including those relating to physical and sexual abuse by officers
5210075 if youre going to beat me youre going to have to go low 12 7 to do it
5210076 thats what i hope to do i hope they can cope
5210077 it has been good for the three players to be involved in the olympics and we are proud of them
5210078 among two key recommendations that were made at the agm is to give boost to cricket in rural areas and provide more support to regional cricket centres
5210079 youre parked in a handicapped spot thanks for making me walk
5210080 handicapped parking enforcement has not been what it should be
5210081 we did have an incident which took place with a small number of people but the majority of people who have come here today behaved impeccably
5210082 a small group attempted to barricade the road we responded quickly and efficiently and they were not successful in creating the barricade
5210083 we have thrown our weight behind this because we think theres a difference between free speech and free expression and attacking someone for the colour of their skin or their sexual orientation
5210084 the bnp stands for everything that we are not we are here as a trade union to promote unity for the betterment of working men and working women and the bnp stand for attacking those who have different colour skin from their own
5210085 they have come here because it is a traditional white area and theres a lot of ethnic minorities living here
5210086 they see it as part of their battle ground to widen their appeal and these are the sort of people they want to reach
5210087 i support the anti fascists the bnp should never have been allowed here in the first place it doesnt do us any favours
5210088 its a strong area for the bnp because theres a lot of people here with nothing to do apart from cause a lot of trouble
5210089 people have a right to peacefully protest the police have been trying to make sure that any demonstrations are orderly and they are doing their job the organisers of the demonstration have been working with the police
5210090 we are spending public money demolishing buildings to avoid this ill thought out stealth tax gordon brown should be ashamed of making people whose properties are empty pay even more tax thus making a bad situation even worse it is another labour stealth tax on hardship
5210091 swindon like many other towns across the country could suffer if regeneration projects are shelved as a result of this we want mps to take note and for the government to urgently reapply the relief on empty property
5210092 this stealth tax will do nothing to help the regeneration of our towns are it simply puts another burden on developers at a time where the government should be giving them a helping hand
5210093 our priority is ensuring we have quality new developments and a rich supply of property to maximize the potential for jobs if the government is seriously committed to helping business creating jobs and not hindering progress then it will reapply the relief forthwith
5210094 with projects to regenerate an area the public sector along with regional development agencies and english partnerships financially supports the actual developments a rate liability on empty properties reduces their viability
5210095 therefore the quality that is needed to regenerate an area is often reduced as costs are slahed government policy is now backfiring because quality regeneration developments are less likely to happen given the economic downturn
5210096 while swindon is lucky enough to have regeneration taking place we are seeing examples across the country of property owners demolishing sites to avoid rates while projects are being shelved in the face of the additional tax burden
5210097 every day every second we will be thinking of him
5210098 he was energetic always giving a helping hand whenever it was needed
5210099 the two younger cousins always looked up to him as their big brother
5210100 the suspect returned a little while later and was again involved in an exchange of words with nilanthan and his friends which resulted in the victim being injured
5210101 the suspect was last seen walking north in london road
5210102 we have no description of the mondeo driver but we do believe it was a licensed mini cab
5210103 we really need to trace the driver of the cab as he may hold the key to the identity of the suspect
5210104 it is not known at this time what the argument was about either with the cab driver or the group but anyone with information about the incident should call us
5210105 in my research students are certainly experiencing a higher inflationary rate because the cost of what they need to buy is among the highest categories of price rises
5210106 to say that this will be the most expensive academic year for higher education students to date would not be stretching it
5210107 for many students it is their first experience of independence and stepping out into the current economic climate will be a hard lesson in itself
5210108 the government could require the establishment of a secure registry of e mail servers that would be used to fight spam that list would encourage others to begin to require some further level of authentication before sending e mail that authentication could be supplied by a digital id
5210109 this includes data to determine the source destination time duration type and equipment used in a given communication
5210110 each oval represents one kind of constraint operating on the pathetic dot each constraint imposes a different kind of cost on the dot

5210113 taking sykes and matzas 1957 techniques of neutralization it is possible to identify how the characteristics of the online environment allow individuals to drift into deviant behavior while still maintaining a positive self image
5210114 online harassment while initially manifesting online can migrate to the offline environment of the victim name calling in emails and chats can turn into threats literally on victims doorsteps
5210115 idm says some of the name calling and accusations has become brutal
5210116 we only assume that the internet allows radical freedom because it happened to be designed that way it could just as easily be resigned to restrict freedom
5210117 in 2003 the riaa sent out letters to colleges and universities warning them that they have a legal and moral responsibility to ensure that on one is using their networks to distribute copyrighted material without authorization
5210118 in early 2004 its clear that unregulated peer to peer music sharing is not destined to be free and easy as it once was millions still do it millions more try to do it soon
5210119 lawrence lessig explained in his seminal work code and others laws of cyberspace we only assume that the internet allows radical freedom because it happened to be designed that way it could just as easily be resigned to restrict freedom
5210120 the internet was built to cynical principles borderlessness unregulatability peer to peer openness
5210121 you can be in any state you want and the streets will just suck you back regardless you cant get away
5210122 neighborhoods that manifest social disorganization and social conditions that produce crime
5210123 whether a hacker fits the stereotypical image of a nerd with pocket protectors thick glasses and awkward social skills is irrelevant and most dont
5210124 mitigating social engineering attacks requires a series of coordinated efforts include the following
5210125 by using a keystroke logger you can retrieve email address email and instant messages credit card numbers and of course passwords
5210126 deploying software like spycop available at www sypcop com to detect unauthorized keystroke loggers
5210127 rather then break into a website and risk getting caught hackers can often retrieve the site files they want through goggle

5210206 as far as the pilots and the west gulf proposal all i can say at this time is theres no need for pilots to take any action on the proposal and we have no further comment
5210207 the pilots showed great flexibility and initiative to handle unique traffic needs
5210208 it is very gratifying to me that west gulf was proactive in trying to keep rates competitive and fair
5210209 now the democratic government of pakistan will have to perform and prove to the people that it is capable it will have to fulfill each and every individuals aspiration
5210210 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
5210211 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
5210212 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
5210213 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
5210214 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
5210215 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
5210216 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
5210217 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
5210218 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
5210219 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
5210220 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
5210221 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
5210222 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
5210223 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
5210224 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
5210225 schlie lich sind viele riester rentenversicherungen so teuer dass die kosten die staatlichen zulagen bersteigen
5210226 es kann doch nicht sein dass der staat die versicherungswirtschaft alimentiert
5210227 t m on oudoin harrastukseni mutta t ll on omanlaisensa tunnelma
5210228 aiya spore cannot make it in table tennis dont waste your time
5210229 we have spotted a couple local kids with world class potential however they are also intelligent kids with good results and their parents didnt want them to continue
5210230 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
5210231 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
5210232 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
5210233 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
5210234 t m on oudoin harrastukseni mutta t ll on omanlaisensa tunnelma

5210246 somos capaces porque somos dignos y orgullosos de cuidar y defender la tierra en qu vivimos no le robamos ni le quitamos nada a nadie para existir en nuestra comunidad pero quienes est n robando son las empresas extranjeras que con nuestros recursos naturales se est n llevando grandes utilidades
5210247 el pueblo chiquitano ejerci su derecho ciudadano y fue a votar masivamente en el refer ndum ahora tenemos como un desaf o grande la aprobaci n y puesta en vigencia de la nueva constituci n pol tica del estado donde se reconocen varias de nuestras demandas y que de una vez se respeten nuestros derechos como pueblos ind genas
5210248 este domingo 10 de agosto durante el refer ndum revocatorio en el cant n de santa rosa de la roca municipio de san ignacio de velasco nuestros hermanos y hermanas que asistieron a votar y participar como delegados para vigilar la transparencia de la consulta fueron insultados y expulsados del lugar de votaci n por los miembros del comit c vico
5210249 un grupo de c vicos que apoyan al prefecto de santa cruz comenzaron a amedrentar a nuestros compa eros y compa eras ind genas para que voten a favor del prefecto e incluso los amenazaron para que muestren la papeleta de votaci n para saber por qui n votaban
5210250 vamos a denunciar este hecho a todo el pa s y ante la organizaci n estados americanos oea para que sepan que en la chiquitania cada vez hay menos democracia pues por pensar diferente o defender los derechos empiezan a perseguir y amenazar a nuestros hermanos ind genas
5210251 nosotros creemos que esta situaci n de persecuci n va a continuar y por eso tenemos que denunciar lo que pasa y exigir a las autoridades que hagan cumplir la ley nosotros lo nico que hacemos es ejercer nuestros derechos reconocidos por la constituci n y la leyes de bolivia

5210253 jos huenchunao tiene pendiente una acci n contra el estado chileno ante la comisi n interamericana de derechos humanos por haber sido condenado por la ley antiterrorista mediante una sentencia dictada con infracci n al debido proceso esencialmente racista y verdadero postulado ideol gico en contra de las leg timas acciones de recuperaci n de derechos por parte del pueblo mapuche
5210254 que nuevamente el estado de chile a trav s de su pol tica de represi n hace caso omiso de los derechos y garant as carcelarias justamente ganadas por nuestros weichafe en su categor a de presos pol ticos quienes han liderado importantes procesos de lucha de nuestro pueblo y que hoy en d a se encuentran injustamente encarcelados
5210255 frente a la situaci n de nuestro werken preso pol tico mapuche jos huenchunao mari an recluido en la c rcel de angol cumpliendo una condena de 10 a os por el caso poluco pidenco queremos anunciar y denunciar lo siguiente

5210263 los pueblos originarios son los primeros que sufrimos la extranjerizacion

5210265 en san martin de los andes la confederacion con el pueblo mapuche puso un lote a disposicion del barrio entero
5210266 el art culo 53 es una herramienta de lucha para el pueblo mapuche
5210267 referente a los derechos humanos suiza es la capitalde la cruz roja suiza nunca tuvo colonias a nivel estatal
5210268 nuestra vinculacion con la pelicula est en que el empresario domenico panciotto viene de suiza y la realizadora fausta quattrini es suiza
5210269 los pueblos indigenas me han cambiado la forma de ver e l derecho
5210270 los funcionarios del estado aparecen en el documental ridiculos y sin comprender ciertas cosas
5210271 el secretario de derechos humanos de neuqun ve a la pelicula como muy pol tica y la criticaba por eso
5210272 el inciso 17 se introdujo por cansancio el convenio 169 se ratifico sin leerlo porque si lo leian bien no lo hacian
5210273 roca hizo una ciudadan a de escritorio nos homogeneiz es importante que los pueblos originarios llamen a revertir eso
5210274 los pueblos originarios nos son negocio pol tico porque est n aislados por eso se los invisibiliza hay que salir de la invisibilidad reconociendo la realidad y fortaleciendo su lucha
5210275 un consejo a los abogados no se disfracen de originarios son abogados de la v citma no la v ctima asi se cumple mejor la funci n
5210276 ser a bueno por ejemplo que el colegio de abogados organice una comiison de derecho indigena propuso zaffaroni ganandose el aplauso de la concurrencia tambien hacer un congreso de derecho indigena
5210277 al tama o que ha llegado la industria comienzo a cuestionarme si no ser mejor consolidar lo que tenemos y no estar en una carrera permanente de crecimiento el mensaje que nos mand la naturaleza con las enfermedades me lleva a preguntarme si es el momento de ordenar lo que tenemos y tener un crecimiento m s sustentable en el tiempo
5210278 la industria deber a seguir creciendo a tasas cercanas al 10 por ciento y duplicar su tama o en las zonas donde no es tan grande como en las regiones xi y xii
5210279 the jesus whom i know as my redeemer cannot be less than god

5210327 the doctor said well it looks like hes got all the symptoms of west nile virus
5210328 i called the state health department because i needed to know how long he was going to be sick
5210329 i was just bawling i thought he was going to die
5210330 he was diagnosed with epstein barr virus which is pretty much the same thing but you dont die from it
5210331 i dont blame him because all the doctors are doing it
5210332 id like to know how many people have been told they have west nile
5210333 this has been going on since west nile came into utah some doctors will base things on symptoms and not do tests
5210334 like any medical test they can be expensive and if people dont have insurance then sometimes the doctor will go ahead and try to help the patient
5210335 whether theyre helping or not may be something of a question
5210336 he said well it sounds like youve got west nile
5210337 it was really strange it was just contradictory to what we had heard on the news and what seemed to be happening everywhere
5210338 i ended up going to the doctor in the springtime
5210339 they found out that i was really anemic the question i have now is did i ever really have it am i immune to it am i going to get it again
5210340 people who have been told they have it are out on the lake not really worrying about it
5210341 i cant imagine how many people have been told that
5210342 maybe theres something seriously wrong that they dont know about and they say nah its west nile
5210343 we try to do education for physicians and stuff like that thats the best we can do is try to educate people of what tests to draw and those kinds of things

5210350 no es el camino de justicia que debe haber en chile
5210351 que nuevamente el estado de chile a trav s de su pol tica de represi n hace caso omiso de los derechos y garant as carcelarias justamente ganadas por nuestros weichafe en su categor a de presos pol ticos quienes han liderado importantes procesos de lucha de nuestro pueblo y que hoy en d a se encuentran injustamente encarcelados

5210354 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
5210355 los sistemas penales no deben inventar ning n m todo pues todos los que utilizan ya se construyeron en democracia para perseguir a las clases peligrosas
5210356 magn fica demostraci n de la incapacidad de di logo de los estudiantes de chile

5210361 un ingl s llamado saham o sam ishlop y un italiano llamado peduzzi estos individuos se ocupan pura y exclusivamente en la caza de indios ya sea en territorio chileno o argentino mediante una libra esterlina por cada individuo macho y 5 chelines por cada muchacho o mujer

5210364 sangre del gaucho y del indio s lo sirve para abonar la tierra
5210365 all por la cordillera como en todos los caminos hay apellidos muy finos pero con una historia muy fiera cuando a los indios mataban para quitarle la tierra
5210366 estamos aqu en la uac levantando nuestra voz el arma m s poderosa que tenemos
5210367 la mina alumbrera consume el 50 del agua que consume la provincia pero adem s consume el 78 de la energ a de catamarca lo interesante es que los problemas de agua y energ a pasan a ser de la comunidad los medios lo instalan as no consuma luz o agua
5210368 modelo de saqueo que se basa en la destrucci n de los medios de vida
5210369 tenemos que luchar por instalar los bienes comunes como palabra y le ponemos el cuerpo a todo esto sin perder de vista el problema del modelo sabiendo que la alumbrera es un punto m s dentro de este modelo de desarrollo de explotaci n y saqueo
5210370 como asamblea esto es un desaf o ya se hicieron acciones hacia la comunidad como para producir un impacto de que se est diciendo algo porque hay que decir ya que si algo qued muy fuerte ac es la marcha del silencio pero en catamarca necesitamos volver a decir
5210371 entender que somos un pa s colonial cuesta en esta poca en que aqu no son necesarios los soldados porque ya formaron los universitarios los profesionales los pol ticos para manejar esto el rol colonizado de la universidad corre paralelo con la colonizaci n de la secretar a de agricultura y del senasa que aprueban lo que las corporaciones necesitan el inta que trabaja para las empresas abiertamente mediante el impulso de polos biotecnol gicos que trabajan para implantar el modelo de nidera cargill monsanto y bunge la miner a los eucaliptos la soja el engorde a corral los grandes criaderos de aves esto es parte de una escala macro en la que operan las empresas pero este fen meno que nos parec a tan lejano el que se pueda vincular en la sociedad todos estos modelos se ha dado con una materialidad sorprendente gracias al gran desarrollo de la conciencia ambiental
5210372 cada vez que nosotros nos movemos y damos un paso vemos c mo se expresa el iirsa integraci n de la infraestructura regional suramericana y as se entiende por qu el tratado binacional que entrega la cordillera de los andes fue orquestado casi diez a os antes de que lo firmara carlos menem vemos c mo se fue desarrollando y pensando el saqueo la hidrov a hecha para que los barcos de gran porte se lleven todo tambi n fue pensada hace mucho tiempo porque saben que la mejor manera de llevarse los bienes comunes es la l nea recta poco costo y rapidez y ah tambi n est gioja que ha regalado todo para que el paso de aguas negras salga hacia el pac fico con un corredor bioc anico y para todo esto es necesario tambi n energ a y r pida para eso las centrales nucleares cuatro centrales que impulsa kirchner y no hablemos de la cantidad de compa eros confundid simos que toman como bandera la energ a nuclear porque es una tecnolog a de punta o porque estamos en crisis energ tica c mo no vamos a estar en crisis una sola empresa minera consume el 10 de la energ a del pa s qu pasar cuando empiecen a funcionar agua rica y pascua lama cu nta energ a se necesitar y ah entra el cuento de la crisis energ tica por eso para luchar y estar seguros de c mo afrontar los debates tenemos que saber y conocer
5210373 no contundente a los agronegocios porque producen destrucci n de montes y bosques nativos expulsa comunidades campesinas criminaliza la protesta social contamina tierras y aguas produce la destrucci n de la biodiversidad apropiaci n de las semillas por parte de las empresas manipulaci n gen tica trabajo en negro explotaci n infantil concentraci n de la tierra en pocas manos p rdida de fuentes de trabajo destrucci n de las econom as regionales atenta contra la salud y vida de los pueblos tanto por el consumo de transg nicos como por las fumigaciones
5210374 las propuestas de cambio son dif ciles de encarar pero algunas ya tienen su materializaci n concretamente como la del mocase y la idea de soberan a alimentaria son una manifestaci n concreta de que se puede encarar las cosas de otra manera pero c mo se resuelve la producci n del conjunto del sistema agropecuario argentino eso es algo a seguir profundizando
5210375 la uac es la expresi n de una necesidad que tenemos todas las asambleas fundamentalmente ambientales de intercambiar nuestras experiencias y vivencias respecto a esta lucha en eso se ha progresado much simo por la inclusi n de m s organizaciones y por la profundizaci n de los temas que cada asamblea toca
5210376 indagar qu es lo que contamina en el rea en donde existe la asamblea o el grupo
5210377 trascender el aspecto puntual para llegar a los problemas de fondo
5210378 la lucha que se viene se presenta en dos grandes ramas la miner a del oro por un lado y la del uranio por otro
5210379 en el resto de las provincias hemos dado pasos importantes hemos logrado leyes contra la mega miner a metal fera contaminante en patagonia mendoza tucum n la rioja y hay presentaciones para prohibirla en san luis y en c rdoba tambi n
5210380 lo que impulsa la c mara minera junto al gobierno nacional y las provincias es zonificar generando espacios donde s se podr hacer la miner a con el m todo contaminante justamente en sitios donde no est n de pie y luchando las comunidades
5210381 el uranio surge de golpe cuando su precio se dispara ante la acci n de los pa ses del primer mundo que buscan combatir el precio del petr leo con fuentes alternativas de energ a dentro de la cnea hay quienes quieren poner en licitaci n los grandes yacimientos otros quieren hacer canje con otros pa ses para el desarrollo local de la energ a nuclear y otros consideran que esos minerales tienen que ser utilizados s lo en lo dom stico mediante centrales nucleares por eso en argentina se relanza un plan nuclear de cuatro centrales en lo inmediato
5210382 con esta iniciativa se busca realizar una masiva tarea de concientizaci n en la poblaci n a fin de que se comprenda sobre las herramientas que desde el gobierno se otorga a las mineras para que se instalen destruyan saqueen y contaminen
5210383 los ciudadanos del territorio argentino decimos no a la miner a qu mica con la modalidad a
5210384 aporte potencial de energ as renovables no convencionales y eficiencia energ tica a la matriz el ctrica 2008 2025
5210385 al a o 2025 las energ as renovables y la eficiencia podr an entregar 30 m s de electricidad al sic y juntas aportar an 7 600 mw al sistema
5210386 nosotros no decimos c mo debe ser el abastecimiento lo que es efectivo es que los resultados permiten prever que podemos dejar de construir algunas centrales porque lo que aportan las fuentes no convencionales es significativo
5210387 que siempre ha sido vista como soluci n de emergencia pero despu s de este estudio pasa a ser una fuente de energ a m s que hay que considerar
5210388 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo
5210389 los supermercados deben mejorar sus sistemas de iluminaci n y refrigeraci n e incorporar equipos nuevos no decimos que hay que botarlos de un d a para otro pero a medida que crezcan econ micamente deben agregar tecnolog a m s eficiente
5210390 debe existir una regulaci n que diga concretamente en chile no se puede importar equipos que tengan eficiencias menores a tanto y eso cambiar a el panorama
5210391 s lo la geot rmica como en todas partes del mundo requiere una ayuda estatal en las primeras exploraciones
5210392 todas las investigaciones actuales muestran que los f siles tienden a subir de precio en forma estable tanto el petr leo como el gas natural el carb n y el recurso de embalse se est agotando las tecnolog as de las nuevas fuentes en cambio est n madurando y muchas de ellas ya tienden a la baja y se van a hacer cada vez m s competitivas lo que impulsar el desarrollo de las fuentes no convencionales
5210393 the folk alliance is pleased to be associated with one of the most respected songwriting contests on the planet newsong and the legendary mountain stage radio show i know that this contest can change the career path for its winners and we are proud to be a part of that process
5210394 the partnering of the mountain stage newsong contest with the folk alliance is a natural
5210395 the result will be an even greater impact on the two institutions missions of promoting the song and the songwriter
5210396 newsong made everyone feel like we were there for a purpose and that we were being celebrated for what we do everyone was treated so well and told that newsong would always be a resource for us even one year later they are still in touch its much more than a songwriting contest
5210397 am decis sa renuntam la proiectul pe care intentionam sa il realizam pe terenul pe care il avem in cartierul berceni deoarece piata imobiliara este confuza in acest moment iar oscilatiile sunt destul de mari pe aceasta piata suntem deja in negocieri cu un investitor pentru vanzarea terenului de aproximativ sapte hectare din zona progresul am solicitat 500 de euro pe metru patrat fara tva
5210398 cred ca daca nu ar fi fost criza financiara piata crestea anul acesta exact ca anul trecut nu cred ca este o maturizare normala o maturizare care oricum s ar fi intamplat fara sa fi avut o criza economica internationala
5210399 piata apartamentelor de lux este afectata de faptul ca potentialii clienti nu mai au ca prioritate achizitia unei locuinte din cauza ca au probleme cu afacerile personale
5210400 daca in luna aprilie cu o luna inainte de lansarea vanzarilor la stejarii aveam stabilit ca target lunar de vanzari cate zece apartamente am fost nevoiti sa ne reducem planul la doar cinci sase apartamente lunar motivul modificarii a fost acela ca noi ne am bazat pe studii care aveau ca istoric anul trecut iar situatia in prima parte a acestui an a inceput sa se schimbe
5210401 aura care planeaza asupra pietei de la inceputul anului cu privire la asa zisa cadere a pietei a scenariului similar cu piata americana i a facut mai sceptici si pe potentialii clienti din zona de lux pot spune ca in zona de nord unde sunt o serie de proiecte la 4 000 de euro mp jumatate sunt goale

5210416 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
5210417 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
5210418 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
5210419 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
5210420 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
5210421 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
5210422 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security

5210429 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
5210430 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
5210431 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
5210432 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
5210433 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
5210434 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5210435 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5210436 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance

5210474 we lost the points today but we need to be positive and then get the points next week
5210475 we are gutted because we wanted a winning start we had a slow start in the game i dont think we played well at all in the first half we scored the second goal but we didnt hold on
5210476 we conceded three goals at home which i think is unusual for us but we need to keep going now we need to start thinking about what we need to improve

5210521 could you imagine if you were to take halo and offer it free to play how much money do you think some people would spend on halo if they had a huge array of items that they could buy i recon theres a cap out at about usd 10 000 when you think about it the most we ask for is usd 60 and when you get those people spending a lot of money it brings the average up on acclaim games right now we average usd 75 per person

5210571 in the first half i think the team were coming together well and we played some good football

5210580 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
5210581 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
5210582 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5210583 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5210584 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
5210585 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
5210586 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages

5210590 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
5210591 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
5210592 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
5210593 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
5210594 it is a much better idea to use the cars brakes than the air bag

5210609 archbishop capalla one of the convenors of the buc said they are among its leaders and members to take on this role
5210610 these amendments were considered by cabinet in the context of recent debate about jury trials theres been a couple of cases
5210611 where there is any concern that a jury may not be able to fairly hear the matter there is an additional option available to the court
5210612 all other states do provide for the provision of majority verdicts
5210613 the hold up was because we had to find people from the ground who had left their cars on the cricket field area so we could get up with the aerial ladder platform to bring him down

5210617 we need to get the points in all our home games if we are going to be where we want to be we are gutted because we wanted a winning start
5210618 we conceded three goals at home which i think is unusual for us but we need to keep going now we need to start thinking about what we need to improve
5210619 we know that we are very short on numbers but we need to get the best out of the numbers that weve got at the moment

5210734 its devastating the game before against spain we got what i thought was a goal and it would have given us a draw and put us through and we couldnt have had a better opportunity to score than that last four seconds today
5210735 its not the individual it was just really the lost opportunities we lost two games by a goal and have drawn a game and we miss out
5210736 the water polo gods are not smiling on us obviously because it just seems like were getting on the wrong side of the calls the wrong side of everything at the moment
5210737 its not the officials its just those 50 50 things that dont seem to be going our way but we cant blame anyone but ourselves
5210738 ill be positive with them because the courage theyve shown not only in that game but in every game weve played
5210739 we havent started any game as favourite except for the game against canada the courage they have shown to be competitive and set ourselves up with the chance of winning every game is what ive asked from them
5210740 we will have a bit of down time now we dont play for three or four days so they can get away from water polo for a while and that will hurt
5210741 the german laenders states key characteristics as a high quality class of issuers have been affirmed in the recent financial crisis

5210766 various groups network with one another with a degree of anonymity that makes it very difficult for us they put information on the internet about how to evade law enforcement
5210767 in the more than 25 years of the animal liberation front relatively few people have been arrested and an even smaller number have been convicted
5210768 why have so few been caught according to most a l f activists preparation and reconnaissance is the key to staying safe
5210769 typically these groups do not conform to traditional hierarchical organizational structures
5210770 even if you catch someone they dont have information on the others
5210771 a lot of times they dont even know who the others are
5210772 these people are very secretive and they are really good criminals
5210773 they are a real challenge to the fbi they train each other in security not to talk on the phone how to send secure e mail messages they are very good at technology
5210774 people just watch sports on television at home with their friends and during the olympics if there is a television in a restaurant they might watch but there are no what you would call chinese sports pubs
5210775 dont know what they are talking about they offer their opinions with no justification of facts at all
5210776 maybe because of the olympic games people are watching more sports
5210777 and if people enjoy doing it so much they will want to do more of sitting together and drinking beer and watching games
5210778 i think this could make it because many people in china today want to go somewhere that is stylish to be seen
5210779 maybe they can go on and do well in the tournament i might be back for the next game

5210842 50 by 50 target but even then with the projected size of the 2013 cap the ets should still have a significant effect on emissions and at some stage the greens will be able to kneecap a party into imposing a sinking cap the sooner they are able to the easier it will be for everyone

5210885 i think theres a good contingent of alaskans who are embarrassed by the earmarks and the things that federal money is spent on
5210886 sean congratulations i beat your dad and im going to beat you
5210887 he had the opportunity to be gracious and didnt take it
5210888 the tone of voice the arrogance of that speech was just more than i could take
5210889 until everyone in the union says were going to take back america from washington d c were in the game
5210890 i think don and ted are two very strong people who know how the system works
5210891 earmarks as far as that goes thats the way the nation is run and i dont think mr young has done anything outside the norm
5210892 when you are one among 435 you had better be outspoken or strong
5210893 i think alaskans understand that translates into getting alaskas issues solved
5210894 his demeanor has not been very open to his constituents
5210895 don young has done good things over the years but at this point i think its time for a change
5210896 its our first sale of the fall and that means i need to have this stuff done
5210897 i think its fair to say he got the ball rolling at least on this issue
5210898 people really make the mistake of thinking this is politically motivated i enjoy doing it and so far i havent been too far off base
5210899 you guys are going down get ready for the show
5210900 i think for all intents and purposes the public didnt know about this until andrew put it on his blog
5210901 well done mr halcro alaska owes you a great thanks
5210902 halcro seems more angry than purposeful and i think that just turns people off

5210910 this is an issue that has been addressed and addressed again it is a clear matter the will of the people has already been known and we are just reasserting it here
5210911 we are both puzzled and enraged that we are back at this point again
5210912 in essence we just think that shooting animals from airplanes so distasteful it should only be used as a last resort not as standard operating procedures to manipulate the high and lows of game populations all the time so there is a maximum amount for hunters
5210913 what is an irreversible decline for crying out loud do they have to go extinct
5210914 it is obvious to us that the predator control program as it currently exists is not a matter of scientific management but policy that is being basically stuffed down the people of alaskas throats by a well connected minority
5210915 it is a vestige of redneck alaska the old fashioned idea that wildlife is all for us and we can do whatever we want with it and blasting things indiscriminately is the alaska way of life and we are the supreme species
5210916 we are seeing cows that are birthing twin calves now

5210922 we might see an ice free arctic ocean by the year 2030 within some of our lifetimes there are some scientists out there who think that even might be optimistic
5210923 the atmospheric response to realistic reduced summer arctic sea ice anomalies
5210924 whether itll go this year is definitely still a wait and see matter but i do think its realistic if it doesnt crash substantially more than last year then my understanding of thick ice as a damper will be flawed
5210925 a bold or foolish man makes predictions based on such an incomplete and chaotic science
5210926 i think it very likely that itll drop to below 3million km2
5210927 i can take criticism but not from someone who is not a scientist but an author making money out of spreading alarmist nonsense for which there is no evidence

5210935 i bet you can do the homework if you try
5210936 i dont want you to have a hard time in second grade if you dont learn this stuff
5210937 stuff that seems really complex but which i can describe imprecisely using very few words
5210938 interestingly some species have the ability to regenerate appendages while even fairly closely related species do not
5210939 this leads us to believe that during the course of evolution regeneration is something that has been lost by some species rather than an ability that has been gained by other species the key is to find a way to turn on this regenerative ability
5210940 if regeneration is hard for natural section to preserve how will natural selection create regeneration
5210941 we cannot see any way that x could have evolved therefore x was designed
5210942 there is obviously no way that sea creatures can get on top of mountains therefore there must have been a big flood
5210943 building up the body of christ at every level with books that are relevant intelligent and engaging
5210944 sals explanation of regeneration is hard to preserve as the only possible explanation is a demonstration of the limits of sals imagination not the limits of evolution or natural selection
5210945 if i cant imagine how it happened then it couldnt have happened
5210946 if the ability to regenerate major organs is hardly visible for natural selection to preserve how in the world will natural selection be able to even create the ability to regenerate major organs in the first place
5210947 instead of modifier middle is mine outer is mine modifier to compensate for the earlier lack clear
5210948 the complex specified information of a closed system cannot increase
5210949 im now in tottenham but no one can disagree with me wanting to follow my dream
5210950 the new data indicate that the genome contains very little unused sequences genes are just one of many types of dna sequences that have a functional impact
5210951 many species genomes contain a pool of functional elements that provide no specific benefits in terms of survival or reproduction
5210952 being able to hack in and change his phone bill
5210953 its not a big deal its just fish and chips its a rare case when it seriously impacts someones career
5210954 who is the pioneer of modern journalism not hemingway who wrote of his experiences in the trenches not orwell who spent a year of his life with the parisian poor not egon erwin kisch the expert on prague prostitutes but oriana fallaci who in the years 1969 to 1972 published a series of interviews with the most famous politicians of the time those interviews were more than mere conversations they were duels before the powerful politicians realized that they were fighting under unequal conditions for she was allowed to ask questions but they were not they were already on the floor of the ring koed
5210955 the public certainly has a right to know what kind of research its dollars are funding
5210956 a responsibility on the part of every scientist to talk to members of the media directly
5210957 nih funded investigators are requested to submit to the nih manuscript submission nihms system at pubmed central an electronic version of the authors final manuscript upon acceptance for publication resulting from research supported in whole or in part with direct costs from nih the policy applies to peer reviewed original research publications that have been supported in whole or in part with direct costs from nih but it does not apply to book chapters editorials reviews or conference proceedings
5210958 our study data do not strongly support the idea that scientists simply drop their religious identities upon professional training due to an inherent conflict between science and faith or to institutional pressure to conform
5210959 it was of course a lie what you read about my religious convictions a lie which is being systematically repeated i do not believe in a personal god and i have never denied this but have expressed it clearly
5210960 a box of atoms was shook and out popped us
5210961 its always nice to go on to the next level and try to prove people wrong
5210962 all the pundits are out there saying that were going to be rock bottom this year but weve shown great team spirit
5210963 that has to be on show for the next 37 games and we might have a chance
5210964 it looks like valeri has snapped his achilles and will be out for six months it is a huge blow for the lad
5210965 we are all desperately disappointed for him this has come on top of being out for a year already so it is a huge blow for him

5210969 given the vastness of the atmosphere and the huge altitude where weather is generated some 8 miles from the ground vs the tiny amount of city smog that only rises a few hundred feet by day then falls again to ground under its own weight at night it is impossible that weather is affected by it
5210970 ozone comprises three thousandths of one percent of the atmosphere
5210971 in fact the culprit crcs are heavier than air so would find it rather difficult to float upwards are inert so probably wouldnt combine with anything and because of population densities in the northern hemisphere would surely travel more to the arctic if they went anywhere
5210972 as for cfcs please supply evidence that atmospheric polar chlorine comes from cfcs and not mt erebus
5210973 it is lucky that they inventor used chlorine instead of bromine
5210974 it is lucky that they inventor used fluorine instead of bromine
5210975 it is not encumbent on the skeptic to prove his case his job is to call for evidence and there being none forthcoming
5210976 rowland has since reversed his position and retracted his earlier claims
5210977 climate is determined by latitude so climate can only change if the poles shift
5210978 latin clima zone of latitude from gk klima sloping surface of the earth from indo european klei to lean
5210979 climate from klima klimatos a slope a zone of the earth a clime from klino to bend referring to the inclination of the earth from the equator to the pole
5210980 the suns ray hits nz from the south during the summer months
5210981 the meteorological conditions including temperature precipitation and wind that characteristically prevail in a particular region
5210982 so perhaps it can be said that ice only totally melts through the thawing process when it reaches its maximum density at 4 c
5210983 all the ipcc al gore etc talk is of antarctica melting and staying melted all year around
5210984 then in 2005 the british antarctic survey released findings that 87 percent of the glaciers on the antarctic peninsula have retreated over the past 50 years
5210985 arctic sea ice is melting at a rate far quicker than predicted by
5210986 global warming has led to a new travel boom as holidaymakers embrace what tour operators call doomsday tourism the urge to see the world before its endangered parts disappear forever the arctic and antarctic the sinking islands of the pacific and the fading glories of the great barrier reef
5210987 all the ipcc al gore etc talk is of antarctica melting and staying melted all year around
5210988 where do you suppose al gores figure of a 20 ft sealevel rise came from answer antarctica ice all disappearing
5210989 the entire antarctic ice sheet holds enough water to raise global sea levels by 62 metres 203 feet
5210990 there is nothing much we can do about it and if the current rate of recession continues it is inevitable that the ice sheet will completely disintegrate within 7 000 years
5210991 the entire antarctic ice sheet holds enough water to raise global sea levels by 62 metres 203 feet

5211221 the new challenge we have is that for approximately five years the plan which is a very bad plan but is the only plan that nasa and the administration and congress have approved is to be dependent on the russian soyuz vehicle to get people to and from the international space station
5211222 and so now with the political realities with russia invading georgia we have a new wrinkle thrown in

5211230 the good news is obviously no state is better prepared or organized to deal with whatever comes this way than the state of florida
5211231 i think that would be up to first of all to john to decide whether he wants a pro choice running mate then we would have to see how the republican party would rally around it at the end of the day i think the republican party will be comfortable with whatever choice john makes

5211268 the global economy is facing a triple crunch a combination of a credit fuelled financial crisis accelerating climate change and soaring energy prices underpinned by encroaching peak oil it is increasingly clear that these three overlapping events threaten to develop into a perfect storm the like of which has not been seen since the great depression with potentially devastating consequences

5211285 celebrating diversity is not just for one day but every day we have to help each other and work together

5211310 various groups network with one another with a degree of anonymity that makes it very difficult for us they put information on the internet about how to evade law enforcement
5211311 in the more than 25 years of the animal liberation front relatively few people have been arrested and an even smaller number have been convicted
5211312 why have so few been caught according to most a l f activists preparation and reconnaissance is the key to staying safe
5211313 typically these groups do not conform to traditional hierarchical organizational structures
5211314 even if you catch someone they dont have information on the others
5211315 a lot of times they dont even know who the others are

5211335 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
5211336 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
5211337 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
5211338 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
5211339 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
5211340 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
5211341 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection
5211342 we had one that we used in a sting for school zones
5211343 hopefully well have the new one by the time school starts again
5211344 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
5211345 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
5211346 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
5211347 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
5211348 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
5211349 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
5211350 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
5211351 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
5211352 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
5211353 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
5211354 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
5211355 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
5211356 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
5211357 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
5211358 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
5211359 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
5211360 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
5211361 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
5211362 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
5211363 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
5211364 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
5211365 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
5211366 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
5211367 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
5211368 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
5211369 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
5211370 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
5211371 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
5211372 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
5211373 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
5211374 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
5211375 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
5211376 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
5211377 wir bleiben bei unserer prognose dass wir unser ergebnis aus dem vorjahr bertreffen werden
5211378 ich gehe davon aus dass sich das bisher prognostizierte wachstum von rund 6 auf 3 bis 4 prozent pro jahr einpendeln wird
5211379 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
5211380 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
5211381 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
5211382 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
5211383 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
5211384 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
5211385 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
5211386 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
5211387 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
5211388 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
5211389 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
5211390 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
5211391 because we live on the coast the red cross had us on standby so we didnt know when they were going to call us out
5211392 just when we got back home decided it was too late for them to call us out is when we got the call that we were supposed to leave
5211393 three days after the fact there is still terrible flooding many of the roads that we need to take to get to some shelters are still impassable and i heard that about 200 000 people down here are still without power or bathroom facilities
5211394 there are lots of roofs blown off houses trees are blown over and downed power lines
5211395 we just have to expect the unexpected and go where we are needed
5211396 ive been on the phone trying to get more supplies sent down here to the shelter in santa rosa
5211397 younger children seem more interested in setting short term goals for their learning in the game compared to older children who are more interested in simply playing and the actions of playing
5211398 thus younger children may show a greater need for focusing on small aspects of a given problem than older children even in a leisure based situation such as playing video games
5211399 the big picture is that there are several dimensions on which games have effects including the amount they are played the content of each game what you have to pay attention to on the screen and how you control the motions
5211400 this means that games are not good or bad but are powerful educational tools and have many effects we might not have expected they could
5211401 no charge sheet can stand against me what i did was for pakistan first pakistan before all all decisions were made with consultation all stakeholders were taken on board for all issues whether they were the military politicians bureaucrats or religious scholars
5211402 can the nation tolerate more confrontation can the nations economy take more pressure can the nation handle an impeachment process is this a wise decision i think this is not a time for individual bravado regardless of whether i win or lose impeachment the country will lose pakistan is my love my first love
5211403 even if impeachment is defeated the governments relations with the presidency will still never be fine
5211404 as a result considering this entire situation after consulting legal advisors political supporters and taking their advice i have decided to resign
5211405 my prayer is that the government curbs this down slide
5211406 today i am completely happy that i leave a vibrant media
5211407 my heart was crying concerned for the direction of the country where are we going how will the world view us
5211408 even right now our macroeconomic situation is sound we need to re rail what has been derailed
5211409 kampanyas t rkiyede internetteki eri im engelleme kararlar na kar tek ses olmak i in son s rat devam ediyor
5211410 phelps dalam kuak dada ia bakal jadi perkara terakhir yang saya mahu lihat
5211411 he then moved to a profession where he would need to learn many skills
5211412 our honoree mastered many skills all of these skills propelled him to the top of his profession including leadership communication negotiation and patience
5211413 in fact this very corporation was once a committee of the chamber of commerce
5211414 his vision of our county led to his running for mayor and his tenure as mayor has been phenomenal
5211415 its indeed an honor and a privilege to receive this honor from mitch who we all know succeeded me at the chamber and i wanted to say thank you to everybody
5211416 you know a lot of folks have done a lot of great things over the years to bring us to where we are today and this is a combination of that so thank you
5211417 i think what we can see as we look around tonight is a county that is in transition in change
5211418 i think we are entering a period now where the change and transition is becoming much more apparent
5211419 all of those things are coming together and they are having an impact on economic development
5211420 we have to refocus our economic development strategy to promote not just growth but a better quality of life for our citizens
5211421 with the many new citizens we expect to be moving into the county we need a housing stock that will accommodate variety
5211422 we need to keep our people and our industry here in the county and having a way to train them locally for a good career is one way we do that
5211423 we continue to look for companies that are going to upgrade the wage scales locally
5211424 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
5211425 ive never seen a community do what bay city has done in the past 10 years
5211426 you have value on the ground more than you spent
5211427 under the texas local government code the city has the right to approve the professionals it hires
5211428 the attorney general ruled that a contractor is a professional
5211429 in cold years the gas company earns money and in the warmer years you lose money
5211430 the board has tried to keep gas prices to the bone as much as possible
5211431 six or seven years ago we had the money to back the funding for the next year
5211432 its easy to look at last years budget and see what should have been done the hard part is not the amendment process but the upcoming budget
5211433 i get the excuse always that there is a broken truck
5211434 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
5211435 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
5211436 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
5211437 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
5211438 this is a planning took where all things are going
5211439 this is just for the culverts which is phase one of the southwest cut project and it will be paid for by the ciap grant
5211440 there has never really been anything proven that this will be good for the bay
5211441 east matagorda bay is a unique bay its a small bay system its not like galveston or any other of the larger bays
5211442 my concern is the salinity that will come in through the colorado river into that east matagorda bay
5211443 we have no idea what its going to do to the sea grasses the fish the shrimp and everything else
5211444 im really concerned not just me but the whole community because weve been known to do things that effect systems in our environment negatively and a lot of times you cant backtrack and fix them
5211445 this culvert as it stands right now will be monitored if it is detrimental to the bay it will be simple to close it in and reverse it
5211446 this is not something that is irreversible in fact the last thing that i would want to do or anyone would want to do would be to do something that would be harmful for east matagorda bay
5211447 this will help keep the mouth of the river open itll be good for drainage and i think it will be good for marine life
5211448 judge i can tell you that there are a lot of people upset at the live oak landing subdivision because they were told that they would be able to build up to the creek and they cant
5211449 ive had several calls and a contractor that came in and was supposed to have built a bunch of gazebos and decks and they cant do it because it is on the flood plain
5211450 so i dont know how far they are going to take it but its a serious problem i mean its out of our control but its happening
5211451 i just hate to see these people come in and get sold a bill of goods before anything has even been done to support it
5211452 that is just deceptive trade practices and we just need to encourage people to be diligent before they buy something
5211453 all we can do is really encourage people to use a realtor who is legally obligated to disclose the conditions of the property because i dont know how you regulate honesty

5211472 to live here to raise my family and to practice here what a blessing this is an extraordinary place
5211473 i wish that this was the election for a transportation tax or road tax theres no question about that

5211478 sicherlich gewinnt die selbstdarstellung im internet besonders bei den heranwachsenden bis mitte zwanzig an bedeutung
5211479 doch gerade diese altersgruppe ist sich nicht wirklich bewusst dass sie vermehrt unvorsichtig mit ihren pers nlichen daten umgeht
5211480 ein gro teil besch ftigt sich aber erst gar nicht mit den datenschutzbestimmungen
5211481 oder sie nennen ihre passw rter ihren freunden und surfen unbedacht im internet umher

5211505 the continuing massive industrialization in china is providing solid support to the global economy
5211506 theres been a retracement in the dollar partly on profit taking but mainly because commodities have moved back higher and commodities seem to be wagging the fx market dog
5211507 i suspect continued weakness in the euro as the figures coming out of europe are going to be poor
5211508 there has been a tug of war between negative fundamentals such as the economic slowdown and positive factors for corporate earnings such as a softer yen and fall in oil prices
5211509 im thankful to be part of it all thankful to get to the olympics and anything from here would be a bonus
5211510 but just seeing that smile and imagining the feeling he had it would be amazing to experience that

5211512 weve been setting records out there left and right on our track
5211513 were going eight riders wide going 40 mph jumping 40 foot jumps coming off a three and a half story starting hill
5211514 its something that the viewers are going to be kind of psyched about everyones ridden a bike and to see what is possible on a bmx bike nowadays is just going to have them in awe of what were doing out there
5211515 vamos a remendar el capote diciendo que es su destino
5211516 fue lo nico que atine a decir cuando vi que la supuesta uber pelea del milenio duraba solo unos segundos y el payaso que se hacia llamar protagonista no era quien resolv a el peo sino mas bien quien cagaba el panorama con su ineptitud ya que no solo le patearon el culo una vez mas sino que tuvo que venir el huevonote que cree ser samurai a terminar el trabajo debo decir que el fallo en la trama es catastr fico ya que te ricamente todo se trataba de un ardid para destruir la ciudad de nueva york con una explosi n y asi asegurar un r pido ascenso del congresista volador a la presidencia pero quien se suponia que deb a explotar era el idiota de peter o el malo y que tal si esos soplapollas no hubiesen descubierto sus poderes

5211525 mccain says heres my plan im going to drill here drill now which is something he only came up with two months ago when he started looking at polling
5211526 they say this other guy is unpatriotic or this guy likes french people thats what they said about kerry
5211527 they try to make it out like democrats arent tough enough arent macho enough its the same strategy
5211528 john mccain has never questioned senator obamas patriotism but he clearly does question senator obamas experience and judgment
5211529 paps en mams zijn zeer gelovig en hun hele leven is dan ook gewijd aan die meneer aan het kruis

5211531 using headphones and a monitor was the old school way of doing it its now done by viewing a screen side note
5211532 one day i found myself sitting in a physics class trying to understand how to calculate the instantaneous acceleration of some particle inside the nucleus of the atom which particle may or may not even exist and i didnt even care if it existed or not because all this horsefeathers had nothing to do with engines or anything else that i cared about even in the slightest teensy bit
5211533 just to know that you were going to a hard top track was a thought that acted like a supercharger on the jets of that mental carburetor called the brain
5211534 so tell me about bakersfield and this search for infinity
5211535 the search begins in bakersfield at the us fuel and gas championships the smokers meet the drag strip is out in the orange groves just north of bakersfield
5211536 i found it in a dumpster outside the library at glendale community college
5211537 is every vestige of hot rodding culture going to be trashed in some sort of do gooder save the planet purge
5211538 probably you should read this book sometime before they do it proves that even in 1960 some folks knew that the real r amp d was going down in atom smashers and not at the drag strip
5211539 atom smashing sounds like great work if you can get a government grant which not even you can get nowadays eh
5211540 look if our government has one purpose it is to cut checks to the people who are trying to separate the bay leaves from the broth in the great cosmic primordial soup
5211541 you know there is a government program to destroy these things so an oil company can get particle emission credits
5211542 they pay folks 500 bucks to get non operational beaters off of their front lawn figure how much carbon dioxide the vehicle would have contributed to the smog theoretically and then allow the oil company that much more leeway with pollution from their refineries remove the filters and stoke the furnace pardon the pun but its an utter shell game
5211543 no matter how decrepit the vehicle the thought of their imminent destruction always made me well up
5211544 look besides the fact that i needed the cash i took the job to get next to the contours of those elegant machines okay
5211545 there is a certain existential beauty in their corrugation and decay as they rust and rot in the excruciating heat of a summer in the forgotten wastelands of the san fernando valley everything is temporary even triumphs of engineering and art even triumphs of the intellect
5211546 they told me to load up a trashed 57 pontiac star chief on to my forks and take it out to get crushed i couldnt the tailfins alone were entirely too majestic i just refused to be an accessory to its destruction so i hid it out by the pacers and gremlins in the amc section nobody goes there except the and when i say this i mean it with respect the kookiest of car collectors you know the type the ones who think the push buttons for the transmission were a neat idea lupe garou phhewwww
5211547 so while i was kicking back one of the other fork operators saw the tailfins through the glass bubble of a pacer and reported it to the dispatcher
5211548 christ they were pissed off yelling at me in both spanish and english i told them to fuck off and that this was pacoima not nuremberg
5211549 you need to get the radiator re cored on this beast that might let it run cooler
5211550 these things came out of the factory running hot ive tried everything re coring the radiator cleaning the water passages a bigger fan a smaller fan nothing works this chunk of detroit steel is always going to run hotter than a blowtorch
5211551 lets pretend this is a rocket car and we are monitoring the thrust
5211552 we can just pretend that we have a hot water rocket engine under the hood not unlike the neptune rocket car that walt arfons ran back in 66
5211553 they ran it once on an air strip in akron ohio
5211554 you might want to find a more positive example sir
5211555 hey man you gotta believe walt arfons was onto something
5211556 it crashed because of aerodynamic issues and a nasty crosswind nothing related to thrust
5211557 it was one of those great ideas that only made one run down the drag strip
5211558 if it only made one run dont you think that by definition it would be a bad idea
5211559 i figured that if the car went half as fast as his mouth i was in trouble
5211560 he even tests that jet engine in the backyard you cant conceive of it unless youve seen him do it at first hed strap it to two big trees he burned a 60 foot channel in his woods that way and he blew a chicken house right off the face of the earth hes the coolest guy ive ever seen in my life when hes got that engine going on afterburner and im 50 feet away im scared to death that its going to blow to pieces they do sometimes you know and hes right alongside it making adjustments
5211561 you know i wont be able to pull a pair of cylinder heads for you now
5211562 he said thats a classified engine youre not allowed to have it
5211563 and i said well heres my piece of paper receipt i bought it after you threw it away i said you cant have it two years later they declassified it
5211564 i knew a man who worked at wright patterson afb and he got me the tool i needed to fix it he would sign it out and drop it by the fence for me hed check it out in the morning and id get it back before he had to turn it in that evening i had to do that to take it apart and i had to do that to put it together the blades were all damaged so i just removed every third one never did balance the thing i just put it back together that way and it ran fine it had all the power i needed
5211565 he was armed with the biggest gun in town once he got that j79
5211566 the professional hot rodders such as the petersen magazine syndicate hot rod magazine and many others and the national hot rod association have gone to great lengths to obliterate the memory of the gamey hot rod days and they try to give everybody in the field transfusions of halazone so that the public will look at hot rodders as nice boys with short sleeved sport shirts just back from the laundry and a chemistry set such an interesting hobby
5211567 yeah ill get to that really though you gotta take the taxonomy of this whole
5211568 fbi agents descended on a texas auto racing track last month looking for evidence that timothy mcveigh bought a large quantity of powerful racing fuel before the oklahoma city bombing abc reported thursday night
5211569 employees of vp racing fuels told the fbi that a man resembling mcveigh in 1994 paid 2 700 cash in texas for nitromethane abc said
5211570 the chemical is an accelerant the government now believes may have been used to detonate the bomb that killed 168 people
5211571 a girl must live by the light in her soul the world is spinning out of control
5211572 thats what i love about proper honky tonk bz three or four chords and no bullshit there is some greater existential truth in the simplest lyric nothing convoluted straight to the point like a drag race or a ray of light
5211573 do you really think a country singer knows anything about the path to the truth
5211574 is that a ray of light knows the correct path to minimize the elapsed time between point a and point b
5211575 i still think this song is right bz shes saying if you follow the light in your soul you too will know how to minimize time
5211576 ahh but is minimizing time actually maximizing time by minimizing time do you gain a glimpse into the infinite and the eternal
5211577 i dont know what is infinite but i do know what is finite what is finite is our time on this planet
5211578 life is not only finite it is also rather mundane and fucked up we find a way to get passionate about things like these men who dedicate their lives to conquering the land speed record as a means of not only getting through life but of getting a glimpse into infinity
5211579 there are infinite points in spacetime from the big bang until the big crunch and the constant tug of war between gravity dark matter and einsteins cosmological constant which has created events moments in spacetime have definite signatures definite markers
5211580 there is a point where a wave becomes a particle and that point can be quantified beyond that there are potentially infinite sub particles or strings that vibrate and resonate within each particle it is mind boggling how infinitely small you can slice this stuff upon which everything jet cars beer cans and the radio waves that carry the sound of country singers is built on
5211581 don garlits ego could not stand to see another man design a car that was successful
5211582 such and such won their first top fuel title after the provisional points leader was killed in action at indianapolis
5211583 the worlds fastest car if you cant buy it why should you care
5211584 zipping over a desert track no matter how fast has lost much of its heroic aura
5211585 but then pursuing land speed records has always been a fringe activity at best the drivers made the record books but they rarely gained lasting fame how many people even know what the current record is asks road amp track senior editor joe rusz i dont and im in the business
5211586 thats not to say we couldnt be interested but it would take a fundamental shift in the zeitgeist weve had our share of space shuttles and stealth fighters not to mention an unrelenting bombardment of statistical trivia from box office grosses to record high temperatures in the daily media too speed itself has become such a part of life that it would be nice if someone instead came up with a way to slow things down the fastest car whats the rush
5211587 a car equipped with a surplus jet engine seems crude compared to the infinitely swift power of a pentium computer chip
5211588 there is a moment in each day that satan cannot find
5211589 if the doors of perception were cleansed every thing would appear to man as it is infinite
5211590 there is a moment in each day that satan cannot find
5211591 time machine for research on rejuvenation anti gravity and time travel
5211592 derives from a steam engine built in 1705 it was the first engine to use a crankshaft to convert reciprocal motion into rotary motion and pass it along through various gearboxes and transfer devices
5211593 since high torque is inherent in my three cycle engine design the engine would be placed right next to the wheel with no gear reduction except for a reverser this engine is very compact shaped like a wheel and no wider than a standard auto wheel it leaves a lot of space inside a car for other things
5211594 you know the prime engineer on the infinity car became a systems engineer for the particle accelerators and atom smashers in berkeley
5211595 he may not set the land speed record but he was instrumental in allowing some physicist or another to claim the nobel prize
5211596 its a long way from the salts of bonneville to the king of sweden
5211597 leasher was as go cat wild with his right foot as gotelli was with his nitro percentage
5211598 when he climbed into that jet car it was like space age america was a tiger that leasher grabbed by the tail
5211599 yeah none of this modern county music that sounds like it was recorded at a super collider in switzerland
5211600 i thought we were going to fix the headlights there
5211601 i dont know man i kind of like traveling like this
5211602 yes it is like the parting of the red seas whatever try to keep it under 90 after all we are driving in the dark
5211603 if i go that slow nobody will believe its an emergency
5211604 he used to work for me he drove my trucks he was getting ready to go back home to wichita some guy said why dont you give this guy a chance to drive your car i said sure go ahead he drove the car and the first meet we were in we won it
5211605 so tell me about the top eliminator run in 62
5211606 it was a misunderstanding we should have won the race they said that we fouled we pulled up at the starting line and the front wheels went over the line so we pulled em back and prudhomme was still coming down he hadnt even been there yet and they disqualified us
5211607 when he prudhomme come he rolled the lights and they said shut if off about a half hour later they said youre disqualified because you went over the line first it was a bunch of shit
5211608 youve had a lot of crackerjack drivers in your career how would you rate leasher
5211609 he was one of the best drivers i had he knew if the car needed some weight here or weight there really sharp guy
5211610 how did you feel about him driving jet cars after he quit driving for you
5211611 i tried to talk him out of driving that big coupe he wanted to go 500 mph he didnt make it i didnt want him to go but he went anyway
5211612 so you were pretty hurt when you heard he was killed in the
5211613 he said im going to drive that car up there at bonneville
5211614 he was saving his money so he could buy a roundy round car
5211615 leaser l e a s e r some made a mistake it dont make no difference anyhow he was a good driver nobody could beat him
5211616 prudhomme is a big asshole that is all he is he goes around bragging that he beat us he didnt beat us i got no use for the guy they didnt let us run
5211617 after they disqualified us down there we were all down at the starting line
5211618 glenn leasher was a hot rod buddy of mine arthur arfons explained
5211619 jeri told me once that anybody who had any complaints about this country should try living in a dictatorship then under the nazis and then the communists he told me that ever since he came to this country he went out side every morning when he woke up and kissed the ground he said we dont appreciate what weve got
5211620 still have my fremont 132 mph card from that pass
5211621 lock up your children corral the animals or pay the man at the ticket booth you cant have it both ways
5211622 you got a registered letter i dont normally do this but i had to open it its from the don garlits museum
5211623 okay this car is running in the 6s were running in the 8s
5211624 you did okay driving my fuel dragster do you want to drive the
5211625 oh shit we just sold our two best dates of the year
5211626 get these people back here or im burning the tower down
5211627 hey you want to help me pack a chute do you want to pump the kerosene
5211628 the skies were black with clouds and the season was late so any storm represented the official end to the runs for the year gary made a successful first run the car was turned and fueled for the return through the flying mile it was a moment of should he or not the timers gave gary the radio call that the decision to go or not was his he sat in silence he was always sort of spiritual suddenly the clouds parted and a ray of sun pierced the windshield garys words were thats a sign from god and he lit the match for the record setting run
5211629 we actually built the english leather rocket car as a prototype test vehicle to develop a hypergolic rocket system for a land speed car we ran that engine on unsymmetrical dimethyl hydrazine and nitrogen tetraoxide for an oxidizer we were able to order it at will trw was able to vouch for us that we were not a bunch of dingbats out there in 1974 all of that was outlawed
5211630 we changed the design of the car to four peroxide thrusters because they had not yet restricted hydrogen peroxide in any way
5211631 after we made the switch all of a sudden you couldnt manufacture or sell peroxide in any concentrations higher than 70 percent and 70 percent is a lousy rocket fuel at that point the entire rocket powered land speed vehicle was trashed
5211632 gary was very upset when the car was sold because he wanted to attempt a sound barrier run with the car
5211633 i cant even describe how many hours we spent talking about where the air goes under the car
5211634 gary was trying to figure out how to stop the new car going supersonic also
5211635 the problems are no air for chutes and brakes wont work over 400mph
5211636 garys feelings about the car being sold was this the car was owned by the natural gas association as a publicity stunt
5211637 gary even pursued contacting the new car owner about another run
5211638 gary then began trying to raise sponsors for a new car hed named
5211639 one of the reasons gary was chosen to drive the car was because his full time job was he worked for rockwell international in downey california as a test astronaut
5211640 as far as garys life being cut short while we all miss him lots few of us could picture him dying an old man
5211641 while setting the lsr made gary infamous many of his friends consider it a high point in his life that made the rest of his life chasing a dream
5211642 gary had one of his hands cut off to the outside skin one leg was behind his head and one was wrapped around the steering wheel that leg became the problem while his hand was re attached and the leg behind him was dislocated the surgeons wanted to remove the other leg as it was nothing but shattered bone from the ankle gary would not let them remove the leg so they inserted a long rod to replace the bone he adapted to the handicap but spent about a year trying to get rid of gangrene
5211643 man is something that must be overcome and for that reason you must love your virtues for you perish by them
5211644 i do know if you spilled the straight stuff in the trunk of the tow car you had instant fire had first hand experience with that one i really think there were more guys running it than were willing to admit it
5211645 it didnt take the talmud to see that folks would pay good money to see death defying displays of horsepower and cockpit acumen at their local drag strip jet and rocket dragsters became a way to subvert the system and ensure that the racers were in the loop in a fiduciary sense it was a means for hot rodders to be paid in full
5211646 nhra was founded in response to a demand among thousands of hot rodders in all parts of the country to organize a legitimate purely american motorsport and nhra under wally parks guidance did just that were all very proud of 50 years of achievements
5211647 if youre so fond of airplane engines race em the air in airplanes where they belong yes drag racing is about automotive engines and as long as i have any say over it the sport will stay that way
5211648 everybody knows that anything under 70 percent hydrogen peroxide makes for a nearly useless rocket fuel
5211649 we used to dilute it with water so we could make more steam id put vicky in the stands while we made a run after the car run if she said she couldnt see the person next to her we considered the run a success regardless of the speed
5211650 i got to see a rocket car run and got to studyin em and stuff i thought them things cant tear up hardly yknow we got to make money somehow enough money to get a nitro funny car thats what i always wanted so we ran a lot of match races with that rocket car the first year we ran the hydrogen peroxide car it would cost me 250 a run for fuel when we quit four years later it would cost 1200 a run the last year we ran i bought more hydrogen peroxide from fmc food machinery corporation the manufacturer and distributor than the u s government they had doubled the price basically that put us out of business it was only good for a flower pot so i gave it away and took a tax write off
5211651 i was actually going to try to inject a little nitro in it to increase the specific impulse on it nhra wouldnt let ya i cant blame them it would have made it a little more unstable
5211652 supposedly when i lifted off the throttle that was one fuel shut off device and when i popped the chute it was supposedly another one
5211653 he had the brake handle rigged with a brass knuckles type grip a push brake so his hand would stay on the brake should he black out when the car ran out of fuel which it had been calculated to do at just past the 1 8th mile then the deceleration would move his arm and brake handle forward applying the brakes and also releasing the chutes which were attached to the brake handle in some manner thus slowing the car until he regained consciousness
5211654 we always felt the fans wasnt gettin their moneys worth so we rigged up a little act to go along with the rocket car
5211655 wed tell the ambulance drivers to be ready because we had something special to race against the rocket car wed put my brother in the other lane with a firesuit on strap a fire extinguisher on his back like he was roger ramjet it wasnt nuthin but baking soda packed into the extinguisher y know and wed line him up against the rocket the light would go green and the rocket would take off and my brother would pull the lever on the fire extinguisher and all that pressurized powder would begin spraying all over and my brother would begin runnin around in circles hed spin around like he was out of control then bang into the guardrail and flip over it the ambulance would come down from the finish line with the bubblegum machines on and the siren blaring that was nuttier than the rocket
5211656 its what you do everyday that counts and not what you do one day
5211657 if you excercize and eat right everyday then one day of ingulgence isnt going to hurt you
5211658 may i suggest if there are five blokes to every girl we should find out where there are beauty disadvantaged women and ask them to proceed to mount isa
5211659 quite often you will see walking down the street a lass who is not so attractive with a wide smile on her face
5211660 whether it is recollection of something previous or anticipation for the next evening there is a degree of happiness
5211661 theres a lot of anger circulating among the community at the moment a lot of passionate anger
5211662 weve got a saying up here that the odds are good but the goods are odd
5211663 the canadian content stuff is frequently at the top of the titles available
5211664 as these are men who desperately want to be in adult movies themselves specifically real productions adult movies they will be very interested in watching a network featuring these movies
5211665 as you get to the stage where the stakes go up if were going to report somebody publicly thats a big thing
5211666 if we dont have statutory protection my board is legitimately worried that as we get to these higher levels where the consequences are bigger for the audit firms that we will be tied down endlessly in law suits because there isnt statutory protection for cpab for directors for officers
5211667 were now in the smaller group of firms not the big guys the smaller guys were getting repeat offenders
5211668 we need to ratchet up the consequences thats normally how a regulator would work well our ability to ratchet up the consequences may be constrained because of this
5211669 its not a snazzy top of the line kind of thing its important that it get done and it just takes a long long time to handle that kind of change in our system
5211670 after consultations with legal advisers and close political supporters and on their advice im taking the decision of resigning
5211671 my resignation will go to the speaker of the national assembly today
5211672 i dont want anything from anybody i have no interest i leave my future in the hands of the nation and people
5211673 we expect to see operational efficiencies that will lead to reduced costs
5211674 we also think that employees will appreciate four days of travel to work rather than five
5211675 the biggest impetus was energy costs trying to be more energy efficient and the high cost of gas
5211676 but it readily became apparent that it really isnt just a crisis management initiative i think this is a long term strategy for doing business
5211677 out of a manufacturing plant walking on cement being around that environment so its a much healthier choice
5211678 we are lawyers and we find ways to interpret the law to the benefit of our clients unfortunately the lack of clarity in the conflicts regime has led to a growth industry in conflict challenges
5211679 if you take a highly specialized area such as competition where a large transaction is taking place it is not only conceivable but has happened that virtually every experienced competition lawyer is conflicted out
5211680 weve found it to be the same case in maritime law in aboriginal law in family law
5211681 there is a strategy out there among clients to make an appointment for legal advice with every experienced family lawyer within a reasonable distance to conflict out their spouse from retaining their counsel of choice
5211682 carried to its ultimate conclusion i would have to pick up stakes and move every five years it is a problem that is felt acutely right across canada
5211683 the duty to protect the confidentiality of client information is indisputable
5211684 it is the inflexible approach to assessing whether or not the duty has been breached that is the source of our concerns
5211685 the duty of confidentiality endures and does not end when a retainer has been completed
5211686 the duty of loyalty on the other hand ends when the retainer ends with the exception of a restriction not to attack the very legal work done for a client or effectively change sides in a matter that is central to the former retainer
5211687 one might more accurately say clarifying we are very clear in our recommendations that a lawyer should not act in a circumstance where there is a substantial risk of adverse effect on a client
5211688 my hurdling on the night was not good and i did not have the same energy or strength that i felt in the qualifying heat
5211689 i am focussing on my own performances and i know that i have a big task ahead
5211690 i tried to block it all out on the day and i gave as good a performance as i was capable of in the circumstances
5211691 i believe that i can trace my injury problem back to having to throw from some very rough surfaces all year in dublin and dunboyne
5211692 i will now have to look at the possibility of training from home in kilkenny for next year

5211724 they are one of the biggest packs in the world and that in itself is a challenge
5211725 theres cj van der linde and i think the beast tendai mtawarira will be playing so thats going to be a big battle for us and how we can step up and improve

5211727 they are passionate at home and theyve got passionate supporters so if we get on top of them early then that will set us up for a good game

5211732 technically the all blacks are probably the best scrummaging team in the world at the moment the springboks are right up there
5211733 we are told we are being mean all the time but what nobody mentions is why the drugs are so expensive
5211734 pharmaceutical companies have enjoyed double digit growth year on year and they are out to sustain that not least because their senior managements earnings are related to the share price its not in their interests to take less profit personally as well as from the point of view of the business all these perverse incentives drive the price up
5211735 has been left to its own devices for too long
5211736 the department of health has for too long optimistically assumed that the interests of health and of the industry are as one this may reflect the fact that the department sponsors the industry as well as looking after health
5211737 the most immediately worrying consequence of the problems described above is the unsafe use of drugs over prescription of the cox 2 inhibitors vioxx and celebrex has been linked to thousands of deaths and many more cases of heart failure these cases illustrate a series of failures manufacturers are known to have suppressed certain trials for these drugs in the us and may have done the same in the uk in addition there were inadequacies in the licensing and post marketing surveillance procedures and excessive promotion of the drugs to doctors

5211749 words words words ugh this play is so fucking slow ugh ugh ugh
5211750 we dont want to discourage companies from making legitimate claims but want to reinforce the fact that they have an obligation not to mislead
5211751 ambiguous or exaggerated claims risk generating scepticism and undermine the genuine initiatives that many businesses including shell are taking to be greener
5211752 that was clearly a misleading claim its those sort of things we have wanted to raise concern about
5211753 the reason we got interested in this is that the number of complaints from on the whole ordinary members of the public about environmental claims for products and services has been going up and up i suspect thats largely because environmental concern is rising generally and so companies are using the environmental angle to put their case forward
5211754 the raison detre for the asa is that companies can make the best possible claims for their product but not mislead people
5211755 on quite a number of these issues there is very little official government or national guidance it would help us enormously if things were clearer at national level
5211756 the green claims points can be included in that revision
5211757 but it wont stop there it will have to be continually looked at because this is a fast moving area
5211758 these complaints are coming from shoppers ordinary people the complaints are virtually all about misleading and inaccurate ads not taste and decency issues this is bread and butter stuff for the asa
5211759 what we dont have is any agreement for advertising on companies own websites if its a direct email to you from a company say with an offer it is covered but if you click into a company website thats not covered
5211760 on the whole nowadays a company which has a marketing department has executives who know the rules in most cases they are using advertising agencies who know the codes but the website may be being done by someone else getting the people who draw up website content to think about codes may be the way forward the world of advertising needs to recognise there is an issue and needs to address it
5211761 if that is the case there will have to be some sort of adjudication process on complaints it would be a major expansion of work and we would need income to resource that
5211762 there are a few campaigning groups who are arguing that the rules are not strict enough and there are calls for pre 9pm bans on all advertisements for these foods regardless of the programme
5211763 my own personal view is that would be an overreaction
5211764 my view currently is lets see what the consultation provides on this id say that in five years time the way people watch tv may have changed dramatically and the impact of specific advertising slots may have reduced to such an extent it becomes difficult to finance programmes it might have to be through product placement simply ruling it out im not sure im not wanting to take a definitive view at this stage
5211765 nine out of 10 its easy to underestimate the scale of the task it faced there are moments when they need to pay slightly more attention to the content side of their work than the purely economic and competition side but thats a minor quibble
5211766 im convinced by the case channel 4 is making for their need for assistance in some years time they dont need it now i believe they are a very important part of the broadcasting landscape we must look seriously at where that help could come from
5211767 top slicing is not an option i would rule out completely if i was secretary of state and i had 100m of licence fee money to deploy with public service broadcasting values in mind would i spend it on bbc3 or would i spend it on helping channel 4 i think thats a very difficult question for the bbc to answer
5211768 la coincidencia de la it por accidente o enfermedad profesional con el tiempo de vacaciones anuales preestablecido no atribuye al trabajador derecho a un nuevo se alamiento individual ya que la superposici n de esta situaci n con el tiempo de vacaciones constituye una manifestaci n del caso fortuito regulado en el c digo civil en el art culo 1105 cuyas consecuencias han de recaer en quienes reciben fortuitamente pues si es bien cierto que el empresario est obligado a conceder vacaciones pero no puede garantizar que stas se disfruten con buena salud
5211769 como regla general los periodos de suspensi n del contrato por enfermedad o accidente no pueden ser imputados a las vacaciones este periodo de suspensi n del contrato se reputa como servicios efectivos entendiendo que la situaci n de incapacidad temporal coincidente en todo o en parte con las fechas validamente previstas de vacaciones no supone interrumpirlas con el consiguiente derecho a disfrutarlas una vez conseguida el alta m dica salvo que en una norma convenio colectivo o el contrato prevea otra cosa
5211770 hoy where have you bee n ba hindi ka na umuuwi sa flat
5211771 rather than getting any encouragement for the initiative we received several nasty comments
5211772 its clear that most of our shoppers are not ready to change their habits and are especially not ready to pay for plastic bags
5211773 sixty seven per cent of the respondents would rather use free plastic bags of reduced quality so we have decided to introduce thinner and lesser quality plastic bags and continue educating our customers through our various promotional campaigns
5211774 there is a major lack of awareness about the environmental damages caused by plastic bags in the kingdom
5211775 in dubai we were able to introduce the new scheme from day one
5211776 although in bahrain we gave our customers four months to get used to the idea and offered reusable jute bags of two sizes for just 500 fils and 800 fils we dont think they are ready for it
5211777 these jute bags are a non profit venture introduced by the company to genuinely work towards protecting the environment we wanted to discourage the use of plastic bags
5211778 we did consider introducing bio degradable plastics but they are far too expensive and ultimately the cost will only get passed on to the customer we were also aware that everything will not fit in the jute bags and were happy to provide plastic bags for carrying large items

5211783 were gearing up for the chase im feeling stronger than ever were here to win championships thats what were shooting for
5211784 the greatest part is we didnt give up more bonus points to kyle
5211785 hes just so strong every time i win and he finishes second thats really a 20 point spread for us thats what we have to keep doing is to try and win the next three events and go into this chase on even ground
5211786 he has been all year yeah its a 20 point swing weve got to live with it hopefully we can make it up someplace else
5211787 my guys did an unbelievable job getting me off pit road
5211788 what were doing here is a little bit of practicing for the chase and trying to get those 10 points to catch that 18 car did a great job the pit crew did a great job
5211789 it just came down to when he beat us off of pit road
5211790 that was it for us we just didnt quite have the car capable enough of being able to beat those guys we were good on that one run that one set of tires but that was pretty much what we had

5211845 even tim may the representative of the international players federation has acknowledged our security plan is the best ever
5211846 only some of these players are grumbling and i dont think the concerns they have about the security in pakistan is based on sense reasoning or logic
5211847 it is an emotive reaction and i see it as emotional pressure being put on the icc and us but there is no way the icc or boards will accept this and the tournament will be held in pakistan as scheduled
5211848 all their fears are based on perception and not reality the reality is that we have done everything possible to make security arrangements foolproof and we have done everything to satisfy the icc and its member boards

5211877 the knowledge that you have emerged wiser and stronger from setbacks means that you are ever after secure in your ability to survive you will never truly know yourself or the strength of your relationships until both have been tested by adversity such knowledge is a true gift for all that it is painfully won and it has been worth more to me than any qualification i ever earned
5211878 given a time machine or a time turner i would tell my 21 year old self that personal happiness lies in knowing that life is not a check list of acquisition or achievement your qualifications your cv are not your life though you will meet many people of my age and older who confuse the two life is difficult and complicated and beyond anyones total control and the humility to know that will enable you to survive its vicissitudes

5211880 unlike any other creature on this planet humans can learn and understand without having experienced they can think themselves into other peoples minds imagine themselves into other peoples places
5211881 many prefer not to exercise their imaginations at all they choose to remain comfortably within the bounds of their own experience never troubling to wonder how it would feel to have been born other than they are they can refuse to hear screams or to peer inside cages they can close their minds and hearts to any suffering that does not touch them personally they can refuse to know
5211882 i might be tempted to envy people who can live that way except that i do not think they have any fewer nightmares than i do choosing to live in narrow spaces can lead to a form of mental agoraphobia and that brings its own terrors i think the wilfully unimaginative see more monsters they are often more afraid

5212036 pastoralists ability to adapt cannot be realized without government support and investment
5212037 all too often the direct economic value generated by pastoralists is not retained in their communities and the indirect value is un rewarded and even unacknowledged by decision makers
5212038 whether increasing climate change will see a worsening of their current situation or whether pastoralists will be able to adapt and even take advantage of the opportunities it may bring will depend on how these environmental and developmental challenges are tackled by both national governments and international donors and the extent to which pastoralists themselves are involved in the process
5212039 pastoralists make a significant contribution to the gross domestic product gdp in many east african countries provides majority of the meat consumed and provides a livelihood for tens of millions of people who live in asals they have been adapting to climate variability for millennia and their adaptability ought to enable them to cope with this growing challenge however their adaptability cannot be realized without government support and investment
5212040 cash payments in place of food aid will enable the members of pastoralist communities to meet their basic needs in terms of food health care and education cash transfers when combined with other suitable interventions have the potential to empower pastoralists and ex pastoralists to make their own investment choices for example a household might choose between restocking themselves with livestock investing in alternative livelihoods such as fishing or experimenting with more cultivation communities must be at the heart of efforts to build their resilience to climate change because adaptation is inherently local it will only work if local people are leading the process
5212041 it is exceptional the degree to which the militarys currently relying on such contractors
5212042 were of a much smaller scale than what we are seeing in iraq
5212043 the cost of having an army contingent provide the same services as blackwater appears to be roughly the same as the cost of the contract itself
5212044 one of the key questions surrounding the governments escalating use of military contractors is actually not whether they save the government client money or not rather the crucial question that should be asked at the onset of any potential outsourcing is simple should the task be done by a private company in the first place
5212045 i had to do a double take and reread it to make sure i understood what was happening
5212046 as far as the pilots and the west gulf proposal all i can say at this time is theres no need for pilots to take any action on the proposal and we have no further comment
5212047 the pilots showed great flexibility and initiative to handle unique traffic needs
5212048 it is very gratifying to me that west gulf was proactive in trying to keep rates competitive and fair

5212058 we have a very good team in all aspects of the game
5212059 we can play defense hit and pitch and our bullpen is very good i think were doing a good job of bringing the same effort level every day
5212060 every time we come here we get some crazy games
5212061 we start out good with the uribe home run and we took advantage of the guy not throwing strikes he was all over the place and when he tried to find the plate we didnt miss them

5212068 i was very aggressive throwing the first pitch for strikes
5212069 that allowed me to go out there for the ninth i was just doing my job
5212070 without question this was his best outing of the year it probably was the second best outing ive ever seen him throw after the nlcs playoff game in 2005
5212071 every one of us on the starting staff tries to put up good innings and quality starts and hope for the best
5212072 we have been able to do that but unfortunately it hasnt gone my way thats baseball
5212073 he was adamant about going back out there which is always a good thing
5212074 he would not have withdrawn unless the pain was intolerable
5212075 i am extremely disappointed and i think he may have wanted to win too much and could have caved under the pressure

5212080 i dont want to be the vice president i am not going to be the nominee
5212081 the last time i checked the vice president is not an independent voice he echoes the position of the president of the united states
5212082 if youre unwilling or unable to do that then i think you should defer to someone else
5212083 i hate to disappoint you but nothing to report today

5212087 may i tell you the truth what you are teaching us is not going to be of help to us
5212088 do you think that what you have taught us here will be of any use to me then
5212089 the russian general vyacheslav borisov promised last night to start the pullout at 10 a m but so far there is no sign

5212135 we are both looking forward to turning our attention and blogging energies towards the community outside microsoft
5212136 the audience of enthusiasts bloggers and those that are the most passionate about windows represent the folks we are dedicating this blog to with this blog were opening up a two way discussion about how we are making windows 7 windows has all the challenges of every large scale software project picking features designing them developing them and delivering them with high quality windows has an added challenge of doing so for an extraordinarily diverse set of customers as a team and as individuals on the team we continue to be humbled by this responsibility we strongly believe that success for windows 7 includes an open and honest and two way discussion about how we balance all of these interests and deliver software on the scale of windows we promise and will deliver such a dialog with this blog planning a product like windows involves systematic learning from customers of all types in terms of planning the release weve been working with a wide variety of customers and partners pc makers hardware developers enterprise customers developers and more since the start of the project we also continue our broad consumer learning through telemetry customer experience improvement program usability studies and more one area this blog will soon explore is all the different ways we learn from customers and the marketplace that inform the release we have two significant events for developers and the overall ecosystem around windows this fall the professional developers conference winhec the following week both represent the first venues where we will provide in depth technical information about windows 7 this blog will provide context over the next 2 months with regular posts about the behind the scenes development of the release and continue through the release of the product
5212137 in leading up to this blog we have seen a lot of discussion in blogs about what microsoft might be trying to accomplish by maintaining a little bit more control over the communication around windows 7 some might say that this is a significant understatement

5212144 zain is interested in operating in south africa if an additional mobile licence is offered by the south african authorities and subject to us attaining such a licence
5212145 this is a viral campaign with people saying dont support vodacom the black empowerment deal is racist because white people cant participate if people want to be racist to that degree its a war we cant win
5212146 it is a great sadness to read that the proposed empowerment deal will only be to the benefit of all black sa citizens
5212147 personally i find this to be blatant discrimination and totally unfair to your loyal white customer base
5212148 to blatantly exclude white citizens is a hugely unfair decision
5212149 vodacom sells products to businesses government and groups which require the presentation of acceptable empowerment credentials
5212150 we can only invite black people and black groups to participate
5212151 there are always disgruntled people we got some e mails and a number of phone calls
5212152 some were genuinely unhappy because they had been excluded and they felt we have had enough time to change things around in the country so everybody should be entitled now
5212153 a couple were hardliners we spoke to them very gently to explain that this is the new sa and we are planning to make a meaningful contribution in redressing the past
5212154 we had overwhelming support for the deal from all levels of the community
5212155 these offers are only for black people so it is racially exclusive but its mandated by law the companies are doing deals to meet the legal requirements
5212156 they dont even think about empowerment until it affects them directly and releases their resentments its understandable because people have been customers for years and believe they should also be given an opportunity to buy shares
5212157 but thats not the point its black empowerment and thats about empowering black people
5212158 in the end these companies stand and fall by their services and their prices obviously vodacom doesnt want to lose any customers and its white customers probably have money but it is forced to do a deal and by offering shares to the black public it is doing it in the most participative way possible at least it is trying to spread the shares around as much as possible

5212239 i would come out of the hospital and immediately stop eating again because i would be put back in the same environment that triggered it
5212240 as we found out with her illness youre afraid to talk about it and open up about things

5212242 if we would have had help as a family i think it would have made a big difference

5212248 his life was changing and i knew i needed to do something to alter my life as well i didnt want him to graduate from high school and me to still be the same
5212249 i had struggled with weight watchers and nutrisystem i would lose a little and then gain it back the more i gained the worse my arthritis got the worse my esophageal reflux got and my broken foot was not healing
5212250 the anticipation of what was to come kept me going
5212251 when you get past that and you get to eat cottage cheese 4 ounces at a time thats your meal for a few weeks and usually you dont eat all of it
5212252 if you dont get into a formal exercise program it can be a big issue
5212253 i met mike aiello a trainer and told him my story he designed a program for me and now i work out in a class doing cardio and strength training
5212254 since january i have tightened up considerably dropped another 55 pounds and lost many inches
5212255 they tell you to expect it to take 18 months to two years to lose all the weight
5212256 i eat healthy organic nutritious food nothing with more than seven grams of sugar nothing with high fat content and nothing high in carbohydrates
5212257 before amp after living and eating well after weight loss surgery
5212258 i dont deny myself anything but ill make do with just a taste

5212260 a month ago my son picked me up at work and zack said he had to look at me three times before he realized it really was me
5212261 after the surgery you look in the mirror and emotionally you still see the fat person slowly that begins to change
5212262 now i look in the mirror and realize i really have done this
5212263 i am so glad i had the surgery im more confident and i want to do the girly things wear heels and try a new hairstyle

5212281 emergency drugs are out of stock and the doctors are providing sample drugs to patients or attendants are advised to buy medicines from the market however due to shutdown and shortage of drugs in the market they have to return empty handed

5212286 limiting overtime does have an effect on the staffing capacity for the health care organisation
5212287 the fundamental issue is the impact on patient care under the enterprise bargaining agreement if staffing levels are not met one of the mechanisms to address that is to reduce services
5212288 some nurses are doing several overtime shifts a week in addition to their normal hours potentially putting both their health and patient care at risk
5212289 we will be negotiating with the anf for a safer situation where the amount of overtime individual nurses can do is capped over a set period
5212290 this latest move is designed to cut down the capacity for this hospital to function
5212291 its all part of the agenda to reduce the services so it becomes just a drug and alcohol facility with minimal facilities for mental health

5212297 when we took alone in the dark in 2001 it was to renew the franchise with names characters we tried to put it in a modern base and modernise it a little bit
5212298 now i think that with this franchise if atari wants to do something further it has to be a major step towards other things perhaps other platforms other game systems other gameplay
5212299 alone in the dark has this chance to have this fantastic title they have to work with that perhaps to be a little purer about it and move away from what has become the classical survival horror game with resident evil biohazard and let it be alone in the dark
5212300 when you forget that theres been four or five instalments in the franchise you can do something fantastic with it
5212301 he was the symbol of china at the olympics this event was the biggest competition at the games for the chinese people
5212302 it hurts the hearts of the people his gold medal was so important to china
5212303 maybe there was too much pressure on him from china and that affected his performance
5212304 after you won your gold medal four years ago you got so proud and haughty and you were convinced you were special
5212305 today you dropped out with a foot injury is that a real excuse youre nothing but a coward without the courage to face reality and accept failure
5212306 if he had filmed a few less coca cola commercials and gone to more competitions
5212307 we have to give him our full understanding lets give him some time and a quiet room to calm down and recover

5212316 my mentor who i have known for nine years and never opened up to he basically came to my house
5212317 i was in my room talking to people and thinking they were very concerned i was on the edge things werent going well i felt i must open up before its too late
5212318 i wont say that i contemplated suicide but i had some very in my mind unrealistic thoughts about a lot of things i was really lost and just really felt there was no outlet my mom was there but i wanted the rest of her life to be worry free and i tried to keep everything from her i just felt alone
5212319 really showed me he cared and that meant a lot to me

5212349 quel est le retour sur investissement de telle ou telle attitude
5212350 there was nothing on when he got the ball but he scores a few goals like that he is always looking for the target and as soon as he gets space to shoot he shoots and often scores
5212351 he is a megastar now but not only is he a great striker but also a great personality he is just the same on the pitch in the dressing room outside the game
5212352 off the pitch he is just a normal guy just one of us but on the pitch he is different he is something special
5212353 the partnership with robbie keane is getting better and if you are good players like those two it does not need much time they will get used to each other it is just about feeling and i am sure the partnership will grow and grow
5212354 fernando played wonderfully at the euros as well and always when you need him he takes very important goals
5212355 he is a top quality players and for me he is the best striker in the world if you are speaking about a real striker he is the pinnacle he is everything not only in normal games but more often that not in special games
5212356 the most important thing is to contribute to the team and play regularly it doesnt matter that much if i am playing up front or behind the strikers or on the right
5212357 i played the last 15 games on the right last season and enjoyed it because we were getting good results and if i stay there and we start winning some trophies i will be happy
5212358 the most important thing is to be in the team and if robbie and fernando are scoring the goals and are the top scorers in the league i will be happy to get the assists that would be great because for me scoring goals is not the most important thing it is not always about scoring goals
5212359 as a dutchman i grew up watching van basten and gullit and they were the best players and he is as good as them
5212360 it was a difficult game in the first half we were a bit under pressure they controlled the game they didnt have clear chances but we were under pressure but we had plenty of possession and sustained attacks in the second half
5212361 as soon as it left his foot it had goal written all over it i saw him do the same thing at middlesbrough last year as well as other teams
5212362 thats why hes such a good striker its not just tap ins hes capable of scoring outside the box too and thats the difference at this level we all realise that
5212363 thats why guys like that cost 25 30 million people keep asking me about the value of players and i saw hes worth every penny because hes won the game for liverpool today and that could make a difference for them
5212364 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
5212365 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
5212366 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
5212367 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
5212368 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
5212369 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
5212370 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
5212371 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
5212372 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
5212373 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
5212374 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
5212375 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
5212376 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
5212377 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
5212378 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
5212379 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
5212380 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
5212381 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
5212382 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
5212383 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
5212384 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
5212385 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
5212386 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state

5212390 by laying out the terms and conditions of the marriage it encourages both parties to establish consensus on issues such as where they will live
5212391 problems arise when couples dont know what to expect the lack of respect for each others personality and choices is shocking
5212392 these are testing times for the government and for the labour party more generally i
5212393 its in our own hands as to how we respond and i have every confidence that we will respond in the right way the right way is not appearing to the rest of the country that we are obsessed with ourselves and own positions and are constantly jostling and maneouvering about those kind of things and are instead talking about the things that matter to people because they are feeling them directly
5212394 those are the issues that alistair darling will be addressing in his pre budget report
5212395 these were two decisions that the government made and then won the argument we won the olympics for this country labour is doing good things we continue to do good things for the country and we should have more pride in ourselves more confidence sometimes

5212402 ive never seen a finisher who strikes the ball as hard as ashton does
5212403 if you want the ball bouncing around or in the penalty area you want it to bounce to ashton because hell hit it hard and on target

5212408 when you look at big picture its pretty damn depressing but doesnt stop people from winning small local battles
5212409 this is a contest a war and its not red against blue or left against right its between the top and the bottom a class war is being waged in this country against almost everybody who lives in this country

5212411 roll back government and corporate encroachment on individual freedom by allowing information to flow past the barriers erected by totalitarian or authoritarian governments and around the gatekeepers of the mainstream media
5212412 just as a trusted computing system will load neither programs nor data files without a validated certificate whose signature matches their contents neither will the secure internet transfer any document in any standard protocol without such a certificate accompanying it
5212413 a documents certificate its imprimatur identifies the person individual or legal entity responsible for its publication provides a signature which permits verifying its contents have not been corrupted or subsequently modified and identifies the document registry which granted the imprimatur and which on demand will validate it and confirm that it has not been revoked
5212414 more than any innovation in the last century the internet empowers individuals to spontaneously teach learn explore communicate form communities and collaborate measured relatively this individual empowerment comes at the expense of the power of governments and large commercial enterprises thereby reversing a trend toward concentration of power more than a century old which has acted to reduce free citizens and productive individuals to mere subjects and consumers
5212415 like everyone he had been taught since elementary school that sharing books was nasty and wrong something that only pirates would do

5212422 its a very narrow class of companies thats going to get venture capital
5212423 you have to have a road map for commercial viability
5212424 the further you are along that path the better it is for you in securing capital
5212425 we always look at management because its the key to the success of any business
5212426 once you bring in money from venture capitalists the pressure from management to perform really intensifies
5212427 youve got to have a very compelling story to tell

5212429 where people who have led bad lives and die without being sorry are eternally punished
5212430 in a pluralistic post modern world students are having a more difficult time with the idea of people going to hell forever because they didnt believe the right thing
5212431 thats the biggest question out there right now would god send someone to hell if they were someone as good as me but didnt believe what i believe
5212432 ive noticed in the last five years how that view is making inroads even in conservative churches whereas five years ago it wasnt even uttered or discussed
5212433 they believe everyone has an equal chance at this life and the next

5212457 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
5212458 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
5212459 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
5212460 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
5212461 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
5212462 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
5212463 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
5212464 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
5212465 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
5212466 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
5212467 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
5212468 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
5212469 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
5212470 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
5212471 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
5212472 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
5212473 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
5212474 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
5212475 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
5212476 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
5212477 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
5212478 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
5212479 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
5212480 who are open to doing something on the production side
5212481 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
5212482 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
5212483 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
5212484 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
5212485 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
5212486 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
5212487 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
5212488 londoners have so far been largely insulated from the price falls taking place elsewhere in the country
5212489 however sellers who choose to come to the market during the peak holiday season generally have a greater need to sell and as a result properties coming onto the market in july were on average 21 000 cheaper than last month
5212490 when looking at trends in the market it is important to remember that uk house prices are significantly higher than five years ago
5212491 the current issue affecting the market is largely about the supply of credit a very different situation to the early 1990s which was about high interest rates and
5212492 the fundamentals underpinning the market remain sound with long term demand for housing low interest rates and low unemployment

5212500 look everyone is going to die the only issue is what you do while you are alive

5212502 where are the muslims seated in this event and why are they not listening to what you are saying

5212505 the contractors in delhi get in touch with the middlemen in bihar with very lucrative offers of money as well as a better future for the children
5212506 i feel so bad that i have put the child in there
5212507 this is the dilemma the best we can do is to empower the children
5212508 deposta adunque ogni malizia ed ogni frode e le ipocrisie ed invidie ed ogni maldicenza come bambini appena nati desiderate ardentemente il puro latte della parola affinch per suo mezzo cresciate
5212509 deponiamo ogni peso e il peccato che cos facilmente ci avvolge e corriamo con perseveranza la gara che ci proposta
5212510 you can see tottenham without berbatov are a different team
5212511 but i dont think his head is there anymore its not with spurs and i think he is looking for a move
5212512 if he leaves then tottenham will sign big strikers and big names because that is what they need to satisfy the supporters
5212513 but how do you replace berbatov its very difficult he is a class player plays his own game every game and he is not affected by anything around him it will be especially difficult for spurs after losing robbie keano is one of the best players i have ever played with losing him i think will turn out to be even more difficult for spurs
5212514 it is up to manchester united to make a bid and spurs to accept or decline it or whatever the ball is in our court really because he is our player the chairman will decide what to do if he stays or if he goes
5212515 he has shown that he is an intelligent player with a good technique who can integrate well with the rest of the team
5212516 shes my old girlfriend i understand she took to drinking after we split up and hasnt been sober since
5212517 who would think a person could go on celebrating that long
5212518 people have been writing things that just arent true trying to unsettle the whole club but all that crap weve had to suffer weve just dispelled in 90 minutes of football thats what makes it all the more sweet for me
5212519 i was disappointed with the fans reaction towards moyesy because people forget what a great man he has been for everton
5212520 he doesnt deserve that on the first game of the season
5212521 i think the club lost a bit of momentum last season which is understandable when youve had the same manager for eight years and he suddenly leaves
5212522 the club has grown and developed year on year and i see the money that i have been given to strengthen the squad as a vote of confidence in me to continue that development and a signal that we are all pulling in the same direction
5212523 i have been given money to try to take the club forward but there has never been any argument about the players i want to bring in there is a trust there that im thankful for
5212524 we were 3 0 down in the blink of an eye
5212525 but we got some pride back in the second half you dust yourself down try and correct a few little things and look forward to the next game
5212526 the whole city is buzzing and its a wonderful thing for anybody involved in sport to see what a positive impact a successful club can have on a once blighted city
5212527 its a tribute to the vision of the council who built the stadium and to the management of peter taylor who built a competitive side to get us promoted we found our level in the championship until some new money came in and that made the difference in getting promoted last year
5212528 weve got two quality strikers and that will help us through the season
5212529 its a 38 game season not a one game season and we go away and lick our wounds all this proves is that there are no easy games
5212530 usually we like to do things with confidentiality but sometimes you cannot
5212531 if you have the support of the owners who say you have the money then you make decisions to sign or not
5212532 i talked about what i wanted in april i had a player in mind barry and an idea alonso out i told them they have to buy top class players with the money we are bringing in all the owners should be really pleased the question is why we cannot do it
5212533 they did not say no before they said no after four months after four months they said the player is expensive
5212534 were not playing like brazil lampard is not brazilian hes english
5212535 ballacks style is different as is decos i ask my players to hold their position but to play to their style
5212536 chelsea were just too bright their movement was too much for us
5212537 last year we played 4 5 1 and were fantastic away from home i made a rod for my own back by bringing in two strikers i dont think you can play 4 4 2 here you get overloaded in midfield
5212538 id have had to leave defoe out and ive bought him here to play
5212539 key decisions in key areas have cost us but we feel hard done by with the result
5212540 i have no doubt that gabbys and ashley youngs time with england will come
5212541 we held off as long as possible but at the end of the day the weather beat us we tried every avenue and postponement possible and only made our decision to abandon at the last minute
5212542 its a great pity for the dundrod club who had put so much effort into the meeting however from early morning it had been expected that the meeting would be off
5212543 there had been weather forecasts giving us a bit of hope but as the day went on it was obvious that we were whistling in the dark
5212544 under the current regulations we are unable to hold the meeting on sunday and so the ulster grand prix has been lost
5212545 i would have raced had the conditions relented but there was no way that was possible its a great pity for the promoters and the crowd many of them were still in the stands hoping for racing to start
5212546 it is all all very sad but i wouldnt have raced in those conditions
5212547 i was prepared to race but obviously the visibility made this a dodgy move im shattered that the meeting has been abandoned for i was really looking forward to it
5212548 we fully support the ugps decision to abandon the planned race programme due to the horrendous weather conditions
5212549 the safety of riders and spectators is paramount and the clerk of course cannot take any unnecessary risks

5212554 lord when i was in the garden you walked with me every day now i do not see you anymore i am lonesome here and it is difficult for me to remember how much you love me
5212555 no problem i will create a companion for you that will be with you forever and who will be a reflection of my love for you so that you will know i love you even when you cannot see me regardless of how selfish and childish and unlovable you may be this new companion will accept you as you are and will love you as i do in spite of yourself
5212556 but lord i have already named all the animals in the kingdom and all the good names are taken and i cannot think of a name for this new animal
5212557 no problem because i have created this new animal to be a reflection of my love for you his name will be a reflection of my own name and you will call him dog
5212558 lord adam has become filled with pride he struts and preens like a peacock and he believes he is worthy of adoration dog has indeed taught him that he is loved but no one has taught him humility
5212559 no problem i will create for him a companion who will be with him forever and who will see him as he is the companion will remind him of his limitations so he will know that he is not worthy of adoration

5212563 zon sensor pikt informatie op over het vochtgehalte van de bodem
5212564 op een gangbare pc duurt het doorrekenen van een bemestingsadvies uren per perceel
5212565 het is de bedoeling dat deze gegevens in de toekomst naar supercomputer stella in groningen worden gezonden deze computer die wordt ingezet voor sterrenkundig onderzoek heeft een gigantische rekenkracht stella kan ervoor zorgen dat agrarische modellen veel sneller uitgerekend kunnen worden zo kunnen boeren onderbouwd met feiten besluiten nemen over hun teelt door te meten en te rekenen wordt meer gewerkt vanuit feiten en kennis dan vanuit het gevoel en de traditie ik weet nu beter wat ik moet doen aan het vochtgehalte in de grond hoe ik mijn gewassen het beste kan bemesten met stikstof of hoe ik gewasbeschermingsmiddelen moet toepassen
5212566 mijn gewassen zijn er kwalitatief op vooruit gegaan bovendien heb ik een hoger rendement van naar schatting 15 procent
5212567 ik weet niet zoveel van landbouw maar vindt het prachtig om te zien dat sterrenkunde en landbouw twee totaal verschillende vakgebieden elkaar hebben gevonden
5212568 we hebben een radiotelescoop gebouwd die honderd maal gevoeliger is dan de huidige telescopen met een netwerk van duizenden sensoren
5212569 de kleine antennes zijn verdeeld over noord nederland en aan een supercomputer gekoppeld via een uitgestrekt glasvezelnetwerk nooit eerder is op deze schaal een dergelijke infrastructuur ontwikkeld met capaciteiten voor verzameling en verwerking van signalen en data we bedachten dat een dergelijke infrastructuur interessant zou kunnen zijn om heel praktisch toe te passen vandaar deze vier projecten op het gebied van landbouw en veelteelt
5212570 dit soort sensoren op grote schaal toepassen in de landbouw is financieel nog niet haalbaar
5212571 het kost nu 50 tot 75 euro per hectare om de sensoren te plaatsen dat kan niet uit het wordt een ander verhaal als over vijftien jaar de sensoren 1 euro per stuk kosten dan kan het interessant worden
5212572 we komen er nu achter dat we nog maar weinig weten over de processen in bodem en gewas het zou mooi zijn dat we erachter kunnen komen hoeveel stikstof er precies nodig is per vierkante meter of per plant dat we er zo effici nt met middelen en werktuigen kunnen omgaan dat er voldoende brandstof overblijft om auto te kunnen blijven rijden mijn utopie is dat we van elke plant precies weten wat hij nodig heeft dat hij een signaal kan uitzenden als ik heb nu water nodig en zoveel stikstof maar daar zijn we nog lang niet
5212573 dat is niet goed voor het milieu bovendien vind ik dat ze vrij snel moeten worden vervangen binnenkort worden er proeven gedaan met sensoren met zonnepanelen dan heb je er geen omkijken meer naar
5212574 ik verwacht dat ik zittend onder mijn kerstboom met een druk op de knop mijn trekker in het seizoen zelf kan laten rijden naar een perceel om werkzaamheden uit te voeren zonder dat ik een stap hoef te verzetten
5212575 you know ive been thinking about this mr hand if im here and youre here doesnt it make it our time
5212576 es ist ein unding dass millionen von rentnerhaushalten tag f r tag durch neue panik meldungen verunsichert werden k nnen wenn in wirklichkeit der weitaus berwiegende teil der rentnerinnen und rentner von dieser besteuerung berhaupt nicht betroffen ist
5212577 berw ltigende mehrheit der rentnerschaft nie mit dem finanzamt zu tun

5212579 my biggest mistake as a coach is i make assumptions that these guys might know or have been through some of these experiences and that happened a little bit in the preseason opener
5212580 there were a few unique things that happened and they just caught us by surprise because when you look at these guys they didnt play very much last year
5212581 primarily in theory were basically starting over at this position
5212582 none of them can rent a car none of them are old enough
5212583 i have so many notes that i write for them every day i can understand why theyre so confused
5212584 its like trying to put out a forest fire with a garden hose youve got stuff going on everywhere so where do you start
5212585 i have to slap myself sometimes and say you cant assume that they know that youve got to start over again
5212586 its been a lot better this year than it was last year for me in terms of knowing what to do knowing the offense and not having to get yelled at for not being in the right spot
5212587 grundschleppnetzfischerei pfl gt den meeresboden regelrecht um und das in einem gebiet das seit vier jahren als schutzgebiet gemeldet ist
5212588 die natursteine sch tzen das gebiet wirkungsvoll und setzen so das naturschutzrecht durch anstatt den aktivisten jetzt unrechtm iges handeln vorzuwerfen sollte bundesumweltminister sigmar gabriel lieber die gesamte fischerei im sylter au enriff sowie den sand und kiesabbau verbieten nur so kann gabriel noch glaubw rdig bleiben
5212589 im coming into a situation where you cant screw up
5212590 were playing well you try to get back too early and you either get hurt or screw it up and then youre back to square one i can go out there today and throw 96 mph but what good is it if its a flat 96 mph
5212591 people have said my policies over the past nine years have been wrong they were wrong
5212592 some elements acting for vested interests have made false allegations against me everything i have done will have long term benefits for pakistan
5212593 you know ive been thinking about this mr hand if im here and youre here doesnt it make it our time
5212594 there could be no clearer indicator about the high level of unaffordable debt in the country
5212595 i can understand that bills need to be paid but as we see more people in these situations we need to find less drastic measures to deal with debt
5212596 it is an absolute last resort for us to pursue customers through the courts for non payment of bills
5212597 in the case of non payment o2 over a prolonged period of time makes every effort to communicate directly with these customers and where we know there is an issue with payment together with the customer we will put in place a monthly payment plan
5212598 out of our 1 7 million customers it is with regret that we have had to pursue a small number in this way
5212599 each company or institution has different ways of treating a judgment some increase the interest rate because of the perceived higher risk
5212600 the general consensus is that the detrimental effect of having a judgment registered against you lasts for five years
5212601 suppose that i were brooks or woodhouse or any of the fifty
5212602 this is just a silly game to play because of love i dont know what to say because of you i dont know what to do maybe im so in love with you
5212603 i dont want the people of pakistan to slide deeper and deeper into uncertainty
5212604 for the interest of the nation i have decided to resign as president
5212605 i am not asking for anything i will let the people of pakistan decide my future
5212606 it will be accepted there is no second opinion about that
5212607 the decision to give a safe passage to the president is on discretion of the coalition leadership
5212608 after the elections the nation wanted solutions from the new government
5212609 but the politicians could not do so a personal vendetta was started
5212610 i am confident that not a single charge can stand against me
5212611 i have not done anything for my personal gain whatever i have done i have done it for pakistan
5212612 leading pakistan is not an easy task and anyone doing it comes under a lot of criticism
5212613 in the start most pakistanis were for him and he still has some supporters especially because the new government which promised to do things differently has failed to do much in the past 100 days in power
5212614 he wanted to serve the country and to be different
5212615 he brought parliamentary reforms he brought women into the parliament
5212616 he in a way always believed in a unity of command a very centralized command which means his command in fact
5212617 this is where he went wrong and he underestimated the value of democracy
5212618 but in my view your face is not everything real beauty lies inside a person not outside
5212619 because beauty is all about faces and beautiful girls and skin
5212620 help us bring back a smile to the face of these survivors
5212621 they say that when we come to a beauty salon we come with the expectation that were going to be relaxed in a different frame of mind
5212622 if we come here and we see someone who has gone through so much pain and misery so automatically that gives us that low feeling also they have a point
5212623 at the same time there are clients who take pride in asking these girls to give them a blow dry or getting a manicure or pedicure taken from them
5212624 once we had a wedding in the family i went there and all the girls were getting dressed and putting on makeup so that time i felt a pain in my heart
5212625 but i dont want to weaken myself with these thoughts
5212626 the peace of mind i have now i never had before i suffered much more mental anguish in my married life
5212627 i feel that her hands call me again and again
5212628 when i see them i want to be like them strong girls
5212629 i want to make a name for myself in this profession
5212630 im independent now i stand on my own two feet
5212631 i have a job i work i earn in fact im living on my own which isnt an easy thing to do for a woman in pakistan for a lone woman to survive
5212632 with a passion for life a strong woman caught up in the torrent of historical turmoil and drowned
5212633 he could have testified but he just flew back stateside to his american family
5212634 we all knew he slept in the house many times the baby looks like the father
5212635 the south korean police and prosecutors hated her because she was the lover of lee gang kook and then of col baird and nobody could touch her they waited for their chance
5212636 they would send her right back to the torture chamber
5212637 i just needed to be with someone who was in the courtroom with her
5212638 i have been searching since november 2007 for models of denominations like the rca that transitioned from being largely euroethnic to being multiracial
5212639 the ecc is one of a very few that has engaged that transition with substantial measurable result
5212640 in june 2008 our highest assembly the general synod voted to put the rca on the path of becoming a
5212641 in the family of god partnering rather than merely reinventing the wheel can bring the kind of blessing the world needs
5212642 from my perspective we didnt see ourselves as two different churches
5212643 i was out to prove a point that with all their improvements the ginettas couldnt live with our pace and for that matter neither could many of the class 1 cars
5212644 we have incredible human rights opportunities and benefits in this country and its not like that in tibet
5212645 the tibetan people are really suffering the olympic games as far as were concerned are kind of a joke they ended up in beijing and what we should be focusing on is the human rights records in tibet
5212646 we knew what the consequences of our actions would be but we knew what little risk there would be compared to what the tibetan people are dealing with on a regular basis
5212647 we all have an opportunity to stand up and say something about it and if we all do that itll make a difference
5212648 funding issues will not delay the implementation of the dispensation
5212649 critical vacancy factor its inability to attract and retain its scarce skills
5212650 i believe prosecutors will now consider seriously the issue of a stayaway in order to knock some sense into these peoples head
5212651 we are not beggars it is time we demonstrate our power as workers
5212652 while the delay is undesirable the npa is doing everything possible to safeguard the interests of our staff and keep them abreast of all current developments
5212653 malaysia strongly condemns the holding of the congress as it blatantly depicts insensitivities and sheer act of provocation to islam and the muslim world
5212654 nothing positive can be achieved through this event but will only incite violence and hatred resulting in adverse consequences
5212655 malaysia and the international community especially muslim nations are against this congress as it will not benefit anyone but arouse religious hatred
5212656 whether it likes it or not the german government should be fully responsible if the congress goes on although it is organised by a non governmental organisation in germany
5212657 malaysia wishes to emphasise the importance of efforts be taken by governments and responsible organisations to build and promote interfaith relations and dialogue and understanding between different religions and cultures
5212658 the worries that existed dont persist any more on the factory floor
5212659 the first part of the problem was that there was wholesale fear mongering on the part of some service providers they said that the government was going to nationalise pensions or steal the money from pensions and provident funds
5212660 people are under such financial stress that they resigned so as to get their pension money and then went and got or tried to get a job somewhere else
5212661 oddly enough it is more in the boardrooms more among so called educated people that worries remain
5212662 to begin with there are still too many unknowns who will be the asset managers who will collect and monitor the government fund will it be the revenue service that would in itself be a problem because sars is the taxman will it be a defined contribution fund or will it be a pooled fund and if so who will be responsible for investing it and where will it be invested will it go into the public investment corporation
5212663 ik ben graag online het is veel leuker dan schrijven op papier
5212664 ik heb momenteel negen vrienden maar ik hoop dat er snel meer zullen bijkomen ik ga binnenkort nieuwe fotos op mijn site zetten
5212665 het blijft een raadsel wanner liu xiang deze blessure heeft opgelopen maar hij sukkelt er al een jaar of zeven mee we hoopten hem toch fit te krijgen op deze spelen en werkten daar keihard voor eergisteren voelde liu zich nog in topvorm en dan stak de pijn plots de kop op liu kon niet anders dan opgeven
5212666 nadat de russische troepen zich uit georgi hebben teruggetrokken moeten wij ernstig beginnen nadenken over de toekomstige aard van de betrekkingen tussen georgi en rusland zodat onze volkeren elkaar niet voor altijd de rug toekeren
5212667 spotjes op de radio en affiches op en in de voertuigen maken automobilisten met een knipoog duidelijk dat het goedkoper is om de bus te nemen dan erachter te rijden met de auto voor de prijs van drie tankbeurten heb je als volwassene immers een jaarabonnement voor het hele net van de lijn
5212668 na de situatie te hebben bekeken en diverse juridische raadgevers en politieke bondgenoten te hebben geraadpleegd heb ik besloten ontslag te nemen
5212669 dat ze ons in de bloemetjes zetten toont aan dat ze blij zijn met spelers als wij en het is ook een bewijs dat dat selectieprobleem van eerder dit jaar niet persoonlijk was
5212670 mijn ambitie is gewoon om zo goed mogelijk te spelen in mijn eerste wedstrijd als ik die overleef zien we wel match per match het positieve van reekshoofd te zijn is dat ik al meteen in de tweede ronde zit maar het negatieve daarvan is dat ik niet heb kunnen inspelen tegen een makkelijkere tegenstander daarom was het ook belangrijk dat ik al heb kunnen trainen in de wedstrijdzaal in de tweede ronde blijven er maar 48 spelers meer over dus makkelijke confrontaties zijn er dan niet meer
5212671 maar na een carri re als de mijne is alles wat ik hier presteer een bonus ik ben blij dat het bijna begint want ik ben hier al sinds 7 augustus en dat is toch lang
5212672 het heeft ons veel geld gekost om ze hierheen te brengen ze zeggen dat het illegaal is om bijbels mee te nemen en dat we vooraf toestemming hadden moeten vragen
5212673 je kan iemand wel horen spreken maar daarom versta je die persoon niet altijd er is dus een groot verschil tussen horen en verstaan traditionele testen beoordelen enkel het horen biepjes maar houden geen rekening met het spraakverstaan deze nieuwe vorm van testen geeft dus een veel nauwkeuriger beeld over hoe iemand in de praktijk conversaties kan verstaan
5212674 iemand die niet goed hoort en verstaat zal zich meer isoleren en gaat minder contacten opzoeken dit betekent niet alleen minder mobiliteit maar ook mentaal minder bezig zijn
5212675 the kuwait government should not mete out collective punishment to all ethiopians instead the kuwait embassy in ethiopia should get to the bottom of the matter even as he called on the embassy to check the antecedents of the medical centers in ethiopia which cleared the three maids
5212676 the kuwaiti embassy should conduct a thorough investigation to ascertain whether any ill practices were involved in the matter i believe the ban is temporary in nature

5212706 natuurlijk is voor biologische akkerbouwers en vollegrondsgroentetelers juist de bodemkwaliteit van belang
5212707 als je het precies uitrekent dan offer je dus zon 5 procent van je bouwgrond op aan die vaste rijpaden in de praktijk is dat minder want de gewassen links en rechts van die paden krijgen meer licht en ruimte en groeien dus beter
5212708 je zet 2 piketpaaltjes neer en daartussen trek je met de trekker de eerste ab lijn
5212709 maar bij een langzame werkgang bijvoorbeeld bij het planten stapt de chauffeur gewoon van de trekker af hij heeft dan wel een afstandsbediening bij zich een soort dodemansknop om zonodig in te kunnen grijpen
5212710 misschien dat ik straks vanaf dit terras bij de kantine alles op afstand kan bedienen dat moet dan geprogrammeerd worden kan ik de fiscus meteen zeggen dat dit een werkruimte is maar dat is toekomstmuziek hoewel ik had vijf of tien jaar geleden ook niet kunnen voorspellen dat we nu al zo ver zouden zijn
5212711 we hebben het ontdekt in west brabant waar drie telers er mee aan het experimenteren waren daar gaan we nu nog elk jaar op werkbezoek in flevoland zijn de reacties bij de gangbare bedrijven positief maar veel boeren kijken er tegenop om hun hele mechanisatie om te gooien ze vinden die extra brede trekkers erg kwetsbaar bovendien zijn ze bang dat de fabrikant zijn garantie intrekt als ze er aan gaan knutselen voor ons is het leuk om een voortrekkersrol te hebben al hebben we soms letterlijk leergeld moeten betalen we hebben veel zelf moeten uitvinden alles is nu bij de fabrikant te bestellen wij verdienen daar niet aan maar dat is niet zo erg veel belangrijker voor ons is dat deze trekkers en werktuigen op grote schaal en dus goedkoper worden gefabriceerd
5212712 bij het koppen van de tulpen hadden we significant minder nakopwerk dankzij het egalere gewas
5212713 bij alleen gps op de trekker sluiten met een getrokken pootmachine op zand en dalgrond de rijen niet goed op elkaar aan alleen gps op de pootmachine geeft een nauwkeurigheid van n centimeter maar dan moet je zelf nog wel sturen daarom twee gps systemen
5212714 een paar jaar geleden zijn we na gaan denken of het niet effici nter kan met lnv subsidie voor innovatieve idee n hebben we de combinatie ontwikkeld geometius heeft de gps systemen in veertien dagen opgebouwd vorige week donderdag hebben we de combinatie opgehaald en uitgetest maandag zijn we er voluit mee gaan werken

5212773 it eliminates all the uncertainty in the market and i think the political uncertainty is coming to an end the government will hopefully start concentrating on the economy from an economic point of view they have no excuses now and they have to perform
5212774 as to whether it is good or bad for the country that remains to be seen and we will tell two to three years from now
5212775 the broader issue right now is will it clear up the political situation will the coalition government work together will there be a power grab
5212776 what i will like to see right now is the coalition government sticking together to address the economic problems rising inflation widening trade gap et cetera

5212781 as far as the pilots and the west gulf proposal all i can say at this time is theres no need for pilots to take any action on the proposal and we have no further comment
5212782 the pilots showed great flexibility and initiative to handle unique traffic needs
5212783 it is very gratifying to me that west gulf was proactive in trying to keep rates competitive and fair
5212784 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
5212785 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
5212786 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
5212787 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
5212788 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
5212789 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
5212790 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
5212791 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
5212792 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
5212793 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
5212794 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
5212795 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
5212796 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
5212797 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
5212798 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
5212799 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
5212800 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
5212801 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
5212802 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
5212803 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
5212804 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
5212805 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
5212806 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
5212807 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
5212808 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
5212809 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
5212810 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
5212811 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
5212812 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees

5212846 president medvedev agreed but we cannot postpone and we cannot delay with these tasks
5212847 it is up to russia now to decide whether it will continue to defy the world or accomplish its final goal of regime change in georgia
5212848 my own view is that the russians will probably stall and perhaps take more time than anybody would like
5212849 i think we just need to keep the pressure and ensure that they abide by the agreement that theyve signed and do so in a timely way

5212866 by abolishing the statutory definition of marriage and reducing marriage and de facto relationships to the same category the bill fails to acknowledge and respect the unique cultural significance of marriage
5212867 the opposition will be moving to amend the legislation to restore specific recognition of marital relationships we will be moving amendments to say that marital relationships are defined differently to de facto relationships whether it is opposite sex or same sex relationships
5212868 one can achieve the objective of the elimination of discrimination against gay couples without homogenising de facto relationships
5212869 what it means is the legislation will recognise martial relationships and de facto relationships rather than equate those relationships as the same thing
5212870 experts in family studies that gave evidence to the inquiry demonstrated that marriage is a much more stable institution than de facto relationship they are entered into advertently when people marry the make a conscious decision marriage is not a relationship that is entered into casually
5212871 what we are saying is that it is unique there is a great weight of social evidence that was presented to the committee that marriage tended to last for longer and have a lower rate of failure
5212872 i wish to make it abundantly clear that the use of the term couple relationship does not undermine existing marriage laws
5212873 it is important to know that we distinguish between de facto and marriage the legislation removes the term marital relationship and substitutes coupled relationship only in super bills
5212874 a lot of the drafting of the legislation is unnecessarily clinical
5212875 its pretty hard to see how its anything other than a straightforward set of copyright violations
5212876 there are entire magazines with no commentary no criticism clearly not a case of classic fair use
5212877 the first sale doctrine says that once i buy a physical copy of something i can do whatever i want with it except copy it
5212878 we take our intellectual property seriously and are considering appropriate action on this matter
5212879 i would never give it up not unless i was dying of alcohol poisoning or something
5212880 its inelastic demand as far as many of these stocks are concerned

5212882 id rather spend 4 or 5 on quality beer than 3 on hopped up water

5212889 when taso was formed in 1987 our aim was to ensure that the people who were infected got medical care we focused on seeing an hiv free country in a few years but our dream has not come true because statistics show that many people are still being infected
5212890 it is the responsibility every one to guard their lives to prevent catching the disease and spreading it
5212891 some people refuse to admit that they are suffering from hiv even when their bodies clearly show it when they fall sick they think they are being bewitched and run to traditional healers instead of seeking medical help

5212917 weve got 13 available offensive linemen for the next two games i think tennessee had 12 available when we were in camp with them and when i was at minnesota we would quite often go into training camp with 12 offensive linemen so assuming we dont have any more injuries at this point we should be ok there
5212918 he just planted and kind of got pushed back and you saw his leg kind of give out
5212919 certainly its some tough luck to have two really tough injuries to the same knee within a year
5212920 i felt bad for him because i know he worked his butt off to get back this year i saw him stand up and his knee wobbled back and forth its one of those things you knew it was that bad when it happened

5212930 dat ze ons in de bloemetjes zetten toont aan dat ze blij zijn met spelers als wij en het is ook een bewijs dat dat selectieprobleem van eerder dit jaar niet persoonlijk was
5212931 mijn ambitie is gewoon om zo goed mogelijk te spelen in mijn eerste wedstrijd als ik die overleef zien we wel match per match het positieve van reekshoofd te zijn is dat ik al meteen in de tweede ronde zit maar het negatieve daarvan is dat ik niet heb kunnen inspelen tegen een makkelijkere tegenstander daarom was het ook belangrijk dat ik al heb kunnen trainen in de wedstrijdzaal in de tweede ronde blijven er maar 48 spelers meer over dus makkelijke confrontaties zijn er dan niet meer

5212948 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it

5212988 as sponsors of some schools churches and indeed all religious groups must re examine their effectiveness as spiritual guardians of the society they must continue to inculcate in the minds of our young boys and girls core values such as love of neighbour honesty unity and patriotism
5212989 i want to thank the church non governmental organizations and the civil society for taking an active role in reconciling our people following the challenges we faced earlier in the year
5212990 we have to be prepared to talk openly about the reform of the council tax
5212991 of all the deceits practised by alex salmond and the snp over police numbers student loans school buildings the biggest is that they can grow the scottish economy
5212992 their budget does not support that cuts in business rates and a council tax freeze will simply mean cuts in skills training and public services
5212993 we cannot just wait for the wheels to come off the snp bandwagon
5212994 we are close to doing something with robbie hes been different class in training in the last few days
5212995 robbie is a premier league goalscorer and he always will be but the only issue is getting his sharpness back
5212996 weve been back a few times because i know he would be good for us
5212997 we cant concede too many goals like we did last season it would be great to eliminate that and still score a lot of goals
5212998 we know we can improve defensively and we will continue working hard to do that we are good enough as a team to cut down on the goals we concede
5212999 it is a new defence with a new goalkeeper and that will not develop overnight the new guys played well
5213000 brad friedel is a good goalkeeper you can see that i thought luke young and nicky shorey also played well but it takes time to play together and be comfortable together
5213001 but well get that right we have to look at it as a whole team and we know we need to do better defensively
5213002 but we are still happy with the start to the season we have made if we can keep scoring goals and start to concede fewer goals that is perfect
5213003 it was important to get off to a winning start we have done well in our important games in the pre season we got the right result in the intertoto cup and we played well in iceland in the uefa cup on thursday
5213004 we played well against man city and i think we can be happy with the way things are going for the club we conceded a couple of goals again but the most important thing was that we won
5213005 this is rims most significant launch since the pearl in september 2006
5213006 it is taking the blackberry platform firmly into 3g territory which is pivotal because more than any other device the smart phone benefits hugely from 3g network access
5213007 no matter what rim did the iphone was going to sell out in the first weekend
5213008 they want to put a little distance between them and the iphone
5213009 they dont have a reputation where you dont want to buy the first blackberry devices quite the opposite everyone feels quite comfortable buying the first round of blackberrys and i think they want to make sure of that
5213010 investor angst increased with each passing week without launch leading to fears of a september launch
5213011 we believe actual launch removes significant sentiment overhang from rim shares

5213037 we remain bitterly disappointed at the manner in which sonny bill deserted his team mates and his supporters
5213038 we have however reached the point where we need to get on with business and we have withdrawn the injunction against him playing for any other club
5213039 neither the bulldogs nor sonny bill have anything further to gain by drawing this situation out any further
5213040 for that reason we have accepted a significant compensation payout from sonny bill and a commitment that he not play for any other nrl club until his contract was due to expire at the end of the 2012 season

5213065 bringing together works from all these artists has been a fantastic opportunity for bombay sapphire but being able to offer the public an opportunity to take them home adds a whole new dimension to the project some of the pieces would look amazing in a private home others like david trubridges light and simon jamess bar would look great in a commercial premises who knows maybe someone is looking for the ultimate bar set up and will take the whole lot
5213066 what the botanical bar and auction does give us though is the opportunity to support local artists and designers at the same time as giving something to the dowse art museum

5213068 on the design front the auction offers furniture from talented up and coming designers as well as large scale pieces from the more established designers david trubridge and simon james we anticipate that prices will reflect the scope of the work and artists involved and the works selling for between 250 and 35 000

5213081 we dont want our people our teenagers influenced by their performance we want clean artists artists that are good role models
5213082 there is going to be a full investigation into this
5213083 i dont want to comment further until i fully understand it because there are some mixed messages going round
5213084 there was a risk assessment prepared beforehand and that was passed by everyone so we need to investigate to see what happened
5213085 we have no need to interfere with the commercial activities of the club and that event was risk assessed anyway
5213086 the parachutist said a gust of wind had blown him off course
5213087 my take is that he slowed coming into land so he could do a bit of show boating but he drifted on to the roof
5213088 he was very embarrassed when we got him down and his colleagues were waiting for him
5213089 with it being burnleys first game of the season at home the crowd werent very happy with it being delayed
5213090 but they gave a big cheer when he was helped down and im sure it all raised a few smiles
5213091 today we were pretty relaxed and we were joking around
5213092 we saw all the boats behind us at one point and we thought to ourselves
5213093 we sailed stable and conservatively throughout this regatta and we tried to stay in single digit numbers at the end we did better than we had hoped

5213096 each division of kaust will have its own unique opportunities and challenges as such each chair must possess the leadership qualities that will drive success and offer our students the very best research experience they can have immersed in each particular area of focus we are thrilled that professors keyes and moran will join kaust and step into their roles to create world class departments that will attract the best and brightest students and faculty from across the globe
5213097 both professors keyes and moran have award winning histories as researchers scientists and published authors their work as pioneers of many notable projects coupled with their experiences as student supervisors and mentors makes both of them a perfect fit for their respective positions

5213101 hi were busy and cant take your call right now
5213102 ive been in the marching band since the ninth grade
5213103 the football players say they love to hear us play the fight song
5213104 the football team and even the basketball team like having us there
5213105 they like knowing theres a large group of their peers who support them
5213106 a lot of the players come to the band competitions
5213107 track marching back and forth and constantly conditioning our upper bodies we do laps upper and lower body a full body workout
5213108 its an awesome amount of energy when you come out on that field
5213109 all of the energy we put into our show comes out
5213110 after we got out on the field it was like an adrenaline rush
5213111 the gig challenge is concentrating on keeping your intervals and trying to play your instrument as loud as you can play
5213112 our loudest player graduated last year we have some big shoes to fill
5213113 i like to challenge myself in all of my classes so i take the hardest classes i can
5213114 when i get to band i can relax and enjoy myself its a nice break
5213115 when you think about it with 100 students in our band we have one fifth of our student body out on the football field at half time during a football field
5213116 when you add in all of the football players and support staff a lot of our student population is on the football field on a friday night
5213117 when we compete we do our best but we also compete against the other schools
5213118 when i see a band that does a really good job i applaud them too
5213119 i think you see that at band competitions people will support you if you work hard and turn in a great performance
5213120 last year was fun but this year picks it up a little with that blues brothers thing
5213121 i was assured on the senate floor during debate and explanation of sb 722 that this would not happen and that our free clinics would have their medicine cabinets and be able to care and dispense medication to those like the lady mentioned in this story
5213122 ive already contacted the senate president and senator roman prezioso d marion our chairman of the senate health committee to straighten this out during next weeks legislative interims meeting
5213123 i personally did the questioning on the floor and made sure what the senates intent was for sb 722
5213124 how dare you make fun of a vietnam veteran and get a hair cut young man
5213125 the brrs bruces rave and rant of the world are the cause of the poor education our children receive in maths and the numerical sciences at least
5213126 meaningless sites like bwuces rave and five pubes is a waste of time
5213127 we worked hard every day but the result was as you see and its really hard to take
5213128 in watching warmups we could see he wasnt quite as strong as you expect him to be
5213129 but we didnt know it was as bad as it turned out to be
5213130 a 110 meter hurdles race without liu is such a pity

5213136 the site redesign is another example of our unique position in the market the site is more exciting than ever as a guide and information source for our area
5213137 we did a lot of pre tests on all the components in isolation and fea finite element analysis studies on the structural design of the chassis before moving on to the physical tests the car has now completed 5800 kilometres without problems so were very happy with the progress we have a small number of engine software issues to finalise but tyre testing is now complete and michelin are ready and looking forward to a competitive season ahead
5213138 compliance has always been a focus of ours since we started the network and by being one of the first companies to employ a full time team it further illustrates our dedication to protecting the wellness of our advertisers as well as our publishers

5213146 es un ainjusticia lo que est n haciendo con el director
5213147 en nuestra escuela no se cobraron cuotas nosotros acordamos nuestras propias cuotas voluntarias en efectivo especie o mano de obra seg n las posibilidades de las familias
5213148 decirles que estamos convencidos de que la educaci n representa hoy la llave para que los seres humanos podamos alcanzar mejores niveles de vida y bienestar en general ya que en ella se encuentra la clave para que una sociedad pueda avanzar y consolidar su desarrollo pleno en todos los aspectos

5213161 and he was packed and hauled out of the mine

5213166 mccain says heres my plan im going to drill here drill now which is something he only came up with two months ago when he started looking at polling
5213167 they say this other guy is unpatriotic or this guy likes french people thats what they said about kerry
5213168 they try to make it out like democrats arent tough enough arent macho enough its the same strategy
5213169 john mccain has never questioned senator obamas patriotism but he clearly does question senator obamas experience and judgment
5213170 theyre being detected quicker and in larger numbers because of the publics awareness and willingness to call us

5213172 it allows for anyone interested in advertising sex for money to log on make up an ad and submit it for free
5213173 with little to no furniture and make shift beds on the floor
5213174 it depends on what theyre offering and what the customers are willing to pay
5213175 this is where companies put their new employees and people are always going in and out
5213176 a lot of families here are always walking around but if you close your eyes you feel like youre at the ritz carlton
5213177 there has been no material change in the current trading and outlook of the company since the company released its trading statement
5213178 michael dont you think that these set backs or blessings in disguise were predictable such events happens every day in real business its been my experience that highly paid executives must continually convince their pay masters that they are doing a good job
5213179 getting a top job is one thing keeping it is another certainly three years is considered a good run at the top in the us oil industry eventually everyone gets to pursue other challenges i know that i did
5213180 similarly it is a tad myopic to believe that the government call in has to do with the fans we are not victims surely it had more to do with the real impacts of the billion pound retail scheme hey if you think this regulatory process is frustrating then try to build an oil refinery
5213181 our study reveals potentially clinically relevant differences in the gene expression of different cancer types and represents a reference framework for interpretation of smaller scale functional studies
5213182 this segregation of tumors into three groups with distinct expression patterns is surprising clearly the developmental trajectory provides a meaningful background for capturing large scale differences in gene expression across diverse conditions
5213183 shifting our focus from single sets of genes or processes to the biology of aggregates on the order of the entire transcriptome is likely to be useful in establishing highly robust molecular correlations between seemingly unrelated disease phenotypes
5213184 ambitionierte sch ler k nnen in ihren bevorzugten f chern vor allem mit vertiefenden inhalten zus tzlich motiviert werden

5213188 das interessante an dem austausch mit lehrern ist dass sie einen erfahrungsvorsprung in bezug auf sozialkunde haben umgekehrt haben wir einen berblick ber aktuelle wissenschaftliche diskussionen das ist eine spannende mischung die bisher gute ergebnisse gebracht hat
5213189 in our experiments we explore couplings between atoms in proteins
5213190 our goal is to translate genomic information into high resolution structural information and thereby be able to better understand the function of the proteins
5213191 with increased speed and sensitivity we can obtain very high resolution spectra
5213192 and because we can resolve thousands of signals at a time one for each atom in the sample we can determine the structure of the entire protein
5213193 using this technique we can more precisely define the fragments of the molecule and how they are oriented
5213194 that allows us to define protein features and determine structure at the atomic scale
5213195 the first flight was a success and made the first in situ measurements of gases in a volcanic plume using meteorological balloons
5213196 with flight visualization using google earth we were looking at tropospheric volcanic emissions of sulfur dioxide carbon dioxide and water which can be hazardous to human and animal health and degrade ecosystems
5213197 we could count the rows of trees to find the balloon
5213198 we are fairly confident of three findings first this work is feasible for measuring sulfur dioxide so2 and carbon dioxide co2 in volcanic emissions for several hours after eruptions second there is a loss of so2 after one hour of flight away from the source which could reflect conversion to sulfate aerosol which may lower the earths temperature by reflecting away solar radiation and third there is a clear stratification of so2 above co2 within the plumes
5213199 one of the largest subdivisions in america is ocean view and it is downwind from the volcano on the west side of the island
5213200 we detected sulfur dioxide over the development several hours after it was erupted into the atmosphere
5213201 we have to prove these two things to show that we really are getting a free lunch
5213202 the main principle of industrial ecology is to try and use our waste products to produce something of value
5213203 unsere ersten ergebnisse legen nahe dass man zum braten und frittieren lieber le mit ges ttigten fetts uren verwenden sollte
5213204 these events also underscore the fact that everyone is at risk for flooding the best way to have financial protection and peace of mind is with a flood insurance policy flood insurance is widely available and should be part of your insurance portfolio whether you live in a high or low to moderate risk area
5213205 residents and business owners need to prepare early to avoid taking a big risk
5213206 if a storm similar to the long island express were to strike the northeast today it would cause multiple feet of flood waters in minutes and inestimable damage to homes business and infrastructure
5213207 not in saint paul all my experiences have taught me that place matters deeply stories matter stories may be as important as food for survival
5213208 my hope is that the almanac begins a conversation between people about what the place they live in means to them

5213211 these amendments were considered by cabinet in the context of recent debate about jury trials theres been a couple of cases

5213215 my commitment with the club is 100 with the fans and the players i have said it 100 times my family is happy here the club is a massive club and the supporters are a nation
5213216 you have problems when you are not doing things that in my opinion as a manager you have to do in terms of signing players
5213217 i will be fighting and working as hard as i can i wont talk about any player because in april we talked about this and no one knew anything before
5213218 usually we like to do things with confidentiality but sometimes you cannot if you have the support of the owners who say you have the money then you make decisions to sign or not
5213219 i talked about what i wanted in april i had a player in mind and an idea i told them they have to buy top class players with the money we are bringing in all the owners should be really pleased the question is why we cannot do it buy barry
5213220 they the owners did not say no before they said no after four months
5213221 after four month they said the player is expensive in four months they said we will have to do something else maybe
5213222 we have to be quicker i said this four years ago it is easier to sign players i will fight and try to improve the squad
5213223 he is our player he is playing well i am trying to keep the balance in the team
5213224 i was told we had money plus the money we can bring in it was not a question of money it is something i cant explain it is clear that they were supporting me if we had the money

5213226 im now at tottenham but no one can disagree with me wanting to follow my dream im not angry about the decision of juande ramos to name me as a subsitute im not crying i only show my emotions to my close friends and family if i had been laughing when i was on the bench people would say i was an idiot eric cantona never smiled but i dont know if anyone ever asked him why he didnt look happier
5213227 but in the same breath i understand the city is doing its homework
5213228 but i dont think hes getting the health benefits hes not walking
5213229 i took this on to get a clear idea about it for the future
5213230 i think people thought there would be thousands of these

5213235 judges can punish men who force their daughters to marry like this
5213236 shows clearly that were not going to vote for taxes
5213237 it rejects the most draconian of cuts that would literally take food out of the mouths of kids
5213238 for this legislature to raise taxes in this economic climate is not only foolish it is outright irresponsible
5213239 various groups network with one another with a degree of anonymity that makes it very difficult for us they put information on the internet about how to evade law enforcement
5213240 in the more than 25 years of the animal liberation front relatively few people have been arrested and an even smaller number have been convicted
5213241 why have so few been caught according to most a l f activists preparation and reconnaissance is the key to staying safe
5213242 typically these groups do not conform to traditional hierarchical organizational structures
5213243 even if you catch someone they dont have information on the others
5213244 a lot of times they dont even know who the others are
5213245 these people are very secretive and they are really good criminals
5213246 they are a real challenge to the fbi they train each other in security not to talk on the phone how to send secure e mail messages they are very good at technology
5213247 people just watch sports on television at home with their friends and during the olympics if there is a television in a restaurant they might watch but there are no what you would call chinese sports pubs
5213248 dont know what they are talking about they offer their opinions with no justification of facts at all
5213249 maybe because of the olympic games people are watching more sports
5213250 and if people enjoy doing it so much they will want to do more of sitting together and drinking beer and watching games
5213251 i think this could make it because many people in china today want to go somewhere that is stylish to be seen
5213252 maybe they can go on and do well in the tournament i might be back for the next game

5213256 when we woke up and saw russian tanks in georgia we knew very well what this meant
5213257 the russian talk about helping others and bringing peace to georgia we dont buy it when did moscow ever enter a country without bringing peace
5213258 for us it is all about staying out of the russian sphere we forgot about russia for a decade now as frankenstein is being reassembled under a former kgb chief we remember it again
5213259 the russians want to keep their money their property in monaco and palm beach and have a good life

5213264 some elements acting for vested interests have made false allegations against me everything i have done will have long term benefits for pakistan
5213265 this tells us that sleeps role in emotional memory preservation is more than just mechanistic
5213266 in order to preserve what it deems most important the brain makes a tradeoff strengthening the memorys emotional core and obscuring its neutral background
5213267 emotional memories usually contain highly charged elements for example the car that sideswiped us on the ride home along with other elements that are only tangentially related to the emotion such as the name of the street we were traveling on or what store wed just passed
5213268 we were interested in examining whether sleep would affect memory for all of these elements equally or whether sleep might allow some of the event features to decay at a faster rate than others
5213269 our results revealed that the study subjects who stayed awake all day largely forgot the entire negative scene they had seen with their memories of both the central objects and the backgrounds decaying at similar rates
5213270 after an evening of sleep the subjects remembered the emotional items smashed car as accurately as the subjects whose memories had been tested only 30 minutes after looking at the scenes
5213271 by contrast sleep did little to preserve memory for the backgrounds i e street scenes and so memory for those elements reached a comparably low level after a night of sleep as it did after a day spent awake
5213272 this is consistent with the possibility that the individual components of emotional scene memory become unbound during sleep
5213273 you might say that sleep is actually working at night to decide what memories to hold on to and what to let go of
5213274 this is the first time anyone has done really fundamental hands on quantum mechanics with an organic led
5213275 we can convert the spin information into a current and manipulate it and change it
5213276 we are manipulating this information and reading it out again we are writing it and reading it
5213277 even the smallest transistor today consists of hundreds of thousands of atoms
5213278 the ultimate goal of miniaturization is to implement electronics on the scale of atoms and electrons
5213279 just like a mass on a spring the pulse produces an oscillation of the spins of singlets and triplets in the organic led
5213280 the leading foreign countries growing technological and military technical supremacy
5213281 neither the executive nor legislative branches have done enough to support a volunteer army
5213282 the failure to either quickly suppress the georgian air defense in spite of its rather rudimentary capabilities or to achieve supremacy in the air in spite of lack of fighter planes in the georgian air force reveals what poor condition the russian air force is in
5213283 military planning should be based on assumption of the worst case scenarios
5213284 it is the availability of strategic nuclear forces that reduces greatly the risk of a large scale military confrontation with other military great powers
5213285 the inefficiency of the procurement suits the military which does not see a real threat politicians and defense industry executives
5213286 the real problem of the russian military reform is not hard headed military men but their unwillingness and incapability to get and open up military information
5213287 pagano cortocircuita storia letteraria e invenzione letteraria e il risultato originale
5213288 re kappa un candido minore ironico e leggero allavventura nel migliore dei mondi possibili quello della cultura un mondo tanto bello che non di rado fa quasi schifo
5213289 vi qualcosa di stralunato nella sintassi aggrovigliata e furiosa di pagano qualcosa di brutale di poco letterario ma come se
5213290 pagano vuole rappresentare quellincrocio casuale di destini oppure quel verificarsi di congiunture che a volte annodano unesistenza o una rete di esistenze ad uno scartafaccio quella sorta di magia che dal nulla crea una straordinaria testimonianza del proprio essere ed esistere con le figure e gli intrecci di un universo fatto di parole
5213291 c scrittura in pagano cos come atmosfera e il tutto reso in un linguaggio contemporaneo ma in uno stile che guarda al post moderno con inserti strumentali mutuati dal passato sta nascendo uno scrittore a 360 gradi
5213292 a sfogliare le pagine del lavoro di pagano ci si sente come scossi da una scarica elettrica come se sorgesse repentino un imperativo categorico che spinge a dedicarsi alla parola
5213293 luciano pagano ha dimostrato di non aver paura di sperimentare e di saper dar vita a un teatrino di personaggi memorabili il tutto condito con ironia il che non guasta mai
5213294 pagano ci consegna un breve romanzo lineare compiuto e coinvolgente
5213295 i thought collage great way to talk about systems of power and pop culture we were using the media to talk about the media
5213296 the more negativland started appropriating media the more we thought about it means
5213297 we practiced hard and we were quite organized but we just didnt play enough games
5213298 when youre only playing against one team it kind of made it difficult to prepare against teams that use other systems

5213300 when we went to select this team we had 24 kids try out and that was it and we finished fourth in the nation
5213301 of the four losses we had here we lost to the gold medal winning team the silver and the bronze medal team these guys have nothing to hang their heads about at all it just goes to show you the talent level of this team and the talent level in moose jaw were fostering some good ballplayers here
5213302 we had a 3 1 lead and had a couple of errors cost us five runs in one of the innings
5213303 we managed to battle back and just didnt have enough to get through
5213304 when you dont bring that intensity to the table you probably dont have the quality at bats you want and we just didnt score enough runs plain and simple
5213305 i think it was just towards the end mark opened the door for me a couple of times
5213306 i really struggled putting but i kept hitting a lot of greens and making a lot of pars
5213307 i wish i could say i made five birdies coming in or something like that but i was just staying consistent making pars and mark had a couple of bad breaks towards the end
5213308 i thought all the guys competed hard and things went pretty good

5213329 i dont know if ill ever do another car movie after this because i really feel like we pushed it to the max and the only other car movie ill do is maybe a sequel to this knock on wood if this movie does well enough to deserve that i really think weve kind of raised the bar when it comes to car action weve done everything practical weve done spectacular stunts weve kept it r rated really hard weve had the actors do a lot of their own driving so you know i think weve really maxed our car movie so i think weve laid down a challenge to any one else i think were now the movie to beat

5213338 we know from history that trickle down economics doesnt work
5213339 but when you hand the average person just a few hundred dollars its life altering they spend the money on things they need and want and that money moves up the economic ladder reaching everyone above through their businesses that are now making more sales to more people
5213340 to bolster the sagging economy our leaders essentially borrowed money to hand taxpayers checks for 600 each and it worked
5213341 but this kind of stunt never works for long and borrowing money to bolster the economy is simply stupid what we need is a way to give the average person 600 1200 even 2 000 or more every month and ive figured out how to do it
5213342 i spent a full year and a lot of time and money working with co produccer chuck strinz on my new movie

5213350 its a whole different world you enter when you get into free to play its like the industry that weve all been missing and the second thing weve been missing is the idea of letting people pay what they want
5213351 ive made so many games and we never ever had the idea that people would pay more than the price of the game for the game no one would pay over usd 60 if its a usd 60 game on our 2moons game youve got people that spend usd 3000 happily and if we had more stuff for them to buy they would buy it
5213352 could you imagine if you were to take halo and offer it free to play how much money do you think some people would spend on halo if they had a huge array of items that they could buy i recon theres a cap out at about usd 10 000 when you think about it the most we ask for is usd 60 and when you get those people spending a lot of money it brings the average up on acclaim games right now we average usd 75 per person
5213353 save afghan lives defeating the enemies plan to discredit the afghan government
5213354 we recommend to all afghans to be vigilant at large public events and other locations where crowds gather and report suspicious behavior to security forces
5213355 all the time the enemy tries to carry out any kind of activity that it can but the afghan security forces are ready and we have already taken measures to disrupt any enemy activity
5213356 i really havent thought that far in advance right now i want to just go home and spend some time with my daughter and go from there
5213357 you dont have to put an age limit on your dreams
5213358 somehow giving childbirth came up and being in the stirrups
5213359 i was trying to tell them that after giving childbirth and getting back into shape i thought i was stronger and more flexible
5213360 was that it was really painful a lot more painful than the 50 free
5213361 daras comeback has been motivation for me every day in the pool
5213362 and i can attribute being here where i am today as definitely influenced by dara
5213363 im very lucky to have that balance between my swimming and being a mother
5213364 and i got that inspiration from working moms they have to do the same
5213365 i was thinking about how the whole atmosphere is going to be so different
5213366 it was just something i really looked forward to hanging out with the younger kids and trying to be like them its going to be different now im going to be going to pta meetings and be with the moms
5213367 we finally got him a little bit of run support
5213368 enough i guess i wouldnt say all that much run support by any means but it was good for him to get a win
5213369 its something that every one of us on the starting staff tries to do
5213370 put up good innings and quality starts and hope for the best ive been able to do that but unfortunately it hasnt been able to go my way and i think thats just baseball you cant go out there expecting to get a win every time
5213371 clearly its not going to hold up under the stress of me going out there every 5 days and throwing a lot of pitches
5213372 by no means do i want to go through another year with what im going through now
5213373 but at the same time i dont think i want my career to end this way either i think that lends me to think i want to pitch next year i think its easier to walk away if you can honestly tell yourself you know what i cant do it anymore and i dont know that i can answer that question right now because my body hasnt allowed me to do it this year as much i wanted to
5213374 when i was healthy i pitched well when i wasnt i didnt that makes it harder to say i cant do it anymore
5213375 if they dont want me to come back it really doesnt matter
5213376 i dont want to go anywhere else at this stage in my life ive done that i dont want to do it anymore
5213377 well see how things play out over the course of the winter for us and for him and his prognosis if he does have to have surgery
5213378 theres a lot of factors that we just dont have enough answers yet
5213379 whatever ive got in my career now i would have had a great deal more if id played in los angeles or chicago you name a town somewhere they were just grateful to have me around
5213380 i told you all i was going to be no 1
5213381 i dont want this sport to be an every 4 year sport
5213382 i think yeah we get the most attention every 4 years
5213383 thats probably the first question i have no answer to
5213384 the talent that i have the drive that i have the want to succeed the excitement about the sport im fortunate to have every quality that i have and i wouldnt trade it in
5213385 and over the past years i havent seen him change
5213386 you cant put it in words the level of achievement that he has done here is phenomenal and in my opinion well never ever see it again i just dont think that can ever be emulated or beaten in an age where the sport is so competitive and so close
5213387 he made the pressure putt in the u s open he won the tour de france and he knocked out the best fighter in the world in the 16th round with an uppercut he did absolutely everything sport is supposed to be and he did it with a smile on his face
5213388 my hope is that kids beat a path to their local pools
5213389 ive heard about ravens stadium in his hometown of baltimore watching the finals of the 400 medley relay finals live
5213390 thats 70 000 people at the reds game they watched the 100 fly live there was an announcement at yankee stadium ive heard people back home say its crazy theyre out to eat the tv is on and swimming is on
5213391 i definitely had to pull myself together the last couple of days i think its time i get a vacation
5213392 seeing how beautiful her routine was today i was pretty sure she had it and she deserved it
5213393 after it was a little hard for her i could see it in her eyes ive been in that position its really hard especially when your teammate does it
5213394 we got through that part when she was ready she came back out now were fine again
5213395 it looked like she grew up a couple of years in this competition the way she looks at me now shes very calm id like to keep it that way
5213396 in the past its always been about both of us
5213397 thank you mr president helen thomas at the white house
5213398 it was hard to convince helen to make this documentary
5213399 but when we found the talented rory kennedy we had made a match sort of a match made in heaven
5213400 it was in like 1960 and thomas was covering jackie and the family primarily and she wasnt covering my uncle yet
5213401 and so her editor called her at 3 a m and said you know we just got this news that carolines hamster died and she said you have to call white house press secretary pierre salinger right now and find out if this is true and so thomas didnt even think about it
5213402 she picked up the phone and she called pierre salinger and she said is it true is it true caroline kennedys hamster died and pierre salinger was like helen its 3 oclock in the morning are you insane youre calling me about this stupid hamster and you know she heard about that for a good long time
5213403 im most proud of demonstrating that we can successfully have market rates of return and at the same time investment into communities
5213404 many doubted they thought we would have to give up one side the financial that hasnt been the case
5213405 elizabeth and shanahan have worked tirelessly to build the family funds and to make them especially relevant to the bay areas low and moderate income communities
5213406 their leadership and forward thinking is making a real difference
5213407 were married in an intimate ceremony at their home in los angeles
5213408 wanted to help get children away from a life of crime and violence
5213409 thats why hes the king of comedy he never lost his soul in chicago
5213410 ellen and portia came out and posed for pictures with ellens mom and their two dogs
5213411 ellen was helping portia with the train of her dress which looked like a cinderella tutu
5213412 at the time she was terrified her career would be over if she revealed her sexual tendencies but then samantha ronson came on to the scene
5213413 jennifer aniston is the smartest most sophisticated person i think ive ever met
5213414 shes one of the most lovely people ive ever met in my life
5213415 its not about years its about going out with somebody being truthful on the way in being truthful in the middle and being truthful on the way out youre either a cheater or you break up and im not the first im the second and thats it theres no lying theres no bull
5213416 i ended a relationship to be alone because i dont want to waste somebodys time if somethings not right
5213417 i dont waste peoples time im sorry that the storys not interesting
5213418 but its about time that somebody stands up for that girl and i think shes great
5213419 i hope the sfmta will approach the fee increases with reason and practicality
5213420 given the beneficial aspects of street fairs to the community street fairs run by non profit organizations should be given special consideration to ensure that the increases are manageable
5213421 i think the substitution fee can go up a little since it hasnt seen an increase for quite some time
5213422 however it should be done over a five year period instead of three
5213423 the increase in logistical fees will put a burden on street fair organizers as funds and sponsors are already scarce
5213424 this is an underhanded attempt to repeal the street fair ordinance under the guise of transportation reform
5213425 it goes against the street fair ordinance that was a legacy of harvey milk and in this day and age in an era of gay equality it is a big step back for the city of san francisco
5213426 this association must tolerate what seems to be an endless use of post and webster streets for a series of look alike street fairs with the same purveyors of schlocky souvenirs mediocre food stands and exhibitors who have absolutely no relationship to the community
5213427 zissers comments show his disregard for the many nonprofit organizations asian artisans and businesses who are part of our community
5213428 its really unfortunate that people who move into this historically vibrant community can not appreciate its history and culture and result to making insulting comments about it
5213429 this was an opportunity to help educate the community and remind them that we can not take things for granted
5213430 geez dont you think he deserves a little payback this tart is ready to go
5213431 theres a combination of reality and voyeurism that captures the imagination
5213432 its really not fair of you to try to turn me against cynthia mom and i wish youd stop it because it puts me in a terrible position
5213433 the professional developers conference on october 27 and the windows hardware engineering conference the following week represent the first venues where we will provide in depth technical information about windows 7
5213434 we are both looking forward to turning our attention and blogging energies towards the community outside microsoft
5213435 the audience of enthusiasts bloggers and those that are the most passionate about windows represent the folks we are dedicating this blog to with this blog were opening up a two way discussion about how we are making windows 7 windows has all the challenges of every large scale software project picking features designing them developing them and delivering them with high quality windows has an added challenge of doing so for an extraordinarily diverse set of customers as a team and as individuals on the team we continue to be humbled by this responsibility we strongly believe that success for windows 7 includes an open and honest and two way discussion about how we balance all of these interests and deliver software on the scale of windows we promise and will deliver such a dialog with this blog planning a product like windows involves systematic learning from customers of all types in terms of planning the release weve been working with a wide variety of customers and partners pc makers hardware developers enterprise customers developers and more since the start of the project we also continue our broad consumer learning through telemetry customer experience improvement program usability studies and more one area this blog will soon explore is all the different ways we learn from customers and the marketplace that inform the release we have two significant events for developers and the overall ecosystem around windows this fall the professional developers conference winhec the following week both represent the first venues where we will provide in depth technical information about windows 7 this blog will provide context over the next 2 months with regular posts about the behind the scenes development of the release and continue through the release of the product
5213436 in leading up to this blog we have seen a lot of discussion in blogs about what microsoft might be trying to accomplish by maintaining a little bit more control over the communication around windows 7 some might say that this is a significant understatement

5213439 our duty is to act decisively and make sure we understand what it is like to cope with rising food fuel and utility bills
5213440 if as a result of the current economic situation the only way to help hard pressed middle class families is to ask the highest earners to pay more then serious consideration should be given to that
5213441 yes protect those on the lowest incomes but also help the hard working middle classes with large mortgage commitments who are neither rich nor poor the people who work long hours for their two holidays a year leisure club membership meals out with family and friends and ability to buy their children nice things

5213445 a giant nude child i dont think he was even circumcised but we didnt get complaints quite the opposite
5213446 the intent of the cover is to satirize the vicious and racist attacks and rumors and misconceptions about the obamas that have been floating around in the blogosphere and are reflected in public opinion polls
5213447 what we set out to do was to throw all these images together which are all over the top and to shine a kind of harsh light on them to satirize them thats part of what we do
5213448 the image isnt too far from the dangerous truth about the obama family
5213449 about one out of 10 americans continue to believe that sen barack obama d illinois is a muslim after all
5213450 its satire i get it i you knew satire you would get it
5213451 its ingenious you folks dont get it if you knew art you would get it
5213452 i m not an american i m one of 22 mil victims of americanism
5213453 there are so many ways to express love and i felt that by designing an interchangeable charm bracelet with symbols of love would be a perfect way
5213454 i design my pieces for those who embrace and want to express the connection of love they cherish with friends family and in relationships
5213455 we are taking enforcement action against those businesses found to be displaying false information
5213456 the younger kids are focusing more on their planning and problem solving while they are actually playing the game while adolescents are focusing less on their planning and strategizing and more on the here and now
5213457 the single best predictor of their skills is how much they had played video games in the past and how much they played now those were better predictors of surgical skills than years of training and number of surgeries performed
5213458 so the first question you might ask your surgeon is how many of these surgeries have you done and the second question is are you a gamer

5213465 i appreciate the collaborative effort the bargaining teams made in confronting key issues facing employees and qwest especially health care
5213466 im confident qwest will be a stronger company because of tonights result
5213467 oil prices also fell to the lower end of the recent trading range on friday so some traders in the market probably saw that as a buying opportunity
5213468 we dont believe theres a need to place additional volume on the market
5213469 when i was thinking about it i was getting ahead of myself
5213470 i was like calm down first you need to go out there and do it

5213474 greetings from china it is 5 a m here and i am so excited that i just cant go to bed
5213475 there are no words to describe the feeling when you know that youve sealed the deal
5213476 going into the last 400 meters of the race i knew for sure that we had secured gold and i just kept saying over and over in my head youre gonna win a gold medal
5213477 the eight man boat is all about working in unison and so when we work together we win together
5213478 they are a really great group weve been together for almost 4 years now working towards this goal so it felt amazing to celebrate with them
5213479 i stay up at night thinking about how i can get our offense going and clicking again like it was
5213480 im puzzled by it im open to suggestions and ill listen to what anybody has to say fans cabdrivers or president bush or anybody
5213481 for 3 years some of the guys weve had in our lineup the big guys in our lineup theyve produced a lot of runs all of a sudden its hard for us to score runs now
5213482 when are you going to go back to the show
5213483 it was a setup they wanted me to sign a contract for 10 episodes rather than the usual 27 which meant my income which was not that large in the first place was cut in half
5213484 i remember an episode where they had will going to the lamaze classes with me
5213485 i wanted to know why philip wouldnt go with me
5213486 but i am not surprised i always knew he would become very large one day
5213487 ive been trying to make it happen for nine years until i finally did it myself i produced it myself
5213488 he knew every single dinosaur that there was we had to get bugs and snakes and every book that existed because he was so driven
5213489 to see themselves as smart and excited about science and math
5213490 i explained to xabi why i needed money by selling players i told him we also have mascherano lucas gerrard and plessis in midfield and we need to have eight british players
5213491 i need to bring british players in and i needed a left footed player
5213492 when i was talking with him we needed the money after some months it was not a question of money it was a question of keeping the balance
5213493 in my mind i just wanted to get up as far as i could and basically bury the field
5213494 when i got to 6 under for the day i was doing exactly what i wanted to do
5213495 w kolejnych kwarta ach 2008 r mo na spodziewa si stabilizacji na wysokim poziomie zar wno cen jak i popytu na stal rosn ce ceny wyrob w hutniczych maj uzasadnienie w stale wzrastaj cych kosztach produkcji stali w tym g wnie kosztach surowc w rudy elaza koksu oraz energii dodatkowym czynnikiem stabilizuj cym wysokie ceny stali w perspektywie kolejnego kwarta u mo e by sezonowy popyt ze strony sektora budowlanego konstrukcji stalowych oraz budownictwa infrastrukturalnego
5213496 the new guys coming in have to put pressure on the guys in the slots
5213497 liam bilbo has put two solid performances together which is good to see frank murphy and sean cronin came in and put in good performances
5213498 he was on the u20 grand slam winning team and has made appearances in the churchill cup in the past two years it is important that he gets game time
5213499 palabras me sostienen tanto como la tierra tanto como el cielo
5213500 piedra preciosa en su noche sangrienta nuestra patria resplandece a lo lejos
5213501 para nuestra patria cautiva la libertad de morir consumida de amor
5213502 otro importante poema de darwish en el que el destinatario po tico es impl citamente el ocupante israel encontramos nuevas im genes de la tierra palestina que en mi lectura reafirman la visi n de una patria cercana al para so en la primera estrofa leemos
5213503 vosotros ten is espadas nosotros sangre vosotros ten is acero y fuego nosotros carne vosotros ten is otro tanque nosotros piedras vosotros ten is gases lacrim genas nosotros lluvia
5213504 nuestra patria pr xima a la palabra divina un techo de nubes un horizonte celeste
5213505 ciertamente allah recompensar con el para so a los creyentes que sacrifiquen sus vidas y sus bienes combatiendo por la causa de allah hasta vencer o morir sta es una promesa verdadera que est mencionada en la tor el evangelio y el cor n y allah es quien mejor cumple sus promesas alegraos pues por este sacrificio que hac is por el y sabed que as obtendr is el triunfo grandioso

5213512 annuler une partie du paquet fiscal pour pouvoir donner un peu dair notamment sur les dispositions sociales
5213513 ca permettrait de redonner un suppl ment de croissance et d viter la r cession

5213522 i was very aggressive throwing the first pitch for strikes
5213523 that allowed me to go out there for the ninth i was just doing my job
5213524 some of these things come back right away and theyre ready to go a lot of players play with these things
5213525 well just see how he feels throwing tomorrow if he can
5213526 from my standpoint i think hes going to be just fine
5213527 i didnt know james orthwein well but i did share one of my lifes most memorable moments with him and my family back on january 21 1994 that was the day that i purchased the new england patriots from mr orthwein
5213528 mexico is californias number one inbound market generating approximately 1 58 billion in spending so declines in that market would have a major impact on our economy including loss of jobs
5213529 in my role as national chair for the travel industry association im also concerned about what impeding travel would mean to the u s travel industry and economy just a five percent decline in overnight visitation from mexico would mean a loss of approximately 700 000 travelers and over 400 million in spending with a disproportionate impact on americas border states
5213530 the increase in business and leisure travel from mexico partially compensates for a decline of 2 million overseas visitors to the u s between 2000 and 2007
5213531 we must nurture and enhance this critical travel market through more efficient and secure travel systems and by combating a growing negative perception among mexican travelers that the u s has removed its welcome mat also our new requirements for u s citizens to provide passports in mexico have added a burden on mexican border states as well
5213532 inbound international travel is a leading american export providing a 17 4 billion trade surplus in 2007
5213533 just as the federal government is deeply involved in promoting trade with our neighbor to the south so too should it be involved in promoting travel to the united states
5213534 it seems we dont find out until they walk in the hospital door
5213535 if i as the mayor cross the border it takes me a lot longer than its taking some of these wounded folks clearly some deals have been made at a higher level of government and we didnt know about them
5213536 if i got shot down there do you think id get this kind of an escort id be lucky to come back in a garbage truck
5213537 we dont know whether some of the people being brought here are bad guys or good guys but the history south of the border is that these people hit men will go to the hospital to finish the job if they need to were not equipped to deal with threats like that
5213538 sister a real terrible thing has happened to our town
5213539 weve got a lot of people here who need help we cant just throw them out on the street
5213540 theyre our family theyve made their homes here had jobs here raised families here
5213541 this town has constantly been changing it had opened its heart to change but now i sense anguish within people
5213542 they are asking whats going to happen to the town
5213543 a lot of good workers were taken away a lot of good families are gone
5213544 the community is drained of our giving energy of wondering how long the new people will stay if it will be a culture that fits into our community we are grieving scared apprehensive
5213545 i am very nervous i dont know what is going to happen and i dont know if i have the strength to keep fighting
5213546 i wish i could plead with the judge for my childrens sake that he would give me a little more time here so my children could continue studying so i could keep working
5213547 you come here with so many plans and illusions that your children will do better than you did
5213548 what joy that gives me to hear i see that they could have a future
5213549 it wounds my soul to think that i might not be able to give them what they desire to think that i might fail them
5213550 i wish people could put themselves in our situation for one moment what would they do if they were poor if they were in dire need wouldnt they risk coming here as well
5213551 i wish that the hearts of people with hearts of stone of ice the people of ice could be transformed into good hearts we came here to work not to do harm to anyone
5213552 they are serious offenses and we will not apologize for enforcing the nations laws if 305 u s citizens had committed identity theft and misuse of social security numbers would people expect us to look the other way
5213553 any disruption whether to families or communities should be put at the feet of those who violate the law
5213554 what happened here is a microcosm of whats happening in the country
5213555 if nothing is done there will be many many more postvilles around the country and thats not healthy for anyone
5213556 i hope our little town will survive i think it will
5213557 weve gotten through lots of things and well get through this too itll take awhile and its tough but were just a resilient bunch in iowa
5213558 i heard there was work here so i came first to get settled if it works out then i will bring them
5213559 before we tolerated everything they did to us at the plant we worked very hard but we lived free
5213560 now we have no work we are not free and we have no idea what will happen to us
5213561 caves have been modified to house temples probably dedicated to xibalba cult considering they are located in hard to reach places buildings are complex some shafts reaching 30 or 40 meters long
5213562 this is proof of an intentional trace similar to balakanche cave at chichen itza
5213563 even if you have lots of sequence for complex communities it still doesnt tell you which organism is responsible for which function
5213564 this publication presents an approach via simplification and targeted metagenomic sequencing of how you can go after the function in the environment
5213565 to utilize these single carbon compounds organisms employ very specialized metabolism
5213566 we suspect that in the environment there are novel versions of this metabolism and possibly completely novel pathways
5213567 even if the impeachment process against me is defeated the office of president would be demeaned and it won t give a right message
5213568 the iranian development and testing of rockets is troubling and raises further questions about their intentions
5213569 this action and dual use possibilities for their ballistic missile program have been a subject of iaea discussions and are inconsistent with their un security council obligations
5213570 iran still has a long way to go as far as satellites are concerned and it deliberately exaggerates its air and space successes in order to dissuade israel or the united states from attacking its nuclear sites
5213571 it is clear that for years iran has had shihab 3 ballistic missiles which put israel within its reach but the threat posed by iran comes from its nuclear programme and not from its satellites or ballistic missiles
5213572 not getting it up and down on 11 kind of ticked me off
5213573 i kind of told myself im letting the tournament get away from me again that was where the tournament was won for me
5213574 i kind of felt like i let the tournament slip away on 10 and 11
5213575 i told myself on the next tee box i got my momentum ive got to put the pressure on scott and hit a great tee shot ive got a chance to really put the hammer down
5213576 h tten wir den markt vor f nf jahren ge ffnet als die preise noch tief waren w rden sie jetzt sinken

5213578 despu s de consultar con mis consejeros legales y con mis aliados pol ticos y siguiendo su consejo he tomado la decisi n de dimitir
5213579 enviar hoy mi dimisi n al presidente de la asamblea nacional
5213580 desgraciadamente ciertas personas con intereses personales han lanzado falsas acusaciones en mi contra han enga ado al pueblo
5213581 we dont make enough 1980s straight to video genre flicks
5213582 weve come up with an original story that addresses relevant issues such as petrol prices media and the general direction the world is heading
5213583 could be used to conceal someones identity or could be used in the course of a criminal act
5213584 we jump to first place in military to civilian job boards matching our ranking in military to civilian career fairs and the purchase gives us a highly competitive position in publishing
5213585 i couldnt help but make a couple of playful swipes at six sigma lean agile and uml mind you i have nothing against these tools per se but i have taken exception with the people who worship use them
5213586 lange erwartet und seit gestern realit t am 15 august 2008 durchbrach der brite andy carter mit seinem lucas oil land meco top fuel dragster auf der hockenheim quartermile zum ersten mal in zentral europa die 500 stundenkilometer marke
5213587 el presidente se dirigir al pa s a la una
5213588 lo primero que hemos hecho ha sido dar la enhorabuena al equipo dan s por ser los nuevos campeones ol mpico es lo que ten amos que hacer con el ganador en cuanto a nosotros tenemos que estar contentos pues vinimos a por una medalla y tenemos la plata que para nosotros es un s per xito
5213589 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
5213590 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
5213591 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5213592 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5213593 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5213594 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5213595 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
5213596 the rest of the boat was still rowing i put my oar down i was done
5213597 were really proud to be in the same league as those amazing women
5213598 before we left princeton we all gathered together at my house and we watched the 1984 race and it was really inspiring
5213599 just to see those women be so cool when it was neck and neck and they pulled away at the end thats what we envisioned
5213600 it felt like we got faster put it that way
5213601 on the schuylkill at college thats where i fell in love with this sport
5213602 probably the most professional group ive ever worked with no fear
5213603 they came down smiling to the boathouse today which was a good sign
5213604 unfortunately there are some people who have self interest and they are putting their interests above those of the country
5213605 some people are trying to blame me and they are making false accusations against me
5213606 there is time but you dont want to get too far behind
5213607 at this time of the year if you get five or six games behind its not like you cant do it but youve really got to play good and the team ahead of you has got to fold or go through a bad streak
5213608 im open for suggestions ill listen to what anybodys got to say fans cab drivers
5213609 its very important that you stay upbeat and you stay cool and you stay relaxed were definitely trying if anything maybe were trying too hard the only reason i say that is because we take fastballs and we swing at balls out of the strike zone if we dont win its our fault because we are definitely capable of winning our division we definitely can control our destiny
5213610 he pitched himself right into some 2 0 3 1 counts thats not good hes a contact guy he doesnt throw in the strike zone hes not going to be out there long
5213611 i cant describe it in words its just not possible to me
5213612 its as simple as that my son underwent an operation and the only reason he managed to get that treatment is because i am earning money i have no choice
5213613 i have total respect for her i dont know how she does it she really is amazing in our eyes im really glad she medaled
5213614 i think i false started then i kind of hesitated it was really a rookie mistake
5213615 no one expected me to win so there was no pressure
5213616 i know some people have problems with them announcing sobriety checks but that actually deters some of the activity
5213617 its not an accident people drink and drive on purpose
5213618 the world is moving towards integration like the integration of the americas the european union and asean taiwan does not want to be marginalized

5213628 our daughter tess was diagnosed with hepatoblastoma a rare liver cancer last september
5213629 she was only seven months old then and we were really scared but throughout this whole ordeal shes shown all of us that shes a fighter
5213630 we came up with the beer pong idea because its such a popular game especially here in the northeastern united states
5213631 then we simply got online and found collegebeergames com where we could buy some beer pong tournament to raise money it might sound crazy but we think itll be fun and raise awareness in people who might not have ever thought to donate to cancer research
5213632 i have to admit i thought it was a little odd at first because this game is simply about having a little fun
5213633 but why not support a great cause while having a good time
5213634 after learning about this story you really cant help but root for tess and all the other people who are dealing with this disease im actually honored that collegebeergames com has gotten this opportunity to contribute to this great cause
5213635 let me repeat liu xiang will not withdraw unless the pain is unbearable
5213636 after viewing the situation and consulting legal advisers and political allies with their advice i have decided to resign a grim faced musharraf said backed by pakistani flags and a portrait of the countrys founder
5213637 not a single charge in the impeachment can stand against me musharraf said
5213638 no charge can be proved against me because i never did anything for myself it was all for pakistan
5213639 on the map of the world pakistan is now an important country by the grace of allah he said
5213640 thats not an issue on the table and i just want to keep our focus on what we must do with the democratic government of pakistan rice said

5213653 there are big nations there are huge populations there is unbelievable economic development in some parts of the world so what we have to do is instead of unilateral actions act all together make common decisions and have consultations with the world a new world order if i can say it should emerge
5213654 such a deal by turkey with iran would send the wrong message at a time when the iranian regime has repeatedly failed to comply with its un security council and iaea obligations
5213655 we png want our young people to get exposure and experience and a bit of money to improve their lives in png he said in a written statement

5213662 it definitely means a lot just getting a win but it also means a lot just being able to finally get one in san diego
5213663 any time you come home you want to do the best you possibly can
5213664 we werent able to really go out there and succeed
5213665 i think thats more the focus its all about the team when you start focusing on your own goals youre going to get yourself in trouble the ultimate goal is to get to the playoffs and get to the world series one win doesnt really mean anything a 5 2 record would have been a lot better
5213666 i didnt feel my finger shaking but i guess it was
5213667 old competitions i played back home kept running through my head and calmed me
5213668 i said that the last time this happened the last time the reason was katy this time i dont know what the reason is yet but im sure something goods going to come from it
5213669 when i was young i always dreamed about finishing in the top 10 in the olympics
5213670 but after sydney i realized that if i was going to do that i probably had to move up to the marathon
5213671 my times are getting better and im doing something i love
5213672 my guys did an unbelievable job getting me off pit road
5213673 this is unbelievable were winning races were gearing up for the chase im feeling stronger than ever were here to win championships thats what were shooting for
5213674 guys are trying to get used to each other especially in the preseason weve got guys rotating in and out so much youre hardly ever next to the same guy i think thats part of it thats why you play preseason games to get the timing down
5213675 its a little bit of both having new guys in new positions and getting used to the technique and executing your blocks
5213676 at the same time the other team is making plays we have to make and finish plays rather than allow them to get into the lanes were supposed to keep them out of
5213677 right now we kind of have an idea whos going to be out there were trying to roll some guys in including some of the younger guys who we may not have seen in a game setting
5213678 i was thinking about running before i even made the catch
5213679 im thinking about everything you cant do nothing without the ball im trying to make a play instead of focusing on little things
5213680 the most important thing on offense is to secure the ball first whether it be a handoff catching a pass or fielding a punt
5213681 as far as special teams ive never done it i want to go out and prove to myself that i can do it
5213682 special teams is all about effort its a one play kind of situation
5213683 you dont get to line up on second down and remake anything special teams requires you to go 100 percent
5213684 watching the films what i see is a lot of guys here learning the system working to get into place
5213685 its preseason right now and its trial and error were going to get better by the time the season comes
5213686 the lanes on the punt returns you have to be patient back there im seeing some lanes but it seems hard to get to them but im going to stay patient and work on it
5213687 i know they are great fans but there are also people i will say for a minute that i read message boards and got caught up in that whole thing
5213688 that even put more stress on me just worrying about what people thought about me people say a lot of times i dont care what people think about me me personally i dont care how people perceive me when they look at my hair but i like people to think great things about shawn andrews but you cant please the world
5213689 i patted him on the head and just said go bonner
5213690 bronze is awesome my first olympics my first olympic medal
5213691 the dutch were just sitting and the australians in fifth and poles in sixth were just sitting
5213692 i said all right boys were in fourth lets go to bronze right now ready and go they responded we started getting out and it became a three way race
5213693 its almost like you go in a hole and pray to god you come out the other end
5213694 its always a risky move because if you go too far in the hole and someone else has something left it will hit you right on the backside its risky but its rewarding when it pays off
5213695 people said to me going in this is a lot of pressure

5213808 when i was talking with him we needed the money after some months it was not a question of money it was a question of keeping the balance
5213809 not getting it up and down on 11 kind of ticked me off
5213810 i kind of told myself im letting the tournament get away from me again that was where the tournament was won for me

5213815 the line is kind of everything is organized so that its kind of fly by but some people lean in and say positive things im dealing with it keep your head up it really makes me feel good that im not the only one going through it
5213816 i kind of feel like some of the fans are going through it with me those that are admitting it those that know that they have it
5213817 i was kind of pessimistic how my teammates would receive me
5213818 there were a lot of rumors i admitted to my teammates i created a lot of those rumors at the time coach andy reid didnt know the truth people were saying it was really about his contract didnt want to play football anymore and i admit that i created those rumors just out of a lot of frustration and didnt care what people thought
5213819 you have a guy whos quick tempered whos to the point where i really didnt care anymore thats not the real me i just didnt realize what i was going through

5213823 i just felt like whether they believed me or not i did my part in my mind i hope they believe me i think for the most part they do and i hope they respect me if they dont they will
5213824 i really cant put it into words id like their respect as a player but id like their respect as a person first life is short and there are a lot more things i can count that are more important than football
5213825 like i said i had a million and one thoughts going through my head
5213826 i just lost my love for a lot of things i didnt know which direction i was headed football wasnt even a thought
5213827 i would love to play against the patriots i mean it feels good to be back and around my teammates
5213828 you dont get that camaraderie in too many other places
5213829 not getting it up and down on 11 kind of ticked me off

5213838 when i get that many runs i think just throw strikes and be aggressive
5213839 everything was working with that many runs just continue to pound the strike zone
5213840 every time we come here we get some crazy games
5213841 we start out good with the uribe home run and we took advantage of the guy not throwing strikes he was all over the place and when he tried to find the plate we didnt miss them
5213842 we finally got him a little bit of run support
5213843 enough i guess i wouldnt say all that much run support by any means but it was good for him to get a win
5213844 its something that every one of us on the starting staff tries to do
5213845 put up good innings and quality starts and hope for the best ive been able to do that but unfortunately it hasnt been able to go my way and i think thats just baseball you cant go out there expecting to get a win every time

5213858 about 4 years ago my wife and i decided to buy as many presents as possible online to avoid the traffic and malls and find online discounts instead we ended up saving almost 20 off what we would have paid retail with local taxes by using coupons and free shipping offers ive been a big fan of finding the best deals online since
5213859 many of the online coupon and deal sites are difficult to use its tough to find expiration dates we wanted to make a site and list as many deals as possible every day organize them and make it easy to search
5213860 sometimes a store will have a 20 off coupon running at the same time as a 10 off coupon with free shipping even if there is a great deal on the home page of a site still search for the merchant or product name to be sure youre getting the best possible deal

5213864 we both had a discussion about how americans are truly a great people and they dont deserve to be hated by all the other countries so we thought we would be the best people to share that not everyone in the world hates americans we wanted to speak on behalf of non americans who recognize the contributions americans have made to the world they have done so much for the world in advances in technology and then there is the support america has provided for other countries after natural disasters how quickly the world forgets so this is our way of saying thank you to the american people
5213865 a user reports that certain ingredients can be found in a store and comments on the quality of those ingredients we then take everything we know about those ingredients to create a profile of the store this allows us to recommend ingredients that have not been directly reported there and give users a more complete picture of the stores merchandise

5213875 i started rowing there and loved the sport there and to come back to philadelphia with the gold is absolutely incredible
5213876 before the race that was one of the things i thought about making my hometown abington and my university upenn proud to have an olympian and now an olympic champion
5213877 greetings from china it is 5 a m here and i am so excited that i just cant go to bed

5213880 the eight man boat is all about working in unison and so when we work together we win together
5213881 they are a really great group weve been together for almost 4 years now working towards this goal so it felt amazing to celebrate with them
5213882 i told you all i was going to be no 1
5213883 i dont want this sport to be an every 4 year sport
5213884 i think yeah we get the most attention every 4 years
5213885 thats probably the first question i have no answer to
5213886 the talent that i have the drive that i have the want to succeed the excitement about the sport im fortunate to have every quality that i have and i wouldnt trade it in
5213887 and over the past years i havent seen him change
5213888 you cant put it in words the level of achievement that he has done here is phenomenal and in my opinion well never ever see it again i just dont think that can ever be emulated or beaten in an age where the sport is so competitive and so close
5213889 he made the pressure putt in the u s open he won the tour de france and he knocked out the best fighter in the world in the 16th round with an uppercut he did absolutely everything sport is supposed to be and he did it with a smile on his face
5213890 my hope is that kids beat a path to their local pools
5213891 ive heard about ravens stadium in his hometown of baltimore watching the finals of the 400 medley relay finals live
5213892 thats 70 000 people at the reds game they watched the 100 fly live there was an announcement at yankee stadium ive heard people back home say its crazy theyre out to eat the tv is on and swimming is on
5213893 for the final you need to go all out and if the pain cant effectively be eased it will definitely have an effect
5213894 thats how golf goes its four rounds 72 holes and anything can happen
5213895 i stay up at night thinking about how i can get our offense going and clicking again like it was

5213907 those claims are disgraceful theyre an insult to prison officers who go to work each day to do their job
5213908 i think there should be measures to reduce the overtime levels but to casualise the workforce isnt going to make it safer
5213909 what we do have is an overtime culture and its been a strong overtime culture
5213910 that in itself creates fatigue and associated sick leave which then fuels further claims for overtime

5213914 fay could be approaching hurricane strength when it nears the florida keys monday night
5213915 there exists a possibility of moderate flooding on the southern and northern shores of the island and in its western parts
5213916 most of haiti is under heavy rains especially in the south with winds clocked at about 70 kilometers per hour 43 mph
5213917 demand for raw materials in the emerging market economies has remained strong
5213918 in particular china remains a key driver of global commodity consumption through its position as a net importer of raw materials
5213919 the effects of current weaknesses in the developed economies on demand for our commodities should be minimal driven by ongoing strong demand from the emerging economies
5213920 the point is the party is united were coming together
5213921 we are now entering one of the most intense political periods that we have ever seen
5213922 we are jamming in a lot of major events the selection of each candidates vice president their national conventions the debates and election day all in an almost 10 week period
5213923 my greatest moral failing and i have been a very imperfect person is the failure of my first marriage
5213924 which covers additional information and variations on the stitch not covered here
5213925 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
5213926 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
5213927 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
5213928 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
5213929 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
5213930 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
5213931 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
5213932 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
5213933 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
5213934 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
5213935 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
5213936 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
5213937 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
5213938 it is the simplicity of gameplay that first made snake ideal for mobile phones
5213939 stop motion animations are very basic and you can make extraordinary things happen without a lot of digital tinkering the same concept applies to the new snakes subsonic for n gage
5213940 snakes subsonic delivers the next evolution in mobile puzzle games
5213941 its an exciting combination of accessible gameplay fused with stylized presentation resulting in a rollercoaster ride in puzzle solving unlike anything else on mobile
5213942 do good things and good things will happen to you
5213943 there could be some supply disruption issues there so the market is watching this closely
5213944 the market will probably get through this hurricane news pretty quickly
5213945 he just made some mistakes early in the game and the guys hit him
5213946 otherwise that doesnt happen to him too often some days that happens
5213947 i definitely had to pull myself together the last couple of days i think its time i get a vacation
5213948 seeing how beautiful her routine was today i was pretty sure she had it and she deserved it
5213949 after it was a little hard for her i could see it in her eyes ive been in that position its really hard especially when your teammate does it
5213950 we got through that part when she was ready she came back out now were fine again
5213951 it looked like she grew up a couple of years in this competition the way she looks at me now shes very calm id like to keep it that way
5213952 in the past its always been about both of us
5213953 we did a lot of pre tests on all the components in isolation and fea finite element analysis studies on the structural design of the chassis before moving on to the physical tests the car has now completed 5800 kilometres without problems so were very happy with the progress we have a small number of engine software issues to finalise but tyre testing is now complete and michelin are ready and looking forward to a competitive season ahead
5213954 the first three seasons of a1gp have shown the cars to be remarkably safe protecting the drivers and allowing them to survive some major impacts
5213955 i am delighted that a1gp has taken the safety of its drivers so seriously and has committed to ensuring the cars stay at the forefront of safety technology and are willing to listen to advice from medical experts and other industry experts in order to achieve this
5213956 it is clear that more than one third of family businesses are close to changing the baton
5213957 you need to plan for it because each of your kids will not necessarily want to do what you think they want to do
5213958 they may have different plans and aspirations which at times can often shock a founder or a ceo
5213959 with the recent changes in both the global and local economic environment in particular increasing fuel prices and rising interest rates it is not surprising that australian family businesses has concerns
5213960 most family businesses are operating around broad unwritten family goals under leadership from the first generation founder
5213961 this is not always the most profitable way of operating and can lead to problems down the track around leadership succession
5213962 we invariably find that once they start the process suddenly the light comes on and its not anywhere near as threatening as they think it is going to be
5213963 we always find that people who have a go who start the succession journey ultimately end up with much better outcomes than those that stick their head in the sand

5213969 when i was thinking about it i was getting ahead of myself
5213970 i was like calm down first you need to go out there and do it
5213971 weve been waiting on this so many great athletes have come so close
5213972 when i was thinking about it i was getting ahead of myself
5213973 weve been waiting on this so many great athletes have come so close
5213974 some of these things come back right away and theyre ready to go a lot of players play with these things
5213975 well just see how he feels throwing tomorrow if he can
5213976 from my standpoint i think hes going to be just fine
5213977 i didnt know james orthwein well but i did share one of my lifes most memorable moments with him and my family back on january 21 1994 that was the day that i purchased the new england patriots from mr orthwein
5213978 and he has been staying in shape to show up at our camp in good shape
5213979 my guys did an unbelievable job getting me off pit road this is unbelievable were winning races were gearing up for the chase im feeling stronger than ever
5213980 i was very aggressive throwing the first pitch for strikes
5213981 that allowed me to go out there for the ninth i was just doing my job
5213982 i was coming down just like normal and everything was fine
5213983 i actually felt really good about the shot as it was coming in and i was getting on the trigger the gun just went off my first thought was like oh thats not good i hope thats in the black i looked down and it was in the black but it was a very bad shot
5213984 after viewing the situation and consulting legal advisers and political allies with their advice i have decided to resign
5213985 not a single charge in the impeachment can stand against me

5213988 no one else has ever provided a product like this in the history of the miami nightclub industry
5213989 this is something weve been working on for a very long time and were excited to offer something that no one else can it truly is the first south beach nightclub line pass ever
5213990 we have a lot of clients who want to experience the south beach scene but dont necessarily care for the glitz and glamour and expense that comes with vip bottle service so this product is perfect for them
5213991 i was very excited about the product about the quality of comfort and quality of support and health benefits the essentia products offer so i couldnt wait to get involved
5213992 there was a level of comfort that id never experienced before from a mattress or a pillow
5213993 athletes sweat a lot in their sleep and the natural memory foam helps control my body temperature rather than elevate it by creating a humid and sticky environment when i move at night my wife doesnt feel it so it doesnt wake her up and whats most important to both of us is that were breathing in fresh air rather than toxic chemicals while we sleep
5213994 we are really excited about launching stretch fx which we see as the beginning of a new line of products and services aimed at multimedia developers such as adobe flash developers
5213995 we want developers throughout the world to easily be able to create their own sound effects in an innovative way without having to invest in expensive equipment
5213996 digiffects and blastwave have given us a solid foundation to build upon
5213997 we are now focusing on bringing in lesser known providers who have high quality content they want to make available to the masses
5213998 a decision was made for the war to start in august the war would have happened regardless of what the georgians did whether they responded to the provocations or not there would have been an invasion of georgia
5213999 the goal was to destroy georgias central government defeat the georgian army and prevent georgia from joining nato
5214000 i think the russians took the wrong lessons from bucharest
5214001 there was a lot of russian pressure and rhetoric against both georgia and ukraine getting membership action plans before bucharest ive heard that russians regard bucharest as a success and what you saw after bucharest was an increase in pressure
5214002 what russia really wants is essentially to be able to do as it pleases in world affairs and to answer to nobody
5214003 it wants a totally free hand particularly in and around the cis it also needs to conjure up the idea of an enemy to justify its regime the fact of the matter is that the most immediate threat here is to georgia because the russian government could pack forces into the north caucasus to threaten georgia
5214004 we heard statements that the russian railroad troops that had entered abkhazia a couple of months ago were there on a humanitarian mission and now we know the truth about why those forces were there it was to rebuild the railroad to allow ammunition and other military supplies to aid a russian invasion
5214005 i am afraid that there is a very strong possibility that military activity will happen this year probably in the next month
5214006 this is a war that russia wanted and clearly had planned for
5214007 the evidence ive seen indicates that the russian army was sitting there waiting for this that this was essentially a provocation launched by the south ossetians who ratcheted up the level of violence in order to bring the georgians who are easily provokable obviously to attack
5214008 and the russians were waiting there ready with an operational plan and with forces in place land sea and air to do what they have subsequently done
5214009 it is difficult to imagine that russia prepared such a provocation while neither of the countrys two leaders was in moscow
5214010 it is also difficult to imagine that russia prepared to go to war and then when saakashvili fell into the trap waited 13 or 14 hours by my count before deploying forces
5214011 russias policies over the past several years caused this war and for this they bear responsibility
5214012 the u s response to the epidemic in black america stands in sharp contrast to our response to the epidemic overseas
5214013 cdc prevention efforts have really tried to follow the epidemic
5214014 i fear for my country when i realize that god is just and that justice does not sleep forever

5214024 on the map of the world pakistan is now an important country by the grace of allah
5214025 thats not an issue on the table and i just want to keep our focus on what we must do with the democratic government of pakistan
5214026 there is no doubt that this has been an enormous fall from grace for a man that lived 61 years in an exemplary fashion
5214027 the facts in this case are very serious indeed unbelievable for a male with no prior convictions to set out and deliberately have sex with an underage female
5214028 it is never a childs fault when they are the victim of a crime
5214029 it was clearly within your contemplation that she was underage
5214030 i made a strong case for the job because i think it is the next big challenge in football and i really wanted to be a part of it
5214031 to be involved in the birth of a club and to build a list from the bottom up is very exciting
5214032 as someone whose life is recruiting it really is one of the greatest opportunities available in recent football history
5214033 we are starting to build the core of a very strong football club not just a team
5214034 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
5214035 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
5214036 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5214037 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5214038 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5214039 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5214040 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
5214041 after viewing the situation and consulting legal advisers and poltical allies with their advice i have decided to resign
5214042 not a single charge in the impeachment can stand against me
5214043 no charge can be proved against me because i never did anything for myself it was all for pakistan

5214045 thats not an issue on the table and i just want to keep our focus on what we must do with the democratic government of pakistan
5214046 the cash poll has indicated all along the leadership is there for the taking if mr costello wants it
5214047 he has enjoyed constant support from punters betting on the liberal leadership at the next election
5214048 brendan nelson is becoming less popular with punters by the day
5214049 i confirm that there was a communication from me to him about him resigning however in the overall scheme of moving fiji forward this issue does not matter
5214050 if a rather tenuous interim government sees interim ministers resigning from it i would have thought it would further destabilise the situation in fiji
5214051 its too late for labour to try and redeem itself after being part of an illegal administration
5214052 while people will welcome chaudhrys exit from government he has failed badly as finance minister and the economy has shown very little sign of progress hes just running away from the mess he has created
5214053 the value of our dollar today would have been about 20 cents had we not taken the measures that we took those who talk about the economy not doing well under the interim administration dont know what they are talking about
5214054 after consultations with legal advisers and close political supporters and on their advice im taking the decision of resigning
5214055 ive had a fantastic relationship with our club our people its been great and its been 12 years now that ive been at the club ever since it opened its door
5214056 i understand times come in football and if the club decides its time to go and its not for me theyll look around and ill look around and thats where it is
5214057 but my choice if you ask me is to stay here and get the club back to where id like to see it at the top of the ladder
5214058 its really entirely up to the club when the contract is negotiated
5214059 ive got another year of my contract to go and over the last 12 years three of them weve finished top and weve won a premiership they never negotiated my contract any time prior to that the end of the existing deal so i cant imagine they would do it now
5214060 our players have some experience theyve got a little older the results might not show that but certainly we dont think were as bad as the position on the ladder is
5214061 but were not going to complain and say anything about that its only up to us to prove that from now on
5214062 tropical storm fay poses some risks to the oil and gas production in the gulf
5214063 these two guys back country skiers turned up at the top of the crag one of them walked out onto the top of the cornice and we remarked how dangerous is that and at that moment the cornice snapped off and we saw him go down with it
5214064 his brother just skied off the top and skied down a vertical face
5214065 it was amazing to watch him scream down there they were obviously very good skiers
5214066 the 22 year old was on top of the ice cornice at that stage when his brother noticed that it was unsafe and called out to him i presume he could see cracks or movement underneath
5214067 and as he attempted to move off the top of the cornice it collapsed underneath him

5214094 esto impide que la industria pueda comprar por encima de coste de manera que los productores se ven obligados a perder dinero en cada transacci n hasta el punto de que a d a de hoy muchos productores tienen que vender al 50 del precio de coste

5214096 tenemos muy claro que la soluci n a la situaci n que padecemos actualmente depende exclusivamente del propio sector somos nosotros los que tenemos que aportar soluciones y tener la voluntad de que stas se cumplan

5214108 i saw firemen get these women up into the cab
5214109 they are going round town getting whistled at by women and they are hanging out the windows of the fire engines
5214110 if a house is burning down where are they stuck in town
5214111 the vehicle in the photograph is a tyne and wear fire and rescue service operational appliance and were in the process of investigating the reasons why it has seemingly stopped in this location
5214112 while appliances may often be seen passing through the quayside in newcastle on their return to home stations after being called out to incidents or after carrying out other duties they shouldnt be parked unless its to deal with a query from a member of the public or to carry out a standard inspection of a premise
5214113 if that hasnt been the case in this situation we will be investigating and will be taking any necessary action
5214114 tyne and wear fire and rescue service would never condone the misuse of fire and rescue appliances or the valuable time of professional firefighters as its being alleged is the case here
5214115 as we got there a twin engined aircraft came over our heads flying quite low enough for us to notice and look up
5214116 literally as we watched it come over our heads more or less like a flash what i almost thought was a microlight came across and the twin engined plane smashed into it straight on and totally destroyed it it just fell apart as if it was made of balsa wood it was unbelievable
5214117 the twin engined aircraft banked heavily to the left and i think its right propeller came off
5214118 we thought it was trying to recover you are just thinking go on it seemed to get its height back for a little bit but then it nose dived into the trees we heard a deep rumble as it obviously crashed
5214119 i saw a plane travelling east coming down sharply straight towards the woods
5214120 i immediately thought it looked like something was wrong then at the last minute just 50 feet up the pilot managed to pull up the nose of the plane it looked like he was trying to save the plane from the trees but then i realised the plane was going down
5214121 id have to say that monckton won the debate he came across as more prepared and had answers at his fingertips whereas richard appeared to verbally stumble on occasion
5214122 i got the impression that littlemore was engaging in the debate totally unprepared
5214123 oh my this is very confusing no wonder the government says its too early to take action
5214124 they were all our first choices everyone said yes which is so rare
5214125 our motto has been get the story right get the facts right tell it honestly
5214126 aside from producing green obama t shirts earlier this year the obama campaign has not yet displayed the rhetoric or resources necessary to win its share of the irish american vote
5214127 barack obama needs the huge irish american vote in closely fought pennsylvania battlegrounds like pittsburgh and the philadelphia suburbs there are similar pockets of irish american swing votes in other key states
5214128 to ignore this irish dimension serves to the advantage of the implicit republican appeal on racial issues like affirmative action and religious issues like abortion
5214129 one cannot imagine hillary clinton avoiding such a trip surely an aspiring world leader would want to acquaint himself in greater detail with an apparent success story in the resolution of conflict
5214130 a more likely explanation might well be the unimportance his campaign strategists attach to the irish vote in america

5214140 we are becoming a more diverse culture and its something that has to be acknowledged
5214141 how are we supposed to then move forward if we keep using terms that bring back that pain
5214142 it seems like a president obama would be harder to make fun of than these guys
5214143 a recession may involve simultaneous declines in coincident measures of overall economic activity such as employment investment and corporate profits recessions may be associated with falling prices

5214146 they chose to be soldiers theres a great love for it
5214147 people just get lonely and need somebody to talk to
5214148 its great to go around and lift so many spirits
5214149 my 5 year old daughter asks daddy are you coming home tomorrow
5214150 it makes it easier for me to step up when hes just incredible
5214151 while i understand that were soldiers and do what were told they basically took my job away and made me do something i have no business doing
5214152 its ready to shoot people not inspect detainees for boo boos
5214153 they essentially have us coming in to be military police
5214154 theres still some people out there who take freedom for granted
5214155 its your personal responsibility to defend this country i hope i gave them a little bit of that
5214156 reflect how america has thought about the war in the beginning they were excited but now theyre wondering why were there
5214157 being out in camden and the ghetto this is definitely something thats going to help me progress in life
5214158 i wasnt out there doing what i was supposed to be doing now here i am making a career out of it
5214159 theyre renting to anybody and its really not good for the owners were suffering
5214160 unfortunately many of our high crime areas are also by coincidence our highest rental property areas and i think a lot of that has to do with the landlords not maintaining their properties or doing proper background checks and taking a good look at the people who move in
5214161 its amazing the divide between the residents and the landlords
5214162 until the residents of the community and the landlords together try to remedy those remote problem areas itll never be peace and harmony together
5214163 it has nothing to do with the state of mississippi

5214166 i had to do a double take and reread it to make sure i understood what was happening
5214167 as far as the pilots and the west gulf proposal all i can say at this time is theres no need for pilots to take any action on the proposal and we have no further comment
5214168 the pilots showed great flexibility and initiative to handle unique traffic needs
5214169 it is very gratifying to me that west gulf was proactive in trying to keep rates competitive and fair
5214170 the future of computing and consumer devices is increasingly visual and bandwidth intensive
5214171 lifestyles filled with high definition media and digital audio demand quick and universal data transfer usb 3 0 is an answer to the future bandwidth need of the pc platform amd believes strongly in open industry standards and therefore is supporting a common xhci specification
5214172 developers are the driving force behind android applications so without them it would be very hard for android to have a stance in the market
5214173 the android platform has a very strong base and a lot of potential but it also has a lot of competition
5214174 the adc finalists are helping us update the latest version of the sdk before we release it to the world in the coming weeks
5214175 we wanted to limit the challenges developers face with an early release in a particularly critical time during the challenge to not disadvantage them weve separated the scheduled releases to not disadvantage these winners who are competing for money and the public will receive a release of the sdk soon with more documentation and tools
5214176 the idea with open source software is to allow early adopters access to the buggier pieces of code so they can help fix them or let people who want to wait for a solid release the ability to do that
5214177 the key is choice and google has taken away that choice and is developing android like every other piece of closed software
5214178 rather than trying to push yet another platform google ought to be bringing the market together and building applications which is where theyre going to make their money
5214179 the developer discontent is just part of what has turned out to be a flawed strategy
5214180 its the very same reason why apple didnt do third party developers first and thats to assure the process and the program and the quality thats initially being offered
5214181 the community must not forget that google is dealing with partners in the cell phone industry and they certainly have a reputation of a closed source tight lipped mentality
5214182 the community can cry foul if google releases the newest sdk to developers a week before handsets hit the stores but as far as i have heard that is far from the truth
5214183 within the next six months symbian and android will combine into a single open source os
5214184 on the other hand it would be much easier to do now than to tackle it in the future when developers are that much farther down the road
5214185 to tie symbian and android together would require an awful lot of heavy lifting between google and nokia and to do that kind of an agreement would be problematic
5214186 it would have been easier while symbian was small and independent but now that symbian is basically a subsidiary of nokia its going to be pretty difficult
5214187 if you develop for apple youve got a ready market
5214188 if you develop for android its a crapshoot because theres no assurance that the android platform is even going to sell
5214189 while google does simple well this is googles first device as opposed to apple which clearly has been doing devices for a while
5214190 apple is treating developers terribly and really undermining the community
5214191 the fact that applications have to go through the itunes store in order to be distributed really shows how much control apple has over the entire os
5214192 at the end of the day developers want to make money
5214193 so theyre going to develop on a platform and put resources on a platform that will make them money
5214194 undoubtedly some developers have written android off and will never return
5214195 lots arent paying a darn bit of attention to the whole mess because there arent any devices ready yet
5214196 costs for labor materials and supplies and other operating expenses continue to rise

5214237 people are opportunistic a holes in general and what happens in a casino is there are an awful lot of opportunities for these kinds of sleazy behavior
5214238 gambling in all of its manifestations can be quite thrilling to people and exciting
5214239 crime is exciting to a lot of people a lot of crime is thrill driven

5214243 in my opinion it is the safest place in chester
5214244 potentially every movement at least on the gambling floor is being monitored
5214245 its not like i gamble today lose 50 and go out and commit a crime
5214246 weve had these thefts based on alleged gambling addictions long before harrahs ever opened
5214247 it seems like whether or not the casino is 10 miles away or 50 miles away theyre going to find a way to gamble
5214248 its not that youre having tons of students unable to attain refinancing they just have to hunt around for another lender
5214249 its certainly something that were very very concerned about and watching very closely
5214250 it was more intimidating before i did it and then once i sat down and looked at it i realized how simple it was
5214251 they were pretty good about letting us know what lenders they werent using anymore
5214252 they wouldnt do it without me getting a co signer
5214253 it was going to be a very big problem for us

5214257 at penn state more than 90 percent of our borrowers lost their federal loan lenders since spring after many banks and private lenders left the loan business
5214258 we knew we had to do something to guarantee the stability of federal loan funds for our students and parents
5214259 we do need a lot of help but every nonprofit organization does
5214260 some may view recent news about britney spears and her sister jamie lynn as cautionary tales for young people and parenthood
5214261 however new jersey adults worry that media coverage of celebrity pregnancy may be having the opposite effect on the average teenager
5214262 the poll revealed some surprising differences in opinion among parents of teenage daughters
5214263 they appear to be less worried than other parents about teenage pregnancy and slightly less supportive of sex education
5214264 sometimes i yell at them slow down and then they look at me as if i was a jerk in fact they are the jerks
5214265 its the cyclists and the roller bladers and sometimes even the runners its about people being too inconsiderate
5214266 a caution sign would be a good idea or speed bumps or some rumble strips
5214267 since november i havent seen a really bad accident thats surprising
5214268 seven miles per hour is the maximum speed here and a lot of times the bikers dont obey that sometimes they give you a look as if they think its their raceway
5214269 joggers pedestrians have the right of way except during sanctioned and or organized running races bicyclists all other trail users have the right of way except during sanctioned bicycle races
5214270 pretty chaotic it should have been addressed a long time ago

5214273 anytime plain common sense prevails in a court of law its actually a win for everyone
5214274 this was a harmless episode of youthful exuberance and hopefully this will be the end of the issue
5214275 we respectfully disagree with the legal and factual underpinnings of the judges ruling
5214276 it was frustrating for us to hear a number of different people arguing that school districts were issuing empty diplomas and just graduating kids who were not prepared

5214291 you would have though they would have told somebody when they were due back
5214292 most of the graduates of this college mainly papua new guineans are deprived of their rights to employment in the field they are trained in because of the influx of illegal asian forestry workers the main reason for this is that various logging companies mostly operated by asians under the flagship of asian logging giant rimbunan hijau rh are allegedly bringing their own workers to work for them rather then employing qualified nationals it is a pity that they are forced to search for employment in other establishments and institutions or economic resource sectors

5214297 if as a result of the current economic situation the only way to help hard pressed middle class families is to ask the highest earners to pay more then serious consideration should be given to that

5214299 this is a matter for the chancellor not a junior health minister this is not something we are considering
5214300 john mccain is going to own the george bush economy around his neck in this election he was central to its architecture he was one of its fiercest defenders in america florida has lost more jobs over the last year than any other state in the country
5214301 it doesnt take much if our supporters are turning out at a rate of 74 percent 75 percent 78 percent and mccains are turning out at 68 70 72 that doesnt seem like a big deal but it is the whole ball game
5214302 bush had an advantage over kerry because of their intensity we think mccain is going to have trouble replicating bush in 2004
5214303 we dont take florida for granted but we do have a good history here even though were outnumbered in this state our voter turnout effort has been extremely good in florida

5214305 when the former vice president left office al gore was worth an estimated 2 million

5214307 it is no crime to be ignorant of economics which is after all a specialized discipline and one that most people consider to be a dismal science but it is totally irresponsible to have a loud and vociferous opinion on economic subjects while remaining in this state of ignorance

5214316 north pole may be ice free for first time this summer
5214317 in the summer of 2007 as arctic sea ice reached a record low the northwest passage opened between baffin bay and mcclure strait also known as mclure strait passing through parry channel this opening would be the route through the arctic most conducive to large scale shipping as of early august 2008 arctic sea ice was not expected to set a new melt record although its extent was well below the long term average whether the northwest passage would open as far north as it did the previous year remained in question but the sea ice in a more southerly route one taken by norwegian explorer roald amundsen in the early twentieth century had begun to melt

5214322 according to an analysis of campaign contributions by the nonpartisan center for responsive politics democrat barack obama has received nearly six times as much money from troops deployed overseas at the time of their contributions than has republican john mccain and the fiercely anti war ron paul though he suspended his campaign for the republican nomination months ago has received more than four times mccains haul despite mccains status as a decorated veteran and a historically republican bent among the military members of the armed services overall whether stationed overseas or at home are also favoring obama with their campaign contributions in 2008 by a 55 000 margin although 59 percent of federal contributions by military personnel has gone to republicans this cycle of money from the military to the presumed presidential nominees 57 percent has gone to obama
5214323 no big surprise being that most white evangelicals are prejudiced at least and outright racist at worst
5214324 three times as many evangelicals 12 percent are undecided this year as in june 2004 in 2000 that number was only 5 percent
5214325 sunday morning has been known and still is as the most segregated hour of the week
5214326 this isnt about what evangelicals think its about what theyll be told to do if they thought for themselves they wouldnt be evangelicals
5214327 evangelicals who are politically or socially active especially conservatives seem to be increasingly upwardly mobile suburban highly educated and with above average incomes contrary to many popular stereotypes

5214330 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects

5214332 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
5214333 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that

5214335 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
5214336 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
5214337 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
5214338 there are many credible members of the scientific community who have questioned the theory of global warming and now we have some scientists actually suggesting the earths temperatures may be entering a period of dramatic cooling
5214339 with this growing level of scientific uncertainty it makes no sense to enact a new set of economically damaging regulations prompted by the global warming hysteria of recent years
5214340 a remarkable indictment of the corruption and cynicism rife among climate scientists
5214341 if nothing is done all the polar bears could die in our lifetime
5214342 science keeps getting stronger and the mathematical models keep getting better
5214343 there is no convincing scientific evidence that human release of carbon dioxide methane or other greenhouse gasses is causing or will in the foreseeable future cause catastrophic heating of the earths atmosphere and disruption of the earths climate
5214344 scott you being unaware lord christopher monckton of brenchleys paper posted by roy august 16 2008 10 55 pm
5214345 expert scientists disagreed on the key contributor to global warming at a senate environment and public works committee hearing roy w spencer former nasa scientist during the clinton administration attributes the majority of global warming contributions to errors in measurement spencer claimed that the clinton administration told him what he could and could not say to congress about global warming and greenhouse emissions chairwoman barbara boxer d calif cited spencers blog where he admits that the clinton administration never told him what was and was not permissible to say to congress
5214346 few seem to realise that the present ipcc models predict almost unanimously that by 2040 the average summer in europe will be as hot as the summer of 2003 when over 30 000 died from heat by then we may cool ourselves with air conditioning and learn to live in a climate no worse than that of baghdad now but without extensive irrigation the plants will die and both farming and natural ecosystems will be replaced by scrub and desert what will there be to eat

5214371 now that i know how to text i think thats the next thing im going to learn
5214372 iran still has a long way to go as far as satellites are concerned and it deliberately exaggerates its air and space successes in order to dissuade israel or the united states from attacking its nuclear sites
5214373 it is clear that for years iran has had shihab 3 ballistic missiles which put israel within its reach but the threat posed by iran comes from its nuclear programme and not from its satellites or ballistic missiles
5214374 as they are losing value on their homes they may be less motivated to repay their mortgages instead they will focus on necessities such as eating or paying for heating fuel to pay for those they need to keep their credit cards open credit cards have become an essential item for many people

5214395 this is not new technology we just stumbled onto one spot where its working and working really well
5214396 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
5214397 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
5214398 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
5214399 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
5214400 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
5214401 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
5214402 john and i will tell you there were interesting races four years ago and eight years ago but in many ways this is one of the most interesting races in all of american history we have a chance to lift our country to a new way of thinking this can be a transformative election but make no mistake its close closer than it should be
5214403 mccain has promised and reaffirmed his commitment to continue the same policies weve had these past eight years for another four
5214404 we cannot do that barack obama has lifted our spirits and led us to believe yes we can solve the global climate crisis address the other issues we have to take on and has said we can come together and create a new century with bright hope
5214405 you want some advice make iraq the 51st state and lets get the hell out of there

5214407 just so you all know we did set a record
5214408 ive been involved in fundraising a long time and to have two incredible men who were nominees and both should have been president and also the fact i got a nobel prize winner and an academy award winner this is too much even for me
5214409 he promised america it would be a campaign of respect of ideas not insults and the american people wanted a better campaign and he gives you paris hilton and britney spears
5214410 if he cant keep his word about the campaign and he cant keep his word about the issues that are really important to the american people and he makes the wrong judgments about how to protect america then his candidacy is in fact dangerous in terms of americas security and you cant trust it and you cant trust him thats what this is about

5214424 for one blacktop stays hot and could continue to generate energy after the sun goes down unlike traditional solar electric cells in addition there is already a massive acreage of installed roads and parking lots that could be retrofitted for energy generation so there is no need to find additional land for solar farms roads and lots are typically resurfaced every 10 to 12 years and the retrofit could be built into that cycle extracting heat from asphalt could cool it reducing the urban heat island effect finally unlike roof top solar arrays which some find unattractive the solar collectors in roads and parking lots would be invisible
5214425 our preliminary results provide a promising proof of concept for what could be a very important future source of renewable pollution free energy for our nation and it has been there all along right under our feet

5214431 i believe that in a jewish state selling pork is a provocation
5214432 if israel is a jewish state then why does it matter how large or small the muslim population is
5214433 if this is a muslim state and jews are a small minority what does it matter how we treat them
5214434 this is our third time in malaysia but our first in langkawi we travel a lot and well be back again next year its quite nice here at pelangi but i think the four seasons might be better next time the chalets here are getting a bit tired you know
5214435 well of course weve been to bali know it well but it wasnt right for this holiday no we havent been back since those dreadful bombings terribly tragic our friends lost their daughter in the attack and it took days to piece together her body parts i mean can you imagine i think they identified her from her dental records in the end what a horrible horrible thing to happen an arm here a leg there blood everywhere devastating for the families our friends went to that memorial in bali recently you know it was on the news yes well they were there with all those other poor poor people who buried parts of their loved ones i dont know if there were any whole bodies to bury after that blast honestly what is the world coming to

5214438 i was kind of nervous but i told myself to find a good pitch to hit
5214439 i was in shock rounding the bases this is the best feeling ive had in my life
5214440 chase didnt have his best stuff but he is a hell of a competitor
5214441 his nature is as strong as ive ever seen in a kid
5214442 oliver has proven himself to be our clutch pinch hitter and to be asked to come off the bench in the last inning of a world series and hit a home run was amazing
5214443 he flew out here to see me and taught me the game and he was smiling and crying and i ran over to him and gave him a huge hug
5214444 the monkey is off our backs but i couldnt be prouder of these kids and the way they understand the game
5214445 there wasnt one kid with his head down in the dugout in the seventh they knew they could win
5214446 we all knew i didnt have my best stuff and my defense played so well behind me
5214447 thomas walker was great at short and soloman williams was a vacuum at first base
5214448 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
5214449 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late

5214451 a bayh pick would have the feel of bill clintons 1992 successful choice of al gore
5214452 if there lives a member of congress who knows more about the environment he or she isnt talking much less writing
5214453 so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh
5214454 im all about biden for many reasons the first being hes the most qualified
5214455 he has excellent experience he has been in the senate since 1985 and he serves on the armed services committee
5214456 in late june polls conducted by the wall street journal nbc and fox opinion dynamics using entirely different samples both showed sen clinton giving sen obama a 3 bump pushing him over 51 for the first time when the two of them were paired against sen mccain and gov romney
5214457 most recently in nationwide polling on july 22 23 a fox opinion dynamics poll showed a more dramatic bump of 8 with sen clinton as sen obamas vice presidential running mate in a head on match it was sen obama 41 to sen mccains 40 this was before the intense media coverage of his european trip but with exactly the same sample when all voters were presented with the choice of an obama clinton ticket vs mccain romney the results were obama clinton 48 7 and mccain romney 39 1
5214458 according to the july 22 23 fox opinion dynamics poll in an obama mccain head on match up sen
5214459 so what about independents an obama clinton ticket appears to gain some strength in this critical swing voter group with an obama mccain head on contest independents are evenly divided 32 30 with sen obama over sen mccain but with an obama clinton ticket vs a mccain romney ticket the independents favor obama clinton 38 30 a statistically significant 6 increase in a crucial voter group
5214460 i too think senator kerry is a brilliant man who clearly beat bush in the debates by miles but he does not inspire much respect in the general population which is incredibly unfair
5214461 senator clintons poorly run campaign her inability to concede error and the irresponsible behavior of bill make me think she would not be a good president should she need to step in
5214462 but why did hillary give up we dont do that here this we do not understand if obama picks her as a partner he will be considered weak by much of the world
5214463 this boat is going to be the toyota prius of the houseboat business
5214464 it is the most eco friendly houseboat anywhere in the country
5214465 gore will consume a lot more fuel driving to and from the lake than he will ever use cruising on this houseboat

5214468 hey mister if you dont get those ads off the air in the next 48 hours then your military record and my military record are going to become a major issue in this campaign youve invited it and if you insist on permitting this stuff to continue then its going to be an issue
5214469 i know what im going into here for one thing im black ive got a feisty wife you know i mean we all know what theyre going to try to do here
5214470 look its just a continuation of what ive been doing a very positive approach that so far seems to have done what i hoped it would do and anyway thats the kind of guy i am so well just kind of continue
5214471 ive lost my benefits or i cant get them because my kids got a chronic heart problem or something
5214472 hey if you havent signed up as a precinct or block captain please do so the coordinators theyre ready for you give them your telephone and e mail address and so on and so forth well be in touch with you
5214473 well in the final maybe you did that in the primary dukakis but in the final its all its all this kind of stuff
5214474 get it off the air and i really mean it
5214475 i know what im walking into here i know there are some people who are going to try to take advantage of this but were going to take them on
5214476 well who is this guy anyway youre changing youre moving from here to there everywhere
5214477 hey those attacks that are coming from mccain heres the truth
5214478 look give me a summary of the kinds of things we want to say
5214479 i am married to the next president of the united states
5214480 run for governor ok what do i have to do
5214481 our dangerous over reliance on carbon based fuels is at the core of all three of these challenges the economic environmental and national security crises
5214482 someone who can combine the toughness they are used to with the negotiating adeptness they believe a woman would bring to the office
5214483 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
5214484 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
5214485 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
5214486 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
5214487 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
5214488 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
5214489 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
5214490 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
5214491 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
5214492 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
5214493 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
5214494 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt
5214495 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
5214496 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
5214497 these are sophisticated buyers they have they know full well that they were going to saturate the florida market
5214498 both hillary and gore are suberb smart caring politicians both let their essential soul to be sucked dry by consulting morons
5214499 if hrcs handlers allowed to be hillary clinton and not some concoction of a phony thatcher or whomever she might have had a chance that she allowed those highly paid fakes to make her into a fake is what disqualified her
5214500 i have had the feeling for a while now since the bereaved are taking the loss so hard that they fell in love with her as first lady like women do with a movie star
5214501 see that guy over there in that cell its his turn to go home first bring it on baby im staying at the hanoi hiltion
5214502 clinton s campaign acknowledged that it s not possible to buy 49 state coverage
5214503 start an audience responsive riff what is it going to take to get it done experience
5214504 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
5214505 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
5214506 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
5214507 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
5214508 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
5214509 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
5214510 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
5214511 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
5214512 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks
5214513 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
5214514 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
5214515 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power

5214526 icims represents the best the talent management space has to offer and we look forward to innovating greater efficiencies with the company both now and in the future
5214527 for some people this is a very controversial topic because it seems to contradict the mission of the single truth by giving the end user too much power to manipulate data
5214528 but think about it you cant control data all the way through an excel spreadsheet or a powerpoint slideshow so why draw the line inside of business intelligence software inetsofts style intelligence software platform is the only business intelligence application to enable this ultimate level of self service
5214529 this is just slightly better than showing up for a job interview that turns out to be selling steak knives door to door

5214548 its somewhat surprising to me that more attention isnt being paid to succession planning issues
5214549 having the right people prepared to fill key positions is an essential business strategy in this time of fierce competition for talent the defining moments in a companys ability to stay competitive may rest in the focus it places on filling key positions with assimilated and capable replacements
5214550 i have held executive level hr positions with several large companies and the importance placed on succession planning was extremely high

5214561 im interested in telling narratives and advocating peoples existent feelings
5214562 this mission is an amazing opportunity to have a huge impact on this hard locked heart locked crisis ive never been to gaza myself but i know that gaza is the forgotten little brother of the middle east or at least of the israeli palestinian crisis everything about this crisis is clearer in gaza the israeli occupation strategy is much clearer in gaza because its not specifically about taking more land its mostly about completely destroying a people
5214563 americans are terribly ignorant of the human effects of what they support i think this boat is one of the most effective means of raising consciousness particularly american consciousness about the problems caused by american foreign policy americans have to know the consequences of these policies im sixty four years old my children are grown and my affairs are in order i think about rachel corrie and about what israel may do to us i know its risky but i take a risk when i ride a motorcycle and i think that if were really going to change things then somebody has to begin putting something on the line for that change to happen
5214564 for years and years seeing place in the world that were being totally destroyed and people that were being totally destroyed by other people and governments i thought theres nothing that i could do
5214565 no one is paying attention to whats happening in gaza no one is listening to palestinians they are slowly being strangulated by israel and no one is even listening i cant sit outside of this and just let it happen we as human beings have an obligation to stand up and i cant be passive about it you cant stand up in london and just say that you dont agree we need to find ways to connect people in the middle east particularly young people to people and groups in wealthier countries together we can inspire each other and together we can be much more than we are alone
5214566 are you hysterical or what having a difficult menopause how many times do we have to tell you russia calls the shots these days so keep your hysterical whining to yourself and stop reiterating the same thing time and time again russia will withdraw from georgia when it sees fit
5214567 a further warning from this time 75 years ago is
5214568 for a second deathly silence spread through the house as the menacing chants of the sturmabteilung 1 penetrated through as white as a ghost with tightly pressed lips hardened features and visibly aware of the gravity the seriousness and the danger of the moment otto wels slowly ascended the speakers rostrum his head was slightly lowered but his stocky form taut and shoulders held high as though he were treading into a firing range
5214569 freedom and life can be taken from us but not honour
5214570 we german social democrats at this historical hour swear solemnly on the principles of humanity and justice freedom and socialism no enabling act gives you the power to exterminate ideas which are eternal and indestructible
5214571 im telling you all im going even if they tear me into pieces over there
5214572 every one of us who as political correspondent or politician was forced into decisions we later regretted made stupid mistakes this rationale is far too weak when it comes to explaining having approved this law the word later also doesnt reach the heart of the matter because i knew back then that this vote of yes could never be expunged from the story of my life
5214573 the depoliticisation of the once thoroughly liberal minded bourgeoisie the catastrophic heritage of bismarck the segregation of the universities the institution of the reserve officers the caste methods within the civil service the turning of the bourgeoisie to pure moneymaking and the political disengagement of intellectuals from everyday life this catastrophic attitude of the german middle classes was fed on many levels making them the middle classes susceptible to apolitical emotional excitements in turn making the victory of fascism possible by the absorption of virtually all the bourgeois electoral masses
5214574 in my opinion the german people as well as the bishops and clergy bear the blame for their predecessors in the concentration camps it is true that later there was possibly nothing more that could be done the blame lies earlier the german people as well as in large part bishops and clergy were responsive to the national socialist agitation they aligned themselves with the national socialists almost without resistance even sometimes with enthusiasm therein lies the guilt

5214605 die vorstellung innerhalb des freiraums die gesellschaftlichen zw nge abzumildern oder gar aufzuheben und so letztlich den kapitalismus zu berwinden ist folgerichtiger weise zweckoptimistisch und nur begrenzt reflektiert das kann nur funktionieren wenn die existenz des kapitalismus an das unmittelbar bewusste wollen und handeln der gesellschaftlichen akteure gekn pft ist sobald nur der wille best nde aus dem kapitalismus auszusteigen w rde sich das entsprechende tun die praxis von selbst ergeben oder einfacher ausgedr ckt wer nur will kann jederzeit und berall aus dem kapitalismus aussteigen die attraktivit t dieses konzepts mag aus der relativen perspektivlosigkeit linker praxis resultieren wenn es gerade keine starke linke bewegung gibt und auch keine in sicht ist scheint es am angenehmsten oder sinnvollsten zu sein sich in sein autonomes jugendzentrum oder sein linkes wohnprojekt zur ckzuziehen und zu versuchen das bisschen spielraum was geblieben ist zu verteidigen die verteidigung des bestehenden freiraums etwa eines besetzten hauses wird dabei leicht zum einzigen politischen projekt und bindet kapazit ten anstatt welche zu schaffen sich dabei noch einzureden es ginge um eine grunds tzliche umw lzung der bestehenden verh ltnisse bzw dass diese verh ltnisse im freiraum bereits aufgehoben w ren greift zu kurz

5214612 we didnt think he was serious but he said he was keen to get a large tattoo like the one david beckham has

5214619 they have exposed a very limited set of capabilities that this architecture is capable of
5214620 in addition to supporting multiple active controllers clustered systems virtualise the individual controllers and make the entire set of controllers appear as one single storage system to hosts
5214621 i believe the architecture has these features but ibm didnt feel comfortable presenting them to the market yet
5214622 weird nothing from ibm other than the announcement letters posted to ibm com world wide not even a press release no customer stories
5214623 maybe this whole xiv thing wasnt really all that big a deal after all
5214624 he gore has been working on this global warming business for decades the country and world caught up to him
5214625 would you offer him a job in an obama administration
5214626 clinton dispatched the military overseas forty four times during his eight years the u s military had been deployed outside of america only eight times in the previous forty five years
5214627 clinton acting through nato also orchestrated a bombing campaign against serbia from march until june 1999
5214628 he did so without the consent of congress the house of representatives actually voted against authorizing clintons bombing war against the serbs no president in american history has ever waged war in the face of direct congressional opposition
5214629 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
5214630 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
5214631 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
5214632 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
5214633 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
5214634 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
5214635 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that
5214636 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
5214637 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
5214638 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years

5214640 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
5214641 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet
5214642 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
5214643 wait a second if youve gotten to the point where youre sheepish about us doing well i cant vote for you
5214644 hey jimmy were only guys we show up at 11 30 we tell the jokes thats what pretty boys do all night
5214645 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
5214646 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
5214647 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
5214648 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment
5214649 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations
5214650 our country needs a new energy policy that reinvests in america and it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy
5214651 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
5214652 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
5214653 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
5214654 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
5214655 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
5214656 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
5214657 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
5214658 there is strong disagreement with many of the legal analytical economic science and policy interpretations
5214659 is a deeply flawed and unsuitable vehicle for reducing greenhouse gas emissions
5214660 will not only harm the us economy but will fail to provide an effective response to the global challenge of climate change as the president observed in april decisions with such far reaching impact should not be left to unelected regulators and judges
5214661 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
5214662 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront the issue as president next year
5214663 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
5214664 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
5214665 wanted is a film with a fantastic visual style an in your face attitude and edge of your seat action sequences and moviegoers around the world have resoundingly embraced it

5214671 employers should have an articulated reason for keeping senior people in the uk whether it is access to market or simply more cost effective to do so

5214677 a new circuit means that there is a new challenge something new to discover new corners new set up a new way of driving because every race is a different story valencia is a great city with lots going on so i am looking forward to this grand prix
5214678 valencia is a mix because youve got a completely new approach its a new street circuit and its in the middle of a city but the nice part is that its in the harbour its great when youve got boats and f1 cars together like that monaco gives us that kind of magic feeling and now its good to see valencia coming in
5214679 ive seen the lay out and the location but the best way to prepare for racing on a new track is to get there as soon as possible to spot the small details on the track the best way to understand a circuit is to drive it and i cant wait
5214680 we can expect valencia to be a race which is going to be very hard on the brakes a little bit similar to montreal also we will have to see how the surface is usually on a street circuit you are faced with some bumpy areas which may lie in braking areas or in the corners so thats something we will have to deal with

5214695 this week will be the longest that they play together theyll play into the second half
5214696 hopefully well get some chemistry going this week with our quarterback and receivers
5214697 theres a couple of balls there that we would have liked him to come up with
5214698 at the end of everything all that matters is how do you perform on game day for him not to make those plays or the first game there was a fade that we throw to him that he didnt go up and get thats discouraging because he was paid an awful lot of money paid like one of the top five receivers in the nfl we need him to make those plays
5214699 its something johnnie did a lot last year in practices and is why we werent able to trust him to play that much in games
5214700 hopefully hes going to show us over these next two games that that isnt going to be an issue
5214701 he played the best of all our receivers last night including the front line guys and its good to see because he did not play well in the first game on offense or on special teams

5214714 defendants have been fraudulently raising money in the various offerings each of which purportedly is for a particular investment without disclosing that funds raised were actually being used to pay prior investors in unrelated offerings and to make unauthorized payments to fund the operations of the wextrust entities which were operating at a deficit

5214720 i urge your colleagues to take even bolder steps toward solving the climate crisis
5214721 we have an historic opportunity to shift to a clean energy economy and in the process create new sustainable jobs to support the development and deployment of these new technologies
5214722 im afraid right now that we are more concerned about the business climate than the earths climate
5214723 until we realize they are not mutually exclusive we wont be able to address these issues
5214724 but it should be clear to anyone who has been watching the session that weve already
5214725 under governor patrick massachusetts joined the regional greenhouse gas initiative and became the first state in the nation to require greenhouse gas analysis and mitigation in major real estate projects
5214726 comprehensive energy legislation the oceans management bill and pending biofuels legislation all put massachusetts into a leadership position nationally we support the creation of an economy wide cap as the next step in reducing greenhouse gas emissions but many details remain to be worked out with the legislature
5214727 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
5214728 windmills should be installed in every uninhabited windy place in this country
5214729 with hunger on the rise we are doing our best to stream incoming contributions to the people most in need in africa asia and the caribbean
5214730 it is essential to launch a bold new set of responses to stem a full blown hunger and nutritional crisis
5214731 food prices are not abating and the worlds most vulnerable have exhausted their coping strategies
5214732 our action plan is targeted and customized to help the most vulnerable meet their urgent needs
5214733 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
5214734 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
5214735 all too often the direct economic value generated by pastoralists is not retained in their communities and the indirect value is un rewarded and even unacknowledged by decision makers
5214736 whether increasing climate change will see a worsening of their current situation or whether pastoralists will be able to adapt and even take advantage of the opportunities it may bring will depend on how these environmental and developmental challenges are tackled by both national governments and international donors and the extent to which pastoralists themselves are involved in the process
5214737 pastoralist make a significant contribution to the gross domestic product gdp in many east african countries provide majority of the meat consumed and provide a livelihood for tens of millions of people who live in asals they have been adapting to climate variability for millennia and their adaptability ought to enable them to cope with this growing challenge however their adaptability cannot be realised without government support and investment
5214738 in the next 10 15 years climate change will mean a continuation of current trends including successive poor rains an increase in drought related shocks and more unpredictable and sometimes heavy rainfall events
5214739 cash payments in place of food aid will enable the members of pastoralist communities to meet their basic needs in terms of food health care and education cash transfers when combined with other suitable interventions have the potential to empower pastoralists and ex pastoralists to make their own investment choices for example a household might choose between restocking themselves with livestock investing in alternative livelihoods such as fishing or experimenting with more cultivation communities must be at the heart of efforts to build their resilience to climate change because adaptation is inherently local it will only work if local people are leading the process
5214740 in 1970 the u s imported 24 percent of its oil by 1990 it was 42 percent and today its almost 70 percent we import 70 percent of our oil at a cost of us 700 billion a year four times the annual cost of the iraq war ive been an oil man all my life but this is one emergency we cant drill our way out of but if we create a new renewable energy network we can break our addiction to foreign oil
5214741 when president john f kennedy challenged our nation to land a man on the moon and bring him back safely in 10 years many people doubted we could accomplish that goal
5214742 but eight years and two months later neil armstrong and buzz aldrin walked on the surface of the moon
5214743 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now

5214773 while the chinese government has built a gleaming new building for its official mouthpiece and its public relations strategy has become more sophisticated the propaganda it uses to maintain its iron fisted control over tibet remains the same
5214774 tibet supporters took action at cctv today to broadcast a message of truth about the intensifying military crackdown in tibet and the tibetan peoples undying resolve to regain their freedom
5214775 tibet is part of china and the whole world recognizes it the free tibet movement is not welcome here a small number of people are trying to split the territory and that is not going to work at all

5214845 es como poner cheque en blanco para cometer actos indebidos advirtieron luis arag n y c sar mart nez del organismo tica y transparencia eyt
5214846 como est no fortalece la transparencia por eso nosotros hemos hecho nuestros aportes para enriquecerla
5214847 burocr tica engorrosa y no acorde al desarrollo moderno de los sistemas de renovaci n tecnol gica que exigen estos tiempos de globalizaci n
5214848 la gaceta y los diarios de circulaci n nacional que siempre han sido utilizados ahora con esta nueva ley ni siquiera se mencionan
5214849 por ejemplo en la licitaci n p blica se hablaba de un m nimo de 45 d as y ahora se ponen 20 d as hasta cierto punto esta disminuci n est bien sin embargo otra modalidad que se menciona como es la licitaci n selectiva pas de 25 d as hasta 7 d as inclusive en las compras menores s lo dejaron tres d as
5214850 entonces puede ocurrir que los oferentes no tengan suficiente tiempo para preparar una oferta ganadora
5214851 tambi n quedaron como materias excluidas las contrataciones de instituciones del servicio exterior en el extranjero y las contrataciones por emergencias no derivadas de desastres y calamidad p blica
5214852 todo contrato incluyendo la adquisici n de bienes servicios generales servicios profesionales de consultor a y la ejecuci n de obras p blicas que se financie mediante donaciones internacionales o cr ditos de estados extranjeros y organizaciones internacionales o que se fundamenten en tratados acuerdos o convenios internacionales se regir por lo que se estipule en los respectivos instrumentos
5214853 lo opuesto promueve al sector informal e institucionaliza la competencia desleal que cumplen con sus obligaciones y responsabilidades tributarias seguridad social o laboral
5214854 en cuanto a las prohibiciones de contratar con familiares deber a convencerse tal como est porque se puede prestar a interpretaciones
5214855 este proyecto de ley es enriquecedor para facilitar las contrataciones del estado porque el estado no puede tener una camisa de fuerza
5214856 si la contralor a tuviera que comprar 100 computadoras con
5214857 supongamos que yo tengo un cu ado con el que no me llevo bien o con quien me miro cada seis meses y tiene un crianza de cerdos entonces no puede venderle animales al mag for porque es mi pariente no me parece
5214858 sin embargo eso no significa que nosotros vamos a sacrificar transparencia por agilidad
5214859 el eje fundamental de todo esto es aprobar una ley que sin detrimento de la transparencia no se convierta en un bice fundamentalmente de la ejecuci n del plan de inversi n p blica y por otro lado una ley que te permita la amplia participaci n de los diferentes oferentes del estado
5214860 esta ley tambi n va dirigida a reducir los requisitos para que puedan existir m s oferentes en el mercado nacional y que no sean s lo las grandes empresas las que se lleven la tajada del le n
5214861 todos los contratos y convenios internacionales y eso te lo puedo demostrar con cualquier convenio de los que normalmente aprobamos en la asamblea tienen toda una estructura procedimientos y anexos que dejan claramente establecidos c mo se van a ejecutar los fondos que los donantes aportan
5214862 no estamos hablando de que por el hecho de que esos recursos sean materia excluida de la nueva ley de contrataciones del estado no tenga un marco regulatorio especial y de seguimiento
5214863 contrataciones peque as que son del d a a d a de las instituciones

5214866 my film is not at all any movies remake it is inspired from a village folk tale about a brahmin it is a modern version of a desi indian story it is a commercial film that leaves a message with humour
5214867 im waiting for the film to release so that audiences can see for themselves what its about even sanjay dutt was surprised after watching the film at a preview he told me that he had previously thought it was a remake of the english film
5214868 it is a custom in the industry to predict and guess the story of a film after seeing the initial rushes
5214869 considering the title of my film and that amitabh bachchan is playing the almighty who wears only white clothes everyone concluded that it is a copy of the hollywood comedy however no one noticed that even rishi kapoor played god and wore only white clothes in thoda pyaar thoda magic
5214870 i wanted to direct a film that no one had ever attempted to considering the technical aspects i have used in the film god tussi also has special effects to keep audiences glued to their seat
5214871 i didnt face any problem while directing the film the film went very smoothly as amitabh and salman had already been pushing me to direct a film for a long time
5214872 i didnt take up direction earlier because i wanted to learn its technical aspects also i needed to find the right subject i wanted to work on
5214873 writing is my first love if i get an exciting offer ill definitely do it as of now my entire focus is on direction every person looks for a change however ill write at least one film every year
5214874 i dont fear any movie my movie is also commercial but different giving audiences a paisa vasoool complete satisfaction film has always been my forte

5214878 home depot can track every 2 by 4 to its forest of origin
5214879 you can track every bag of coffee every diamond to a specific diamond field but for gold theres nothing
5214880 with many immigrants there is this sense that they made this hard choice to leave their homelands and they are going to make it under any cost
5214881 i think theres a tendency to see the positive even under the most dire circumstances because so much is at stake theyve left family family members are counting on them and they want to make this work
5214882 i do not believe in hopeless gestures made for diplomacy alone these negotiations have been going on for a year and until now not a result has been achieved a gesture alone without exchange is a step of weakness
5214883 the victory of the will of the resistance and a means for persisting in the conflict with the israeli occupation
5214884 we ask israel to change its conditions for releasing prisoners and we ask for the release of all prisoners without exception
5214885 the release of prisoners only to those who use force against israel transmits a message of weakness and surrender to pressure while the release of prisoners to pragmatic elements as part of the peace process encourages the policy by which dialogue with israelis leads to these achievements for the palestinians
5214886 instead of taking a position of attacking terror the government is freeing terrorists with blood on their hands in exchange for nothing while gilad shalit continues to rot in jail the inevitable result is that terror organizations will understand that they can send more terrorists to carry out more attacks in israel and theyll know that one day they too will be freed

5214920 and this will be a great highlight for my resume as i look for employment after college
5214921 its a tough world out there for employment within the las vegas nevada politics sector
5214922 so i invited strong students to help me in this project hopefully this experience will help them gain meaningful employment later on
5214923 but im proud i was able to be part of such a distinguished research team
5214924 ive been working within the las vegas nevada politics field for years and never before have i seen better work out of prof pilarski scherf
5214925 but only because of the high expectations and standards of our las vegas nevada politics project we have worked tirelessly for about a year now and we hope to release the best review of las vegas nevada politics thought in decades
5214926 this great work will mean high profits for our firm
5214927 and were also very honored that the author and student research team chose our firm to share its work with the world
5214928 because it allows the entire general public to learn about things they never before furthermore it may even convince them to go out and buy the professors book
5214929 basically were looking at new ideas within the las vegas nevada politics realm of thought that have never really been put in writing before
5214930 and this is what makes the release such an exciting event for our community new ideas means new developments and success for our area

5214941 now beauty is in the eye of the beholder beauty can be a good set of teeth beauty is nice wavy hair beauty can be blue eyes or green eyes
5214942 there is such a thing as disposition temperament manners general attractiveness attitude and demeanour all those things tend to make a person attractive
5214943 returning us to the dark ages and making the guys that live in this town seem like sex hungry starved men that will pounce upon the first girl that they see walking down the street
5214944 the people that are coming into town now are coming here to work and find a house and live and bring up their families but with these sort of comments id say humph fancy going up to that place
5214945 anyone who moves to mount isa beautiful or not so beautiful they have a great chance to make a great life here it is a fantastic town
5214946 if guys have the right attitude then you know any type of girl will be happy to be with them so maybe the guys need to fix their attitudes a little bit
5214947 the afghans did not go to canada to kill canadians rather it is the canadians who came to afghanistan to kill and torture the afghans to please the fascist regime of america
5214948 remains steadfast in our commitment to the people of afghanistan and will continue to work with the afghan government and the international community to improve the lives of afghans
5214949 it may well be that the connection between riches and happiness is looser than most economic and political commentators
5214950 it is considered too sexy for us its not good for viewers in malaysia
5214951 we dont want our people our teenagers influenced by their performance we want clean artists artists that are good role models
5214952 save afghan lives defeating the enemies plan to discredit the afghan government
5214953 we recommend to all afghans to be vigilant at large public events and other locations where crowds gather and report suspicious behavior to security forces
5214954 all the time the enemy tries to carry out any kind of activity that it can but the afghan security forces are ready and we have already taken measures to disrupt any enemy activity
5214955 we will hold important talks with iran within one month we hope that the work which we launched before will produce a result during this period
5214956 any notion that russia was the kind of responsible state ready to integrate into international institutions
5214957 i think that there has been an effort by three successive american presidents to try and coax russia into an integrated role in the international community
5214958 we thought that they were headed in that direction we now have to reevaluate all that
5214959 it wants to be part of these institutions that are so essential to the international economy and the international order
5214960 it wants to engage in kind of soviet style behavior of intimidating and invading allies or neighbors
5214961 what the president has done is to open a path for russia that would have been different than the path of the soviet union
5214962 russia that has misjudged what would happen if it did not take that path
5214963 it has nothing to do obviously with the conflict that began in south ossetia
5214964 i think that the whole world is looking at russia through a different set of lenses the longer they take to get out and to observe the cease fire thats been declared and the arrangements that have been worked out i think the greater those consequences will be
5214965 russia has given continuous promises to hold to the ceasefire but in fact they are continuing their actions they are widening their zone of occupation
5214966 sooner or later yes but how much time it will take it depends definitely on how georgians will continue to behave
5214967 began to ring like a political campaign instead of principled and strong diplomacy
5214968 presumptuous is to try to undercut in any way the very difficult and tricky work that president bush and secretary rice are trying to do right now
5214969 he called for an international peacekeeping force he called for humanitarian aid he called it exactly what it is unprovoked aggression
5214970 if we were georgians and the russians were invading our country and killing our people wed bet in a state of war
5214971 john sometimes is given to this kind of bellicose rhetoric which has a tendency to inflame conflicts rather than to diffuse them
5214972 senator obama to this day to this day denies the value and the strategic benefit of the surge
5214973 because the bush mccain approach has been to focus almost exclusively on iraq over the last five years a lot of these issues have gone without the kind of attention they deserve
5214974 we thought that the russians were headed in the direction of an integrated role in the international community we now have to reevaluate all that
5214975 do not lie do not participate in a lie do not support a lie
5214976 theres a real concern that russia has turned a corner here and is headed back to its past rather than its future

5214978 i myself would like to meet up with you face to face with my nephew by my side
5214979 russia wont leave until our jets and tanks and ships get into the game till then russia will make excuses and delay and delay and delay
5214980 for whatever reason they leftists here and in russia are always convinced that impression trumps reality or is able to create one
5214981 iraq and afganistan are not and will not be included into the us
5214982 george bush is going to russia this week and kick vladimir putins a and george can do it too
5214983 any notion that russia was the kind of responsible state ready to integrate into international institutions
5214984 i think that there has been an effort by three successive american presidents to try and coax russia into an integrated role in the international community
5214985 we thought that they were headed in that direction we now have to reevaluate all that
5214986 it wants to be part of these institutions that are so essential to the international economy and the international order
5214987 it wants to engage in kind of soviet style behavior of intimidating and invading allies or neighbors
5214988 what the president has done is to open a path for russia that would have been different than the path of the soviet union
5214989 russia that has misjudged what would happen if it did not take that path
5214990 it has nothing to do obviously with the conflict that began in south ossetia
5214991 i think that the whole world is looking at russia through a different set of lenses the longer they take to get out and to observe the cease fire thats been declared and the arrangements that have been worked out i think the greater those consequences will be
5214992 russia has given continuous promises to hold to the ceasefire but in fact they are continuing their actions they are widening their zone of occupation
5214993 sooner or later yes but how much time it will take it depends definitely on how georgians will continue to behave
5214994 began to ring like a political campaign instead of principled and strong diplomacy
5214995 presumptuous is to try to undercut in any way the very difficult and tricky work that president bush and secretary rice are trying to do right now
5214996 he called for an international peacekeeping force he called for humanitarian aid he called it exactly what it is unprovoked aggression
5214997 if we were georgians and the russians were invading our country and killing our people wed bet in a state of war
5214998 john sometimes is given to this kind of bellicose rhetoric which has a tendency to inflame conflicts rather than to diffuse them
5214999 senator obama to this day to this day denies the value and the strategic benefit of the surge
5215000 because the bush mccain approach has been to focus almost exclusively on iraq over the last five years a lot of these issues have gone without the kind of attention they deserve
5215001 we thought that the russians were headed in the direction of an integrated role in the international community we now have to reevaluate all that
5215002 do not lie do not participate in a lie do not support a lie
5215003 theres a real concern that russia has turned a corner here and is headed back to its past rather than its future
5215004 stick the long and hard one up the collective keisters of little bush amp co
5215005 i the united states of america will confidently do my duty to police the world since i am in the position especially if someone requested for it

5215009 who do you think you are kidding mr hitler if you think were on the run do do do do do do
5215010 we saw strong revenue and earnings growth in the second quarter of 2008 as a result of our focus on core businesses our operating cash flow increased significantly from the previous quarter although our business was negatively impacted by the earthquake in may business conditions rebounded quickly in june in addition we expanded our network capacity significantly in the second quarter for example the total installed base of digital poster frames exceeded 25 000 units as of june 30 2008 and is well on its way towards our goal of a 50 000 to 60 000 installation base by the year end
5215011 while we continue to see strong advertising demand from consumer goods advertisers in china in particular non olympic sponsor advertisers are increasing their advertising spending in the later half of the year after the olympic games our large scale and highly effective media coverage of high end urban consumers in china differentiates us from competition our outlook for the remainder of 2008 and 2009 is getting stronger

5215013 ah this is maybe why i went into the movies in the beginning i thought it would be full of wonderful people
5215014 hes a bit older and wiser and hes probably gained an extra yard of pace which he probably needed internationally
5215015 hes done very well this year and hes pretty much a three dimensional player because he bats bowls and fields
5215016 its exciting for him to get another chance and hell have learned a lot from those games he played against sri lanka so his challenge is to use that knowledge hes got from county cricket over the last two years and try and make a real impression
5215017 hes very much a viable option for selection we wouldnt have called him into the squad otherwise and it gives us options because hes another bowler who bats a bit
5215018 hes done it for 14 months so its not something thats a flash in the pan
5215019 hes gone away to have treatment and physical work to get himself ready to play again were hoping he comes back into the one day series feeling refreshed and ready to go
5215020 it might be andrew flintoff bowling the ball or kevin pietersen holding the bat but its just another game of cricket
5215021 therell be certain challenges throughout the day but i think weve got a good enough squad to rise to the occasion

5215026 value in keeping the afghan insurgency going sucking the soviets into a vietnamese quagmire
5215027 according to the official version of history cia aid to the mujaheddin began after the soviet army invaded afghanistan but the reality secretly guarded until now is completely otherwise indeed it was july 3 1979 that president carter signed the first directive for secret aid to the opponents of the pro soviet regime in kabul and that very day i wrote a note to the president in which i explained to him that in my opinion this aid was going to induce a soviet military intervention we didnt push the russians to intervene but we knowingly increased the probability that they would

5215032 while a marked slowdown in activity is likely over the next 18 months even if interest rates are cut when inflation peaks the correct policy decisions are still needed to ward off the threats of a serious and prolonged recession
5215033 the longer the mpc waits before cutting rates the bigger the danger that the economic situation would deteriorate
5215034 our view is that the threats to growth are more serious and more immediate than the risks of higher inflation
5215035 our central scenario envisages that the uk bank rate would be cut to 4

5215037 school has been torched houses are burning people there are racing to the coasts for protection a steady stream of refugees is being observed from the checkpoint this is war
5215038 who do expats cheer for in the olympic games is it with their country of birth or their country of residence
5215039 we are almost certainly not going to be able to defend absolutely every bit of coast it would simply be an impossible task both in financial terms and engineering terms
5215040 the clincher is there will be no negotiation in any of this so the rug has effectively been pulled out from everyones feet
5215041 those claims are disgraceful theyre an insult to prison officers who go to work each day to do their job
5215042 i think there should be measures to reduce the overtime levels but to casualise the workforce isnt going to make it safer
5215043 what we do have is an overtime culture and its been a strong overtime culture
5215044 that in itself creates fatigue and associated sick leave which then fuels further claims for overtime
5215045 its not good for workplace safety and its certainly not good for the prison system

5215080 ik werk bij een internetbedrijf en had daardoor snel in de gaten dat veel westerse media de protesten in tibet verkeerd begrepen ik heb in tibet gereisd het dagelijks leven van de mensen daar is vredig en kalm toen tijdens de olympische fakkeltocht in parijs en londen free tibet demonstraties waren was ik daar vreselijk kwaad over vooral toen ik las hoe de westerse media erover schreven maar ik wist niet hoe ik mijn woede moest uiten wij chinezen hebben van jongs af aan geleerd onze emoties niet te laten blijken en daarom dragen we deze kleren om onze gevoelens te tonen
5215081 het rode hart staat voor liefde en rood staat ook voor ons land we dragen het om onze patriottische gevoelens te tonen
5215082 nu is het nationalisme vrij sterk omdat er een aantal dingen zijn gebeurd
5215083 de rellen in tibet maar ook de aardbeving in sichuan en natuurlijk de olympische spelen maar wat vooral het nationalisme heeft aangewakkerd is de berichtgeving in het westen over tibet

5215143 two years ago we were over 20 points behind the leaders last year we were four points behind that means we made a significant move forward
5215144 a four point gap after 38 games is down to one or two decisions in your favour one or two injuries that you dont have one ball going in instead of hitting the bar
5215145 we feel we were a fraction short now we want to show we can make up the four points that made the difference last year
5215146 this season i feel it will be more down to starting well and being more relaxed when it comes to the crunch point
5215147 last year we were leading the premier league due to a good start so lets focus on the short term goals and show later on that weve learned from when we dropped off last season
5215148 usually the teams that come up give you a good game
5215149 we know west brom will be up for it out of the three teams who just came up from the championship they have the most experience in the premier league but it is always our target to win the first match
5215150 but i dont think we lost the title last year due to lack of overall experience because the young players produced a great season
5215151 we lost as a unit because we didnt have the experience of winning the title hopefully we have learnt from that now
5215152 anyway i believe it is not just experience that wins the league it is the talent and quality of your display

5215168 with the recent changes in both the global and local economic environment in particular increasing fuel prices and rising interest rates it is not surprising that australian family businesses has concerns
5215169 most family businesses are operating around broad unwritten family goals under leadership from the first generation founder
5215170 this is not always the most profitable way of operating and can lead to problems down the track around leadership succession
5215171 we invariably find that once they start the process suddenly the light comes on and its not anywhere near as threatening as they think it is going to be
5215172 we always find that people who have a go who start the succession journey ultimately end up with much better outcomes than those that stick their head in the sand

5215202 our partnership has implemented an innovative way to bring together the interests of housing developers and non profit groups by working at the grassroots level to provide critically needed housing and financing options as hurricane katrinas anniversary approaches
5215203 ultimately this partnership will empower the areas residents by enabling more than 300 families to move from renting and temporary housing to owning a piece of the american dream their own home after more than two years decent housing priced reasonably remains the single greatest need for those who were directly impacted by the devastating hurricane
5215204 our castle homes mission has always been to make housing affordable for working families
5215205 thats why we are working with partners like american sunrise communities an organization whose mission is to provide struggling american families with access to safe decent affordable housing and new economic growth opportunities providing homes for less than a family would pay in rent is demonstrates our commitment to rebuilding and enhancing the lives of new orleanians and families in the surrounding communities who were so heavily impacted in august 2005 by hurricane katrina

5215233 after viewing the situation and consulting legal advisers and political allies with their advice i have decided to resign
5215234 not a single charge in the impeachment can stand against me
5215235 no charge can be proved against me because i never did anything for myself it was all for pakistan
5215236 on the map of the world pakistan is now an important country by the grace of allah
5215237 thats not an issue on the table and i just want to keep our focus on what we must do with the democratic government of pakistan
5215238 ive had a fantastic relationship with our club our people its been great and its been 12 years now that ive been at the club ever since it opened its door
5215239 i understand times come in football and if the club decides its time to go and its not for me theyll look around and ill look around and thats where it is
5215240 but my choice if you ask me is to stay here and get the club back to where id like to see it at the top of the ladder
5215241 its really entirely up to the club when the contract is negotiated
5215242 ive got another year of my contract to go and over the last 12 years three of them weve finished top and weve won a premiership they never negotiated my contract any time prior to that the end of the existing deal so i cant imagine they would do it now
5215243 our players have some experience theyve got a little older the results might not show that but certainly we dont think were as bad as the position on the ladder is
5215244 but were not going to complain and say anything about that its only up to us to prove that from now on
5215245 the cash poll has indicated all along the leadership is there for the taking if mr costello wants it
5215246 he has enjoyed constant support from punters betting on the liberal leadership at the next election
5215247 brendan nelson is becoming less popular with punters by the day
5215248 so powerful that it changed the way people acted thought of themselves and responded to others at least for a time
5215249 i made a strong case for the job because i think it is the next big challenge in football and i really wanted to be a part of it
5215250 to be involved in the birth of a club and to build a list from the bottom up is very exciting
5215251 as someone whose life is recruiting it really is one of the greatest opportunities available in recent football history
5215252 we are starting to build the core of a very strong football club not just a team
5215253 i confirm that there was a communication from me to him about him resigning however in the overall scheme of moving fiji forward this issue does not matter
5215254 if a rather tenuous interim government sees interim ministers resigning from it i would have thought it would further destabilise the situation in fiji
5215255 its too late for labour to try and redeem itself after being part of an illegal administration
5215256 while people will welcome chaudhrys exit from government he has failed badly as finance minister and the economy has shown very little sign of progress hes just running away from the mess he has created

5215269 i wanted flexibility and in principle an understanding that the date could be reviewed if fiji for good reason was not able to meet the particular date
5215270 i think leaders are very keen to see the commitments that were made last time adhered to
5215271 i think there would be considerable concern if the person who gave those commitments wasnt prepared to come and explain himself

5215297 there is no doubt that this has been an enormous fall from grace for a man that lived 61 years in an exemplary fashion
5215298 the facts in this case are very serious indeed unbelievable for a male with no prior convictions to set out and deliberately have sex with an underage female
5215299 it is never a childs fault when they are the victim of a crime
5215300 it was clearly within your contemplation that she was underage

5215302 the bible says that we will suffer persecution if we are christians ive been a christian for a long time and i dont think ive ever experienced it does that mean im not a christian am i missing something
5215303 dont you believe that the persecution we are going through in america the war on christmas the crassification of our culture the removal of the ten commandments from our schools etc is a sign that our nation has been abandoned by god is this a sign of the end of the world or will god raise up another country to take our place since we failed

5215305 these two guys back country skiers turned up at the top of the crag one of them walked out onto the top of the cornice and we remarked how dangerous is that and at that moment the cornice snapped off and we saw him go down with it
5215306 his brother just skied off the top and skied down a vertical face
5215307 it was amazing to watch him scream down there they were obviously very good skiers
5215308 the 22 year old was on top of the ice cornice at that stage when his brother noticed that it was unsafe and called out to him i presume he could see cracks or movement underneath
5215309 and as he attempted to move off the top of the cornice it collapsed underneath him

5215320 he was on the u20 grand slam winning team and has made appearances in the churchill cup in the past two years it is important that he gets game time
5215321 i explained to xabi why i needed money by selling players i told him we also have mascherano lucas gerrard and plessis in midfield and we need to have eight british players
5215322 i need to bring british players in and i needed a left footed player
5215323 when i was talking with him we needed the money after some months it was not a question of money it was a question of keeping the balance

5215330 borrowing to invest can be a hazardous strategy just as much with property as with any other form of investment because you magnify losses as well as gains

5215341 i was very aggressive throwing the first pitch for strikes
5215342 that allowed me to go out there for the ninth i was just doing my job
5215343 without question this was his best outing of the year it probably was the second best outing ive ever seen him throw after the nlcs playoff game in 2005
5215344 every one of us on the starting staff tries to put up good innings and quality starts and hope for the best
5215345 we have been able to do that but unfortunately it hasnt gone my way thats baseball

5215352 after consultations with legal advisers and close political supporters and on their advice im taking the decision of resigning
5215353 my resignation will go to the speaker of the national assembly today
5215354 i dont want anything from anybody i have no interest i leave my future in the hands of the nation and people
5215355 on a long term view and on a fundamentals view i am very comfortable with the outlook a year from now for the likes of potash and other companies like it we think they will be generating significant earnings
5215356 we dont look at this sector as a bear market we look at it as a correction and we expected the correction
5215357 the chinese are not in the drivers seat here to negotiate from a point of strength they need the volumes and they have no second choice
5215358 i think next year we are going to see a bigger bump in volumes than in prices any price gains next year will be more marginal and more opportunistic rather than fundamental
5215359 the thing to remember is that farmers both here and abroad have not been confronted with these extremely high potash prices the demand destruction will be substantial but it has not occurred yet

5215362 a free taste would go a long way in making the consumer case for mobile tv
5215363 mobile tv services have taken off in south korea where service is offered free of charge in italy where additional fees have been the norm usage has been limited
5215364 once you start charging consumers they start getting turned off
5215365 i just think its a tragedy for this region its a tragedy for young players and for all the aspiration thats out there
5215366 if any of these guys have an aspiration to play at a higher level than heartland rugby then theyre going to have to move away arent they we could be talking about 20 to 30 players and that to me is the sad part of it all
5215367 id like to stay in the crusaders environment so canterbury is probably the only place to go
5215368 things were just starting to roll along quite well now and now its been taken away from all the players and the younger guys who are coming up weve got a few new guys in the team this year and theres a lot of good talent around the tasman region
5215369 it doesnt really give the kids in this region and upcoming talent anything to aspire to
5215370 its a shame really but we cant do a hell of a lot about it weve just got to keep playing
5215371 is a pity because i dont really want to go anywhere else
5215372 ive just got to keep playing and hopefully get an opportunity somewhere else

5215391 he flew out to surprise her at school and on the way he stopped off at her parents place to ask her fathers permission
5215392 i shouldnt be thinking of nina in that way i mean yes shes pretty and im sure shed be a wonderful person to be love with but ive know her less then two days and here i am thinking about taking her to my bed im sure this is something gunner would do no he would just try and charm the pants off her maybe its something tosh would do no he would romance her over a long period of time how about rand no hed turn the tables on her and make her fall in love with him
5215393 you make falling in love a very difficult thing for yourself
5215394 do you mind if i ask you a personal question sir uber nina asked taking a seat facing him
5215395 tie me up in some more emotional knots will you
5215396 i guess to answer your question its yes and no
5215397 i was no im still in love with someone but i never had the courage to tell her i felt because of that her heart belongs to someone else
5215398 but i always told myself if i couldnt have her heart id be happy with her friendship were good friends now but sometimes i wish there was something more between the two of us
5215399 i guess that will teach me not to pry too much into other peoples business
5215400 it is rare for me to hear the painful parts of a person thats in love i guess i live a sheltered life
5215401 this may be true sir uber but i want to the world the good the bad and the ugly
5215402 im sure we could talk all night again but i need you to take me to the church i must have a talk with stephen
5215403 hes talking to the abbot right now im sure they will be finished within the hour
5215404 please go in there and tell my brother that im out here waiting for him or do i have to go in there myself
5215405 very well ill just go in and see him myself
5215406 if this fool does not get out of my way i want you to kill him
5215407 you know im not to be disturbed when im with the abbot
5215408 brother it is important i have something to tell you and no it couldnt wait
5215409 stephen im leaving you ill have my things packed and ill be gone before night fall
5215410 if you wish to speak to her say your peace from there
5215411 you cant leave i wont permit it he shouted nina chuckled
5215412 thats my point you see me as a piece of property not your sister ever since you came to this church youve become less of a brother and more of zealot and i want nothing more to do with you
5215413 i will see you will have nothing you will have no money youll be all alone
5215414 nina cutler i request to pledge myself and my sword to you as a protector and a friend will you accept my charge
5215415 ill be leaving now brother im sure it will be some time be before we see each other again and not the stranger youve become
5215416 sir uber im so sorry it wasnt my intention to drag you into all of this even though it must look that way to you
5215417 its alright remember what you told me in the scriptorium that you know what kind of person i am if that is the case how could i not do this
5215418 i better go and start packing it wont take long
5215419 take your time take everything you want to bring with you we wont be coming back here for a while
5215420 im grateful for all youve done for me and doing for me but i do have one small favor i wish to ask of you
5215421 can i address you as sir thomas instead of sir uber
5215422 dont tell me you think the name uber is stupid also

5215428 the professional developers conference on october 27 and the windows hardware engineering conference the following week represent the first venues where we will provide in depth technical information about windows 7
5215429 we are both looking forward to turning our attention and blogging energies towards the community outside microsoft
5215430 the audience of enthusiasts bloggers and those that are the most passionate about windows represent the folks we are dedicating this blog to with this blog were opening up a two way discussion about how we are making windows 7 windows has all the challenges of every large scale software project picking features designing them developing them and delivering them with high quality windows has an added challenge of doing so for an extraordinarily diverse set of customers as a team and as individuals on the team we continue to be humbled by this responsibility we strongly believe that success for windows 7 includes an open and honest and two way discussion about how we balance all of these interests and deliver software on the scale of windows we promise and will deliver such a dialog with this blog planning a product like windows involves systematic learning from customers of all types in terms of planning the release weve been working with a wide variety of customers and partners pc makers hardware developers enterprise customers developers and more since the start of the project we also continue our broad consumer learning through telemetry customer experience improvement program usability studies and more one area this blog will soon explore is all the different ways we learn from customers and the marketplace that inform the release we have two significant events for developers and the overall ecosystem around windows this fall the professional developers conference winhec the following week both represent the first venues where we will provide in depth technical information about windows 7 this blog will provide context over the next 2 months with regular posts about the behind the scenes development of the release and continue through the release of the product
5215431 in leading up to this blog we have seen a lot of discussion in blogs about what microsoft might be trying to accomplish by maintaining a little bit more control over the communication around windows 7 some might say that this is a significant understatement

5215435 hear ye hear ye i bring grave news to you all
5215436 i am certain from my continued research and studies that a terrible threat faces our city
5215437 we are under threat from a dark force in this city a deadly creature of wolf and man a werewolf i know the exact identity of this foul beast it is one of our most trusted guildmasters you may ask how i know this and i shall tell you you might not like what i have to say and how i found this out but i must tell you the truth so that you can believe me

5215449 the crunch of whole roasted macadamias with the yielding softness of milk chocolate textured with little cereal flakes which create turtle esque shapes
5215450 i understand where you are coming from but how many real bigfoot researchers are out there trekking 140 000 miles a year
5215451 what were seeing suggests there may be a social connectivity constant for humanity
5215452 identify the emergency and work as one large team to protect and save lives and mitigate the hazards
5215453 they knew it was a cbrn chemical biological radioactive or nuclear event
5215454 and that it was a terrorist event they dont know what the chemical is they have to decide based on what they find and what they heard
5215455 it would be a challenge but if the community wanted it we would plan and find the resources to do it
5215456 its difficult to have the level of seriousness you would have in a real situation
5215457 they might be feeling a little frustrated and a little awkward about standing around
5215458 we take the sample over to our mobile laboratory and if theyre not able to determine what it is theyll take it over to lawrence livermore
5215459 what weve been doing is setting up scenario based training exercises in preparation for a terrorist attack this situation being that we had a mass casualty exercise
5215460 having wings on board has enabled us to have a new level of intensity
5215461 we were able to do hot loads and off loads with casualties
5215462 our soldiers performed well holston army ammunition did an excellent job and i certainly hope that this exercise will strengthen our partnership and our relationship
5215463 it went very well im very pleased with the way my guys reacted and the way they blended in with the army reserves and their patrol it appears that they got a lot of good training out of this
5215464 i hope we can do some more joint exercises with the army
5215465 its just a wonderful opportunity to learn from each other these are three organizations that dont work together a lot so our take away from this is to be able to learn the strengths of everybody so we can take that back to ourselves
5215466 it establishes where our training team is at during tsta phase one and two
5215467 as we get closer and closer to the end of tsta atg will help us out and get us to the level of proficiency in our ability to train the crew so we can carry on preparing the crew for things like real mass casualties
5215468 by running these drills we can practice simulated situations and if such a disaster occurs we have some experience we can fall back on
5215469 we try to get those first ones that actually need surgery down to the operating room in less than 20 minutes
5215470 i had to act as a casualty with protruding intestines
5215471 they came over to me and helped they were very good at calming me down and making me feel okay
5215472 life on a carrier is dangerous nothings going to fully prepare us for what youre going to see in an actual disaster but by practicing and going through the motions you can become familiar with what needs to be done and in what order
5215473 we go through and find out what we need to correct so we can be ready when the real thing goes down
5215474 we showed up at the facility unannounced today the doors were wide open and we managed to shoot for several minutes until a denver sheriffs captain asked us to leave
5215475 the exercise is to find a reported nuclear device on a vessel coming into the harbor
5215476 were trying to further develop our concept of operations as a region in protecting the waterways and ports of nyc from any acts of terrorism
5215477 it could be used in what we term a dirty bomb today
5215478 our main objective would be to through intelligence find out about a plot before it ever got to a stage where a nuclear device or a dirty bomb was coming our way
5215479 this provides for our defense after a plot has already been launched and a device is on its way
5215480 our main objective would be to through intelligence find out about a plot before it ever got to a stage where a nuclear device or a dirty bomb was coming our way
5215481 this provides for our defense after a plot has already been launched and a device is on its way
5215482 someone has thought up a movie plot in their head of bad guys driving trucks into new york city
5215483 while im sure there are some scenarios in which this makes sense spending for security based on movie plots is only effective if you guess the plot correctly
5215484 the presence of a video camera even if its a fake one is very often enough to change peoples behavior
5215485 the underlying network infrastructure will be susceptible to the same hiccups and shortcomings of any networking and storage architecture
5215486 the quality of license plate images is so easily degraded that complete accuracy is unlikely
5215487 in north america license plate fonts and colors vary from state to state and writing software that capable of accounting for these differences is very difficult the challenge is developing a powerful algorithm to account for the massive variety of plates
5215488 i think the real issue with incident response is how much data you have to go through to find something interesting that analysis is going to be the key challenge
5215489 the coalition forces invaded afghanistan and we know that women are very important to the forces that invaded afghanistan
5215490 our women and common people are important to us too about one month ago the coalition forces attacked a wedding in jalalabad that killed 49 people women children men boys everyone that was present
5215491 to take revenge on the coalition forces and foreign people and to show the world that our people are just as important as yours
5215492 traditionally badal or revenge has been one of the mainstays of the pashtunwali code or the way of the pashtun
5215493 so its not at all surprising to me that the taliban would use revenge as justification for the killing of the aid workers
5215494 afghanistan has to try to have good relations with you but if your government continues a reversed policy the afghans will be obliged to kill your nationals in revenge for their brothers their sisters and their children
5215495 events such as logar will happen again because occupied afghanistan looks at all actors that are established in the interest of america with an eye of hostility
5215496 the occupation of afghanistan so that the afghans are not killed with your hands and so that you are not killed with the hands of the afghans
5215497 they have to know that the canadian forces under american command handicap tens among the afghan people every day to this kind of condolence and they kill in addition to men numbers of women and children as well
5215498 rather it is the canadians who came to afghanistan to kill and torture the afghans to please the fascist regime of america your government did not take into account the national interests of canada and did not follow a neutral policy it sacrificed its national and international respect and standing in service of the interests of america
5215499 this is not a problem for us because this man is the same slave of the foreigners
5215500 its quite an honour to have an olympian in the family
5215501 when you came out to meet me today you didnt do a risk assessment you didnt wonder if youd come back alive
5215502 yes it has risks like any other job but its not inherently dangerous you can choose to avoid danger if you want
5215503 ive never been one of these people who got a thrill from danger
5215504 just one of those things that had to be done
5215505 instead of thinking how do i get out of this
5215506 over the years its become more fashionable to talk about emotional effects whereas i come from a generation whose parents went through six years of war and they didnt go around talking about how they coped
5215507 people who have suffered real trauma need some kind of therapeutic help
5215508 i think youd be surprised how people can cope ive seen people experience the most hellish things and what gets them on the right road again is love and friendship and care and concern people get a lot of comfort from the woman who brings in a cup of tea
5215509 i never comment on these matters i have other things to worry about
5215510 mad fungus which stuck its greasy stalks into every crevice and expanded to block light and logic
5215511 well that was john birt and hes gone now the management at the bbc went completely bananas
5215512 those issues are best left to people who work in newsrooms
5215513 i want the viewer to be informed about what is going on and let them have their own reactions if a journalist is in a war scene and walks by a series of corpses and says ive never seen anything like this well therell be some viewers who have seen such a thing so you havent reported as well as you could
5215514 in these days of 24 hour news you tend to get reporters standing by the satellite dishes instead of discovering the story
5215515 i spent about 45 minutes talking to the police and the demonstrators and nothing much was going on it was a bit of stand off
5215516 i later heard her speaking to camera about the threat of violence she was trying to make predictions and i thought no thats not news
5215517 people want me to be unhappy but im not ive nearly been killed three times so when i wake up in the morning im not filled with worry im glad to be alive
5215518 someone who spent too much time playing tennis having boyfriends and going to parties and who didnt see their a levels coming
5215519 no never we were all so busy drinking so hard there was no time for pot
5215520 and there was this man who was turning up at parties and singing and we would say shut up bryan it was bryan ferry
5215521 i suppose that i never got to nail bryan ferry when i had the chance
5215522 and may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were
5215523 not pursuing whether mccain heard any of the other questions
5215524 with the christmas holidays coming up and so many serving in our military id like to share how my grandmother sent me cakes mostly fruitcakes and biscuits all in good taste seattle university
5215525 we continue to have concerns in particular for these eight children which is why we have asked the judge to review the case
5215526 whether the children are in any immediate danger simply because their parents choose to raise them in this religion
5215527 the substance of what theyre doing here is fundamentally the same
5215528 you werent really shit but you werent all that great either like tottenham
5215529 must admit i got bored with that piers article half way through
5215530 we have to get behind him what took place in the summer was manipulation from agents and did not reflect his deep desire
5215531 are many of our boys heading off for the international w e
5215532 manu break very fast too bad they didnt have a striker well berbatov should be on his way anyway and so do chelsea well the way we play nowadays we need at least 5 6 passes to get into the 6 yard box we really need to speed that up our counter attack is pretty poor
5215533 why dont we break the bank and make a 30 million offer for essien chavski have too many players in his position amp he would be awesome alongside cesc at the very least it might prove that we have ambition
5215534 weve got brian brian marwood on the wing on the wing
5215535 hes big hes black he crashes through the pack big yo yo big yo yo
5215536 i think theo will come good remember he is being put out wide to teach him how to become a more a more cultured striker
5215537 its very much a return to old fashioned conservative lending
5215538 the current global market condition has given islamic finance a great opportunity to show what it can do help to fill the liquidity gap
5215539 they dont allow infinite leverage and the structure that you will be seeing increasingly will be tied ever more closely to underlying assets this is the right time for islamic finance to spread its wings

5215550 i think mr jones is a member of the bourgeois class who knows he should feel but never learned how he pays his dues gives to charities is well educated but inside he feels nothing because he hasnt learned how to actually connect with anyone or anything emotionally so he has empty sex with prostitutes and lives an unfulfilled life despite otherwise having every superficial marker of success
5215551 yeah i think bob dylan is trying to tell us that mr jones is a complex character
5215552 ed dude is that you remember its me jose we worked on that one english assignment about bob dylan together

5215557 i got like 135 access points off the freeway on my way up here from santa cruz
5215558 i think most people would presume that you have permission to access that open network thats become the social norm but its a little unclear what the law is
5215559 i think for most people an open network is a nice neighborly thing to do
5215560 youve given that person access to your home and he can hack your home
5215561 how much do you trust your neighbors and how much do you trust well anybody that can get geographic proximity to your network
5215562 if a bad guy wants to commit a crime he usually wants to avoid committing it in a place that it can be traced back to him
5215563 people are always going to look for the easy targets if youre too much of a headache unless theres something they specifically want from you theyre going to look for an easier target
5215564 its really about making yourself tougher than the next guy

5215567 you have to hear the responses inside the shin bet to the release they work day and night to capture and neutralize terrorists and all of it is gone in an instant
5215568 people in the shin bet end up asking why do we capture these people
5215569 same problem here youtube videos or normal videos played either with mplayer or vlc
5215570 since the mba according to the guy is to be used for email web
5215571 its not normal that the same error happens with two macbook airs from the same owner ill have to check with my supervisor
5215572 the issue is not hardware related and will be fixed with a software release
5215573 we are working on that and i do not have the answer at this time
5215574 if you want it done right you are gonna have to do it your self
5215575 not so much for mr dion but for the liberal brand and for the government too
5215576 i think it will be a combination of the environment and the economy
5215577 were very excited that hes going to be shaking things up in that riding and giving the other candidates a run for their money
5215578 that doesnt mean we wont have a little correction and that will provide longer term investors with an opportunity to buy into the u s dollar
5215579 im directing my sales effort to people that need protection against the canadian dollar falling
5215580 im of the opinion that the u s dollar is still in a major downtrend that started eight years ago
5215581 you cant just be flipping back and forth as a retail investor you leave that for the big boys
5215582 if you have reasons to have u s dollars and u s income then stick with it
5215583 its a strong statement on the coastal industrys current position
5215584 we did not get to where we are in a couple of years it took decades to get it wrong
5215585 this is nothing short of tragic h r macmillan must be rolling over in his grave
5215586 we are seeing a global shift where other companies now have huge competitive advantages over us
5215587 these are monstrous companies capable of attracting new investment money
5215588 we have a lot of things going for us a stable political regime an educated workforce and fabulous fibre but our costs are too high
5215589 it would be great to see a local success story because of what the mill means to the nanaimo economy
5215590 part of it is no ones fault simply economics the impact of the fiber shortages from the sawmilling side the canadian dollar and such but that is not the whole story
5215591 we have all been very used to extracting wealth from the forest sector to the point where the various rents are making survival very difficult
5215592 the most telling example of this for me was the jubilation in nanaimo when the city executives celebrated the fact that they were going to get their 3
5215593 the first one tipped and the other one was right behind its amazing how the girl went straight down
5215594 we extend our heartfelt condolences to the family and friends of the young woman who perished in this tragic accident
5215595 there is a risk involved to being in that river absolutely
5215596 its strong and its mother nature it can be unpredictable
5215597 when we hear about people drowning on the river its usually people who have been out there either inner tubing or fishing no life jacket no helmet no training
5215598 we do the best we can to make it as safe as possible but with any adventure sport its called an adventure sport for a reason theres always a risk

5215762 a further announcement to the market will be made when appropriate
5215763 he tried to justify pretty much what he had done but i think at the end of the day this was the only option because the space for him to remain president had shrunk so much that it had become impossible to carry on
5215764 this is a positive sign considering we were looking at a long drawn out confrontation that will be avoided now
5215765 its a major victory for the new government but there is still a lot of uncertainty going forward the main unifying force for the new coalition government was their mistrust of musharraf and it remains to be seen whether they can resolve the remaining issues
5215766 first is the restoration of the deposed judges they have set a three day deadline for that next is the war of terror and both parties do not see eye to eye on the strategy for that going forward
5215767 i expect markets to remain strong in the next two to three from the initial jubilation from musharrafs resignation
5215768 it eliminates all the uncertainty in the market and i think the political uncertainty is coming to an end the government will hopefully start concentrating on the economy from an economic point of view they have no excuses now and they have to perform
5215769 as to whether it is good or bad for the country that remains to be seen and we will tell two to three years from now
5215770 the broader issue right now is will it clear up the political situation will the coalition government work together will there be a power grab coalition government sticking together to address the economic problems rising inflation widening trade gap et cetera

5215779 in my 19 years in this business i have never seen anything like this
5215780 i have seen many buyers come in with a lot of cash money but never this much money in coins
5215781 he had dimes quarters half dollars silver and susan b anthony dollars it took me an hour and a half to count all of it
5215782 paper money will burn but it is hard to damage coins i bought four or five rolls of coins each month i dont know how long it took me to save this amount probably all my life spending some of it now in then
5215783 he gave me lunch money in coins and each time he ever gave me money it was in coins
5215784 i am amazed that we were able to talk him into buying a new truck because he is pretty tight with his money
5215785 he still wanted to fix up the old truck and keep driving it but i convinced him to give it up

5215810 eso no quiere decir que las autoridades espa olas no busquen a los tramposos pero deben aceptar que hay un problema con el dopaje desde hace tiempo que tienen que afrontarlo con todas las fuerzas
5215811 no creo que haya problemas con los controles por sorpresa en espa a lo que pasa es que el control que se le hizo en pek n lleg en el buen momento justo a cinco d as de la competici n si se la hubiera controlado durante la carrera el producto dopante ya habr a desaparecido de su organismo

5215857 its a whole new kind of car for a whole new kind of people who really dig driving
5215858 its not how young you are its how old you arent
5215859 while the car shared a platform and many components with the 1969 camaro
5215860 no that is not the case the 1970 camaro is in fact the first of the second generation camaros there might be some parts interchangeability with the 69 camaro but a 1970 camaro has more in common with a 1981 camaro or a 1976 nova platform wise than it does with a 1969 camaro
5215861 the car shared a platform and many components with the 1969 camaro
5215862 your point seems to be that they are basically the same car and then you try to explain it away by saying that you meant that they were both f body cars
5215863 sometimes its hard to get a compleate skin treatment because you can not get everything from one label but

5215867 when people dont get the information or treatment that would allow them to manage illnesses at an early stage or avoid a disease altogether the costs of health care escalate and the burden of expensive late stage medicine often falls to publicly funded health services
5215868 an important strategy to reduce chronic illness and the costs associated with it is through prevention via regular monitoring and educational initiatives
5215869 whether youre legal or illegal its always been assumed that your medical information is private and cant be used against you
5215870 the doctor patient relationship is sacred and im not sure that has really been challenged until now were in uncharted territory
5215871 if people have enough money to send home which is what many of them are doing then theyve got money to pay some of their medical bills
5215872 but health directors have to defend the essential public health services practically every day

5215879 i think the russians will pull out but will damage georgia strongly
5215880 georgia will survive but russia has lost its credibility in the eyes of the world
5215881 i think there needs to be a strong unified response to russia to send the message that this kind of behavior characteristic of the soviet period has no place in the 21st century
5215882 have to call an extraordinary meeting of the council of the european union to decide what consequences to draw
5215883 i wouldnt say theres a humanitarian catastrophe but theres an urgent need for primary products
5215884 i think you should do it its good for you
5215885 well yeah sure i know i dont have a disease like so and so but my boyfriend of three years just broke my heart and you have no idea how that feels i would take the disease over a broken heart anyday
5215886 and i consider it an honor to be able to be a girl playing
5215887 yeah i think that theyre getting respect especially after people start hitting each other
5215888 whenever you have a good team that supports you thats what matters
5215889 they were surprised but they were really happy that im doing it
5215890 not too much i mean its a challenge but youve got to be able to push yourself im happy
5215891 i played quite a bit not for a team so much but i am now
5215892 hey i dont blow deadlines the work gets done and except for a few columns my work exists upon the script of floating timetables that afford wiggle room such that rare is a hard and fast deadline that warrants such unsettled slumber
5215893 my goal was to get within a couple of shots after the front nine
5215894 i knew lanto would make a run and he started to throw birdie after birdie at me later in the round
5215895 but i took my dads advice and i played the rest of the round one shot at a time
5215896 its a real honor to win this tournament on my home course
5215897 it was a great feeling to walk up the 18th fairway and see my family and friends everyone who supported me and helped me improve lanto made me earn it
5215898 2008 aber werden viele wunder geschehen und zwar in allen sportarten
5215899 there is no confidence at all and no money entering the market to clean up this mess so no one can call a floor now
5215900 money poured into south locomotive as its price looked relatively attractive in such a weak market but much of the buying looks speculative and risky
5215901 mark ronson wants to write his own tunes instead of ruining everyone elses he needs to learn three chords on the guitar and write a tune
5215902 learn three chords on the guitar and go write a tune
5215903 there is a two tier nhs in fact the scottish one and the english one
5215904 not go after your heart and your eyes after which you stray
5215905 i am going to try to look and see the wall over there
5215906 i am going to look at the wall that is over there over here in my mind
5215907 i do not like where i will end up if i let that lust take me away even at these times of great desire we can look away from that attraction and go on to something else
5215908 its kind of sad in a way summer is ending
5215909 some of the kids theyve come to the idea that theyre going back to school soon and dont want to do anything
5215910 they dont even come to the pool its just like they put their heads down and look at their feet they know whats coming

5215914 after consultations with legal advisers and close political supporters and on their advice im taking the decision of resigning
5215915 my resignation will go to the speaker of the national assembly monday
5215916 this is an issue that is not on the table
5215917 the staff nicole was very helpful choosing the right fabric and color for my couch and the headboard

5215926 i enjoyed the opportunity to meet senator obama and discuss an issue that is americas top priority which is ending our dependence on foreign oil that today is approaching 70 percent of our imports and is costing us 700 billion a year
5215927 i assured senator obama that this is a non partisan campaign and that i will do everything in my power to work together with leaders who are willing to solve our immense energy problems which are ruining our economy and threatening our national security
5215928 as i did with senator mccain on friday i stressed the urgency of the situation and the need to end the largest transfer of wealth in human history
5215929 we discussed my plan and the opportunities to create jobs grow our economy and revitalize americas heartland by using private capital to invest in renewable energy including wind and solar power that are among our most abundant and untapped natural resources
5215930 we also discussed the pickens plans success and our efforts to get more than one million supporters
5215931 the immediate cash injection coupled with zooms interest in joint project involvement will provide both an immediate financial boost plus broad operational and technical support to our green energy drive across three continents
5215932 quite apart from zoom we are now attracting growing attention from world class energy infrastructure and engineering majors in many parts of the world
5215933 increasing global political consumer and regulatory pressures arising out of climate change concerns are driving many governments as well as national and multinational companies to look for viable technologies which can provide early climate and emissions solutions
5215934 this push will help accelerate the pace at which edens technologies and projects are able to be rolled out we believe zoom will be a strong strategic partner with its broad affiliations particularly in india where eden is focusing its efforts to market hythane as an ultra low emission high efficiency fuel
5215935 on the new atheist record we are going to record a blazing cover of the brilliant yyz from rush

5215941 als uitloper van de amerikaanse financi le crisis vorig jaar zien we meer voorzichtigheid op het vlak van risicovol ondernemerschap
5215942 onder meer de vastgoedsector ook in antwerpen houdt het hart vast we zien ook bij ons een lichte daling van het aantal buitenlandse investeringen ik verwacht wel een lichte vertraging in de economische bedrijvigheid maar er is geen reden tot ongerustheid door de daling van de olie en grondstofprijzen gaan de economische activiteiten zich herpakken
5215943 veel laaggeschoolden vonden werk dankzij het aanzuigeffect van een goed draaiende economie
5215944 werkgevers zochten dringend werkvolk obstakels als taal waren geen probleem meer sommige beleidsmensen stellen daarom onze projecten nu in vraag alleen vrees ik dat de economie weer aan het kantelen is werkgevers maken opnieuw meer bezwaar over onder meer de kennis van het nederlands wij werken met mensen die kampen met problemen als schulden geen diploma of geen kinderopvang daarom zullen wij steeds noodzakelijk zijn

5215956 as journalists were good at finding great sources of information and distinguishing whats important but we also want to harness the very significant capabilities of our community
5215957 it only takes a very small percentage of people being active in a topic for it to be really vibrant and valuable for everybody else
5215958 ordinary social media are too broad to draw ads but we can sell display ads reaching a specific audience on electronics or cars or medical devices

5215970 google is good for a general search but not at understanding the specific needs of specific people like sports fans
5215971 facebook and other social network sites do a good job of connecting you to people all over your life but its not relevant to your sports interests
5215972 were isolating that subset of sports friends and giving you instant communication with them
5215973 fans like to test their wits about anything they think they know best
5215974 compete on any topic they want against anyone at any time
5215975 david understands what sports fans want but can he sustain traffic and engagement sports fans will vote with their mouse
5215976 and its been interesting to see people embrace our bringing the games to them
5215977 we didnt find evidence that sports fans are angry with the current online sports space

5215986 in tien jaar iab heb ik veel interactieve trends tot in de keuken mogen bekijken de uitdaging is om tijdig op deze trends in te spelen met nieuwe bureaus dankzij de goede resultaten van lacomunidad heb ik kunnen investeren in de ontwikkeling van viraltracker dat in 2007 een internationale doorbraak beleefde de insights van viraltracker en de aansluiting bij het wereldwijde wpp netwerk opende zoveel internationale deuren dat de laatste stap naar een triple play propositie in mijn ogen niet mocht uitblijven de oprichting van socialmedia8 was dus een logische laatste stap

5215998 the audience of enthusiasts bloggers and those that are the most passionate about windows represent the folks we are dedicating this blog to with this blog were opening up a two way discussion about how we are making windows 7 windows has all the challenges of every large scale software project picking features designing them developing them and delivering them with high quality windows has an added challenge of doing so for an extraordinarily diverse set of customers as a team and as individuals on the team we continue to be humbled by this responsibility we strongly believe that success for windows 7 includes an open and honest and two way discussion about how we balance all of these interests and deliver software on the scale of windows we promise and will deliver such a dialog with this blog planning a product like windows involves systematic learning from customers of all types in terms of planning the release weve been working with a wide variety of customers and partners pc makers hardware developers enterprise customers developers and more since the start of the project we also continue our broad consumer learning through telemetry customer experience improvement program usability studies and more one area this blog will soon explore is all the different ways we learn from customers and the marketplace that inform the release we have two significant events for developers and the overall ecosystem around windows this fall the professional developers conference winhec the following week both represent the first venues where we will provide in depth technical information about windows 7 this blog will provide context over the next 2 months with regular posts about the behind the scenes development of the release and continue through the release of the product
5215999 in leading up to this blog we have seen a lot of discussion in blogs about what microsoft might be trying to accomplish by maintaining a little bit more control over the communication around windows 7 some might say that this is a significant understatement

5216006 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
5216007 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
5216008 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5216009 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5216010 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5216011 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5216012 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
5216013 form a good basis for a speedy resolution of outstanding matters
5216014 it wont last unless its a common product that is owned by this entire collective of the leadership of zimbabwe
5216015 the gap between the parties is narrower points of disagreement are not so wide
5216016 the parties still are far from each other though on one point and that is the executive powers that should go to the president and the prime minister that is the stumbling block
5216017 it is critical that we conclude these negotiations very soon i hope that wise counsel and wisdom will prevail as the mdc we welcome the fact that the dialogue will continue under the framework of the memorandum of understanding we are fully and firmly committed to the process of dialogue
5216018 the troika continues to engage with this matter and indeed after we have formally closed the organ will convene again it is an indication of the seriousness with which the sadc approaches this question
5216019 a speedy conclusion needs to be reached so that it indeed becomes possible to address the enormous challenges that face the masses of the people of zimbabwe
5216020 its better not to have a deal than to have a bad deal
5216021 promote the development of democratic institutions and practices within the territories of state parties and encourage the observance of universal human rights as provided for in the charter and conventions of the african union and the united nations
5216022 declare the presidential run off elections of the 27th of june 2008 and its outcome illegitimate and unacceptable
5216023 send a peace keeping force to zimbabwe in concurrence with the african union charter united nations charter and sadc protocol on politics defence and security cooperation article 2 2 to confine zimbabwean police and armed forces to the barracks and disband youth militia amp war veterans and close their military base camps
5216024 call off the elections planned for september 2008 because they will be undemocratic due to the flawed processes and hostile political environment in swaziland
5216025 unban political parties the continued banning of political parties which was initially authored by the kings proclamation to the nation of 1973 has since been validated by the new constitution promulgated in 2005
5216026 grant amnesty to all political exiles although continually denied by the state several swazi nationals remain in exile for fear of persecution by the state
5216027 allow the evolution of a truly representative national dialogue or national convention which will result in a truly democratic constitution which will be a true representation of the people of swaziland the current constitution remains illegitimate as it was unilaterally driven without the critical input of swazi stakeholders
5216028 end the cancerous corruption and greed the royal family has entrenched a deep culture of cancerous corruption and greed in swazi society with the state institutions permanently ingrained in pervasive corruption that eats away the social fibre of swazi society

5216034 under these conditions children are highly vulnerable save the children is moving quickly to meet their critical needs as the numbers of displaced continue to rise
5216035 right now our primary focus is on delivering life saving relief
5216036 displaced families are telling us they urgently need food basic hygiene products and cooking utensils
5216037 due to security there are entire communities in the worst affected areas cut off from humanitarian aid
5216038 it is critical that humanitarian organizations gain safe and unrestricted access to these areas so that we can assess and respond to the needs of children and their families
5216039 we urge the international community to ensure that the humanitarian corridors remain open so that aid can get through to children in the areas hardest hit by this crisis

5216053 its unfortunate but i dont think its a reflection of the friendship centre or the crowds we draw
5216054 at this point we dont believe there are any safety concerns in relation to this they did the best they could at this point were continuing to look at that angle of it
5216055 i ducked down everyone waiting on the bench ducked down

5216059 with the worlds gaming eyes on the games convention at leipzig it was a natural and perfect venue for us to announce our cooperation with nokia in germany this and other announcements we have planned have the potential to extend and unlock the creativity of game and application development to a new level
5216060 the cooperation with zeemote shows that nokia is serious about casual gaming we invest in hardware and software to bring consumers a whole new mobile gaming experience
5216061 sometimes i yell at them slow down and then they look at me as if i was a jerk in fact they are the jerks
5216062 its the cyclists and the roller bladers and sometimes even the runners its about people being too inconsiderate
5216063 a caution sign would be a good idea or speed bumps or some rumble strips
5216064 since november i havent seen a really bad accident thats surprising
5216065 seven miles per hour is the maximum speed here and a lot of times the bikers dont obey that sometimes they give you a look as if they think its their raceway
5216066 joggers pedestrians have the right of way except during sanctioned and or organized running races bicyclists all other trail users have the right of way except during sanctioned bicycle races
5216067 pretty chaotic it should have been addressed a long time ago
5216068 are coming through at almost 20 miles per hour and zigzag around the pedestrians
5216069 sometimes some kids dont know whats going on and they step in your way
5216070 im about 10 years behind the technology revolution if someone asks me can you get on the internet i say yes in about 60 seconds and i call david yarkin
5216071 those who have known him for so long know that the computer was not part of his world 20 years ago and we could have predicted with absolute accuracy that it wouldnt be part of his world 20 years later
5216072 hes still a guy who says fax that to me
5216073 what he doesnt understand is that people dont get them instantaneously
5216074 he doesnt pay us to include him in the process he pays us to run the process and he makes the decision
5216075 theres something about putting your words with your own hand on paper
5216076 thats better i think than putting them on a machine it feels good and if you write something out the ability to remember it is far greater
5216077 he takes a stack of papers home and always comes back the next day with them all marked up its better than someone using a blackberry on the fly

5216082 it is time to move heparin off the farm and into the factory where it will be safer to make and more regulated
5216083 the crisis was motivation to pull this kind of technical gee whiz process we used in our laboratories and think about how to scale it up to producing heparin by the metric ton
5216084 we use approximately three trillion units of heparin a year in the u s
5216085 its truly immense at jefferson we were using 1 000 multidose vials a week
5216086 the way that he has outlined this i think it is very feasible
5216087 after consultations with legal advisers and close political supporters and on their advice im taking the decision of resigning
5216088 my resignation will go to the speaker of the national assembly today
5216089 they chose to be soldiers theres a great love for it
5216090 people just get lonely and need somebody to talk to
5216091 its great to go around and lift so many spirits
5216092 my 5 year old daughter asks daddy are you coming home tomorrow
5216093 it makes it easier for me to step up when hes just incredible
5216094 while i understand that were soldiers and do what were told they basically took my job away and made me do something i have no business doing
5216095 its ready to shoot people not inspect detainees for boo boos
5216096 they essentially have us coming in to be military police

5216105 the vehicle in the photograph is a tyne and wear fire and rescue service operational appliance and were in the process of investigating the reasons why it has seemingly stopped in this location
5216106 while appliances may often be seen passing through the quayside in newcastle on their return to home stations after being called out to incidents or after carrying out other duties they shouldnt be parked unless its to deal with a query from a member of the public or to carry out a standard inspection of a premise
5216107 if that hasnt been the case in this situation we will be investigating and will be taking any necessary action
5216108 tyne and wear fire and rescue service would never condone the misuse of fire and rescue appliances or the valuable time of professional firefighters as its being alleged is the case here

5216147 just worrying about calming myself down and just breaking a good shot and so i didnt even look at the number

5216149 and as i get down into the is when i start to get on the trigger
5216150 as i was starting to get on the trigger the gun just went off
5216151 i was like uh thats not going to be good
5216152 hearing the spectators cheering i felt maybe i got the silver but my coach told me i got the gold
5216153 i said that last time and its the truth maybe last time the reason was katy this time i dont know yet but im sure something goods going to come from it
5216154 more important than medals i think the athens losses hurt him as a human being for like a year and a half
5216155 keeth looked at himself as a failure after that it was very difficult for us because we loved him he had a tough time dealing with all that but sunday he slayed that dragon
5216156 they wanted us to finally medal it feels like a family medal to me
5216157 i really didnt think much about what had happened in 04
5216158 i just went out there and followed the game plan id worked out with my teammates in the morning i was fortunate enough to be successful this time
5216159 keeth took it really hard in athens which he didnt need to do

5216175 those claims are disgraceful theyre an insult to prison officers who go to work each day to do their job
5216176 i think there should be measures to reduce the overtime levels but to casualise the workforce isnt going to make it safer
5216177 what we do have is an overtime culture and its been a strong overtime culture
5216178 that in itself creates fatigue and associated sick leave which then fuels further claims for overtime
5216179 its not good for workplace safety and its certainly not good for the prison system

5216185 he tried to justify pretty much what he had done but i think at the end of the day this was the only option because the space for him to remain president had shrunk so much that it had become impossible to carry on
5216186 this is a positive sign considering we were looking at a long drawn out confrontation that will be avoided now
5216187 its a major victory for the new government but there is still a lot of uncertainty going forward the main unifying force for the new coalition government was their mistrust of musharraf and it remains to be seen whether they can resolve the remaining issues
5216188 first is the restoration of the deposed judges they have set a three day deadline for that next is the war of terror and both parties do not see eye to eye on the strategy for that going forward
5216189 i expect markets to remain strong in the next two to three from the initial jubilation from musharrafs resignation
5216190 it eliminates all the uncertainty in the market and i think the political uncertainty is coming to an end the government will hopefully start concentrating on the economy from an economic point of view they have no excuses now and they have to perform
5216191 as to whether it is good or bad for the country that remains to be seen and we will tell two to three years from now
5216192 the broader issue right now is will it clear up the political situation will the coalition government work together will there be a power grab coalition government sticking together to address the economic problems rising inflation widening trade gap et cetera
5216193 as a child wilma was underweight and sickly and also special and spoiled not an easy circumstance in the boisterous family of railroad man ed rudolph and his wife blanche who together brought home less than 2 500 year and lived without indoor plumbing in a dusty red framed house at 644 kellogg street in the poor and black section of clarksville tennessee
5216194 during the worst years of wilmas childhood infirmity they took turns carrying her from room to room
5216195 as wilma later described her early childhood she was depressed and lonely at first especially when she had to watch her brothers and sisters run off to school while she stayed home burdened with the dead weight of the heavy braces she felt rejected she said and would close her eyes and just drift off into a sinking feeling going down down down soon her loneliness turned to anger she hated the fact that her peers always teased her she didnt like any of her supposed friends she wondered whether living just meant being sick all the time and told herself it had to be more than that and she started fighting back determined to beat the illness
5216196 why should we make the same mistakes here as in other parts of the mediterranean
5216197 tourism is the most direct way for people to make money
5216198 but unless its developed carefully well see the dalmatian islands go the same way as many other parts of the mediterranean covered in concrete
5216199 the biodiversity of the dalmatian islands is incredibly well preserved
5216200 the waters are home to important fisheries dolphins endemic posidonia sea grass meadows and loggerhead turtles while the forests are home to many rare and endemic plants animals and birds
5216201 we must be clever when we make decisions about how to make money
5216202 many people think that all we need to do is provide beds for tourists
5216203 but building a hotel for 2 000 people on an island that only has 400 year round residents doesnt make sense where will the water come from and where will the garbage go and how can a big hotel thats only full for one or two months help us to survive the whole year we need to develop something more sustainable that wont destroy the resources we have
5216204 but the local people dont like this they cant do anything without permission and theyre excluded from managing the park a nature park is different it allows for human activities and so makes more sense for island communities
5216205 local people are the most valuable resource for protecting biodiversity and landscapes
5216206 if there are thriving communities on the islands that benefit from nature then protection will be sustainable but it wont be if the communities die
5216207 mass tourism often destroys local culture and doesnt contribute significantly to local income
5216208 in many cases most of the profits flow to foreign tour operators and investors for example 2 3 of the income from mediterranean tourism over the last three years went to fewer than 10 tour operators from northern europe
5216209 i want the children to look at lastovo not just pass things by this way theyll be proud of their home and more interested in its future
5216210 mass tourism can only bring short term benefits to this area
5216211 the key attraction of the dalmatian islands is their natural beauty and cultural heritage were not trying to prevent people from enjoying this but rather trying to preserve it for everyones advantage now and in the future

5216216 this is an issue that is not on the table
5216217 we wont rule it out but we are working on a christmas special now
5216218 there has to be a story to tell i think there is another life to the show but ruth jones and i dont know what is after the special

5216222 ive got loads on at the moment ive got another book out a style guide at the end of the year and im filming the new series of real women
5216223 im working on a new range of cosmetics to come out next year im really excited about that
5216224 about self glorification of a man that is moving on
5216225 im clinging on to reality i have no idea how anyone else feels because this is my first time
5216226 is it normal to do shows every week every day all over the world
5216227 i still want to hang out with my friends and have a drink but i dont have any time sometimes it does my head in but i wouldnt have it any different i mean maybe my mum wont know what to get me for christmas because she likes to get me shoes and i keep on being given them but thats about it really
5216228 im not going into it because i want every person to have their own reaction to it
5216229 its theirs now not mine whats important is that people enjoy it for themselves when i am dead and gone thats what will remain that record thats what makes me happy nothing else really
5216230 most people would prefer a bigger stronger bbc to a smaller weaker one
5216231 all we can do now is go back and see how it all plays out

5216235 microsoft is so full of holes thats why its still a target if you limit your exposure to microsoft youre going to be in a more secure environment
5216236 the reality is that its in companies interest that software should become obsolete and that you should have to buy every upgrade
5216237 things will start to change when people start losing all of their personal photos
5216238 but to be honest i have serious doubts that this will really happen
5216239 i would be very surprised if that would really happen
5216240 businesses seeking to go green must look at cutting the red tape their employees face in implementing energy efficient work practices
5216241 our research shows that its a feeling of needing to ask permission to make positive changes which prevents workers from taking the necessary steps
5216242 weve kind of thrown the same type of game out again very little offence and the pitching was absolutely great
5216243 you have to tip your cap to the pitcher sometime but it gets to a point where youve got to make things happen
5216244 it was a game we had to have it was a must game for us and again we just couldnt generate the offence when it was needed
5216245 i was giving him a fastball that i wanted him to either swing at and put in play or take for a strike
5216246 i didnt want to fall behind 3 0 so i gave him one to hit it was a little bit higher than id like and he put a pretty good swing on it
5216247 some big situations came up and i couldnt get the job done
5216248 for this tour we decided to go back to the organic roots of why we started this band it was to play with friends and see the country after being on such a light touring schedule for the last 9 months we really had time to think about where we want this band to fit this tour encapsulates our mind frame for playing music
5216249 i think bands these days think they deserve so much in my opinion were lucky to do what we do its comforting to know there are other bands who are down for the cause and willing to be part of this
5216250 it will be the first time we have performed them so they will definitely transform during the course of the tour
5216251 we have very high hopes for eurogamer benelux and expect it to be a leading site in the region before long
5216252 weve partnered with a great team and we all cant wait to get the new site established
5216253 our experienced team of passionate gamers and the well known eurogamer network both make sure that the future is looking very bright for all dutch gamers

5216259 per me benedetto xvi un secondo padre con lui si ragiona ma sempre con allegria
5216260 annunciare dio introdurre nella relazione con dio insegnare a pregare la preghiera fede in atto
5216261 con profonda emozione ho appreso dellimprovvisa morte di s e mons wilhelm emil egger vescovo di bolzano bressanone lavevo lasciato pochi giorni fa apparentemente in buona salute nulla faceva pensare ad una sua cos rapida dipartita
5216262 mi unisco al cordoglio dei parenti e dellintera diocesi ha detto benedetto xvi nella quale era apprezzato ed amato per il suo impegno e per la sua dedizione nellelevare al signore una fervida preghiera di suffragio per questo suo servo buono e fedele invio una speciale confortatrice benedizione apostolica al fratello religioso cappuccino agli altri parenti e a tutti i sacerdoti i religiosi le religiose ed i fedeli della diocesi di bolzano bressanone
5216263 una personalit che ha lavorato sempre alla ricerca di ci che unisce e non che divide che ha fatto del senso di equilibrio e della convivenza i cardini della sua missione pastorale
5216264 al papa le vacanze a bressanone sono veramente piaciute aveva detto luned scorso 11 agosto mons egger incontrando i giornalisti poco prima della partenza di benedetto xvi e lo ha espresso in pi occasioni in questi giorni ha potuto fare ci che pi desiderava stare in casa a leggere a studiare e passeggiare in giardino
5216265 abbiamo bisogno di silenzio e di preghiera e nella lettura orante della sacra scrittura ci verr quella luce e quella forza di cui abbiamo bisogno queste letture questa lezione sul silenzio ci fa capire anche il ritiro di vacanza e il silenzio del santo padre in queste due settimane tante persone gli avrebbero voluto stringere la mano ma il santo padre ha proprio bisogno di questo breve tempo di riposo e di silenzio cos tutti noi possiamo imparare dal silenzio del papa anche noi abbiamo bisogno di tempi di riposo soprattutto quello domenicale di approfondimenti di tematiche che sono per noi importanti di silenzio e di preghiera
5216266 il vostro vescovo mi ha detto che nel programma diocesano di questanno c la santificazione della domenica aveva ricordato benedetto xvi e in verit quanto importante la domenica non soltanto come un momento di distensione di cui abbiamo bisogno ma la distensione da sola non sufficiente e la domenica rimane vuota anzi torniamo forse pi stressati e pi vuoti di prima se questa domenica non ha un su centro nellincontro con il cristo risorto credo che domenica scorsa e oggi tutti noi abbiamo potuto sperimentare quanto bello quando possiamo incontrare il signore nelleucaristia incontrandoci cos anche tra di noi ecco perch vi invito tutti di cuore a raccogliere questo programma diocesano anche a livello personale e nelle vostre parrocchie
5216267 i shovel it off and use a blow torch to melt the ice
5216268 the focal point for me was the cauldron its the only meet in the world where youve got this big flame on the top of the building
5216269 the fire just hypnotizes you it was really kind of cool throwing at it
5216270 those five rings add so much to it it is just another track meet but doing this for the first time its pretty overwhelming
5216271 its a combination of a lot of sports its the strength of a football player agility of a figure skater the back flexibility of a golfer its a combination of everything put into one
5216272 one of my favourite ways to describe it is chaotic ballet thats about as close to a good definition as you can get
5216273 its all about efficiency now rather than pure brute strength

5216302 er is altijd een interactie tussen de tijdsgeest de noden en de opportuniteiten ik was territoriaal opbouwwerker wat betekent dat ik de noden van de buurt vertaalde naar de overheid toe zodat ze daar oplossingen voor kon fabriceren eind jaren 80 gaf de toenmalig minister lenssens de opdracht aan de opbouwwerkers om zich meer bezig te houden met kansarmoedebestrijding ik heb een project uitgedokterd om tegemoet te komen aan de wens van de minister zonder mijn engagement in mijn geliefde rupelstreek te moeten stopzetten bij toeval zag ik een reportage over de bataviawerf een werklozenproject in lelystad daar bouwden werklozen een replica van het voc ship waarmee ze in de nederlandse gouden eeuw specerijen haalden in india toen ging er een lichtje branden wat de batavia betekende voor nederland betekenden de steenschuiten vroeger voor deze streek het idee om schepen te bouwen met werklozen kende drie grote voordelen het was een tegemoetkoming aan de eisen van de minister voor de kansarmoedebestrijding het zorgde voor het behoud van een typische ambacht van de streek namelijk het bouwen van schepen en het maritiem cultuurpatrimonium werd uitgebouwd
5216303 het was geen makkelijke opstart maar anders zou er geen uitdaging meer aan geweest zijn
5216304 mensen die van geen hout pijlen meer weten maken die leren wij van hout boten maken
5216305 we vragen eerst of ze zich door de vdab gestuurd voelen
5216306 ze weten toch dat ze me met rust moeten laten
5216307 zowel jongeren als volwassenen komen hier regelmatig terecht voor de uitvoering van hun werkstraf wij maken geen onderscheid tussen de verschillende cursisten we stellen hen voor als een nieuwe collega als ze zelf niet vertellen dat ze hier een werkstraf uitvoeren dan zeggen wij zelf ook niets dat hoort tot ons beroepsgeheim
5216308 de werklozen gestuurd via de vdab zijn vaak ouder dan 25 maar dat is wel de categorie waarvan we ondervinden dat die nooit hun draai gevonden hebben als die dan beseffen dat de steenschuit hun laatste kans is dan zijn ze enorm gemotiveerd als ze dan merken dat als ze hier iets niet kunnen ze het opnieuw mogen proberen en dat de groep dat ook aanvaardt dan merk je snel dat dit de dankbaarste groep is
5216309 ons motto is al doende leert men als we aan een groot schip aan het werken zijn bepalen de vorderingen aan het schip welke opleiding ze krijgen er is een groot verschil tussen de ruwbouw en bijvoorbeeld de afwerking waar veel meer schildertechnieken aan te pas komen de cursisten weten in het begin niets af van deze technieken en moeten bij nul beginnen dat komen en gaan kan soms frustrerend zijn voor de begeleiders die het geduld en de gave moeten hebben om het over te brengen
5216310 voor ons is het minder belangrijk aan wat voor soort schip ze werken
5216311 tatjana is hier als administratief brugproject maar ze wou ook wel eens proberen te lassen ze mag dat eens proberen maar je weet nooit wat het resultaat is we laten de cursisten echt proeven van de verschillende zaken zodat ze een weloverwogen keuze kunnen maken nadien via ons project kunnen ze kennismaken maken met de verschillenden beroepen
5216312 er zijn er wel die in de scheepsbouw terecht komen scheepsbouw is immers een microbe eenmaal je daardoor gebeten bent kan je niet meer zonder een aantal mensen zijn echt verslingerd geraakt aan de scheepsbouw en hebben werk gezocht in het buitenland bijvoorbeeld in nederland
5216313 al de anderen moeten we laten gaan soms met tranen in de ogen het
5216314 die steenschuit zal er nog wel komen daarin ben ik een koppigaard eerste klas we hebben nu ook ons eigen ponton zodat hij dan ook hier kan aanmeren
5216315 op het einde van dit project kwamen al de werktechnieken samen zodat we hier extra instructeurs voor hebben aangenomen dat was een bijzondere ervaring zowel voor onze cursisten als voor de leerlingen van die instructeurs die het een buitenkans vonden om aan een schip te werken
5216316 mensen vroegen me wanneer ik nu eens iets ging doen voor boom de steenschuit clotilde een schip uit 1910 hebben we gerestaureerd en wordt nu als theaterzaaltje gebruikt dat schip gaan we nu nabouwen in metaal daardoor kunnen we een lasopleiding organiseren die we nu aan het voorbereiden zijn met de inrichting van een lasatelier hiermee beantwoorden we ook aan de vraag van de vdab om iets te doen aan de knelpuntberoepen zoals metaalbewerking

5216342 younger children seem more interested in setting short term goals for their learning in the game compared to older children who are more interested in simply playing and the actions of playing
5216343 the big picture is that there are several dimensions on which games have effects including the amount they are played the content of each game what you have to pay attention to on the screen and how you control the motions
5216344 this means that games are not good or bad but are powerful educational tools and have many effects we might not have expected they could

5216519 the latest is that the protest lodged by the americans has been rejected
5216520 on the grounds that they jurors of appeal checked the evidence they spoke with the starter they looked at the video and determined it was a fair start

5216522 i dont want to call the americans poor losers so what ill do right now is to continue to be positive and continue to feel excited and to feel pride in the athletes and in our country
5216523 the only pressure on me was to go out there and execute so i felt no pressure

5216533 it did not re tender or obtain a new no objection from cabinet for the purchases of drugs and medical supplies it should be noted that this situation continued in 2006
5216534 drugs and medical supplies purchased were delivered to the central stores and the pharmacy bond for which records for the receipt of items were maintained however with regards to those delivered to the materials management unit no records were kept for the receipt or delivery of drugs and medical supplies in the circumstances it was difficult to ascertain whether the corporation had received full value for money expended
5216535 however there was no evidence to indicate that tender board procedures were adhered to

5216538 2003 to purchase drugs in 2005 and 2006 although this approval may have lapsed in that year it did not re tender or obtain a new no objection from cabinet for the purchase of drugs approvals should not have been sought in compliance with the procurement act of 2003 and the related regulations
5216539 tender procedures were not followed for 54 purchases exceeding 600 000 which totaled 590 478m included in the 54 purchases were 8 which should have received cabinets no objection as set out in section 54 1 of the procurement act of 2003

5216648 a mugging a robbery a murder in the years living in london in the last 10 years ive witnessed a mugging near where i live
5216649 the target culture that has been imposed on police by labour which means that they tend to go after easy cases rather than difficult cases and that means obviously demonising the middle classes to a certain extent and targeting people who are fundamentally law abiding
5216650 im going to be as radical a social reformer as mrs thatcher was an economic reformer and radical social reform is what this country needs right now
5216651 family rules for two nights a week i come home early enough to be with sam one i should be back for suppertime and the other i should be back to do bathtime with the children

5216665 i think im canine rather than feline i like company i like people and that is much more dog like than cat like and im more of a dog lover
5216666 im a pretty classic church of england racked with doubt and scepticism believer
5216667 my favourite political quote is by disraeli he said the conservative party should be the party of change but change that goes along with the customs and manners and traditions and sentiments of the people rather than change according to some grand plan
5216668 im going to be as radical a social reformer as mrs thatcher was an economic reformer and radical social reform is what this country needs right now
5216669 samantha is actually very unconventional and hard to put in a box she went to a day school was a goth at 14 had quite a wild childhood is unconventional and challenging and that is very good as it stopped me from being too straight down the line
5216670 we sometimes row about politics but id say the most common thing we row about is arrangements
5216671 i tell her i love her when we go to bed at night when were happy which fortunately for us is quite a lot
5216672 for two nights a week i come home early enough to be with sam one i should be back for suppertime and the other i should be back to do bath time with the children
5216673 ive been burgled twice in the last eight years ive had my car stolen and i was on my bike the other day and this white van had been following me stopping and starting this was very late at night about midnight i was coming back from some dinner i got rather nervous about it so i turned down a road i dont normally go down and i slowed down and sort of pulled in behind a line of parked cars and as this van drove by this hand came out and just bashed me in the back with the aim of pushing me in front of the car luckily i managed to put the brakes on but ive never been the victim of proper violent crime
5216674 you appoint good people and trust their decisions but you have to know when to step in william hague has really helped me because he made all the mistakes the first time round
5216675 william hague once said to me being leader of the conservative party and wearing a hat are incompatible
5216676 i absolutely believe that if wed have had that 2007 election that gordon brown would no longer have been prime minister and that the conservatives would have been the largest party in a hung parliament
5216677 brown compounded calling off the election by then saying it was nothing to do with the polls which was a massive mistake it was a lie and it was treating people like fools
5216678 i regret that my government driver took some of my papers home while i was on my bike sometimes maybe i put off making decisions that maybe i should have taken earlier
5216679 i remember going for a drink and it was just after john smith died and we said it will be blair who becomes next labour leader and that will be disastrous for us
5216680 i command you come out of him and never enter him again

5216682 most lenders have been cutting selective rates rather than everything
5216683 it is time for our state in partnership with the federal government and private industry to build the largest solar energy system in the world

5216686 were living in a special time which reminds me of the mid 1980s in new york when everything was possible and there was a bid every day and a counterbid every day
5216687 your projections are only as good as your assumptions and when your assumptions dont come true you have a problem
5216688 unfortunately with unemployment set to rise significantly and the mortgage credit squeeze likely to persist the situation will only get worse
5216689 londoners have so far been largely insulated from the price falls taking place elsewhere in the country
5216690 however sellers who choose to come to the market during the peak holiday season generally have a greater need to sell and as a result properties coming onto the market in july were on average over 21 000 cheaper than last month
5216691 there has been a lot of speculation i want to saycategorically we are not pursuing hummer period
5216692 we are pursuing our own models strategy and we do not wantto tarnish our lean warrior strategy
5216693 there has been a virtual news blackout in view of theearnings season this summer
5216694 we can discuss this but it has to be market oriented any restriction to energy markets makes things more expensivefor customers
5216695 i see movement in this area in germany too thats what thelatest surveys show unfortunately the mood here is still a bitossified i dont understand that and i wish that the debatewas a bit more objective and less emotional
5216696 first weve got to see if there are respectable investors which will invest long term in the grid and second whethertheres a decent price there are plenty of interested parties including private equity companies
5216697 we dont want to lose what we have here on shelter island this is a special place a place where children and families feel safe where you dont have to lock your doors
5216698 there is a security risk here because of how its situated you cant completely secure it
5216699 this is just not the appropriate place for something like this and the people here are going to fight it
5216700 of all the residences on shelter island this would be the most secure
5216701 the whole world is looking at russia through a different set of lenses than just a week and a half or two weeks ago so there are already consequences
5216702 the longer they take to get out i think the greater those consequences will be
5216703 have to call an extraordinary meeting of the council of the european union to decide what consequences to draw
5216704 georgia will never give up a square kilometer of its territory
5216705 i hope he intends to honor the pledge this time
5216706 my own view is that the russians will probably stall and perhaps take more time than anybody would like
5216707 parsons said last week at a screening in the time warner center according to a report in new york magazine
5216708 they were having a dogfight between a german plane with two wings that was called the red baron and an allied plane english or american
5216709 one plane was tailing the other and all of a sudden the red baron dipped and went straight down
5216710 its like getting struck by lightning its like nothing you could ever dream would happen
5216711 i immediately called back and said yes i was damn sure i was going to make it and i did
5216712 i guess now the only person bigger to cook for is the pope
5216713 he was the most gracious warm gentleman you could meet we were just thrilled to have him
5216714 he was endearing and left a spot in our hearts
5216715 i was talking to him and then i looked at him and said does anyone ever say you look like paul mccartney
5216716 i heard screams the lamp pole went down im shaking its terrible there are no words for this especially the screaming i hope everybody is ok
5216717 the lights were green the other cab was coming on 44th street it was going from west to east and he had a red light if i had seen it a moment earlier i could have stopped the car hit me on the side i lost control of the car
5216718 the cab coming down broadway was speeding like hell and ran the red light
5216719 his car got hit and spun out of control i saw his cab hit one woman she got right up i know it hit a kid and he got hurt there were a group of tourists running for their lives
5216720 i dont know anything about that i cant help you
5216721 were going to find out who is responsible theyre all supposed to be inspecting and they failed to do so
5216722 they had 40 feet of standpipe missing for a year and nobody knows its missing or they do know and they dont care
5216723 it is a sad day when two people who spent only 36 months at the authority get to walk away with 300 000 after they are fired
5216724 both houses of the legislature are trying to be responsive to the menu of cuts the governor has put forward but were not there yet
5216725 i remember waking up in my bed and him on top of me
5216726 there is a clear message in albany keep your mouth shut or there will be consequences its very hard to speak out especially if the people in power are sexual predators
5216727 then one of the lobbyists corrected me for not speaking to boxley in the right tone of voice
5216728 being anywhere near the capitol id be scanning the parking lot for his car
5216729 i freaked out i was shaking and crying you think you get past it but that fear hides inside of you
5216730 youre depressed youre furious youre angry you want revenge you dont want to get out of bed
5216731 the interactions between her and mr boxley were completely consensual
5216732 the iranian development and testing of rockets is troubling and raises further questions about their intentions
5216733 iran still has a long way to go as far as satellites are concerned and it deliberately exaggerates its air and space successes in order to dissuade israel or the united states from attacking its nuclear sites
5216734 i hope the nation and the people will forgive my mistakes
5216735 i pray the government stops this down sliding and take the country out of this crisis
5216736 if virginia was the same state as it was four years ago or eight years ago there wouldnt be much discussion about virginia being a swing state
5216737 i have been advised to step down in the nations interest
5216738 de mi parte di todo todas las carreras la hab a terminado pero no s porque ahora no pude dios sabe porque hace las cosas y le agradezco que me haya tra do hasta aqu

5216743 limiting overtime does have an effect on the staffing capacity for the health care organisation
5216744 the fundamental issue is the impact on patient care under the enterprise bargaining agreement if staffing levels are not met one of the mechanisms to address that is to reduce services
5216745 some nurses are doing several overtime shifts a week in addition to their normal hours potentially putting both their health and patient care at risk
5216746 we will be negotiating with the anf for a safer situation where the amount of overtime individual nurses can do is capped over a set period
5216747 this latest move is designed to cut down the capacity for this hospital to function
5216748 its all part of the agenda to reduce the services so it becomes just a drug and alcohol facility with minimal facilities for mental health
5216749 the released admission list left out most applicants from people who matter and the deans complained that the numbers were low and would lower income
5216750 the academic registrars office is independent and does not yield to any pressure
5216751 this behaviour is inappropriate but the spanish athletes involved have apologised formally to china for the photograph and the matter is now closed
5216752 we did it because we came to china we dont want to do anything bad for chinese people or asian people
5216753 we think maybe we took a bad picture but we never wanted to offend anybody we didnt see it as a racist gesture
5216754 im chinese and we call westerners white people not ghosts
5216755 and to be frank id rather have slitty eyes than be a hairy spanish person and i am goddamned annoyed im very offended
5216756 a lad did this to me once and i slapped him silly
5216757 i hope they lose all of their medals and are sent back to spain with nothing
5216758 as for the madrid bid i would encourage everyone to block it until spain can demonstrate they have grown up
5216759 i was going to say on my new sign comedy that walks the line which is what george carlin use to say to me
5216760 but flamingo president don marrandino said no its got to be edgier racier
5216761 the flamingo is happening its a hip hotel the location cant be beaten
5216762 osheas was a testing ground to prove i could sell the edginess
5216763 i just do a few up front and then its a free for all with the crowd full frontal in your face here i come im in my groove im getting deeper in with audience members its much more personal
5216764 i want as much stage time as i can get
5216765 now that ive been given the opportunity of a lifetime i want to work and i want to build my show i want them lined out the door every night im in this business 20 years for a reason not because im lazy i want to work
5216766 besides i only work an hour night who cant handle that i can swim in my pool till 6 30 shower and go to work and get right back in my pool what a life im living
5216767 im going to try to get there before it closes
5216768 cameronomics is emerging in which photo ops warm words and conflicting promises attempt to distract from a risky and destructive ideological agenda
5216769 cameron knows that his party are keen for some traditional
5216770 they remain hostile to government action at a time when the role of government is critical to stability and prosperity
5216771 they are opposed on principle to government involvement in redistribution even when those on lowest income are facing the greatest squeeze
5216772 external sources of financing the availability of which is highly uncertain
5216773 you have to give credit where credit is due the organization for the caucus was well funded well organized
5216774 nevada continues to be a state thats very much centrist
5216775 if you have someone from las vegas or god forbid san francisco knocking on doors in hawthorne people wont respond you need supporters from hawthorne knocking on doors in hawthorne
5216776 we have always had a very good relationship with school police
5216777 at least not at my level and as far as im aware not at the superintendents level
5216778 making sure this school year is that much safer than last year
5216779 schools will not be as safe as they need to be if we do not have community support
5216780 but our egyptian armies just stormed in and assumed power
5216781 these economic conditions affect a young community more than an established one
5216782 you have a person whos worth 5 billion and the next morning theyre worth a billion
5216783 but to think this climate would last for multiple years would be disconcerting
5216784 philanthropic outreach is starting to become a real part of our community
5216785 shes got problems just like all of us have about what happened to my mum
5216786 ive been in therapy not long ago and she has had a hard time
5216787 thats why she has done drugs and why this wedding happened too were all depressed in our family
5216788 the women started talking to him and dancing to his music
5216789 knowing my brother he was trying to get their phone numbers
5216790 this discovery might lead to putting together tissues or whole organs
5216791 i held all of the medals together today for the very first time and it was pretty cool
5216792 its hard to put some concrete projections on his endorsement opportunities
5216793 its not going to be an opportunity its going to be a buffet of opportunities
5216794 there are some things that i still want to do
5216795 no i wouldnt be surprised if he only chooses a couple of events
5216796 i decided to take this summer off from my high tech company and i just had this idea
5216797 i want people to think of condoms theyre the best way to protect your health when youre not in a mutually monogamous relationship
5216798 the past few years hiv has been increasing among men who have sex with men under the age of 30
5216799 were giving away about 3 4 million condoms a month
5216800 it was a shocking set of remarks and people were looking around the room in disbelief
5216801 it was far more blatant a threat than anything were used to hearing from many of the leaders
5216802 the whole thing was incredible malcolm got up there and thanked everyone for coming and told them we should think of his fund raising event as being like an ipo an initial public offering
5216803 he said we should get in early because then it doesnt cost as much the longer you wait to get in he said the more it will cost you and if you dont get in at all then it will be painful after november after the democrats win the majority
5216804 then he referred to bronx state sen jeff klein about four times as his enforcer who is going to be brutal aggressive about collecting the contributions and that he was the one managing the ipo
5216805 the golf was called off because of rain so the program was being shortened and the dinner was held early
5216806 smith was up there joking about what was going on about the dinner ending early and then said something like if anybody needs a permission slip for their spouse so that they can say you were here for a few hours more ill say you were here until 8 youre covered until about 8
5216807 there was only one way to interpret that cheating on your spouse even if it was a joke
5216808 i think its the career path that will best utilize my networking skills and my ability to think outside the box
5216809 you cant call me on your phones call me on your cellphones
5216810 there are fine lines in managing cis and he did not cross them
5216811 my wife was eager to engage in a threesome with me and our incredibly hot 19 year old babysitter
5216812 my wife was disgusted repulsed and in every imaginable way opposed to the thought of engaging in a threesome with me and our incredibly hot 19 year old babysitter
5216813 opposing the research is one thing but physical threats against whaling ships must be restrained
5216814 you know hes got a longer track record than that
5216815 one of the things i think we have to unify the country around is having an intelligent energy policy
5216816 we used several different computers to initiate conversation between our heroes the faked protagonists in the online community that their campaign created and we were very careful to make everything seem natural and real
5216817 for instance one time i was playing the part of a housewife who had sent her son to summer camp and wanted to know how i could control her sons use of his cell phone while he was away yet still keep in touch with him
5216818 the client was very happy with the result because the dialogue of all the heroes covered off all their products features and benefits
5216819 the reality is that no agency can create viral marketing this is the sole domain of the consumer viral marketing is what happens when a campaign works when we allow their message to travel via our own super efficient conduits
5216820 good advertising doesnt rely on tricking lying to or deceiving your target audience
5216821 could this interview or its fruits possibly lead to disciplinary action
5216822 complaint charging a violation of the internal rules and regulations shall be filed no later than the 45 th day after the date on which person filing the complaint obtained sufficient information to file the matter upon which the complaint is based
5216823 the bottom line is that the protection new jersey municipal police officers once enjoyed under
5216824 aware of his or her work environment at all times
5216825 father thomas is a martyr he sacrificed his life for the poor and marginalised but he did not die in vain because his body and his blood enrich the church in india particularly the church in andhra pradesh
5216826 look even rome has admitted we are not in schism
5216827 see we were right about the mass and we will be proved right about the council see even rome says we can go to mass here
5216828 it is with great sadness that i have learned of the death of the great irish singer ronnie drew
5216829 ronnie was a champion of traditional irish music and with the dubliners he re energised and refreshened our unique musical heritage he brought great pleasure to the people of ireland and yet more around the world
5216830 after viewing the situation and consulting legal advisers and political allies with their advice i have decided to resign a grim faced musharraf said backed by pakistani flags and a portrait of the countrys founder
5216831 not a single charge in the impeachment can stand against me musharraf said
5216832 no charge can be proved against me because i never did anything for myself it was all for pakistan
5216833 on the map of the world pakistan is now an important country by the grace of allah he said
5216834 thats not an issue on the table and i just want to keep our focus on what we must do with the democratic government of pakistan rice said
5216835 we png want our young people to get exposure and experience and a bit of money to improve their lives in png he said in a written statement
5216836 we will set stringent criteria for those who would be involved to take part including that their character and behaviour would be acceptable he said
5216837 we will not allow a few louts to spoil this opportunity if appointed because we want the program to be available to png he said
5216838 the scheme will be more positive than negative he said
5216839 we png want our young people to get exposure and experience and a bit of money to improve their lives in png he said in a written statement
5216840 fay could be approaching hurricane strength when it nears the florida keys monday night
5216841 there exists a possibility of moderate flooding on the southern and northern shores of the island and in its western parts warned jose rubiera director of the centre of forecasts at the cuban institute of meteorology
5216842 most of haiti is under heavy rains especially in the south with winds clocked at about 70km h said ronald semelfort an official with haitis meteorological service
5216843 we expect to see the proposal for 2009 by the time we resume we have asked the president to submit the proposal by september 9 2008
5216844 we dont intend to deviate from the precedent we have laid everything will be subjected to thorough scrutiny we want to begin work on the proposal so that we can have a budget by christmas
5216845 the way this government has carried itself on the issue of corruption is beginning to hurt us out there in the international community
5216846 ribadu seems to have become the albatross of that whole so called drive against corruption because of the way this government has been whipping him
5216847 the man has a profile in the international community whether you like it or not they believe he did a good job and so any time you touch him they feel there is an attempt to reverse that process
5216848 we will like to advise that the government adopts another strategy and just forgets about the ribadu thing if it is still interested in this business of fighting corruption
5216849 that decision should be fully deployed so that it can function without being centred on anybody
5216850 individuals just become part of a process this is an institution that is respected not personalised by anybody to all these things about demotion withdrawal from somewhere reassignment to school and all that
5216851 with all these going on those who were supposed to be indicted have audience with the president and are nominated for appointments and they talk about all sorts of things
5216852 the perception out there is that there is an attempt to reverse or ultimately slow down the drive against corruption it is important for the government to take that into account
5216853 you can check on the international scene that is the growing perception and it is very dangerous for the country ultimately it might affect everything because most of the funds for efcc are from donors abroad
5216854 they fund the efcc from abroad basically and i think that is beginning to hurt
5216855 developmental democracy a new political model good for the nigerian nation

5216857 two political parties will create stability and development in the system nigeria is a work in progress and we have to continue to work at it and the only way we can stabilise is not to juggle three boats when you have only two hands you manage the two develop the two first and develop it very well then you can create other political parties judging from our experience between 1991 in spite of the failure of character shown by the then military leaders in aborting the natural progression of probably the most progressive political period in nigerias history i believe a two party system is the best political model on which to hinge the electoral future this is not a new model but a choice from tested models that have worked but which in our usual impatient and non confrontational style we dumped for the present model

5216863 but are you going to continue to operate from here i hear that you would be going back to the international wing
5216864 yes but even if we go back the ticket will still be valid
5216865 the recent incident involving the chairman of the commission using diabolic means reveals the complancy of the management of nddc to issues of transparency and accountability which blocked the chairmans ulterior intentions
5216866 the action of the former chairman should not be used as a benchmark to judge the performance of the entire board and commission
5216867 i believe that the solution to the problems of the niger delta should be sustained massive development based on a marshal plan
5216868 it is crucial that we respond proactively promptly and honestly to the niger delta situation before it is too late
5216869 such development would reclaim the land open up the hinterland clean up the environment empower the people physically develop the rural areas and enhance the quality of lives of its peoples
5216870 we all feel bad and worried about the widespread environmental degradation and are particularly concerned about its impact in the niger delta we even feel worse about the neglect that led to the current crisis
5216871 all is not lost i was brought up to look at the brighter side of life therefore i never see empty glasses in the immensity of the challenges facing our dear country what i see is a bright future i see opportunities to give our people a better country
5216872 the economic successes of china and india came after many years of toil and sweat the task of nation building is an arduous task with a life long struggle

5216875 in the long run this will be a good local transportation resource i dont think this has to be seen as a novelty
5216876 it could be something that adds to the character of our town and provides another means for people to get from one place to another
5216877 if someone has their packages theyve picked up and their car is parked on the other side of town its a means for people to get over there fairly unobtrusively
5216878 but i dont think anybody in their right mind would go into business without it
5216879 i thought i should have it but nobody would offer it to me because they didnt even know what a pedicab was
5216880 ive been falling back on the liability insurance i have on my house
5216881 its really an attraction for any city if its run properly
5216882 but if theres no pedicab business where youre at youre starting on the ground floor
5216883 it took me so long to get it going it became a financial burden
5216884 personally i feel they should make allowances for novelty vehicles that are not polluting were creating healthy jobs for men and women and theyre very safe
5216885 our insurance rates go down because we have a lot of cabs
5216886 i really feel like pedicabs are an amazing opportunity to displace cars in downtown
5216887 im still sticking with it i still believe in the whole deal and want it to happen but its looking like a slower start than i thought it would be
5216888 was sloped in both directions so it had to be redesigned
5216889 what distressed me is that i walked the bridge at 3 30 p m on a weekday in july and there was absolutely no one doing work out there
5216890 we couldnt expose the floor because the concourse was in operation
5216891 did not install the edge of the roof the way it was intended so it created problems with the slope

5216903 iran still has a long way to go as far as satellites are concerned and it deliberately exaggerates its air and space successes in order to dissuade israel or the united states from attacking its nuclear sites
5216904 it is clear that for years iran has had shihab 3 ballistic missiles which put israel within its reach but the threat posed by iran comes from its nuclear programme and not from its satellites or ballistic missiles

5216912 were gearing up for the chase im feeling stronger than ever were here to win championships thats what were shooting for
5216913 the greatest part is we didnt give up more bonus points to kyle
5216914 hes just so strong every time i win and he finishes second thats really a 20 point spread for us thats what we have to keep doing is to try and win the next three events and go into this chase on even ground
5216915 he has been all year yeah its a 20 point swing weve got to live with it hopefully we can make it up someplace else
5216916 my guys did an unbelievable job getting me off pit road
5216917 what were doing here is a little bit of practicing for the chase and trying to get those 10 points to catch that 18 car carl edwards did a great job the pit crew did a great job
5216918 it just came down to when he beat us off of pit road
5216919 that was it for us we just didnt quite have the car capable enough of being able to beat those guys we were good on that one run that one set of tires but that was pretty much what we had
5216920 the disability was not the result of the members willful negligence
5216921 actually this is a market where its more prudent to take stock calls rather than sector calls because frankly results have shown within each sector there is wide divergence between stocks in terms of sectors given on my view that interest rates are not going to rise very sharply from here have probably peaked whether they come off i really dont know we are pretty bullish on the banking sector and valuation comfort is also there that is one
5216922 the other sector is capital goods and engineering although it is a high beta sector there have been concerns on both margins front as well as the order book front i think order book still remains healthy remember the boom in this country is an investment led boom not necessarily a consumption led boom so far so order book will remain healthy and on commodities with the way prices are looking weak i think margins will also be okay so we are reasonably bullish on the capital goods and engineering sector also
5216923 finally the fmcg sector has shown a lot of resilience the companies have been able to pass on prices without necessarily affecting volume so that is another sector one can be reasonably positive on

5216932 from what i can gather about bnp attitudes there are no more homophobes in its ranks than in any other party and actually suprisingly enough to anyone who believes that a so called far right party would be anti gay

5216935 theres plenty of people making soap operas that present homosexuality as a wonderful lifestyle which as a matter of fact it very often isnt
5216936 friendly disease because blacks drug users and gays have it
5216937 some unfortunate people suffer from homosexuality so we will just have to tolerate them
5216938 it therefore follows however that i do not approve of those who proselytise in favour of homosexuality or homosexual rights or who parade proclaiming their homosexuality to the world

5216959 if you see the business model of maxwell industries i think it is very interesting with topline of over rs 200 crore and the marketcap of right now at around rs 150 160 crore with enterprise value even if i consider the debt of rs 40 50 crore the enterprise value is close to rs 200 crore in fact the recent development in the company which has happened in the pathare family who is now the single promoter holding 65 bought the other promoter reddy in fact in the past there has been lot of news even reliance capital which is still holding 14 99 also were in talk with the erstwhile promoter to buy their stake and as that mr pathare has said that the other promoter reddy they were in talk with future groups so i think this has a very good potential
5216960 they are into the leading undergarments manufacturing and the demand and the prospects of the company is very good in view of the organized retail happening and being expanded by all the groups all of them have been putting an eye on the company as we have discussed 65 promoter 15 reliance capital even videocon is holding over 2 of the stake in the company so in all about 85 is held by these all large institutional investors with very little floating stocks with equity of about rs 12 13 crore with a face value of rs 2 i think this is a very interesting play though it is right now ruling at rs 25 but the long term prospects of the company are very good in fact no expansions were happening because of the disagreement between the promoters families so probably now all those things have been put behind for the company and future from hereon is very good
5216961 the best avi to dvd converter there is other commenters have said there are free converters better than this but they are wrong this is the only program that has produced results that will fill the needs for users trying to convert avi to dvd it produces quality dvds that will play in your dvd players i have tried the freeware converters dvd flick has problems with results playing on my dvd player favc produced results that would play on my player but the playback was not smooth it had alot of skips in it nero is a payware but it produced the second best results to convertxtodvd playbck was smooth with nero but quality was not as good as convertxtodvd imho if you want an avi to dvd converter that will produce quality results that will play back in your dvd players this is your program

5217016 you cannot negotiate anything about final status if you dont talk about jerusalem final status consists primarily i believe of jerusalem and refugees if you want to postpone jerusalem you postpone refugees really you are not dealing with the problem you have to discuss these issues and that is exactly where the trade off has to be made
5217017 i still favor a two state solution and will continue to do so but to the extent that you discover its not practical anymore or that its not going to happen you start to think about what the alternatives are
5217018 but on the other hand if we are looking at what is happening on the ground in israel and the occupied territories you see things happening in the opposite direction as if they are not connected to reality thought is running in one direction reality in the other
5217019 we can fight for equal rights rights of existence return and equality and we could take it slowly over the years and there could be a peaceful movement like in south africa
5217020 i think one should maybe begin on the palestinian side to begin a debate to reengage in the idea of one state
5217021 it so happens that fatah in particular the mainstream party and the only viable alternative to extremes on the left or on the right now needs a strategy an ideology
5217022 these are isolated incidents but they do reflect a major sickness in our jerusalem arab society
5217023 what is the driving force behind a two state solution the fact that it seems more acceptable to a majority of people on both sides and therefore more applicable the primary motivation is to minimize human suffering this is what we should all be looking at if there will be a one state solution it will not come today or tomorrow its a long protracted thing not the ideal solution unless in an ideal world people really want to be together then it is the ideal solution the best solution the one that causes the least pain and that can actually be instrumental to a one state solution is to have peace now and acceptance of one another on the basis of two states
5217024 fifty 100 200 years down the road there will be some kind of conclusion sometime in the future however far away this future is i believe well be living at peace with one another in some way or another i am not sure how whether in one state or two states or in a confederation of states but people finally will come to live at peace in the meantime we will simply cause pain to one another its tragic it is very tragic because we know we can do it now that today it is possible with some guts leadership vision we can make it happen today we can reach a peaceful solution today the arab peace initiative proposed in 2002 is a fantastic chance the palestinians have adopted it theyll go with it all the way it is a perfect chance it doesnt even mention right of return it is even better than the ayalon nusseibeh plan but i am willing to accept it
5217025 because for israel however important jerusalem may be the primary factor is the jewish character of the state
5217026 the facts on the ground are making the situation irreversible
5217027 take the clinton parameters palestinian neighborhoods are palestinian sovereignty jewish neighborhoods are jewish sovereignty they are acceptable in principle but with realities on the ground like the expulsion of arab families from their homes in the sheikh jarrah neighborhood and the inhabitation of those areas by jewish settlers its going to be unacceptable on a practical level thats why we dont have time
5217028 ramallahs reaction was a bit worried they called me a few times a bit worried
5217029 we have a terrible situation our political bible our platform our moral values we need to be brought together again if not for creating a state then for our own sanity and for own values as a people apart from in ramallah everybody is living under very bad conditions the occupation is terrible the siege is everywhere pressure as it is the europeans are financing the occupation and the europeans are happy because they feel theyre doing something it cleans their conscience and the israelis are happy because theyre not paying for it and the palestinians are happy because they are getting their wages paid it keeps the economy going and people are getting complacent about it its dead money going after dead money
5217030 i said i want to tell you what you can do to transform yourself from a payer into a player make your money payments conditional on tangible progress in the peace process
5217031 i was in brussels i gave a talk and i said to the europeans if you want to pass on money do it only on the condition we build a state in which case it makes sense for you to spend money to build us an international airport but if in the end there isnt going to be an independent palestinian state why waste your money waste your money if you need to on integrating us into israeli society makes more sense pay the money for us to become part of israel to have equal rights raise our level of education bring our standards of living up but to have the pa taking all this money creating all this debt makes no sense maybe the europeans should link the aid they are giving us to real progress in peace talks so that both the israelis and the palestinians will be shocked out of their complacency or lack of commitment
5217032 the pa has no use if we fail to reach a peace agreement by the end of this year i believe it would be best to go back to the period when we were living happily under occupation we had a small civil administration they were paying back some 20 million a year to the israeli treasury so they were making money off us today we are creating year after year bigger deficits we are spending billions we have 160 000 employees half of them are security personnel who give us no security whatsoever we are spending masses of money on guns which we only use against each other and which provide us no security the whole thing is a mess
5217033 people in jerusalem why should they attach themselves to the muqata to ramallah
5217034 i was still hoping because before he went to the labor party he came and spoke to me i like this about him i knew what he was doing people were pushing him for a long time trying to get him into the system and he resisted but then at one stage i think he made up his mind maybe i can lead the labor party and then this is the best place for me to be i said fine do it i was unhappy that he became marginalized as minister without portfolio
5217035 would come to the palestinian people and say i initialed such a document
5217036 i believe that on israeli side olmert could do the same we dont know whether both leaders will be reelected but its worth doing even if theyre not because at least we know weve given this peace agreement a chance
5217037 i agree with sari nusseibeh that time is running out for the two state solution
5217038 i share his view that olmert missed a chance to get an agreement due to efforts to insure his own political survival the labor party will not succeed in getting back in power by attacking the other parties but only by raising the common banner of security and political agreements

5217051 being free for females is self explanatory there are not many things in life that are free and dont have a catch for the guys they can expect a rush of new and exciting female members who will take advantage of the free memberships and all the guys pay is from 3 30 for full access and the opportunity to be apart of an online dating site that has 1000s of real single ladies and the guys can expect a better balance of female to male members and are not dominated by too many males and not enough females

5217169 theres cj van der linde and i think the beast tendai mtawarira will be playing so thats going to be a big battle for us and how we can step up and improve
5217170 being consistent in our set pieces and making sure we get that right but also just bringing the aggression up right from the start
5217171 they are passionate at home and theyve got passionate supporters so if we get on top of them early then that will set us up for a good game
5217172 my first test was at ellis park in johannesburg in 2006 it was a huge shock it was a bit of a wake up call for me
5217173 i was playing club rugby about three weeks beforehand and then i was in front of 70 000 screaming south africans at altitude
5217174 for a front rower your scrummaging is your number one focus so ive been working really hard on that with wallabies set piece coach michael foley
5217175 thats been my goal just keep my scrummaging going and if anything else comes for me its an added bonus
5217176 technically the all blacks are probably the best scrummaging team in the world at the moment the springboks are right up there
5217177 ns bikes was the only brand that develops in a good direction with light and strong parts
5217178 were very proud to have such a talented rider choose our kit in the first place now with the more formal co operation we can all expect to get some real benefits the support should help martin achieve even better results and let him travel to more competitions and for sure we will also see martins input in future product development

5217180 in all it is expected that about 5 000 farmers in the two districts would benefit from the programme before the end of the year
5217181 not until such a time we have to accept the reality of the situation and come up with ways to manage the waste

5217185 to bring peaceful closure to this matter consistent with the principles of justice and respect for human rights and human dignity
5217186 strategic options for consideration in the comprehensive national development plan
5217187 let me assure those who have in the true npp spirit of the expression and dissent voiced concerns about my nomination that i am truly one of the family
5217188 naturally in these circumstances my open partisan politics has been virtually fore closed
5217189 though he may not be known on the political platform he has been very active at the apex of the economic platform contributing to the economic achievement of the npp under president kufuor
5217190 the party belongs to you and must serve you it is your sweat sacrifice and tenacity over the years that have built up this party i therefore see my selection to support our flag bearer as a call to serve you at all times and in all circumstances
5217191 this young man is an achiever whom the party has selected to support me to present a solid ticket for the december poll
5217192 the npp has made a wise decision by selecting a muslim running mate from the northern part of ghana to support a christian flag bearer to accelerate the countrys development
5217193 we are going to build on the solid foundation laid by president kufuor and we invite everybody to be part of this
5217194 i will assist nana akufo addo to continue with the good work of president kufuor
5217195 i am happy and feel fulfilled that i have been able to achieve something for ghana and nana akufo addo and dr bawumia will continue from where i left off
5217196 the party has a destiny to fulfil by leading ghanaians out of enslavement to true freedom and justice
5217197 when i say this it is not an empty boast we have already got the money
5217198 the workers know that the problem is not from the npp government
5217199 surely we are achieving the middle income status by 2015 and by 2020 the sky will be our limit
5217200 the next government under our flag bearer will accelerate growth
5217201 it is important for all of us to support the ticket firmly and work wholeheartedly and with commitment to secure the mandate of the electorate and have the party retained in office
5217202 i support the view the people should be able to assess all the parties to be able to make informed choices

5217215 ahem i know i said to fill it up but thats not
5217216 i put pen to paper and wrote out my lifes story
5217217 he wrote and said i should ask for a pardon
5217218 when you have a criminal record you have no hope no future
5217219 im going public with this because i want to reach out to other people to let them know where they can turn for help the difference now is that i have my life back i can apply for a better job for my children i dont have to go on welfare
5217220 but once youve served your sentence you keep serving the bars are just invisible having a criminal record is like wearing a scarlet letter its hard to get a job because each time you fill out an application they ask have you ever been convicted of a crime if you say yes they dont ask you for the circumstances they reach for a different pile of applications
5217221 its things like housing insurance education opportunities theyre all asking these questions
5217222 you have to get all your paperwork you have to review your whole life you have to answer a lot of embarrassing and unpleasant questions they can ask you anything and if you get a hearing you have to answer them again in front of the board of pardons and paroles and 200 other people who are there getting hearings
5217223 the joke is that they end up knowing you better than your doctor
5217224 you have the burden of proof you really have to prove to them that you have turned your life around
5217225 and just telling them i want a better job aint gonna cut it
5217226 a few years ago 58 percent of the applicants were turned down in the initial screening stage without a hearing
5217227 the last numbers we have from 2007 that is down to 21 percent so the process is more accessible though i dont want to deceive anyone into believing that this is easy it isnt
5217228 but at the time they wanted to deport me for that i was seven months pregnant and had to get a waiver but that also meant i could not travel out of the country i went 10 years without seeing my mother now i can travel
5217229 and now i can apply to become a united states citizen
5217230 we used to upset the cops so bad that they would just be total jerks to us
5217231 i would go home and tell my mom how upset i was
5217232 we are kind of a lawless sub culture but we have advanced so much
5217233 we have these organized events on tv and people are talking about skateboarding coming into the olympics the skys the limit im 35 years old now and i dont want to compete that much i want to give back to the sport uh the activity
5217234 i dont like to call it a sport but its getting to that point
5217235 it will never totally end skateboards in the streets but it has cut down on kids loitering around and skating on the steps of the post office until theyre kicked out now they have a place to go
5217236 its the if you build it they will come mentality
5217237 i dont necessarily agree with that theyre still going to skate downtown but if the park challenges them they will come
5217238 some things get old and you want to skate something new
5217239 the park is really fun but when you skate in the street its fun
5217240 skateboarders are definitely still going to be out in front of businesses skating stairs and ledges
5217241 theyre going to skate the parks because they will have something to do when they get kicked out
5217242 i sold my car for 2 200 bought a 69 greyhound ticket and took a bus from new london to san diego
5217243 i slept on the beach camped out met people and did whatever i could with my backpack and skateboard
5217244 hes well on his way and if he sticks with it he could make it big
5217245 theres no rules to skateboarding which is why its so attractive to some
5217246 you dont have to run laps and theres no coaching its you and your board
5217247 i just do this i do this every day to try and get better and work on my style
5217248 i had opened a boutique and in the space we had there was another 800 square feet my husband is a triathlete but we didnt want to do bikes because theyre too expensive we decided on skateboarding we learned about it and then found out that jewett city was having a youth problem and a lot of them were skaters
5217249 they skate and the skating keeps them from doing bad things

5217254 unfortunately some elements acting for vested interests levelled false allegations against me and deceived people
5217255 they said that during the last nine years our economic problems and electricity shortages were due to our policies it is absolutely wrong and deception for the country
5217256 they never realised that they could be successful against me but they never thought how detrimental it would be for the country

5217261 if we dont take pictures of these buildings soon theyll be gone and there will be no record that they existed
5217262 i would put it in the category of labor of love
5217263 its important for the area because were losing our barns what this does is to flag peoples interest and say theyre valuable say theyre worth looking at and maybe we can save them
5217264 i think its the same question with all of us who have these barns without an economic use and needing tens of thousands of dollars to repair

5217268 everyone thinks samantha is lindsays first lesbian love but we were very passionate until her fear of being found out drove us apart at the time she was terrified her career would be over if she revealed her sexual tendencies but then samantha came on to the scene and i was dropped
5217269 from the start lindsay was very confused about her feelings for courtenay so did more and more drugs to stifle the sexual attraction she was experiencing but eventually she just gave in and at every party theyd kiss and touch each other in the corner its a miracle nobody found out both of them would do lines of cocaine in the toilets then head home and fall into bed together
5217270 back then samantha and lindsay didnt have a physical relationship she once said samanthas the father i never had apparently samantha acted in a paternal way towards her giving her advice and cuddles
5217271 courtenay would throw fits of rage writing her hundreds of angry e mails from another room in the house the sexual attraction between them was electric though and theyd still kiss and make up
5217272 courtenay still cant understand how lindsay is now so open with samantha every time she sees a picture of them together it kills her
5217273 she looks better now than she ever has done im so proud i love her so much

5217323 iraqi shiite assassination teams are being trained in at least four locations in iran by tehrans elite quds force and lebanese hezbollah
5217324 and are planning to return to iraq in the next few months to kill specific iraqi officials as well as u s and iraqi troops according to intelligence gleaned from captured militia fighters and other sources in iraq
5217325 provided iraqs national security adviser with several lists of the assassination teams expected targets
5217326 said the targets include many judges but would not otherwise identify them
5217327 iraqs intelligence service is preparing operations to determine where and when the special group fighters will enter the country and is to provide an assessment to prime minister nouri al maliki

5217339 america stands in firm opposition to chinas detention of political dissidents human rights advocates and religious activists
5217340 we speak out for a free press freedom of assembly and labour rights not to antagonise chinas leaders but because trusting its people with greater freedom is the only way for china to develop its full potential
5217341 and we press for openness and justice not to impose our beliefs but to allow the chinese people to express theirs
5217342 act responsibly on matters from energy to the environment to development in africa

5217346 its really concerning when we have two wars overseas our economy is more global were competing with economies that are growing faster than ours and our dependence on foreign oil is one of the biggest stories
5217347 in many cases the resource they had for foreign news was an editor pulling material from the wire services or they were willing to send a reporter overseas in limited cases and theyre doing less of that now or none at all

5217355 we wanted the book to have several distinct features particularly how different mental disorders manifest in children adolescents adults and older adults older adults are often neglected in textbooks
5217356 other textbooks focus on just children or adults or are aimed at just psychiatrists meaning the focus is on medication rather than therapy we wanted to write a book that was tailored as a useful approach for counseling clinical psychology therapy and social work
5217357 we didnt want to sacrifice content or our vision so it was a long process
5217358 its a unique book a lot of textbooks dont address the basic skills so we felt it would be useful for students to have a one stop shopping experience while writing we gave chapters to students for feedback and got a lot of positive response one student commented that she still pulls out those pre publication chapters to use so that was heartening
5217359 the usb mba programs focus is on developing leaders who will make a conscious demonstrable and sustainable difference in their organizations the program is an ideal complement to pepperdines commitment to developing values centered leaders and advancing responsible business practice through contemporary education that is entrepreneurial in spirit ethical in focus and global in orientation

5217361 on the ballot it looks like people are voting directly for the president and the vice president they arent

5217368 i have been given a wonderful opportunity to serve at pepperdine for nearly 25 years and am mid way through my one year term as chair of the american council on education

5217370 my first trip in the summer of 2007 made alone with no particular agenda convinced me i needed to do it again the following year and have conversations with people along the timeless route about things that are timeless to them
5217371 its very special when we see our former student athletes taking part in such a prestigious event
5217372 all of pepperdine commends them for their achievements and the dedication they have shown throughout their careers to get to this point pepperdine has had a strong record of success producing olympians both for the u s and internationally and the 2008 games are no different

5217388 the bourgeoisie wherever it has got the upper hand has put an end to all feudal patriarchal idyllic relations
5217389 it has pitilessly torn asunder the motley fuedal ties that bound man to his natural superiors
5217390 and has left remaining no other nexus between man and man than naked self interest than callous cash payment it has drowned the most heavenly ecstasies of religious fervour of chivalrous enthusiasm of philistine sentimentalism in the icy water of egotistical calculation
5217391 it has resolved personal worth into exchange value and in place of the numberless indefeasible chartered freedoms has set up that single unconscionable freedom free trade
5217392 in one word for exploitation veiled by religious and political illusions it has substituted naked shameless direct brutal exploration
5217393 constant revolutionizing of production everlasting uncertainty and agitation distinguish the bourgeois epoch from all earlier ones
5217394 the need of a constantly expanding market for its products chases the bourgeoisie over the whole surface of the globe
5217395 industries no longer work up indigenous raw material but raw material drawn from the remotest zones industries whose products are consumed not only at home but in every quarter of the globe
5217396 in place of the old wants satisfied by the productions of the country we find new wants requiring for their satisfaction the products of distant lands and climes
5217397 in place of the old local and national seclusion and self sufficiency we have intercourse in every direction universal interdependence of nations and as in material so also in intellectual production the intellectual creations of individual nations become common property national one sidedness and narrow mindedness become more and more impossible and from the numerous national and local literatures there arises a world literature
5217398 we have discovered only in the last 48 hours that a number of retailers have been affected by a point of sale compromise

5217414 katy is our daughter and we love her but we strongly disagree with how she is conducting herself at the moment we cannot cut her out of our lives as she is our child but she knows we disagree strongly with what she is doing and the message she is promoting regarding homosexuality which the bible clearly states is a sin but the bible also promotes understanding and forgiveness which i keep reminding myself katy is not a homosexual but i fear she has been led astray by the hollywood crowd i pray all the time that god will work through her and help her find salvation
5217415 some outfits are too revealing and her father has had words with her about it like any child she is going through a period of rebellion
5217416 katy was raised in a very strict christian household she started performing in church at nine she was a special child she loved to sing and had an angelic voice that is why this is all so disappointing and sad

5217471 the cost of having an army contingent provide the same services as blackwater appears to be roughly the same as the cost of the contract itself
5217472 one of the key questions surrounding the governments escalating use of military contractors is actually not whether they save the government client money or not rather the crucial question that should be asked at the onset of any potential outsourcing is simple should the task be done by a private company in the first place

5217602 this backroom deal i think is going to explode in our face
5217603 ms bhutto and mr musharraf detest each other and the concept that they can somehow work collaboratively is a real stretch
5217604 by declaring a state of emergency musharraf has sought to remove any remaining obstacles to the prosecution of the us led war on terror in the region his claim that extremism is the root cause of pakistans current crisis mimics the discredited rhetoric of the bush administration but does not explain the actions of sacking the chief justice suspending the constitution dissolving the supreme court censoring all television stations except the state tv network and arresting mainstream political figures in reality the cause of violence and instability in pakistan has been caused by the occupation of afghanistan the war on terror and us plans to secularise pakistan all policies vigorously pursued by musharraf
5217605 it is not others that have brought pakistan to the brink of suicide but him and his political masters musharraf spoke yesterday as always of putting pakistan first but for 8 years he has always put the interests of western governments first selling out over kashmir permitting american forces to establish bases in pakistan presiding over a bloodbath in waziristan baluchistan and swat legitimising the occupation of iraq providing logistical support and intelligence to us forces in afghanistan and surrendering control over pakistans economy to multinationals
5217606 for the last six months musharraf has been a very hated figure in the country now he has pariah status it is so obvious to the people that there is no principle involved here
5217607 its a matter of shame that israeli forces are killing innocent children and women in gaza and our president is engaged in appeasing america to save his stint
5217608 musharraf has shoved knife in the back of muslim ummah
5217609 they have unleashed aggression and suppression against the innocent people what israel is doing in gaza today musharraf is doing the same in pakistans tribal areas our army is killing our own people
5217610 hey i like the idea and or writing here so i think id like to check back regularly so i add that blog to my blogroll
5217611 since im a guy who likes to go on stage and tell stories well this is how you get stories some guys get their stories at the barbershop i get mine at the barbershop in tehran
5217612 as an american we are the ones who dictate how the world turns where the oil goes who does and does not get fed and i need to see this for myself so my opinion is more informed than something ive read or some guy on cnn is telling me because i know he is eventually pulling for some corporate concern
5217613 what a lot of people would not know is just what happens when globalisation hits the ground what a mcdonalds looks like in downtown beirut and what all this does to culture in these countries how it elbows it to the side
5217614 another thing thats important is the commonality of the human path what are most people concerned about in cairo and minneapolis three square meals a roof that doesnt leak and a day without fear its not like people are running up to me screaming death to america theyre just trying to get through the day
5217615 absolutely and more good than bad and if you put them in a relaxed circumstance where theyre not freaking out theyll probably offer you shelter and half their sandwich thats what i learned from travel not many americans hold a passport and if more travelled they wouldnt be so easily sold on one dimensional hatred to see these places with your own naked steaming eyeballs theres something about it that makes your life really special everyone desperately wants dignity and freedom and a chance this is not a revelation its not that i did not know that but when you see it first hand you really get it
5217616 my anger isnt i didnt get mine or the girl left my anger is why are those people still broke how come these people cant read my anger is civically driven what else would i be mad at that im not taller
5217617 i lose sleep with the arrogance the outrage the destruction of my constitution the fact that a law just passed in america that they can now take your laptop at the airport for as long as they want and they dont have to give you any excuse this is the stuff that makes me mad the anger is a good thing because its in lieu of complacency
5217618 i do have optimism in that i think that the good people are eventually going to drag away the children of the idiots i think young people are voting more often starting to realise that if they dont look out democracy is something we can lose also whenever i travel and see the general gentleness and kindness of people thats why im optimistic
5217619 i got thrown out of the washington dc public school system for being hyperactive and violent and then thrown out of another school for being hyperactive violent with poor grades

5217622 so my early years were a lot of confusion pain and uncertainty and basically being a very nervous semi hysterical child with a lot of weird impulse problems like stealing one time my mom took me down to the police station and they threw me in the drunk tank it didnt really scare me straight i really had no plans for a life of crime thats when i discovered weightlifting and a way to achieve something on my own it was a helluva thing to realise one can improve ones self and then punk rock when you meet other people who are strange and judging you the dc punk rock scene was such that the fact you even knew enough to walk into this room where the show was you were ok in one night you had 30 new friends
5217623 i was lucky my mom is a pretty forward thinking person because my dad is one of those intolerant guys my mom used to go see john coltrane and miles davis she met henry miller on her bookshelves were ee cummings and mark twain and her vinyl collection is just sick great
5217624 and she had gay friends i was ok with the gay by the time i was like five and understood it and didnt fear it
5217625 my dad was the complete opposite id visit him at the weekends and hed say your mom is a spade lover so dont take her too seriously but i want you to respect her im eight years old thanks
5217626 remember the scene in runaway train where john voigt is standing on the end of the train going like 70 mph into a tunnel in the side of a mountain thats been walled off hes staring through the snow at a wall rushing ever closer
5217627 that would be the ride just this massive wall and people would go up to the top and go wait a minute it looks like im going to get into this toboggan and go down these rails right into an impenetrable wall thatll kill me and my entire family yes well why would i want to do that
5217628 well the rides called f it with an exclamation mark its the motto of henry rollins and it gets him out of the door every day so kiss your friends goodbye and get on the f it ride

5217810 a lot of people practise yoga here maybe 20 000 or so which is a great thing in a personal sense better health and a sense of spirituality but what was lacking was a sense that were all practising yoga in toronto and how can we help each other and how can we help the place where were practising
5217811 we hope the festival will help people come to see that contributing to their communities is a possible way to bring peace to the world and we hope that people who are already activists will feel supported in that

5217836 credo che si sarebbe potuto fare di pi per accogliere la nuova russia nella compagine internazionale per rassicurarla sul fatto che avrebbe conservato la sua importante posizione come membro permanente del consiglio di sicurezza e come protagonista sulla scena mondiale
5217837 per me la giusta via per loccidente senza compromettere le sue posizioni e i suoi valori mostrare pi comprensione per il comportamento della russia e accettare con maggiore buona volont le preoccupazioni della russia per le ex repubbliche sovietiche mentre per alcune azioni non c possibilit di ammenda le percezioni russe esistono e ci vorr del tempo perch possano cambiare questa la grande sfida che si presenta ai politici e i diplomatici lostilit e lo scontro militare devono restare una cosa del passato

5217890 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
5217891 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
5217892 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
5217893 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
5217894 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
5217895 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
5217896 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
5217897 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors

5217902 they feel somehow their culture will be threatened when on the contrary culture specific films like jodhaa akbar and singh is kinng pay a homage to the people and culture of a community
5217903 they were dancing the bhangra with dhols after the screening they told a news channel that this was the first film in 70 years of indian cinema that had done justice to the sikh community what more endorsement for our motives can there be
5217904 we admit akshays beard shouldve been longer we added a scene where akshay says he made a mistake by trimming his beard and in the video with snoop dogg during the end titles he comes with a full beard albeit a false one itd have taken akshay two years to grow a natural beard we had told the shirmoni gurudwara parbandhak committee that the beard would be false and they had agreed
5217905 the final authority on right and wrong in a film should be the censor board once the censors approve all protests should be crushed with iron hands otherwise all of us should just fold up our production houses im not disrespecting sikh sentiments so please stop hounding me for nothing
5217906 the opening of singh is kinng has been incredible business everywhere has been thundering but i can only rest easy after the first two weeks im glad that in spite of being a comedy

5217908 it was a small intimate get together for friends and family with saif and kareena calling up people personally it was a drinks and dinner party and everybody who attended had a rocking time kareena wanted to make it a special evening for saif it was definitely more organised and better than katrinas birthday party marred by the infamous srk salman fight

5217918 ich verwendete alle drei motorr der die ich mitgebracht hatte das dauernde hin und her wechseln der maschine ohne dass dadurch was vorw rts gegangen w re wurde irgendwann ziemlich frustrierend am ende war es wohl vor allem meine pers nliche erfahrung die mich ins finale trug

5217921 newly obtained documents prove that in 2003 barack obama as chairman of an illinois state senate committee voted down a bill to protect live born survivors of abortion even after the panel had amended the bill to contain verbatim language copied from a federal bill passed by congress without objection in 2002 explicitly foreclosing any impact on abortion obamas legislative actions in 2003 denying effective protection even to babies born alive during abortions were contrary to the position taken on the same language by even the most liberal members of congress the bill obama killed was virtually identical to the federal bill that even naral ultimately did not oppose
5217922 nothing in this section shall be construed to affirm deny expand or contract any legal status or legal right applicable to any member of the species homo sapiens at any point prior to being born alive as defined in this section
5217923 obama said that had he been in the u s senate two years ago he would have voted for the born alive infants protection act even though he voted against a state version of the proposal the federal version was approved the state version was not the difference between the state and federal versions obama explained was that the state measure lacked the federal language clarifying that the act would not be used to undermine roe vs wade the 1973 u s supreme court opinion that legalized abortion
5217924 senator obama says if he had been in the u s senate in 2002 he too would have voted in favor of the born alive infant protection act because unlike the illinois bill it included language protecting roe v wade
5217925 said he had opposed the bill because it was poorly drafted and would have threatened the supreme court decision in
5217926 if an abortion is performed or a natural birth occurred at any age even three months and the product of that was living outside the mother and somebody came and shot him i dont think theres any doubt that person would be prosecuted for murder

5217938 at the time during the depression it was tough and my father was working for a company in waterbury and he was only working a couple days a week
5217939 so we needed food on the table there were seven of us besides mother and father nine people ate a lot of food

5217954 rafas rise to world number one in the atp rankings is fitting reward for his phenomenal run of results in a difficult tennis year
5217955 his unbeaten run on clay and grass underlines rafas talent and the all round player he has become it is no small feat to have ended rogers record reign as the worlds best player and now fans can look forward to both players continuing the most engrossing rivalry in world sport
5217956 hes a bit older and wiser and hes probably gained an extra yard of pace which he probably needed internationally
5217957 hes done very well this year and hes pretty much a three dimensional player because he bats bowls and fields
5217958 its exciting for him to get another chance and hell have learned a lot from those games he played against sri lanka so his challenge is to use that knowledge hes got from county cricket over the last two years and try and make a real impression

5217992 at the time during the depression it was tough and my father was working for a company in waterbury and he was only working a couple days a week
5217993 so we needed food on the table there were seven of us besides mother and father nine people ate a lot of food
5217994 were finding that hope is consistently associated with fewer symptoms of depression and the good news is that hope is something that can be taught and can be developed in many of the people who need it
5217995 if you feel you know how to get what you want out of life and you have that desire to make that happen then you have hope
5217996 many of the people who seek therapy are not mentally ill they dont meet criteria for depression or other illnesses
5217997 so if you focus primarily on what is wrong with them there may not be much progress
5217998 hope therapy seeks to build on strengths people have or teach them how to develop those strengths we focus not on what is wrong but on ways to help people live up to their potential
5217999 were finding that people can learn to be more hopeful and that will help them in many ways
5218000 what i think is exciting about hope therapy is the way we are learning from people who are doing very well we have been figuring out what hopeful people are doing right and taking those lessons and developing therapies and interventions for people who are not doing as well
5218001 and the great news is that it seems to work we can teach people how to be more hopeful

5218006 ive been shooting for kambhakth ishq in la yeah i play akshay kumars sibling we both play stuntmen so it kinda runs in the family and its a family that kinda runs fast the role requires considerable physical skill and energy
5218007 the stunts are dangerous but everything is so professional here in hollywood safety while doing action scenes is top priority not just for the lead stars but also for the stunt men otherwise the experience of working at universal is no different from the studios back home
5218008 there has been a decision there is a first collective agreement for gatineau for the garage

5218091 since the last one year there has been a distinct mellowing of attitudes between bipasha and kareena last week when kareena saw bachna ae haseeno she messaged bips saying she had loved her performance in the film that broke the ice and then bebo invited bips to saifs party bips too has been praising bebos talent so the patch up was all but inevitable
5218092 yes its true that kareena personally invited me to their party it was very sweet of her and we all enjoyed it a lot

5218122 si sono immagini terribili ma qui rappresentato solo il nostro punto di vista interessante sentire anche quello degli americani quando vengono qui
5218123 ci sono americani che si sono informati che adesso hanno capito cosa succedeva e per questo tornano come visitatori alcuni sostengono programmi per i bambini per leducazione o per lo sviluppo altri invece sono convinti di aver fatto la cosa giusta vengono ma non vogliono sentire i nostri racconti
5218124 ma perch degli americani che nonostante levidenza sono ancora convinti che la guerra fosse giusta vogliono tornare qui perch non stanno a casa a farsi una grigliata tra veterani

5218126 it begins to look as if these environmental health officers ehos are a law to themselves like rohms brown shirts but without a rohm in sight i feel it is time our conventional police customs and armed forces organised themselves for another night of the long knives meanwhile a hero of winslow boy proportions has come forward in the person of the 67 year old ian macaulay landlord of the bell inn aldworth berks and a pipe smoker for 50 years he has been threatened with a 500 pound fine and three months in prison if he continues to smoke his pipe behind the bar beer counts as food the local eho has explained and even if he does not smoke while serving the law says if someone is engaged as a food handler they must not use tobacco the law does not require them to be doing it simultaneously in the quarrel between mr macaulay and his local eho mr grant courteney i see the great battle for civilisation in our times
5218127 so kastanienallee is gradually becoming squeaky clean the shops are as full as ever and the aforementioned cafe with its cloak of wild vines still looks as romantically left wing as ever in prenzlauer berg its so easy to live the lefty life thats the great thing about it you can feel tolerant because tolerance is never put to the test no satellite dishes to insult the eye no headscarves to provoke debate no mosques to trouble the global citizens

5218130 most cities were dealing with a brain drain new orleans had a brain gain a luxury problem if you ask me it was so inspiring to see that everyone in new orleans wanted to change the world and help rebuild new orleans austin attracts musicians new orleans attracts social innovators i believe that within 5 years new orleans will be the epicenter of social innovation its the one place where the slate is wiped clean for positive change theres no other place in the world i would have been at that point in my life
5218131 i was ready to share my experience of eight years with the government but the coalition thought i was a problem not a solution
5218132 i leave it to the people to decide let them be judges and let them do justice
5218133 though i am sure no charge can stand against me i do not want instability and confrontation in the country
5218134 i do not want the office of president to come under impeachment procedure i think this is not the time for individual bravado
5218135 even if the impeachment motion is defeated the relationship between the president and the government will not be alright he added
5218136 ik ben trots op dit initiatief van de internationale federatie

5218139 smells like ajax i no longer buy ajax because of it instead i buy mr clean its perfumed
5218140 it tastes like itself its kind of like asking what pepper tastes like
5218141 i cannot compare the taste to anything else i have tasted because its flavor is unique i can compare its taste to the smell of clorox bleach semen tastes like bleach smells
5218142 it has different tastes for different people ranging from rotten eggs and dirty socks to a slimy salty taste
5218143 semen had a taste of its own sometimes its more spicy than other times sometimes its sweeter sometimes it gives me the sensation that i just chewed on a balloon
5218144 salty glue especially if dehydrated not so salty otherwise actually more watery like paper mache flour glue and old newspapers
5218145 i dont know but ive heard that semen tastes like whatever the ejaculator ate twelve hours before
5218146 like youd think dish washing detergent would taste but doesnt kind of soapy
5218147 the taste was not easy to identify it was sort of mixed with another fluid
5218148 sort of a non descript taste leaning towards the salty side of the spectrum
5218149 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
5218150 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
5218151 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5218152 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5218153 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5218154 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5218155 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

5218161 a hate crime is any occurrence that is perceived to be motivated by hate from the point of view of anyone involved whether that be the victim call handler friend relative or onlooker
5218162 many people find it easier to speak to someone at the housing association as they might feel they are more accessible and perhaps more familiar than a police officer
5218163 we were initially approached last year by cheshire police to see if we were interested in becoming report centres my colleague at widnes tracey gilbody and i have now completed the training and the estate offices are now officially reporting centres
5218164 as a responsible landlord this is a valuable additional service we can offer to local residents
5218165 hopefully people will recognise that it is now easier to report this sort of crime and working together with the police we can tackle any issues that may arise
5218166 hate crime will not be tolerated in cheshire we are very happy that by working with our partners like william sutton homes we are giving the people of cheshire another way of tackling this important issue
5218167 i developed a great material to submit to my colleagues in senate

5218203 i had to do a double take and reread it to make sure i understood what was happening
5218204 as far as the pilots and the west gulf proposal all i can say at this time is theres no need for pilots to take any action on the proposal and we have no further comment
5218205 the pilots showed great flexibility and initiative to handle unique traffic needs
5218206 it is very gratifying to me that west gulf was proactive in trying to keep rates competitive and fair

5218219 today many owners are not making full use of their smart phones features
5218220 concern over usage costs is still a big barrier though wider availability of flat rate data plans will help and usability still needs to improve for certain applications on many devices people are also wary of draining their battery and not being able to make calls battery life isnt helped by having gps and wi fi turned on nor by having a large bright screen for navigation or web browsing but there is clear demand for those features and applications and advances in battery technology would enable quite substantial changes in usage patterns with all the service revenue benefits that would bring
5218221 something that stood out in the latest survey was that those who already owned a portable navigation device pnd showed only a slight preference toward paying to have these services on their pnd rather than on their mobile phone
5218222 there is already quite high acceptance in principle that even key driving related location services would be delivered to the phone
5218223 im excited at joining such a great and truly global company as nokia i see this as an inspiring new challenge there is a lot to learn but i believe i will be able to draw on my experience from both a think tank environment as well as from international politics it is a privilege to serve on nokias group executive board and i really look forward to working with the nokia team
5218224 veli sundb ck brought to nokia valuable experience and knowledge of international affairs at a time when nokia was expanding fast into other markets

5218229 theyre just going under the name of the kaiser chiefs
5218230 i did drugs for 18 years and i never got that bad as to say you know what i think the kaiser chiefs are brilliant
5218231 he was just having a go at all yorkshire people
5218232 were definitely not offended but i do actually like it i think its a bit of sport
5218233 it is funny though because it does happen every single time they put out an album and the last two albums its been us
5218234 when i was 17 and noel was going on about blur i was watching it and now im 30 and hes 50 and hes talking about us its brilliant
5218235 weve been talking about getting some kind of ufo for a while and we thought finally wed found a place which would let us do it
5218236 but apparently there were all sorts of issues with the wind and the usual rubbish you get at big gigs and festivals where they tell you you cant do anything you want to do
5218237 maybe one day well be able to put all the stuff in wed like to but i dont think itll happen in this country for some reason
5218238 i think the health and safety laws are too tight i think it would have looked quite impressive
5218239 last time was probably the most jading experience id had with the band
5218240 i drank 10 cans of lager on stage to numb the pain ive been looking forward to this for a long time
5218241 me and hugh harris were racing buggies through v festival and he lost his guitar
5218242 its not true there was this big dog and it ate my homework and then i lost the guitar
5218243 there was a hole in our tent so we nearly got electrocuted
5218244 someone threw a lighter and hit me on the head
5218245 ive never been hit by a missile in 15 years
5218246 it was a bit unsettling there was a torrent of water falling into our mixing desk which is never a good combination and then people throwing things
5218247 i was a bit shocked because usually theres a lot of love at our gigs
5218248 i didnt notice first of all we came off stage and i saw heidi bending over and i think she thought she was going to throw up i think shes feeling a little bit light headed and keisha hurt her foot
5218249 theyre all casualties in there the dressing room theyre dropping like flies but its all good theyll be alright

5218262 die hohe qualit t und das enorme ausma der ehf befragung wird es uns erm glichen die volle bandbreite an familienwegen zu erkennen auch solche die eher un blich sind so k nnen wir angaben von 380 000 m nnern und frauen untersuchen die zu herkunft kindern partnerschaften oder sozialem hintergrund befragt wurden wichtig ist zudem dass im gegensatz zu anderen befragungen verh ltnism ig viele daten von m nnern zur verf gung stehen dadurch k nnen wir neben allgemeinen familienmustern auch m gliche unterschiede in den familienbiografien von frauen und m nnern erkennen

5218349 this action and dual use possibilities for their ballistic missile program have been a subject of iaea discussions and are inconsistent with their un security council obligations
5218350 iran still has a long way to go as far as satellites are concerned and it deliberately exaggerates its air and space successes in order to dissuade israel or the united states from attacking its nuclear sites
5218351 it is clear that for years iran has had shihab 3 ballistic missiles which put israel within its reach but the threat posed by iran comes from its nuclear programme and not from its satellites or ballistic missiles

5218362 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
5218363 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
5218364 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
5218365 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
5218366 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
5218367 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
5218368 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
5218369 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
5218370 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
5218371 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
5218372 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
5218373 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
5218374 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5218375 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5218376 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance

5218380 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
5218381 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
5218382 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
5218383 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
5218384 die usa m ssen mit russland in bezug auf iran probleme der nichtweiterverbreitung von atomwaffen und eine reihe von fragen im handelsbereich kooperieren das geschieht vor dem hintergrund der tatsache dass die usa ein gewaltiges inneres defizit haben wir haben riesige au enschulden und arbeiten daran b ndnispartner zu sammeln
5218385 das ist offensichtlich keine sehr gute idee da wir gegenw rtig versuchen die russische wirtschaft zu unterst tzen und zusammen mit den russen ein banken und ein marktsystem zu gr nden
5218386 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
5218387 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
5218388 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
5218389 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
5218390 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
5218391 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
5218392 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
5218393 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
5218394 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5218395 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5218396 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
5218397 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
5218398 the cash poll has indicated all along the leadership is there for the taking if mr costello wants it mr sullivan said in a statement
5218399 he has enjoyed constant support from punters betting on the liberal leadership at the next election
5218400 brendan nelson is becoming less popular with punters by the day
5218401 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
5218402 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
5218403 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
5218404 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
5218405 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
5218406 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
5218407 we png want our young people to get exposure and experience and a bit of money to improve their lives in png he said in a written statement
5218408 we will set stringent criteria for those who would be involved to take part including that their character and behaviour would be acceptable he said

5218411 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built

5218413 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
5218414 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
5218415 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
5218416 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
5218417 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
5218418 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
5218419 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
5218420 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
5218421 after viewing the situation and consulting legal advisers and political allies with their advice i have decided to resign a grim faced musharraf said backed by pakistani flags and a portrait of the countrys founder
5218422 not a single charge in the impeachment can stand against me musharraf said
5218423 no charge can be proved against me because i never did anything for myself it was all for pakistan
5218424 on the map of the world pakistan is now an important country by the grace of allah he said
5218425 thats not an issue on the table and i just want to keep our focus on what we must do with the democratic government of pakistan rice said
5218426 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
5218427 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources

5218440 estamos aqu en la uac levantando nuestra voz el arma m s poderosa que tenemos
5218441 la mina alumbrera consume el 50 del agua que consume la provincia pero adem s consume el 78 de la energ a de catamarca lo interesante es que los problemas de agua y energ a pasan a ser de la comunidad los medios lo instalan as no consuma luz o agua
5218442 modelo de saqueo que se basa en la destrucci n de los medios de vida
5218443 tenemos que luchar por instalar los bienes comunes como palabra y le ponemos el cuerpo a todo esto sin perder de vista el problema del modelo sabiendo que la alumbrera es un punto m s dentro de este modelo de desarrollo de explotaci n y saqueo
5218444 como asamblea esto es un desaf o ya se hicieron acciones hacia la comunidad como para producir un impacto de que se est diciendo algo porque hay que decir ya que si algo qued muy fuerte ac es la marcha del silencio pero en catamarca necesitamos volver a decir
5218445 entender que somos un pa s colonial cuesta en esta poca en que aqu no son necesarios los soldados porque ya formaron los universitarios los profesionales los pol ticos para manejar esto el rol colonizado de la universidad corre paralelo con la colonizaci n de la secretar a de agricultura y del senasa que aprueban lo que las corporaciones necesitan el inta que trabaja para las empresas abiertamente mediante el impulso de polos biotecnol gicos que trabajan para implantar el modelo de nidera cargill monsanto y bunge la miner a los eucaliptos la soja el engorde a corral los grandes criaderos de aves esto es parte de una escala macro en la que operan las empresas pero este fen meno que nos parec a tan lejano el que se pueda vincular en la sociedad todos estos modelos se ha dado con una materialidad sorprendente gracias al gran desarrollo de la conciencia ambiental
5218446 cada vez que nosotros nos movemos y damos un paso vemos c mo se expresa el iirsa integraci n de la infraestructura regional suramericana y as se entiende por qu el tratado binacional que entrega la cordillera de los andes fue orquestado casi diez a os antes de que lo firmara carlos menem vemos c mo se fue desarrollando y pensando el saqueo la hidrov a hecha para que los barcos de gran porte se lleven todo tambi n fue pensada hace mucho tiempo porque saben que la mejor manera de llevarse los bienes comunes es la l nea recta poco costo y rapidez y ah tambi n est gioja que ha regalado todo para que el paso de aguas negras salga hacia el pac fico con un corredor bioc anico y para todo esto es necesario tambi n energ a y r pida para eso las centrales nucleares cuatro centrales que impulsa kirchner y no hablemos de la cantidad de compa eros confundid simos que toman como bandera la energ a nuclear porque es una tecnolog a de punta o porque estamos en crisis energ tica c mo no vamos a estar en crisis una sola empresa minera consume el 10 de la energ a del pa s qu pasar cuando empiecen a funcionar agua rica y pascua lama cu nta energ a se necesitar y ah entra el cuento de la crisis energ tica por eso para luchar y estar seguros de c mo afrontar los debates tenemos que saber y conocer
5218447 no contundente a los agronegocios porque producen destrucci n de montes y bosques nativos expulsa comunidades campesinas criminaliza la protesta social contamina tierras y aguas produce la destrucci n de la biodiversidad apropiaci n de las semillas por parte de las empresas manipulaci n gen tica trabajo en negro explotaci n infantil concentraci n de la tierra en pocas manos p rdida de fuentes de trabajo destrucci n de las econom as regionales atenta contra la salud y vida de los pueblos tanto por el consumo de transg nicos como por las fumigaciones
5218448 las propuestas de cambio son dif ciles de encarar pero algunas ya tienen su materializaci n concretamente como la del mocase y la idea de soberan a alimentaria son una manifestaci n concreta de que se puede encarar las cosas de otra manera pero c mo se resuelve la producci n del conjunto del sistema agropecuario argentino eso es algo a seguir profundizando
5218449 la uac es la expresi n de una necesidad que tenemos todas las asambleas fundamentalmente ambientales de intercambiar nuestras experiencias y vivencias respecto a esta lucha en eso se ha progresado much simo por la inclusi n de m s organizaciones y por la profundizaci n de los temas que cada asamblea toca
5218450 indagar qu es lo que contamina en el rea en donde existe la asamblea o el grupo
5218451 trascender el aspecto puntual para llegar a los problemas de fondo
5218452 la lucha que se viene se presenta en dos grandes ramas la miner a del oro por un lado y la del uranio por otro
5218453 en el resto de las provincias hemos dado pasos importantes hemos logrado leyes contra la mega miner a metal fera contaminante en patagonia mendoza tucum n la rioja y hay presentaciones para prohibirla en san luis y en c rdoba tambi n
5218454 lo que impulsa la c mara minera junto al gobierno nacional y las provincias es zonificar generando espacios donde s se podr hacer la miner a con el m todo contaminante justamente en sitios donde no est n de pie y luchando las comunidades
5218455 el uranio surge de golpe cuando su precio se dispara ante la acci n de los pa ses del primer mundo que buscan combatir el precio del petr leo con fuentes alternativas de energ a dentro de la cnea hay quienes quieren poner en licitaci n los grandes yacimientos otros quieren hacer canje con otros pa ses para el desarrollo local de la energ a nuclear y otros consideran que esos minerales tienen que ser utilizados s lo en lo dom stico mediante centrales nucleares por eso en argentina se relanza un plan nuclear de cuatro centrales en lo inmediato
5218456 con esta iniciativa se busca realizar una masiva tarea de concientizaci n en la poblaci n a fin de que se comprenda sobre las herramientas que desde el gobierno se otorga a las mineras para que se instalen destruyan saqueen y contaminen
5218457 los ciudadanos del territorio argentino decimos no a la miner a qu mica con la modalidad a

5218467 the extent of dods contracting is particularly evident during prolonged large scale operations like those in iraq where there may not be enough military personnel available to provide logistics support
5218468 providing security for all personnel including contractors is an inescapable aspect of u s operations in iraq because of the instability and violence in that country

5218471 we are very disturbed ourselves not just that its a social issue but its also a public disaster to us
5218472 it pains us because we are a very responsible media company
5218473 we cant concede too many goals like we did last season it would be great to eliminate that and still score a lot of goals
5218474 we know we can improve defensively and we will continue working hard to do that we are good enough as a team to cut down on the goals we concede
5218475 it is a new defence with a new goalkeeper and that will not develop overnight the new guys played well
5218476 brad friedel is a good goalkeeper you can see that i thought luke young and nicky shorey also played well but it takes time to play together and be comfortable together
5218477 but well get that right we have to look at it as a whole team and we know we need to do better defensively
5218478 but we are still happy with the start to the season we have made if we can keep scoring goals and start to concede fewer goals that is perfect
5218479 it was important to get off to a winning start we have done well in our important games in the pre season we got the right result in the intertoto cup and we played well in iceland in the uefa cup on thursday

5218619 los pueblos indigenas me han cambiado la forma de ver e l derecho
5218620 los funcionarios del estado aparecen en el documental ridiculos y sin comprender ciertas cosas
5218621 el secretario de derechos humanos de neuqun ve a la pelicula como muy pol tica y la criticaba por eso

5218987 do not simply fail to value education they deliberately target it

5219007 es preciso adem s que no exista aqu ninguna reticencia ninguna cicater a en cuanto se refiere al traspaso de competencias y a la atribuci n real de facultades
5219008 pr cticamente tanto como lo que se ha conseguido quedan algunos temas que constituyen lo que podr a denominarse la parte m s sofisticada del desarrollo auton mico constituyen materias decisivas para calificar el nivel de autogobierno resultante del estatuto
5219009 nosotros creemos que el desarrollo del estatuto no est terminado y lo vamos a desarrollar en la pr xima legislatura pero tambi n nos gustar a saber si el pnv es capaz de reconocer que ese proceso de desarrollo tendr final alguna vez
5219010 s lo habr desarrollo estatutario si los nacionalistas renuncian a ulteriores objetivos pol ticos
5219011 las proposiciones no de ley sobre la autodeterminaci n que hoy se presentan a debate llevan impl cita o expl citamente una puesta en cuesti n del estado democr tico espa ol
5219012 qu ocurre cuando todo esto que est pendiente se transfiere a la comunidad aut noma vasca yo creo que hay que ser claros al menos nosotros lo somos y decimos que cuando eso ocurra ya no hay desarrollo estatutario pendiente no hay un estatuto incumplido se es el esp ritu de nuestro autonomismo y cualquier otro camino no contar con el apoyo de los socialistas vascos porque nuestro autonomismo es incompatible con una visi n instrumental del estatuto como una v a hacia f rmulas distintas al igual que es incompatible y beligerante con cualquier planteamiento de autodeterminaci n o de independencia
5219013 para este partido con esto no se cierra el estatuto de autonom a nosotros siempre hemos entendido que el estatuto de autonom a es un texto jur dico y entendemos que un texto jur dico est a disposici n de aquellos a quienes sirve y no al rev s un texto jur dico est al servicio y el estatuto de autonom a as tiene que estar al servicio del pueblo vasco y como tal es la voluntad de este pueblo vasco la que dir qu texto jur dico en cada momento hay y entendi ndolo como un texto jur dico abierto ser la voluntad de este pueblo la que decida d nde y c mo hasta d nde puede llegar esa es la voluntad y sa es la postula del partido nacionalista vasco
5219014 la respuesta de los socialistas fue sin embargo que no habr desarrollo estatutario en tanto en cuanto el pnv no garantice el punto final es decir pretenden que renunciemos a nuestra ideolog a nacionalista que cedamos a un chantaje bastante c nico por su parte
5219015 usted acepta el estatuto pero tiene que renunciar a sus otras ideolog as o a otra parte de ideolog a
5219016 si sois buenos los nacionalistas os daremos todo el estatuto
5219017 estado en el chalaneo cambiando transferencias por apoyos pol ticos
5219018 o renunci is a vuestra ideolog a o no hay transferencias
5219019 nosotros cumplimos escrupulosamente el programa del partido socialista de euskadi y ustedes cumplen y respetan la constituci n y el estatuto de gernika
5219020 no es lo mismo negociar con alguien que se quiere ir que con alguien que se quiere quedar no es lo mismo hablar de competencias de marco jur dico con quien est comprometido con el estado que con quien quiere abandonarlo
5219021 el estatuto termina diciendo que su aceptaci n no supone renuncia alguna a los derechos que pudieran corresponder a este pueblo te ricamente el estatuto no se termina nunca

5219029 er bestaat geen onafhankelijke journalistiek in letland de situatie hier lijkt meer op de italiaanse verschillende clans hebben controle over de media je kunt het conflict het best beschrijven over een breuklijn die loopt tussen de lokale oligarchen en de westerse liberalen hoewel je beide begrippen met een flinke korrel zout moet nemen
5219030 ik werkte een tijd als televisiecriticus bij diena de grootste krant van letland ik stak mijn politieke mening niet onder stoelen of banken soms kom je daar nu eenmaal niet onderuit ook in mijn academisch onderzoek schreef ik soms kritisch over diena en zo was ik mijn baan als televisierecensent al weer kwijt
5219031 ze zijn een tijdje zelfs gestopt me te bellen voor quotes
5219032 tot de hoofdredacteur onlangs veranderde nog geen twee weken later wou men weer van me horen journalistiek het is hier pure politieke business
5219033 eigenlijk is het een campagne tussen sorosisten en anti sorosisten
5219034 dat begon in december 2005 toen de krant neatkariga een sterke toon aansloeg tegen george soros een campagne die vrijwel naadloos paste bij de russische anti soros campagne sinds oktober 2005
5219035 diena is pro neatkariga is contra je ziet het overal terugkomen de sorosisten of liberalen zijn voor een gay pride in de stad de anti sorosisten of lokale oligarchen die de meer traditionele waarden in pacht houden die zijn dus tegen
5219036 een echt debat is er niet het geruzie begint een paar dagen voor de pride en is daarna weer snel afgelopen in het hele debat heb ik drie redelijke argumenten gezien aan beide kanten de rest is nonsens journalisten gaan niet pro actief op zoek naar andere argumenten of verhaallijnen ze volgen de lijn van de redactie
5219037 die moest wel reageren omdat de anti sorosisten de liberale waarden nederlands vonden en het een en ander in verband brachten met de pedofielenpartij
5219038 diena is lets maar wilde in de loop naar de toetreding tot de europese unie haar anti russische toon matigen daarom huurde men etnische russische journalisten in zo stond er bijvoorbeeld een keer op 1 september de eerste schooldag een grote foto van een jongetje laten we hem vanja ivanov noemen een typische russische voor en achternaam en zijn trotse ouders ze stuurde hem naar een letse school omdat ze dachten dat daar meer toekomst in zat
5219039 journalisten hier hebben geen bond nodig ze zijn slechts in dienst van hun werkgever er bestaat geen professionele attitude onderzoek wijst ook uit dat een ruime meerderheid van de journalisten er geen probleem in ziet te schrijven wat hun werkgever hen opdraagt wie zich verzet tegen de hoofdredactie is de volgende dag ontslagen
5219040 er is geen visie onder uitgevers er is geen professionele strategie voor media business rijke zakenlieden kopen kranten of uitgeverijen als visitekaartje zonder een flauw idee te hebben wat ze er mee moeten doen er zit geen visie achter
5219041 nog nooit studeerden er zoveel mensen af aan de universiteiten die moeten allemaal iets doen
5219042 de ns zetten naar den helder meer en langere treinen in en voor autobezitters zijn er parkeerterreinen aan de stadsrand bij vliegveld de kooy vanaf daar rijden pendelbussen naar het havengebied bovendien stelt de marine haar grond beschikbaar als parkeerterrein
5219043 human exploration beyond low earth orbit should be a long term goal and investment for all space faring countries with america in the lead
5219044 work with the space industry to ensure retention of work force and technical capabilities
5219045 a bush program and didnt make a lot of sense
5219046 human spaceflight is important to americas political economic technological and scientific leadership
5219047 barack obama endorses the goal of sending human missions to the moon by 2020 as a precursor in an orderly progression to missions to more distant destinations including mars
5219048 there is now considerable pressure from the main shareholders to take measures to improve the value of our company otherwise the slide in our stock market value could make us a potential takeover target

5219050 snps political machine is often brilliant and much of the media is in thrall
5219051 no i cant there is a lot of gold and silver in my boat there is no place here for you
5219052 i cant help you love you are all wet and might damage my boat
5219053 oh love i am so sad that i need to be by myself
5219054 because only time is capable of understanding how valuable love is
5219055 0 but it can make windows really hard to use as menus will open if you just look at them well move your mouse over them anyway
5219056 politics is the business of getting power and privilege without possessing merit
5219057 the best british political libertarian blog on the web consistently excellent but not for the squeamish
5219058 but for all that he is a brilliant writer incisive fisker extraordinaire and with an over developed sense of humour and he can back up his sometimes extraordinary views with some good old fashioned intellectual rigour im promoting him on my blogroll to a daily read
5219059 the glorious devils kitchen not for the squeamish or easily offended
5219060 a very smart article takes a pretty firm libertarian line on the matter
5219061 by the way dk seems to be on fucking good form at the moment
5219062 devils kitchen is the big name on the free market libertarian strand of the british blogosphere profane rants are the immediate stand out feature of dks blog but the ranting is backed up by some formidable argument on a wide range of issues particularly relating to british and european parliamentary politics economics and civil liberties
5219063 an excellent intelligent uk political blog which includes a great deal of swearing
5219064 i like the devils kitchen i think its one of the best written and funniest blogs in the business
5219065 for sheer intelligence erudition and fun iain dales diary cranmer and devils kitchen are so far ahead of the rest i dont see how they can figure in a top ten they are the beatles stones and who of the blog world the astair bogart and marlon brando of the blog world the gerswin porter and novello of the blog world the dot cotton pat butcher bette lynch of the blog world
5219066 its the blogging equivalent of someone eating ostrich vindaloo washed down by ten bottles of jamaican hot pepper sauce and then proceeding to breathe very close to your face while talking about how lovely our politicians are but theres much more to his writing than four letter words
5219067 the devils kitchen is a life affirming life enhancing blog this particular post will also lead you to some of the best soldiers in the army of swearbloggers of which he is field marshal
5219068 underneath all the ranting and swearing dk s a very intelligent and thoughtful writer whom many people take seriously despite disagreeing with much of what he says
5219069 the most foul mouthed of bloggers devils kitchen was always likely to provoke sometimes disgust but more often admiration
5219070 i dont mean it literally or even metaphorically i just find that his atheism aside i agree with everything the devil of kitchen fame says i particularly enjoy his well crafted and sharp swearing especially when addressed at self righteous lefties
5219071 spot on accurate and delightful in its simplicity devils kitchen is one of the reasons that were not ready to write off euroweenie land just yet at least not until we get done evacuating the ones with brains
5219072 this hugely entertaining articulate witty scottish commentator is also one of the most foul mouthed bloggers around gird up your loins and have a look essential reading
5219073 the devils kitchen is one of the foremost blogs in the uk the dk is bawdy foul mouthed tasteless vulgar offensive and frequently goes beyond all boundaries of taste and decency so why on earth does dr crippen read the dk because he reduces me to a state of quivering helpless laughter
5219074 dk is a take no prisoners sort of libertarian his blog is renowned for its propensity for foul mouthed invective which can be both amusing and tiresome by turns nevertheless he is usually lucid often scintillating and sometimes illuminating
5219075 if you enjoy a superior anti left rant albeit one with a heavy dash of cursing you could do worse than visit the devils kitchen the devil is an astute observer of the evils of nulabour thats for sure i for one stand converted to the devil and all his works
5219076 this fellow is sharp as a tack funny as hell and when something pisses him off meaner than a badger with a case of the bullhead clap
5219077 foul mouthed eloquence of the highest standard in bad taste offensive immoderate and slanderous f ing brilliant
5219078 i tend to enjoy devils kitchen not only because i disagree with him quite a lot of the time but because i actually have to use my brain to articulate why
5219079 this blog is currently slamming politics certainly aint all my own but style and prose is tight fierce provocative and funny ok i am a child swear words still crack a laugh
5219080 10 000 words per hour blogging output prolific or obsessive compulsive i have yet to decide
5219081 anyone can cuss but to curse in an imaginative fashion takes work
5219082 ive been laffing fit to burst at the unashamed sweariness of the devils kitchen certainly my favourite place recently
5219083 god bless the devils kitchen colourful as his invective is i cannot fault his accuracy
5219084 it made me laugh out loud and laugh so hard and i dont even get all the references i hope his politics dont offend you but he is very funny
5219085 dk himself is unashamedly right wing vitriolic and foul mouthed liberally scattering his posts with four letter words not to be read if youre easily offended but highly entertaining and very much tongue in cheek
5219086 this blog is absolutely wasted here and should be on the front page of one of the broadsheets
5219087 this labour government is the most mendacious dishonest endemically corrupt power hungry incompetent illiberal fucking shower of shits that has ruled this country

5219247 labour today fires the opening salvo in an autumn offensive against the tories with a warning that
5219248 the vast majority 81 per cent of people think the issue of whether politicians come from privileged backgrounds is not very or not at all important according to the survey for the website
5219249 david cameron has hailed himself as the heir to maggie thatcher and the man to mend broken britain the tory leader vowed to be as tough as the iron lady if he follows in her footsteps to become pm
5219250 his favourite novel is robert gravess goodbye to all that his favourite soap is neighbours when kylie minogue was the star and his favourite sitcom is porridge
5219251 im wald du tust du j ger ohne herz o jetzt von mir erfahren must du was bedeutet schmerz

5219253 denn bin kein j ger ich ein armer nur raubsch tz mann hat ges tze so gemacht den reichen get es gut die armen leiden tag und nacht bis finden sie den mut
5219254 this is the most difficult issue we are going to face as an agency
5219255 we know the sea is eating away at the coast in quite a number of places primarily but not totally exclusively on the east and south coasts its a particularly huge issue in east anglia but in quite a number of other areas as well
5219256 level best to try to defend communities where there are significant numbers of properties under threat and where its possible to find engineering solutions
5219257 we are almost certainly not going to be able to defend absolutely every bit of coast it would simply be an impossible task both in financial terms and engineering terms
5219258 we will publish next year details of the work thats been done where we think the particular threats are where we think there is current defence in place we will begin to talk with communities where we think defence is not a viable option
5219259 we need to start having a serious discussion with government about what options can be put in place
5219260 the increases in volume of air traffic and the consequent increases in congestion on the ground are from the analysis that weve done pretty unavoidable
5219261 i think the government is making a mistake and i will carry on telling them that i think they are making a mistake
5219262 my view would be that we should not go ahead with the development of a new coal fired generation unless those clean coal technologies are in place and we can clean up the emissions
5219263 effectively you would be destroying the fish populations of everything up the river system from the barrier that is a major environmental downside
5219264 das problem ist dass du mit deiner ganzen erfahrung nur geringen einfluss nehmen kannst also spielt das keine gro e rolle
5219265 meiner meinung nach ist das einer der gr nde warum sowohl erfahrene fahrer als auch junge piloten sofort erfolgreich sein k nnen in der formel 1
5219266 letztendlich kann man mit einem auto nun einmal nicht so viel anstellen
5219267 nat rlich w re es besser wenn ich 23 und nicht 29 jahre alt w re aber k mmert mich das nein so ist die zeit sicherlich begrenzt um an die spitze der formel 1 zu gelangen
5219268 ich kann nicht wirklich sagen schon alles gezeigt zu haben was ich in diesem jahr zeigen wollte was passiert das passiert halt
5219269 ich bin ein freier mann ob ich nun aus diesem oder jenem grund gefeuert werde was f r mich z hlt ist ganz alleine dass ich mein bestes gebe
5219270 nat rlich gebe ich mein bestes wenn das f r manche leute nicht genug ist auch recht
5219271 not so much for mr dion but for the liberal brand and for the government too
5219272 i think it will be a combination of the environment and the economy
5219273 were very excited that hes going to be shaking things up in that riding and giving the other candidates a run for their money
5219274 if canadians cannot count on non political non ideological justice from the supreme court of canada it compromises the whole justice system
5219275 some idea was put out by i dont know who a rumour or some source that the chair leads the discussion that is just not the case my view is im there to ensure that the meeting runs well and fairly and that the vote is taken fairly not to weigh in in favour or against a particular candidate
5219276 we were quite astonished to read reports of what she had said
5219277 we never accused her of voting we accused her of disregarding the constitution that she is bound to serve by expressing her approval of the process she is expressing approval of morgentalers activism on abortion
5219278 i feel reasonably comfortable about the process doing it the way i have outlined that i do it and not getting involved in voting for a particular candidate or advocating for a particular candidate
5219279 in light of the role that she has assigned to herself id be surprised if many people would have a problem with the way that she carries out that particular role
5219280 these are historical things that judges have done over the years because of our reputation for independence and impartiality
5219281 he was the symbol of china at the olympics this event was the biggest competition at the games for the chinese people
5219282 it hurts the hearts of the people his gold medal was so important to china
5219283 maybe there was too much pressure on him from china and that affected his performance
5219284 after you won your gold medal four years ago you got so proud and haughty and you were convinced you were special
5219285 today you dropped out with a foot injury is that a real excuse youre nothing but a coward without the courage to face reality and accept failure
5219286 if he had filmed a few less coca cola commercials and gone to more competitions
5219287 we have to give him our full understanding lets give him some time and a quiet room to calm down and recover
5219288 we give our blessing to liu xiang and we hope he can recover his health and stand up again at the starting line
5219289 ich kann die ganze aufregung nicht verstehen denn wenn man eine flugbereitschaft hat die nicht genutzt werden kann damit die regierung ihre gesch fte ordnungsgem erledigt dann verstehe ich gar nicht was das ganze soll
5219290 eine flugbereitschaft muss ja auch fliegen sie braucht ja auch flugstunden
5219291 what seemed like a simple task suddenly turned into a battle against a bus driver who had as much personality as the concrete bus stop post id just been leaning against for the past hour
5219292 we were told to get out it was pretty dangerous in peak traffic and we had to get out onto the road
5219293 their driving skills need improvement they slam the brakes on and when youre standing up you have to really hold on
5219294 it was raining miles from anywhere and he was just so unpleasant about it
5219295 theyre not getting people at their best as either passengers are stressed as theyre on their way to work or tired on their way home
5219296 its a pretty thankless job and people are all too quick to complain
5219297 one bus driver who did my run for years and gave a few of us cards and chocolates at christmas
5219298 the drivers see the training as an essential part of working at nz bus
5219299 as a business we have a clear vision and part of that is the travel experience itself the focus of the training is to give our drivers the tools they need to provide our customers with excellent customer service
5219300 my task was to simply travel from hataitai to courtenay place and having looked at the timetable i knew i needed the number 5 or the number 14 so far so good
5219301 i strolled down to the stop and waited for the bus and waited and waited
5219302 it finally arrived the number 14 i hopped on asked the lovely man for a return to courtenay place
5219303 what the bus driver didnt tell me was that on a saturday the number 5 doesnt actually exist
5219304 what seemed like a simple task of sitting down on a bus to a big city which i could even see from my vantage point had suddenly turned into a battle against bus drivers that had as much personality as the concrete bus stop post id just been leaning against for the past half hour
5219305 anyway turns out i was on the wrong side so i crossed over the next bus arrived a few minutes later and i hopped on asking my new female driver hi is this the right bus to courtney place
5219306 or maybe i had to catch another non existent bus route the 140 from hataitai into transport hell seems more likely
5219307 ironic really that id come all the way from cambridge via los angeles and auckland all the way to wellington and not had one problem and yet the five minute trip from hataitai to wellingtons cbd was fraught with difficulty
5219308 i was only going in for a haircut id pretty much pulled all of my hair out by the time id got there
5219309 lets not have a beverage at every breakfast sometimes choose to have a beverage every two or even three days soup is a meal put your fork down between bites weigh yourself twice a day
5219310 i dont want to do this but ill pick one no coffee day i dont want to weigh myself twice a day i dont want to write down everything i eat i dont want to eat a bowl of cereal for breakfast i dont want to eat breakfast but i will because i want to weigh pounds
5219311 i tried hot cereal at breakfast and i enjoyed it i tasted the most wonderful soup for lunch one day i didnt think id like it but i did i had a cup of hot water instead of tea one night and it was actually very nice
5219312 something to think about extraordinary reflections about ordinary events mesorah
5219313 always consider others as bandits yet treat everyone with respect as rabban gamliel did
5219314 silence befall lips that speak untruth who speak against the righteous
5219315 the sage ravina fulfills all the stipulations the rabbis required
5219316 send me ten zuz a sum of money for i just found an opportunity to buy a piece of land ravina sent back bring witnesses and write a deed he sent to him even me he sent back you above all for one who is absorbed in study comes to forget and brings misfortune on himself
5219317 how can you see gods involvement in a financial crisis
5219318 who is wise the person who learns from everyone else who is strong the person who controls himself who is rich the person who is happy with what he has who is honored the person who honors other people
5219319 if shoaib choudhury was in europe during the shoah he would have refused to drive the trains
5219320 made offensive comments on the muslim world islam and muslims in bangladesh and commented about the existence of al qaeda and other islamist militant groups by which you have tarnished the image of bangladesh in the outside world
5219321 everyone is going to die the only issue is what you do while you are alive
5219322 look everyone is going to die the only issue is what you do while you are alive
5219323 why cant people be told there are aliens on earth people are smart
5219324 where are the muslims seated in this event and why are they not listening to what you are saying
5219325 you can be a robot on the day of the race
5219326 its when no ones paying attention and all the eyes are closed and its you and the dark water that its won
5219327 in snow in hail our slides were frozen our bodies were frozen we couldnt see for the snow and we cracked ice on the lake we went out every day
5219328 since he came here in 2006 weve had two fourth place finishes at the world championships
5219329 and with bent being sick we really wanted to make sure he didnt leave his home country and his family there for nothing
5219330 its pretty inspirational for those guys hes the guy whos fighting for his life
5219331 the only coach to actually have medals at every olympics
5219332 my parents always worked hard to be able to support the family it is special for them to be here and see this accomplishment to see me make my dream
5219333 they came through with a silver theres this kind of mood in canada now
5219334 who will have a life after and be good friends
5219335 this highly anticipated program will be affordable and above excellence in quality
5219336 we are working diligently to make university of the west the preeminent location for the academic study of buddhism
5219337 the development of the inter faith master of divinity program at uwest is the product of intense collaboration with hospital based clinical pastoral education programs christian and buddhist denominations and eminent theologians from the united states and abroad
5219338 we are looking forward to a new way of meeting the ministry needs of a new generation
5219339 the significance of wasc approval means other institutions are far more likely to recognized the program and employers as well
5219340 anybody can give out degrees accreditation affirms that our peers in the world of academic learning and professional training have recognized us
5219341 one of the obstacles for buddhists seeking certification as professional chaplains is the lack of accredited graduate training programs
5219342 the program here at uwest is important because it helps to solve this problem and encourage the professional development of buddhist chaplains
5219343 a two year on campus residency requirement is vital for chaplaincy training
5219344 since an indispensible part of being an effective chaplain is good interpersonal skills this residency requirement will allow uwest to evaluate and help students develop these skills
5219345 if we called it a dbs no one would know what it is m div immediately tells everyone you ve studied chaplaincy
5219346 een dubbelleven lijden is ontzettend zwaar en de druk werd haar simpelweg te veel
5219347 ze ontmoette lindsay in de zomer van 2006 op een feestje in malibu lindsay was zeer verward door haar gevoelens voor courtenay dus begon ze steeds meer drugs te nemen om de seksuele aantrekking die ze ervaarde te smoren uiteindelijk ging ze voor de bijl en op elk feestje kusten en betastten ze elkaar in een hoekje het is een wonder dat het niet eerder is uitgekomen ze snoven coke op het toilet en gingen naar huis waar ze samen in bed belandden
5219348 when the federal government started making schools gun free zones thats when all of these shootings started

5219359 i would like to see the u s be more aggressive in terms of our immigration policy for people with college degrees especially in high tech that we expand the h 1b status capability because each person that we bring to this country to put in engineering and high tech generates two to three other jobs in my company a good three to five jobs in the local economy having said that were going to go wherever the talent is in the world not as a labor arbitrage play but it is a focus on the war for talent and getting the best and the brightest around the world be a part of cisco which we are clearly trying to do

5219491 the victims were all poor laborers and civilians this was a barbaric act carried out by the enemies of afghanistan at a time of celebration of independence
5219492 these reports indicate that the enemies of the people of afghanistan intend to attack civilian military and government targets during afghan independence celebrations
5219493 we recommend to all afghans to be vigilant at large public events and other locations where crowds gather and report suspicious behavior to security forces afghan or coalition and government representatives
5219494 let us shun tribal linguistic and regional issues and wage jihad against the enemies of this country and its religion and their mercenaries so we can mark the independence anniversary in its actual form
5219495 cancer was not in leroys plans but he turned his battle with cancer into the most dramatic the most moving and the most important story of his life
5219496 larger than life while he walked among us and destined to be even larger in our memories
5219497 but if ive learned anything over the last two years its that life with cancer is tough
5219498 ive learned something far more important too no matter what happens were all in this together none of us will walk this road alone
5219499 oil prices also fell to the lower end of the recent trading range on friday so some traders in the market probably saw that as a buying opportunity
5219500 madonna detailed her marriage to guy in a way that a woman usually doesnt discuss her husband with her brother it showed a side of her that made her very human but i think that this was so soon in the marriage she was having grave doubts but so was he the separation was initiated by him
5219501 i consider the government was not working effectively so i signed the decree to sack it
5219502 we have created an emergency commission to liquidate the consequences of the georgian aggression this is connected to the fact that several members of the government are incapable of acting in such a serious military situation
5219503 a commission has been formed and the government is being formed so that the population get humanitarian help and that the residents get what they need after the georgian aggression
5219504 the situation is getting more normal we are working to restore the infrastructure and communal services that were destroyed by the georgians we are working to supply housing to those displaced by the conflict
5219505 many of our federations have asked us to support womens boxing in the olympics we hope well soon have the women competing there
5219506 were looking forward to it the time has been there for a long while we were just waiting but weve been ready long enough
5219507 what we have done i think the ioc family witnessed
5219508 weve made a lot of reform and changes and weve also demonstrated fair judging in the olympics
5219509 win fine lose dont always lose and complain dont accuse the judges and referees they are working very hard if they were not fair every bout the loser would be complaining
5219510 after consultations with legal advisers and close political supporters and on their advice im taking the decision of resigning
5219511 my resignation will go to the speaker of the national assembly today
5219512 i told him i knew he was one in a million
5219513 i just get the sense with obama that he has a clear set priorities in his own mind that have nothing to do with ups and downs of the campaign
5219514 he doesnt need someone who is young but its got to be someone who is not part of the baby boom partisan culture wars of the 1990s
5219515 can this country afford ay more confrontation can the country afford any more economic upheaval

5219518 the supermarkets are telling us they will pay for price cuts out of their own money but we have bitter experience of what happens in the medium to long term
5219519 as the world flips over from a predominantly rural to a predominantly urban population base cities are going to take more and more water for agriculture
5219520 however most of the water going into urban areas comes out the other end in the sewers
5219521 we know that there is an informal sector within many cities that is using wastewater to grow vegetables but there has been no data on how much of this water was being used or what the risks were
5219522 it is a pretty useful way of treating water in the sense that if the water just went straight into a river it would cause a lot more eutrophication problems further downstream
5219523 so in a way it is performing an ecological service by cleaning up some of the water and recycling the nutrients
5219524 if this practice is going to be increasingly commonplace and more and more people are going to be eating food produced this way then there needs to be a bit more concern about the heavy metals and other contaminants in there
5219525 ideally the end product should be treating the water to a standard that means there is no risk but most developing nations cannot afford to do this
5219526 apparently what happens now in areas with very polluted water is that the farmers do a smell test or a taste test
5219527 if the water tastes too foul or smells too bad then they wont use it to irrigate their crops but thats a pretty dangerous way to go about things
5219528 it is really just about minimising the risks from field to fork with a series of simple measures
5219529 these include letting the water settle in a pond so a lot of the eggs from worms drop out of the water and irrigating around the crops rather than on top of them
5219530 when the crop is harvested it also needs to be washed with fresh clean water in the market and that water needs to be constantly changed so everything else is not contaminated
5219531 i hope the nation and the people will forgive my mistakes
5219532 i pray the government stops this down sliding and take the country out of this crisis

5219589 we are fed up with india and we are fed up with pakistan
5219590 when i am in india i am treated as a kashmiri and not as an indian
5219591 if i am told that i am kashmiri then i am kashmiri
5219592 there is no government nothing only people on the roads thats all
5219593 it was just all so fine from the indian point of view you had the kashmiri separatists almost isolated
5219594 everything was moving so beautifully and then these guys start playing electoral politics it was one of the best times after the militancy but now it has gone back to the 90s phase
5219595 i think the chief minister was hoping the issue would get him some votes in the jammu region and they didnt bargain on the kind of response that they got
5219596 now on both sides in jammu and kashmir it has gotten far beyond the land issue
5219597 if you are economically strong you can fight for your independence if you are weak then you have nothing
5219598 it means a lot to these guys now to see federer go down on his back after winning a semifinals of doubles it shows how important an olympic medal is to him
5219599 some players rise to the occasion when they play for their country some players get a little nervous
5219600 its different than a normal tournament its do or die its a lot of players last olympics its a lot of players first olympics and their only opportunity to get a medal and become a superstar in their country
5219601 we have seen a great evolution over the 20 years in olympic tennis with a medal becoming one of the most coveted prizes for our athletes
5219602 its kind of strange i never knew tennis existed in the olympics until four years ago
5219603 when i speak to some players now who didnt used to play the olympics back in maybe 1996 or 2000
5219604 i know that some of them have regrets that they didnt play it seeing how big the olympics has become in tennis and how important tennis has become to the olympics
5219605 i hope that by my presence and also rafas presence and the presence of roddick and
5219606 liu xiangs withdrawal is the biggest loss to this beijing olympic games
5219607 i feel sad because this is the olympics that is being held right here in beijing
5219608 we still have confidence in him because he was gold medalist at the last olympic games and all chinese people adore him
5219609 as an ambassador for our company and our brand because his achievements both on and off the field will continue to inspire fans and consumers throughout china
5219610 we began supporting liu xiang before his athens triumph and we will continue supporting him through his recovery
5219611 we would have stayed longer if liu xiang had gone on to the final
5219612 liu xiangs withdrawal is the biggest loss to this beijing olympic games
5219613 i feel sad because this is the olympics that is being held right here in beijing
5219614 we still have confidence in him because he was gold medalist at the last olympic games and all chinese people adore him
5219615 as an ambassador for our company and our brand because his achievements both on and off the field will continue to inspire fans and consumers throughout china
5219616 we began supporting liu xiang before his athens triumph and we will continue supporting him through his recovery
5219617 we would have stayed longer if liu xiang had gone on to the final
5219618 thats the one thing ive been looking forward to for a long time not doing anything just sitting and not moving
5219619 id like to try some other events maybe not do some of the events i did here
5219620 bob has said he wants to start fresh and do things that he hasnt done before try new things in workouts try new training methods its going to be a fun four years
5219621 i think well have to see how he is on those sprints because there is training involved with that
5219622 i think that he thinks it might be a little easier but it will be different i think he can sprint but i think that hes more naturally suited to longer events it would be a change for him but i think a good one
5219623 the worst thing you can do is tell him that he cant do something thats the quickest way to make sure he can the races he concentrates on when its time to perform in the london games id bet hell be the best in the world
5219624 ive heard about 70 000 people at baltimore ravens stadium staying after the preseason game to watch the 4x100 medley relay on the big screen to the 100 fly being on the jumbotron at the game
5219625 four years ago theres no way that would ever happen
5219626 i dont want this sport to be an every four year sport yeah we get the most attention every four years but in between those four years theres really not as much exposure for us that i would like thats a goal that isnt going to happen overnight i think its going to happen over time so thats something im ready to be in the long haul for
5219627 every day every night youre thinking about it scared that something will happen to your family
5219628 i hope when i go home everything will be quiet and there will be peace
5219629 i love my country so i will do anything for my countrys peace
5219630 its too hard to focus on the competition when you have war in your home
5219631 i called them and they said were good dont worry about us but its hard not to worry you cant see you just hear
5219632 but russian military is in georgia walking on the streets people are scared
5219633 but im thinking about the possibility of creating history the possibility of all of us going out there and getting golds is feasible
5219634 the best way you can raise up your family is to do well and win
5219635 i feel like i have an advantage having steven and jean around because theyve done it before and of course i want steven and diana to win

5219677 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
5219678 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
5219679 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
5219680 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
5219681 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
5219682 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
5219683 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
5219684 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
5219685 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
5219686 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
5219687 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
5219688 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
5219689 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
5219690 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
5219691 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
5219692 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
5219693 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
5219694 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
5219695 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
5219696 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
5219697 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
5219698 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
5219699 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
5219700 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
5219701 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
5219702 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
5219703 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
5219704 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
5219705 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
5219706 this is a planning took where all things are going
5219707 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
5219708 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
5219709 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
5219710 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
5219711 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
5219712 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
5219713 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
5219714 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
5219715 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
5219716 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
5219717 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
5219718 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
5219719 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
5219720 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
5219721 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
5219722 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
5219723 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection
5219724 we had one that we used in a sting for school zones
5219725 hopefully well have the new one by the time school starts again
5219726 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
5219727 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
5219728 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
5219729 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
5219730 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
5219731 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
5219732 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
5219733 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
5219734 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
5219735 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
5219736 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
5219737 because we live on the coast the red cross had us on standby so we didnt know when they were going to call us out
5219738 just when we got back home decided it was too late for them to call us out is when we got the call that we were supposed to leave
5219739 three days after the fact there is still terrible flooding many of the roads that we need to take to get to some shelters are still impassable and i heard that about 200 000 people down here are still without power or bathroom facilities
5219740 there are lots of roofs blown off houses trees are blown over and downed power lines
5219741 we just have to expect the unexpected and go where we are needed
5219742 ive been on the phone trying to get more supplies sent down here to the shelter in santa rosa
5219743 he then moved to a profession where he would need to learn many skills
5219744 our honoree mastered many skills all of these skills propelled him to the top of his profession including leadership communication negotiation and patience
5219745 in fact this very corporation was once a committee of the chamber of commerce
5219746 his vision of our county led to his running for mayor and his tenure as mayor has been phenomenal
5219747 its indeed an honor and a privilege to receive this honor from mitch who we all know succeeded me at the chamber and i wanted to say thank you to everybody
5219748 you know a lot of folks have done a lot of great things over the years to bring us to where we are today and this is a combination of that so thank you
5219749 i think what we can see as we look around tonight is a county that is in transition in change
5219750 i think we are entering a period now where the change and transition is becoming much more apparent
5219751 all of those things are coming together and they are having an impact on economic development
5219752 we have to refocus our economic development strategy to promote not just growth but a better quality of life for our citizens
5219753 with the many new citizens we expect to be moving into the county we need a housing stock that will accommodate variety
5219754 we need to keep our people and our industry here in the county and having a way to train them locally for a good career is one way we do that
5219755 we continue to look for companies that are going to upgrade the wage scales locally
5219756 this is just for the culverts which is phase one of the southwest cut project and it will be paid for by the ciap grant
5219757 there has never really been anything proven that this will be good for the bay
5219758 east matagorda bay is a unique bay its a small bay system its not like galveston or any other of the larger bays
5219759 my concern is the salinity that will come in through the colorado river into that east matagorda bay
5219760 we have no idea what its going to do to the sea grasses the fish the shrimp and everything else
5219761 im really concerned not just me but the whole community because weve been known to do things that effect systems in our environment negatively and a lot of times you cant backtrack and fix them
5219762 this culvert as it stands right now will be monitored if it is detrimental to the bay it will be simple to close it in and reverse it
5219763 this is not something that is irreversible in fact the last thing that i would want to do or anyone would want to do would be to do something that would be harmful for east matagorda bay
5219764 this will help keep the mouth of the river open itll be good for drainage and i think it will be good for marine life
5219765 judge i can tell you that there are a lot of people upset at the live oak landing subdivision because they were told that they would be able to build up to the creek and they cant
5219766 ive had several calls and a contractor that came in and was supposed to have built a bunch of gazebos and decks and they cant do it because it is on the flood plain
5219767 so i dont know how far they are going to take it but its a serious problem i mean its out of our control but its happening
5219768 i just hate to see these people come in and get sold a bill of goods before anything has even been done to support it
5219769 that is just deceptive trade practices and we just need to encourage people to be diligent before they buy something
5219770 all we can do is really encourage people to use a realtor who is legally obligated to disclose the conditions of the property because i dont know how you regulate honesty
5219771 in cold years the gas company earns money and in the warmer years you lose money
5219772 the board has tried to keep gas prices to the bone as much as possible
5219773 six or seven years ago we had the money to back the funding for the next year
5219774 its easy to look at last years budget and see what should have been done the hard part is not the amendment process but the upcoming budget
5219775 i get the excuse always that there is a broken truck
5219776 ive never seen a community do what bay city has done in the past 10 years
5219777 you have value on the ground more than you spent
5219778 under the texas local government code the city has the right to approve the professionals it hires
5219779 the attorney general ruled that a contractor is a professional
5219780 may i suggest if there are five blokes to every girl we should find out where there are beauty disadvantaged women and ask them to proceed to mount isa
5219781 quite often you will see walking down the street a lass who is not so attractive with a wide smile on her face
5219782 whether it is recollection of something previous or anticipation for the next evening there is a degree of happiness
5219783 theres a lot of anger circulating among the community at the moment a lot of passionate anger
5219784 weve got a saying up here that the odds are good but the goods are odd
5219785 wir haben bei der auswahl der programmpunkte darauf wert gelegt neben dem hohen reiterlichen niveau auch den unterhaltungsmoment zu bieten
5219786 americans regard democracy as something more transcendent something more sacred than just counting noses
5219787 americans at base want to know that their politics is about what is right and if a majority wants to do what is wrong people just dont roll over
5219788 just that very basic principle of recognizing the humanity of blacks was huge
5219789 im never going to remember these thoughts im having without the aid of written word
5219790 thats actually two questions and this is a hypothetical situation and you can pretty much do anything in a hypothetical situation

5219792 save afghan lives defeating the enemies plan to discredit the afghan government
5219793 we recommend to all afghans to be vigilant at large public events and other locations where crowds gather and report suspicious behavior to security forces
5219794 all the time the enemy tries to carry out any kind of activity that it can but the afghan security forces are ready and we have already taken measures to disrupt any enemy activity

5219801 i had my first 2cv in 1971 and have thousands of stories to tell when this couple saw my 2cv they asked if they could use it for their wedding of course i said yes
5219802 i took this photo of my girlfriend cooking while camping in the french alps with my 2cv looking out towards the mountains
5219803 siempre tuvo claro que era una mujer por qu una mujer transexual no puede tener problemas mentales
5219804 you know what i want to carry on with this discussion
5219805 do you know how embarassing that sounds to other races
5219806 im not being racist my dad is even darker than you
5219807 you need to change your mindset because those type of statements could get you into some serious trouble with other people in the future
5219808 after consultations with legal advisers and close political supporters and on their advice im taking the decision of resigning
5219809 my resignation will go to the speaker of the national assembly today
5219810 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
5219811 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
5219812 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
5219813 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
5219814 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
5219815 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
5219816 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
5219817 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
5219818 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
5219819 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
5219820 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
5219821 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
5219822 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
5219823 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
5219824 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
5219825 who are open to doing something on the production side
5219826 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
5219827 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
5219828 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
5219829 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
5219830 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
5219831 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
5219832 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
5219833 the outlook is not good but we are giving the calf its only option
5219834 it cant be fed and in fact we wouldnt know what to feed it
5219835 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
5219836 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
5219837 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
5219838 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
5219839 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
5219840 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
5219841 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
5219842 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
5219843 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
5219844 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
5219845 der pr sident saakaschwili anm nicht l nger ein gespr chspartner f r verhandlungen sein kann und dass es besser w re wenn er zur cktritt
5219846 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
5219847 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
5219848 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
5219849 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
5219850 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
5219851 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
5219852 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
5219853 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
5219854 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
5219855 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
5219856 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
5219857 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
5219858 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
5219859 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
5219860 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
5219861 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
5219862 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
5219863 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
5219864 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
5219865 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
5219866 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
5219867 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
5219868 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
5219869 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
5219870 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence

5219875 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
5219876 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
5219877 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
5219878 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
5219879 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
5219880 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
5219881 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
5219882 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
5219883 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
5219884 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
5219885 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
5219886 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
5219887 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
5219888 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
5219889 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
5219890 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
5219891 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
5219892 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
5219893 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
5219894 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
5219895 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
5219896 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
5219897 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
5219898 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
5219899 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
