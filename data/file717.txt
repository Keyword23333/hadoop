7170047 what picture i would use for my holy card should i make it to saint and of what cause s i wanted to be patron
7170048 i think the first thing that we do is we have a look at how the funding is being utilised and whether we are getting the maximum bang for every one of those taxpayer dollars
7170049 that means that we need to have a look at the programs that are in place
7170050 are there ways that we can better co operate and make that money go further i think potentially there is
7170051 i think that its time that we have a look at the next steps for our system and that we introduce serious reform
7170052 i dont want to criticise those other sports but certainly after every olympics and indeed every time we come round to a funding round there will be serious work done analysing the programs that are in place

7170054 i think the first thing that we do is we have a look at how the funding is being utilised and whether we are getting the maximum bang for every one of those taxpayer dollars
7170055 that means that we need to have a look at the programs that are in place
7170056 are there ways that we can better co operate and make that money go further i think potentially there is

7170063 but how do you expect me to live alone with just me
7170064 i was pained and angered by the atrocities against muslims worldwide and the turning point was the demolition of the babri masjid and the gujarat riots only made matters worse
7170065 if the government does not take early measures to bring an end to undue harassment of muslims who were indiscriminately labeled as terrorists this country is in for another partition so let us be prepared for nation wide riots and violence
7170066 all this talk about creation of indian mujahideen images needs to be probed i would not be surprised if such an organization has been floated by fundamentalist bodies like the rashtriya swayamsevak sangh or vishwa hindu parishad with the sole intention of defaming muslims
7170067 i am not giving any clean chit to anyone but the manner adopted by the investigating agencies speaks of a blatant bias and a predetermined approach
7170068 if the government does not take early measures to bring an end to undue harassment of muslims who were indiscriminately labeled as terrorists this country is in for another partition so let us be prepared for nation wide riots and violence
7170069 if the government does not take early measures to bring an end to undue harassment of muslims who were indiscriminately labeled as terrorists
7170070 if the government does not take early measures to bring an end to undue harassment of muslims who were indiscriminately labeled as terrorists this country is in for another partition so let us be prepared for nation wide riots and violence
7170071 if the government does not take early measures to bring an end to undue harassment of muslims who were indiscriminately labeled as terrorists
7170072 if the government does not take early measures to bring an end to undue harassment of muslims who were indiscriminately labeled as terrorists this country is in for another partition so let us be prepared for nation wide riots and violence

7170079 we are at a critical point in our time where we can either educate or incarcerate

7170081 students and parents must understand that attending school is not optional
7170082 were all for keeping kids in school and we applaud any efforts to make that happen
7170083 but the privacy issue what happens with the bracelet or anklet after school is out is that appropriate for the school or courts to know where and what this person is doing outside of school
7170084 sometimes as i said students are runaways parents dont know where they are
7170085 i take my running shoes seriously since comfort while pounding mile after mile really does boil down to the quality of the shoe

7170111 biden ha denunciado el deplorable juicio de barack obama en materia de pol tica exterior y ha se alado que barack obama no est preparado para ser presidente
7170112 es una buena noticia para obama y para estados unidos

7170125 they had me up on ladders with rollers doing shots
7170126 they made us stay 10 to 12 hours a day for the three days and usually we were there five hours a day so it was a massive change to our normal schedule
7170127 i just got so upset because they were basically not letting me leave
7170128 coming into the ice cream shop that was ridiculous i dont know what they hoped to achieve by coming around the back of the counter it was like they thought they were on some dramatic tv show its just a cooking show
7170129 they didnt get the angle they wanted with my bosses so they were pretty much scrambling for any bit of excitement they could get from it and i guess that just happened to be it
7170130 she came into the shop and the next thing we know theyre through the front filming us so ive taken her out the back into the store area
7170131 then one of them comes through the front behind the counter and bails up my 16 year old daughter while ive got a pregnant sasha out the back
7170132 i thought she was going to have a miscarriage she was so distressed it was disgusting absolutely disgusting
7170133 the police went and told them to pull their heads in because they had no right they never apologised nothing
7170134 as a rule we dont comment on production shoots but there are a number of claims that are inaccurate and that we strongly disagree with
7170135 id agreed to do the show but it was like theyd never known a pregnant person before
7170136 they didnt make any allowance for it and it would have been nice if theyd been more considerate of me needing more of a break than everyone else
7170137 did that really just happen yeah yeah that really just happened
7170138 she looked over looked at baby bear and scrunched her nose like she was disgusted

7170152 it describes a scenario that is repeated often in the world of aspiring songwriters
7170153 with little experience and high hopes they write a song that to them is absolutely perfect

7170157 is genuinely a friend of mine ive known john for 35 years
7170158 and during those 18 months i must tell you frankly
7170159 i have been disappointed in my friend john mccain who gave in to the right wing of his party and gave in to the swift boat politics he once so deplored
7170160 thats not a worry john mccain has to worry about
7170161 its a pretty hard experience hell have to figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at

7170164 so let me introduce to you the next president the next vice president of the united states of america joe biden
7170165 i think he can be ready but right now i dont believe he is
7170166 the presidency is not something that lends itself to on the job training
7170167 i would be honored to run with or against john mccain because i think the country would be better off

7170172 wow look at that one that almost took out the tree in our backyard
7170173 now get outta my bed and go talk amongst yourselves downstairs and stay away from the windows
7170174 just because someone tells a story doesnt mean its true
7170175 i had always thought of her as ageless timeless and 100 percent cast iron damage proof
7170176 whereas previously you never had to say anything to her twice because shed already filed it away in her formidable memory bank mum started asking the same questions over and over again unaware she was doing so
7170177 i had to keep giving her the bad news over and over again
7170178 every time it finally sank in that she had lost her husband of more than 50 years shed look at me sadly and say oh as i struggled to compose myself
7170179 she snapped back into iron lady mode and was utterly engaging
7170180 t ves la silla pero no puedes decir si es real debido a que tu percepci n de esa silla inicia en tus sentidos que pueden ser enga ados y luego por tu mente que puede estar alterada
7170181 hagamos lo siguiente tomo la silla y te la estrello en el lomo si percepci n de que la silla es real era correcta
7170182 i see dare to dream as one step above in our career weve kept the same attitude we had on theatre of shadows but we were a little more bold this time i believe lots of people will be quite surprised because we did some stuff that maybe no one would ever expect us to do but weve also kept our identity
7170183 recently we finished our contract with chavis records they were one of the main people behind us giving us a kick in the ass in the right direction in our path and were grateful for it and for everything they helped us achieve we wish them only the very best bill and lori will always be great friends of ours but its time that we move on it was the right moment to leave and well shop the new album to labels but have already started talking to some people that showed interest were extremely confident about this new material and very anxious to see what the future holds in store for us
7170184 as the olympic games in beijing draw to a close i have been particularly impressed by the british and commonwealth athletes who have taken part in this memorable competition and who have contributed so much to the spirit of these remarkable games in the various disciplines
7170185 like so many people around the world i have followed their endeavours with great interest and admiration
7170186 as a nation we now look forward to holding the olympic games in london in 2012
7170187 the golden triumphs of the present british team can only serve as further inspiration to those who will be working hard over the next four years to make the london games a shining example of olympic success
7170188 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
7170189 finding artifacts such as this one during experiments is not uncommon but we decided to investigate this one further since we kept observing it over and over when we sequenced it we were surprised to learn that we had found a new virus
7170190 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
7170191 these things definitely wont make the same kind of pretty pictures on the sky that previous stream discoveries did
7170192 proud to stand firm with the next president of the united states of america barack obama
7170193 if your kitchen table is like mine you sit there at night after you put the kids to bed and you talk about what you need you talk about how much you are worried about being able to pay the bills
7170194 ladies and gentlemen that is not a worry john mccain has to worry about its a pretty hard experience
7170195 hell have to figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
7170196 above all i searched for a leader who is ready to step in and be president
7170197 today i have come back to springfield to tell you that ive found that leader a man with a distinguished record and a fundamental decency joe biden
7170198 joe biden is what so many others pretend to be a statesman with sound judgment who doesnt have to hide behind bluster to keep america strong
7170199 he has stared down dictators and spoken out for americas cops and firefighters he is uniquely suited to be my partner as we work to put our country back on track
7170200 barack obama sounded as though he turned over the top spot on the ticket today to his new mentor when he introduced joe biden as the next president
7170201 the reality is that nothing has changed since joe biden first made his assessment that barack obama is not ready to lead he wasnt ready then and he isnt ready now
7170202 but we really have different approaches to many national security issues i look forward to whoever my running mate will be having a respectful debate with him on that as well
7170203 state governments have offered land but id like to assert the project will be a reality
7170204 theres a sense of tension violence its not a conducive atmosphere
7170205 whatever be the cost we will move out if the situation so demands
7170206 west bengal can either host the worlds costliest political blunder or the worlds cheapest car
7170207 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
7170208 god is dead god remains dead and we have killed him how shall we comfort ourselves the murderers of all murderers what was holiest and mightiest of all that the world has yet owned has bled to death under our knives who will wipe this blood off us what water is there for us to clean ourselves what festivals of atonement what sacred games shall we have to invent is not the greatness of this deed too great for us must we ourselves not become gods simply to appear worthy of it
7170209 the job of all revolutions to make permanent their gains
7170210 if we look at how much more water we will need for food and how much more for biomass for energy going forward it is quite worrying
7170211 almost every increase in water used in agriculture will affect water availability for other uses including that needed to keep ecosystems healthy and resilient in the face of change and perturbation
7170212 it might be environmentally reasonable to withdraw maybe 6 000 cubic kilometres but if we withdraw more water it would be at a very high environmental cost because we need water to flush the system and for different ecosystem services
7170213 by 2030 the same amount of energy that we produce today with fossil fuels will have to come from biomass
7170214 meet food demands by 2050 if we have a much more efficient use of water that does not include the water we need for all that biomass
7170215 we are at the end of the road when it comes to irrigation because all the water available in rivers and so on has already been now more or less used up
7170216 in a large part of africa if you look at the total rainfall throughout the year the amount is usually enough to grow many crops
7170217 russia invades georgia bush stays at the olympics presidential candidates begin taking the reigns meanwhile the iraqi government has put forth a statement all but demanding a timetable for troop withdrawal discuss

7170235 a well respected and award winning scientist ivins co wrote a slew of anthrax studies including a recent work on the treatment for inhalation anthrax published in the july 7 issue of the antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy journal
7170236 yet ivins had attempted to poison people as far back as 2000 and his therapist said she was
7170237 2 so much of the public reporting about ivins has been devoted to depicting him as a highly unstable psychotic who had been issuing extremely violent threats and who had a violent past
7170238 duley herself has a history that at the very least raises questions about her credibility
7170239 just three months ago duley pled guilty and was sentenced to probation with a suspended fine of 500 as a result of having been stopped in december while driving at 1 35 a m and charged with driving under the influence
7170240 i postulated that the real culprit of the 9 11 and anthrax attacks who engineered it all was thomas e enron white the former co chair of enron who subsequently became army secretary his dominate motive was cover his and others ass and assets was there a massive cover up white who was co chair again of enron was never indicated recently we are led to believe that bruce ivins was behind the anthrax attacks who worked out of the armys fort detrick biological center i wondered if there besides that was any direct connection between dr ivins and tom white
7170241 my veteran able danger colleagues and i share the common fear that the seeds of the next 9 11 attack have already been sewn and that much of the critical data that was harvested for the able danger project that could be used again now in the search for sleeper cells and others that matched the

7170246 we have done everything that is humanly possible to convince the commission that tucumcari is the right place for the casino

7170248 as the olympic games in beijing draw to a close i have been particularly impressed by the british and commonwealth athletes who have taken part in this memorable competition and who have contributed so much to the spirit of these remarkable games in the various disciplines
7170249 like so many people around the world i have followed their endeavours with great interest and admiration
7170250 as a nation we now look forward to holding the olympic games in london in 2012
7170251 the golden triumphs of the present british team can only serve as further inspiration to those who will be working hard over the next four years to make the london games a shining example of olympic success

7170281 i dont want to use the word fearless but she is a courageous person of course theres apprehension and she did speak about that but she never really used the term fear
7170282 she said she was drawn to the passion of the people who were in these zones in other words if youre in a zone of conflict nothing is taken for granted and you live each moment like it was a lifetime of experience
7170283 she is an intelligent caring and adventurous professional who was well aware of the dangers of the regions she frequented

7170294 this week our best efforts failed and for that we are deeply sorry
7170295 this is the toughest situation weve faced in the 100 years of this companys history
7170296 while these results are highly significant and indicate the investigation is on the right path the investigation is not complete
7170297 it listeria is virtually impossible to eradicate in its entirety
7170298 it exists in plants in supermarkets potentially in your kitchen
7170299 if test results went the other way wed be starting to look again and widening the circle for other products this limits it to what we have been focusing on so it is good news
7170300 there is a very active effort to work with all the food distribution customers but it is not as direct because there are customers and then those customers have customers
7170301 we are very confident but i cannot give you a percentage but virtually all of it has been removed
7170302 this is a very large recall right across the country involving thousands of accounts
7170303 the most vulnerable places the institutions and old age homes
7170304 over the course of the next few minutes the vehicle is seen a number of times in the neighbourhood by a number of police members and there are some attempts made to stop the vehicle
7170305 all this is subject to investigation but we know that our police member discharged a firearm at the driver of the vehicle the vehicle carried on for a short distance about a block and a 34 year old male was taken into custody and then immediately taken to hospital by ems for treatment of serious injuries
7170306 and then again the same suspect vehicle took a run at this police officer who then discharged his firearm in defence of his life
7170307 its an injury sustained in this incident but not firearm involved he wasnt shot
7170308 they may not have a complete picture of what occurred but they may be able to add a very pertinent piece of information
7170309 we need to do an investigation that looks into use of force by a police officer using a firearm that causes injury
7170310 im pretty happy though i thought i might have a shot at a medal
7170311 i tried to put myself in it early but i knew if i kept up a 2 06 pace i probably wouldnt finish
7170312 i did the best i could and ran my heart out it wasnt as good as i wanted
7170313 theyre kind of surprised that ive been playing with it up to this point
7170314 thats what i want to do thats why this decision is even out there still and not already made because i want to play period the question is what should i do how long should i play with it
7170315 its a thousand different options at this point and im just trying to make the best one
7170316 im just trying to make the best decision possible for the team and for my career
7170317 right now in talking to him his mind set is hes doing everything he can to get ready for carolina our opener
7170318 he just wants to get a little bit more information on his knee
7170319 but if you have several hundred or thousands of people pay for ash scattering on state park land it could translate into considerable funds
7170320 the doctors told us if she hadnt done this he would have died
7170321 with the selection of senator joe biden as senator obamas vice president the democrats ticket has now become an even greater gamble for the jewish community throughout his career senator biden has consistently been wrong on iran and his voting record on israel has been inconsistent like obama biden fundamentally misunderstands the threat posed by an iran determined to obtain nuclear weapons biden has continuously demonstrated poor judgment on iran he has voted against significant legislation that would pressure iran to stop pursuing nuclear weapons biden has failed to recognize the serious threat that iran poses to israel and the us and its allies in the middle east
7170322 iran is not a nuclear threat to the united states of america
7170323 the jewish community was already gravely concerned with senator obamas na ve understanding of the iranian threat an obama biden ticket has proven that it is ill equipped to deal with this threat by selecting senator biden to join his ticket voting for senator obama has now become an even greater risk
7170324 state governments have offered land but id like to assert the project will be a reality
7170325 theres a sense of tension violence its not a conducive atmosphere
7170326 whatever be the cost we will move out if the situation so demands
7170327 west bengal can either host the worlds costliest political blunder or the worlds cheapest car
7170328 we are not against the car factory we want our fertile land back
7170329 we welcome industry in singur this can be done by shifting the ancillaries somewhere else
7170330 we have been engaged in unloading of trucks and piling of sand inside the project area we will lose our living if the tatas decide to pack up
7170331 we are not aggrieved with the tatas as such we are hurt with the government that made promises which it didnt keep when the government started acquiring our land we were told we will get jobs it didnt happen some of us joined as security guards but are now out of job
7170332 i think you can expect something on the quarterback i think itll be sooner than later
7170333 if we look at how much more water we will need for food and how much more for biomass for energy going forward it is quite worrying
7170334 almost every increase in water used in agriculture will affect water availability for other uses including that needed to keep ecosystems healthy and resilient in the face of change and perturbation
7170335 it might be environmentally reasonable to withdraw maybe 6 000 cubic kilometres but if we withdraw more water it would be at a very high environmental cost because we need water to flush the system and for different ecosystem services
7170336 by 2030 the same amount of energy that we produce today with fossil fuels will have to come from biomass
7170337 meet food demands by 2050 if we have a much more efficient use of water that does not include the water we need for all that biomass
7170338 we are at the end of the road when it comes to irrigation because all the water available in rivers and so on has already been now more or less used up
7170339 in a large part of africa if you look at the total rainfall throughout the year the amount is usually enough to grow many crops
7170340 big red demon brought to earth by the nazis with a great big stone hand
7170341 to avoid the obvious problems that will occur when the republican party raises these issues after obama is nominated
7170342 multi citizenship with responsibilities owed to and allegiance to other countries
7170343 apparently a normal restriction to avoid births during a flight
7170344 during a downturn training is one of the shelf life to get whacked
7170345 but obamas consistent disregard for the liberal wing of the party has gotten really old
7170346 this man is a clear eyed pragmatist who will get the job done
7170347 we will repair the world and tear down all of the walls
7170348 and you know im just not crazy about black people
7170349 simon every time you rant on about how the evils of racism were just a trumped up thing and really not all that evil you prove how ignorant you are of this country and its history
7170350 i certainly dont feel anywhere near the sense of disgust that youve expressed when it comes to the possibility of race being used during the course of this campaign in an exploitive manner
7170351 i can however go on the evidence based on the attitudes that take hold of you
7170352 surely you have posted here and often on how you think obama exploits race
7170353 a political atmosphere that seeks to bully people into voting for their candidate
7170354 youve also said that you think american history vis a vis race has no bearing on racial attitudes today and scolded this country for being obsessed with the possibility that it does

7170365 dan sesungguhnya kami telah mengutus rasul pada tiap tiap umat untuk menyerukan
7170366 untuk tiap tiap umat diantara kamu kami berikan aturan syariat dan jalan yang terang
7170367 wahai anakku duduklah kamu bersama para ulama dan dekatilah mereka dengan kedua lututmu bergaul dengan mereka maka sesungguhnya allah subhanahu wa ta ala menghidupkan hati hati yang mati dengan cahaya hikmah sebagaimana menghidupkan menyuburkan bumi dengan hujan yang deras
7170368 bukankah orang yang sakit akan mati tatkala tercegah dari makanan minuman dan obat obatan
7170369 demikian pula halnya dengan hati jika terhalang dari ilmu dan hikmah maka akan mati
7170370 tidaklah seseorang yang bermaksiat kepada allah subhanahu wa ta ala sehingga menyebabkan hilang akalnya
7170371 sekali kali tidak demikian sebenarnya apa yang selalu mereka usahakan itu menutup hati mereka
7170372 tetapi karena mereka melanggar janjinya kami kutuk mereka dan kami jadikan hati mereka keras membatu mereka suka merubah perkataan allah dari tempat tempatnya dan mereka sengaja melupakan sebagian dari apa yang mereka diperingatkan dengannya
7170373 ketahuilah bahwa ilmu adalah cahaya dan cahaya allah tidak akan diberikan kepada orang yang bermaksiat

7170499 i think i tried to contact him four times in the last three years because i had triplets
7170500 i wanted him to know i was doing good and i wanted to make it here to see him bring the boys to see him because all of them carry his name
7170501 i dont know if he ever found out about that or not
7170502 all i know is up to the part where we were all still together probably when i was 6 or 7
7170503 last thing i remember he brought us fireworks and it was about the fourth of july we were living on a hill
7170504 were trying to provide the most reliable service possible if a tree sways in a storm and branches break it can take down the line
7170505 theres never been a question of our performance as far as saving animals and providing service to the community
7170506 if theyre fighting and ousting each other as long as they are doing what they are supposed to do under the contract thats what we care about and thats what we legally are able to deal with
7170507 our levers of control dont reach into the inner workings of the humane society
7170508 there are definitely some people who are still mourning but it gives us more of a sense of peace today im very proud to see the amount of people who have come out to show their support
7170509 in twenty some years of police work ive been to as many funerals where i knew the police officer who was killed and its stuff like this that puts the positive back into the life of the family
7170510 we raise some good funds help out the kids this is the way we serve the family thats what its all about
7170511 i dont know if a lot of people on the road realized what it was all about but i think they figured it out
7170512 there were a lot of flags a lot of waving
7170513 its been a kind of beyond your wildest dreams experience to be mentioned
7170514 it was very very flattering to be considered to be mentioned by folks for that position was very gratifying
7170515 when i signed on with senator obama it wasnt to get anything
7170516 my complete expectation is im going to be governor until january 2010
7170517 senator obama has made a great pick in joe biden
7170518 senator obama and senator biden will work very very well in virginia
7170519 i can tell you i suspect theres a great sigh of relief
7170520 there are a bunch of folks who have said i would really hate to lose tim as governor
7170521 democratic caucus and a likely candidate for governor next year said he was proud of kaine as well as sen mark r warner d who were also thought to be under consideration for showing the country that democrats are succeeding in virginia
7170522 slot machines are like a lottery on crack theyre far more addicting
7170523 we worked so hard and the virginia maryland and d c potomac primaries were the beginning of his momentum that carried him through
7170524 it was just an amazing day for all of us
7170525 we feel a special sense of pride because we gave him the momentum he needed
7170526 every time i see obama he mentions something about how that was such a big day for him
7170527 he mentions the tremendous group of victories in maryland d c and virginia he will not forget us
7170528 i think the decisiveness of his victory was a big part in creating the conventional wisdom that we wouldnt be able to catch up with him
7170529 the clinton campaign probably thought feb 5 was going to be the knockout blow and then one week later to have such a clear group of states going obamas way really helped
7170530 we had done good door knocking and had strong visibility
7170531 to me it was kind of a fait accompli we had a business execution and i felt like if we executed wed win all 144 precincts
7170532 tim penyelamat darurat segera mendatangi tempat kejadian namun menemukan tidak satu orang pun masih hidup
7170533 we are fighting every day we dont give up we dont stop and we do all that we can do
7170534 id like to introduce you to a lady from this community kathy henderson
7170535 she had tears in her eyes when she saw all the police officers out here this community needs you and there are a thousand kathy hendersons out there you have to give them everything you have you have to do 110 percent you are gonna meet people who have suffered from extreme violence and their kids cant go outside and we put our lives on the line for them and the law abiding people appreciate this you see what you can do you put your lives on the line and people like kathy henderson appreciate it
7170536 just a publicity stunt and a roundup of black males
7170537 we are not going to arrest our way out of this crime problem this is not arrest driven
7170538 its really a shame we have police officers who dont realize that public relations is a really important part of what we do absolutely its a public relations stunt and it works people like it so if they like it criticize me
7170539 we left the house we left everything and came on foot because to stay there was impossible
7170540 they are burning the houses from most of the houses they are taking everything they are stealing everything even such things as toothbrushes and toilets they are taking the toilets imagine they are taking broken refrigerators
7170541 we are so heartbroken i dont know what to say or even think our whole lives we were working to save something and one day we lost everything now i have to start everything from the very beginning
7170542 there was a bomb in the garden and all the apples on the trees fell down
7170543 the wall fell down all the windows were destroyed and now there is nothing left because of the fire
7170544 they came and asked us for wine but first we had to drink it ourselves to show that it was not poisoned then they drank the wine themselves and then they said to leave this place as soon as possible otherwise they would kill us the russians were looking for anyone who had soldiers in their home if anyone had a georgian soldier at home they burned the houses immediately
7170545 he was trying to keep the house and the fields
7170546 afterward he wanted to leave but he was circled by soldiers it was impossible he was in the orchards hiding from the russians in case they lit the house he was walking and met the russian soldiers and he made up his mind that he couldnt stay any more the russian soldiers called him and asked where he was going if he was going to the american side
7170547 my husband said he was going to see his family
7170548 and the russians said again are you going to the american side
7170549 so the russians view you as the american side even though there are no americans here
7170550 they support us so much we thought we were alone i am so thankful for the support we have from the united states and from the west the support is very important for us
7170551 the west saved the capital they were moving to tbilisi there was one night that was very dangerous the russian tanks were very close to the capital i dont know what happened but they moved the tanks back
7170552 bush and mccain made their strongest speeches yet the russians seemed to back down bush and mccain have been very good for us
7170553 why do you think the russians are doing this in your village
7170554 some of them are ossetians too not only russians and not only soldiers some are there just to steal things from ossetia and chechnya
7170555 russia can have at its borders only enemies or vassals
7170556 the previous statements are preposterous only an enemy can be an enemy

7170619 he has the potential to be the best person weve ever had and that takes nothing away from any of his predecessors
7170620 he was like a waiter at the old stanfords in westport and we had an open mic night and he began to perform each week
7170621 the big thing about him is he was a dancer he did a moonwalk like michael jackson only it was better
7170622 but our manager then thought it was vulgar and asked eddie to cool it
7170623 eddie came to town a few years ago and we made up

7170681 i enjoy playing i enjoy playing for a big crowd you know when youre in the finals you dont have anything to lose you can just win
7170682 its hard to see how that one will unfold but at present i think the situation with the company is still unravelling
7170683 however i dont believe that there is a culture which is sufficiently robust to prevent it rehappening so therefore there has got to be some remedial action
7170684 the management and the ceo run the business were the ones who are accountable for the bank
7170685 its a question of do you want 20 years of protracted litigation and reputational issues or do you want to come to something which is a bit more convenient its a balance
7170686 proud to stand firm with the next president of the united states of america barack obama
7170687 if your kitchen table is like mine you sit there at night after you put the kids to bed and you talk about what you need you talk about how much you are worried about being able to pay the bills
7170688 ladies and gentlemen that is not a worry john mccain has to worry about its a pretty hard experience
7170689 hell have to figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
7170690 above all i searched for a leader who is ready to step in and be president
7170691 today i have come back to springfield to tell you that ive found that leader a man with a distinguished record and a fundamental decency joe biden
7170692 joe biden is what so many others pretend to be a statesman with sound judgment who doesnt have to hide behind bluster to keep america strong
7170693 he has stared down dictators and spoken out for americas cops and firefighters he is uniquely suited to be my partner as we work to put our country back on track
7170694 barack obama sounded as though he turned over the top spot on the ticket today to his new mentor when he introduced joe biden as the next president
7170695 the reality is that nothing has changed since joe biden first made his assessment that barack obama is not ready to lead he wasnt ready then and he isnt ready now
7170696 but we really have different approaches to many national security issues i look forward to whoever my running mate will be having a respectful debate with him on that as well
7170697 you wanna know why i get out of bed every day and come to school for this
7170698 weve got a couple of shoulders that look like they will impact on next week in berrick barnes and daniel vickerman theyre unlikely to be available
7170699 it wasnt an easy situation to go into but he certainly relished the opportunity hes been waiting for it hell be much better for it
7170700 the key now is can we back up and therell be many who would suggest we cant
7170701 the history would suggest that also but well get a great opportunity to do that this week and thats what well concentrate on
7170702 we know that we have to better next week but we want to be better and we want to back up because its something that we havent done
7170703 i think its a reflection on how much they guys gave to secure that victory and then also that our feet hopefully are planted on the ground
7170704 we know that this is a two match tour and were very happy with what we achieved today and rightly so but another challenge awaits us in seven days
7170705 its been commented on before the fact that with so many guys that havent got that baggage with us i think that helps
7170706 its easy sometimes when youre sitting behind the glass a long way away with a pen not to have any real sense of the games physicality deans said
7170707 i think sometimes looking through the tv screen and looking from a distance we dont have a sense of that the boys got up and met that reality
7170708 state governments have offered land but id like to assert the project will be a reality
7170709 theres a sense of tension violence its not a conducive atmosphere
7170710 whatever be the cost we will move out if the situation so demands
7170711 west bengal can either host the worlds costliest political blunder or the worlds cheapest car
7170712 i had to push the pace to tire the other runners i had to push the pace because my body gets tired in the heat when i slow down
7170713 it feels good to make history here it feels good to make history for kenya and win the gold
7170714 you can see from this tournament how we need to upgrade the level of the judges
7170715 that experience is going to make this experience that much better
7170716 this discovery puts a tragic end to two weeks of anguish and despair
7170717 we wish to thank the people of victoria our family and friends in melbourne and mauritius the media auburn south primary school collingwood english language school and melbourne girls college for their assistance and prayers
7170718 last but not least we will be eternally grateful to the victorian police victorias finest men and women in uniform who did not leave any stones unturned in their quest in bringing yadav back to us

7170732 if we dont get diversity right this sport will not achieve what it needs to achieve from a popularity standpoint
7170733 one of the things that can help us is getting better tv ratings in new york l a and chicago
7170734 to do that weve got to have a reason for hispanics to like the sport
7170735 i think this is what a successful montoya would do for us
7170736 regret for the things we did can be tempered by time regret for the things we did not do that is inconsolable
7170737 we both want to get to the same place but we both simply have different visions on how to get there
7170738 all the while it is time for me to continue his legacy in the way i only know i can by taking the life lessons that he taught me be a man race hard and contend for championships since that is what i plan to do i feel strongly that i would have my fathers blessing
7170739 its more about you know there are some things that you cant get with money peace of mind and satisfaction in what you do every day and who you are and why youre doing it and who youre doing it for im seeking to have that peace of mind and that comfort to be able to really be an asset to somebody
7170740 at 32 years of age the same age as my father was when he made his final and most important career decision it is time for me to compete on a consistent basis and contend for championships now

7170771 the act of the good bishop endorsing the petition of the national irrigation administration nia to president gloria macapagal arroyo on december 28 2007 against mining the watershed was part of his moral responsibility and accountability as pastor and shepherd of the diocese no more no less
7170772 as a regulatory body they should have even isolated themselves from attending community technical working group ctwg meetings organized by the mining firms ironically the mgb representative at the meetings planted the idea that the social development plan of the mining company was not mandated by law but coming from the good heart of the company
7170773 bishopodchimar the nia and the anti mining groups such as the baywatch foundation are not simply standing up against mining they are standing against a severe lack of common sense exhibited by the national government the denr and the mines and geosciences bureau

7170778 im guessing most players did not actually perform to their level because of the heat and you got tired in a little bit of time but we didnt make the rules they decided to play the game at 12 oclock which i dont think was a good idea
7170779 a long process but it always pointed in bidens direction

7170920 to get into a roundabout you have to slow down to about 15 to 20 miles an hour
7170921 it makes it a safer situation versus the conventional four way signal light intersection where you might have someone going through at 45 miles an hour
7170922 it comes down to the amount of space you need to leave between you and the car ahead of you the faster you go the more headway you need its another one of these odd things if you look at traffic as a system it often behaves differently than the way we think it would
7170923 the merge is going to have to happen somewhere but in a congested situation its best just to take advantage of that road capacity

7170958 the committee for the liberation of iraq was the brainchild of the bush administration
7170959 it is said that once the saddam regime has been overthrown the cli will act as a shadow government for baghdad
7170960 but it will limit itself to policy matters and will not deal with details it will eventually press for a competitive petroleum production sharing regime which could make opec irrelevant to iraqs oil output or supply decisions
7170961 sessions with opinion makers contacts for journalists and mass marketing when the time is ripe
7170962 by joining our efforts senators mccain and lieberman highlight their commitment to ending the threat posed by saddam hussein and freeing the iraqi people
7170963 with nato now set to enlarge from 19 members to take on seven east european nations including the three baltic states it is said that both the bush team and the committee for the liberation of iraq want the political mechanism of the atlantic alliance to replace the un security council in giving multilateral legitimacy to any major u s action outside north america
7170964 this is because unlike the un security council where the french or russians might block american action natos political decisions do not require consensus only natos military decisions require consensus
7170965 considering the nations including the baltic states signed on the group at the expense of creating a schism in the european union the scheunemann initiative was unanimously regarded as a diplomatic triumph for washington and a coup detat in brussels

7170986 i find attractive the arguments of scholars such as stephen macedo who defend an activist supreme court that would
7170987 that caught me off guard and i had no recollection of making so atypical a statement which shook me up even more
7170988 now it would seem to me what you were talking about
7170989 is you find attractive the fact that they are activists and they would like to strike down existing laws that impact on restricting the use of property rights because you know that is what they write about
7170990 it has been quite some time since i have read professor macedo but i dont believe that in my writings i have indicated that we should have an activist supreme court or that we should have any form of activism on the supreme court
7170991 but the libertarian argument overlooks the place of the supreme court in a scheme of separation of powers one does not strengthen self government and the rule of law by having the non democratic branch of the government make policy
7170992 i thought we deserved to get something more yet we could have lost it at the end
7170993 goaltender greg sutton made a great save and defender julius james made a fantastic block to preserve the tie
7170994 if i scored it probably would have got us three points im just so gutted right now i feel like i let the team down
7170995 if we have somebody like ruiz with balls coming across the box theyre going to end up in the back of the net
7170996 if i have to eat fruit my whole life im going to do it
7170997 it only really hit me when i was watching tv this week

7171000 whether the cat is black or white makes no difference as long as it catches mice it is a good cat
7171001 proud to stand firm with the next president of the united states of america barack obama
7171002 if your kitchen table is like mine you sit there at night after you put the kids to bed and you talk about what you need you talk about how much you are worried about being able to pay the bills
7171003 ladies and gentlemen that is not a worry john mccain has to worry about its a pretty hard experience
7171004 hell have to figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
7171005 above all i searched for a leader who is ready to step in and be president
7171006 today i have come back to springfield to tell you that ive found that leader a man with a distinguished record and a fundamental decency joe biden
7171007 joe biden is what so many others pretend to be a statesman with sound judgment who doesnt have to hide behind bluster to keep america strong
7171008 he has stared down dictators and spoken out for americas cops and firefighters he is uniquely suited to be my partner as we work to put our country back on track
7171009 barack obama sounded as though he turned over the top spot on the ticket today to his new mentor when he introduced joe biden as the next president
7171010 the reality is that nothing has changed since joe biden first made his assessment that barack obama is not ready to lead he wasnt ready then and he isnt ready now
7171011 but we really have different approaches to many national security issues i look forward to whoever my running mate will be having a respectful debate with him on that as well
7171012 i thought they would kill us i was very much afraid
7171013 georgian units are concentrated in the central part of the republic and are preparing for further actions
7171014 georgian special forces are setting up arms caches in order among other things to carry out provocations on the territory of south ossetia and neighboring districts
7171015 knowing how to abandon a failed idea task or relationship is often the most difficult kind of decision a leader has to make
7171016 barack obama sounded as though he turned over the top spot on the ticket today to his new mentor
7171017 the reality is that nothing has changed since joe biden first made his assessment that barack obama is not ready to lead
7171018 i would be honored to run with or against john mccain because i think the country would be better off
7171019 joe biden has a long record of experience its in sharp contrast to barack obamas record
7171020 we feel like its a bit of a disguise pick hes trying to disguise hes the most inexperienced candidate in the modern era
7171021 joe and i have been friends for many many years and we know each other very well and so i think hes made a very wise selection
7171022 but we really have different approaches to many national security issues i look forward to whoever my running mate will be having a respectful debate with him on that as well
7171023 an obama biden ticket is a very impressive and strong team
7171024 i have enjoyed for many years the opportunity to work with joe biden to bring strong bipartisan support to united states foreign policy
7171025 no one on the democratic side knows more about foreign policy than senator biden
7171026 a package management system that can solve sudoku based on package dependency rules is not something that i think would be useful or worth having

7171039 this is the next innovation for the movie industry it impacts how we make our movies how movie theaters present our films and how audiences experience our films
7171040 intels contribution to the 3 d partnership technology came through acquisitions of start up companies with more innovations from its stand alone graphics chip due in 2009 code named larrabee
7171041 you definitely need to pay attention to which graphics card youre installing
7171042 many people put high powered equipment into their barebones and then wonder why its so loud
7171043 the chance to list a game has been increased many times over by the letter of the law
7171044 the protection of minors act calls for the supreme youth agencies of the state to undertake the labelling and they employ the usk
7171045 the majority decides but the permanent representative always has a veto right

7171048 video is a criteria for purchase but its seldom used
7171049 purchases are made based on functions whether that feature is used or not is often beside the point
7171050 industrialization is critical for the development of social infrastructure the development of the state and the country should not suffer due to any political differences
7171051 the industrial progress of west bengal would be ruined if tatas are forced to withdraw their singur project it would be a clear case of vindictive politics and sending extremely wrong signals to investors which will take the state back to 70s era when west bengal witnessed large exodus of its industrial units
7171052 we call ourselves the worlds biggest democracy but we are allowing these extremist groups to dictate what can be allowed in the public sphere
7171053 the person you see in front of you is not a highly motivated individual
7171054 a little bit of support a little bit of freedom

7171061 its a very specialized market and the economy is not the greatest
7171062 when you get the old guys here its great to listen the car evokes a ton of memories
7171063 yeahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh raaaaaaaaaaaaagamuffin thats my jammmmmmm bo bo bo i almost got into the mosh pit at the end until i saw a guy that was 3xs my size jump in i like you guys but im not running the risk of being sat on by a 300 pound man
7171064 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
7171065 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
7171066 cell phone only households are similar to landline households in political attitudes
7171067 people are truthful in public opinion surveys but there are times when the truth is stretched a bit a recent wall street journal story reported that in a 2005 harris poll 58 percent of interviewees told the live telephone interviewer that they exercise regularly but in an online survey only 35 percent reported exercising regularly
7171068 reluctant to say theyre voting against a candidate because of race as a result polls tend to overstate the level of support for a black candidate by five to 10 points
7171069 nearly every national poll interviews only registered voters but some try to identify those people who are most likely to vote
7171070 are considered to be more predictive of the actual election results because about six out of every 10 registered voters will go to the polls in november
7171071 if one day makes such a difference in polls results
7171072 how accurate can polls be three months before an election
7171073 im talking only about scientifically designed polls that use random sampling not internet surveys or other amateur efforts that do not purport to represent an entire electorate
7171074 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
7171075 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
7171076 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
7171077 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
7171078 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
7171079 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
7171080 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
7171081 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
7171082 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
7171083 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
7171084 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
7171085 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
7171086 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
7171087 who are open to doing something on the production side
7171088 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
7171089 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
7171090 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
7171091 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
7171092 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
7171093 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
7171094 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
7171095 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
7171096 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
7171097 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
7171098 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
7171099 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
7171100 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
7171101 el procedimiento es que el centro de control aeroportuario tiene que llamar al 112 y decirle activo el plan de emergencias

7171103 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
7171104 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
7171105 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
7171106 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
7171107 big industry and industrial agriculture and if those two drivers of your economy have become more efficient that means you need fewer people in the factories and fewer on the farm
7171108 its hard to retool a community that was so dependent for so many years on industrial agriculture and industry to reinvent itself
7171109 i think one of the biggest obstacles is the cost of fuel i think unfortunately thats a situation a lot of families are having to deal with soaring energy costs are pretty significant
7171110 theres things to do they have access to more urban areas traditionally the communities are clean the towns are safe
7171111 as we get our redevelopment going we will become more of a bedroom community
7171112 a lot of people i know work in galesburg i think youll start seeing car pooling or maybe somebody will come up with some kind of a shuttle service i dont see it being a real serious problem for us
7171113 were seeing the manifestations of poverty of empty houses and unkempt lawns and that puts the burden on the people who are left
7171114 we see that in the crime and the empty buildings but thats just a public manifestation of the problem its getting worse right now people are stealing gas theyre stealing copper
7171115 if we have a big outpouring of people we could have a problem
7171116 then well start working on the other buildings some can be saved but weve got to look a long ways down the road
7171117 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
7171118 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
7171119 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
7171120 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
7171121 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
7171122 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
7171123 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
7171124 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
7171125 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
7171126 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
7171127 like most people i have a love for gardening and want other people to enjoy the fresh produce too
7171128 most of us are too small to do it on our own
7171129 none of us are certified organic but we all practice sustainable methods we eat what we grow and want it to be the best
7171130 it was a launch pad to help us increase sales by working together
7171131 i doubt if it is a record but it is still pretty big
7171132 i am retired and was looking for something to occupy myself and make a little extra money
7171133 this just gives me a venue to sell my stuff
7171134 most farmers markets dont have the stipulation that the produce sold is locally grown our mission is to educate the consumer
7171135 if you buy them when they are not in season you are not getting peak flavor
7171136 we didnt really have to sell the idea though the food sold itself
7171137 we sell to them at extremely low prices to make it affordable to them
7171138 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
7171139 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
7171140 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
7171141 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
7171142 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
7171143 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
7171144 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
7171145 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
7171146 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
7171147 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
7171148 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
7171149 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
7171150 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
7171151 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
7171152 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
7171153 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
7171154 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
7171155 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
7171156 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
7171157 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
7171158 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
7171159 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
7171160 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
7171161 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
7171162 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
7171163 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
7171164 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
7171165 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
7171166 i want that person to state my mothers name the old folks home and when it happened
7171167 the people are not stupid to simply believe such a thing while the accuser is indeed stupid to make such a baseless accusation
7171168 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
7171169 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
7171170 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
7171171 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
7171172 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
7171173 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
7171174 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
7171175 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
7171176 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas

7171178 ive watched a lot of you former governors come up here and invariably you go through three phases like a person grieving over a death i suppose
7171179 the first phase is disbelief you just cant believe how legislation and decisions are made
7171180 is anger you stay mad most of the time and you want to change the system and make it more orderly

7171192 digitization and convergence have redefined our present as a moment of media in transition
7171193 historians can quite productively made use of those earlier transition moments when related forms of instability threw into question media ontologies

7171203 if you want to find out what a big obstacle the ego really is try to come together with other people in genuine transparency transparency means radical authenticity free from ego defenses and impure motives its the ultimate challenge to the ego you could sit on a meditation cushion until you dropped dead and never have your capacity for radical transparency tested the real test for all of us is in relationship when theres radical transparency and the ego steps aside each single individual in that extraordinary collective context has access to the power and depth and clarity of the enlightened mind and thats when enlightenment really starts to take on new meaning and significance for us all

7171207 we have to create awareness that homophobia is not acceptable
7171208 i didnt think we were sharp right from the opening minute
7171209 we had a couple of chances to put the game away early and our final pass just wasnt quite there
7171210 shes super athletic and can play with her feet very comfortably for her first regular season game i thought she was outstanding
7171211 she played a composed and mistake free game and when we needed a couple of key saves she made them
7171212 she probably wins 60 or 70 percent of the balls at midfield off of punts and goal kicks without watching the film i think she may have been our best player on the field tonight shes just a tremendous competitor and has a great will to win
7171213 i wouldve liked to have gotten the ball more to the left side of the goal but i thought i got solid contact on it
7171214 her composure in front of goal is great her strike rate for her chances is great and she puts the ball on target which is something we had a bit of trouble doing tonight

7171220 and the best part is you get to eat the cookies
7171221 besides my family this is probably what i consider the most important thing in the world right now
7171222 i just think its monumentally important he becomes the president i think it affects our country and the planet to not be involved in this campaign i couldnt do it
7171223 mccain has a problem of people staying home and that is a huge problem republicans are not as excited about the mccain candidacy and that could translate to a poor showing in november
7171224 he can absolutely improve on the excitement factor during the convention
7171225 i also think that it helps a lot that we are going after the democrats this year right now the conventions are just crammed right next to each other with very little opportunity to get a significant bounce out of the democratic convention
7171226 we engaged thousands of new people in the process and i think the nevada delegation has a responsibility and an obligation to represent multiple generations of nevadans
7171227 people for whom this is a first campaign and people who have been waiting for history like this to happen
7171228 i just thought oh my gosh this is so exciting
7171229 at the caucus they just asked for volunteers i just raised my hand nobody else was doing it
7171230 were part of the reason hes in this historic position hes in now
7171231 i just volunteered to work for the barack obama campaign thats all i did i believe in sen obama and what he stands for and what he is i want to make sure he gets elected
7171232 im sure that theres still people that are disappointed because their candidate is not the nominee but that disappointment can be overcome by a desire to change the country and the recognition that barack obama is the one that can do that
7171233 i am still a supporter of hillary clinton but will work hard to help put a democrat in the white house come january 2009

7171246 obviously joe and i have been on different philosophical sides but we have been i consider him a good friend and good man
7171247 it will be more difficult now senator mccain to criticize barack obamas foreign policy credentials when someone like joe biden is on the ticket a very experienced and respected voice on capitol hill in these matters
7171248 well ive always respected joe biden but i disagreed with him from the time he voted against the first gulf war to his position where he said you had to break iraq up into three different counties
7171249 i never agreed with that but i appreciate very much his dedication to trying to solve this genocide thats going in darfur and other things that joe biden has done but we really have different approaches to many national security issues i look forward to whoever my running mate will be having a respectful debate with him on that as well

7171259 you work for years to built that invincibility knowing that at some point its going to break the mirror is going to break
7171260 ive enjoyed it talking about it being compared to the greatest
7171261 its a nice challenge beating the next generation trying to play for a long time trying to stay healthy trying to beat records
7171262 its always been difficult to beat all these guys its just not so easy to keep it up all the time eventually sometimes they get you
7171263 i think thats maybe what i feel most this year you know just losing too many matches
7171264 i look forward to the u s open i still have really this and then the masters cup in shanghai to really do well now try to save my season
7171265 the last years i did very well too i was very happy being the no 2 so finally im no 1
7171266 i dont have time to celebrate so probably after new york after davis cup im going to have a good time
7171267 i feel like im playing really solid and much better than i have been all year to be honest i really look forward to it
7171268 you know it can turn around in a split of a second
7171269 you have to stay calm on the outside for the kids you dont want to panic
7171270 were back on top of the west and as we know its so important to have that home field advantage for the second round of the playoffs and thats even looking ahead a little bit were taking it game by game and it was my first game back
7171271 if we dont get a result in new york then its back to a three or four point lead in the west
7171272 but its fine probably ill get to know next time how to celebrate
7171273 this is my 11th final and ive only won twice its starting to really sting you know nine times losing ive got a lot of runner up trophies in my office in my house
7171274 stockholm was in scandinavia it was my first tournament and it was smaller than this
7171275 here its the tournament before the u s open and its a really big tournament you know i have beaten some really great players on my way to win this tournament
7171276 i just didnt have power especially in the third set
7171277 if you are not able to run and fight on the court then youre going to lose the match
7171278 not today but if i compare it to one month ago its much better so i look forward to play the u s open the most important tournament obviously is coming in two days i hope i will stay fresh for each match
7171279 i enjoy playing i enjoy playing for a big crowd you know when youre in the finals you dont have anything to lose you can just win

7171291 which led to technical breakdown and disorganization amongst the line
7171292 i think were working very hard at practice but at this point we have to pay close attention to detail

7171303 no molesta el futbol es as lo nico que s es que hay que seguir trabajando mucho para mejorar en esos aspectos tambi n hay que ver el punto de que venimos de un viaje muy largo desde espa a muy cansados y tuvimos uno o dos entrenamientos antes de este partido y lo m s importante es que sacamos los tres puntos
7171304 s fue clave para irnos 2 1 al descanso adem s de salir para el segundo tiempo con esas ganas que siempre ha mostrado este equipo
7171305 fue una jugada en que se me fue un poco larga la esf rica y entonces cuando la toc para el costado me toca
7171306 ya me siento adaptado al ritmo del futbol mexicano y la altura del distrito federal yo trato de trabajar y quiero jugar pero no defino solo los equipos
7171307 obviamente despu s de que vas ganando 2 0 lo que menos quieres es siquiera imaginar que puedes perder el partido sobre todo porque tenemos un equipo que no es nada f cil sab amos que est bamos en su casa y que no iban a bajar los brazos
7171308 creo que s en lo an mico los ayud much simo y a nosotros no nos afect pero no supimos pararnos bien dentro de la cancha en el segundo tiempo ellos anotan un gol a los diez minutos del complemento y los anim
7171309 hubo combinaciones de mala marcaci n algunos errores que permiten que el rival nos pueda anotar y al final duele porque terminamos perdiendo el partido
7171310 no supimos manejar el partido ten amos una ventaja de 2 0 el equipo estaba bien desafortunadamente seguimos teniendo distracciones que nos cuestan la derrota
7171311 ahora m s que preocuparnos hay que tratar de meternos lo m s pronto posible tenemos un juego en puerta contra necaxa que tenemos que ganar s o s porque podr amos alejarnos mucho en el grupo y podr a costarnos mucho si queremos calificar

7171340 dark for fear of failure an inner gloom as wide as an eye and fermenting roiling hate death grip in my viens unveiling rancid pedals flowering forth foul nectar the space between a blink and a tear death blooms
7171341 the fool that fell from heaven heaven perversion of a truth im stuck there inside of lies buried in me why alone born into a world never asked to be here try to forget truth doesnt exist truth it doesnt exist it doesnt exist truth maybe were all the children of a star misguided in direction our misdirection pardon me while i pray for light im not the only one that walks between the rain there are many im not the only one when everything is lost that doesnt surrender

7171351 when you feel your soul drop to the floor like a hole like an open bleeding sore
7171352 dont blame us for our in action it was incumbent on nancy pelosi to explain to us how to end the culture of corruption
7171353 he has this air of perfection and joe biden is more down to earth
7171354 its a total diss to sen clinton in my opinion
7171355 it just speaks volumes about how barack obama doesnt stand for anything
7171356 most people feel that if she wanted to press to be vice president she would have made a bigger push for it
7171357 a long process but it always pointed in bidens direction
7171358 many others were discussed but my impression was that those three a few weeks ago were really the centerpiece kaine bayh and biden
7171359 we made the final three in a competition where they dont give out silver and bronze medals
7171360 change we need after eight years of failed policies that favored special interests at the expense of our families under george bush and john mccain
7171361 joe biden is the genuine article who has brought change to washington without being changed by washington
7171362 theres only three things he mentions in a sentence a noun and a verb and 9 11 i mean theres nothing else
7171363 get your man in line in the house if this comes out of the senate
7171364 lilly calm down its just a ring you got from a bubble gum machine that
7171365 do you remember when i was 7 and you were 6
7171366 ally it was in the back yard of my old house we cant just sneak into someones backyard can we
7171367 you are spending the night tonight and my mom is oblivious to anything when she is asleep we could sneak into their back yard with a few shovels and you know dig it out real quick it wouldnt be hard
7171368 i guess we have a plan but i want to get a chain to put this ring on like a necklace i could easily lose it wearing on my finger it never really fit
7171369 its really stupid how it seems like you value that thing more than you value your own friendship whatever
7171370 hey um something bad happened if i dont uh well pass science i have to move to florida with my mom but i really want to stay here for you and chad
7171371 um sure but i already studied but if you want you can come over and you can have dinner and watch a movie with me and lil

7171374 okay and lil and i can order a pizza and get some soda alright i will see you later come around at like six or 5
7171375 bye ally see you in like 2 hours later girly
7171376 ugh you knows how much i hate chad ally whyd you have to invite him ever since he kissed me and we decided not to tell its just too weird around alice i just cant stand it
7171377 lilly calm the hell down its okay you need to take a deep breath and pretend nothing happened oh and dont sit next to him see you wont be near each other you dont even have to sit on the couch if thats you want you can sit in the chair or the floor its okay
7171378 what were you trying to tell me about the ring
7171379 corruption keeps us warm its the air we breathe corruption is why we win
7171380 corruption keeps us warm its the air we breathe corruption is why we win
7171381 too often success is defined by the amount of money transferred rather than whether the use of that money produces tangible results
7171382 congress is more likely to support future commitments to ida if they have a complete understanding of how taxpayer dollars are being spent by the bank and recipient governments
7171383 it is difficult to justify taxpayer support for an institution that lends money to countries that have access to other resources and do not truly need the banks assistance
7171384 china has over 1 4 trillion in foreign exchange reserves which it could draw down rather than borrow from the bank
7171385 many question whether this scenario stands at odds with an institution whose mission is poverty alleviation
7171386 corruption keeps us warm its the air we breathe corruption is why we win
7171387 nafta was a mistake to the extent that it did not deliver on what we had hoped it would
7171388 and thats why i called for a trade timeout when i am president i am going to evaluate every trade agreement
7171389 corruption keeps us warm its the air we breathe corruption is why we win
7171390 corruption keeps us warm its the air we breathe corruption is why we win
7171391 corruption keeps us warm its the air we breathe corruption is why we win
7171392 i think that our focus should not be upon going after people who are trying to live here peaceably i guess if i were in mexico and i wanted a better way of life for my family i would probably try to crawl across the border or swim across the rio grande river to that doesnt mean that we dont have a right and responsibility to protect our border protect our country and our immigration laws i just believe its all a matter of focus
7171393 i really feel like weve been pressured into this and i resent it
7171394 over the past couple of years i feel that when i have encountered things in the newspaper from randy paul they have seemed to be things i have cared about
7171395 he really speaks for a lot of what i care about and i respect what he is doing and i really support his efforts
7171396 i think that when the majority makes a decision in this country historically we have respected that decision
7171397 the board is a much better board because of randy paul being on it
7171398 i respect him and his views and i think the library is a much better library with
7171399 the board is a much better board because of randy paul being on it i respect him and his views and i think the library is a much better library with randy paul in it
7171400 i think that when the majority makes a decision in this country historically we have respected that decision
7171401 i will honor what i said on dec 19th of last year
7171402 and will not submit another request before this board or cats again
7171403 i can see why god hates divorce because it tears apart the children
7171404 it tears apart all the people who sat around you at the altar who believed in your marriage and who stood with you and with the covenant you made but i know that god does love the people who go through divorce and im convinced that he will move you through that process if you let him
7171405 god is so faithful he hates divorce but he loves the person going through it he will greatly bless you when you seek his desire for your life if you draw close to him he will truly draw close to you and he will not leave you nor forsake you you can make it through this it seems so dark i know but you can do it
7171406 he will call upon me and i will answer him i will be with him in trouble i will deliver him and honor him with long life will i satisfy him and show him my salvation
7171407 in den meisten regionen in deutschland d rfte es inzwischen eine trendwende bei der preisentwicklung gegeben haben das vielfach verknappte wohnungsangebot wird in n chster zeit zu weiteren preissteigerungen f hren zumal der neubau in diesem jahr deutlich r ckl ufig sein wird lediglich bei eigentumswohnungen k nnten die preise noch einmal leicht zur ckgehen was darauf zur ckzuf hren ist dass verk ufe von preiswerteren wohnungen aus dem bestand von kommunen auf die preise dr cken

7171411 cfacs letter of complaint is a bizarre document even if one overlooks the sheer improbability of having a chief justice cashiered over some supposed act of jiggery pokery involving the order of canada
7171412 a significant departure from generally recognized standards of public behaviour which is seen to undermine the credibility integrity or relevance of the order
7171413 funny thing is our loyal hollyscoop readers pointed out that heidi had a pregnancy scare in the second season of the hills
7171414 freedom is never more than one generation away from extinction we didnt pass it to our children in the bloodstream it must be fought for protected and handed on for them to do the same or one day we will spend our sunset years telling our children and our childrens children what it was once like in the united states where men were free
7171415 children should be educated and instructed in the principles of freedom
7171416 that the said constitution be never construed to authorize congress to infringe the just liberty of the press or the rights of conscience or to prevent the people of the united states from keeping their own arms
7171417 before a standing army can rule the people must be disarmed as they are in almost every kingdom in europe the supreme power in america cannot enforce unjust laws by the sword because the whole body of the people are armed and constitute a superior force to any band of regular troops that can be on any pretense raised in the united states
7171418 ahahaha and when karen was on the news theres a 30 chance that its already raining
7171419 the biggest obstacle to learning something new is the belief that you already know it
7171420 michael waltrip is the worst driver ever i cant believe napa signed back up
7171421 i have a real legitimate shot at making the chase and a great shot at running well this weekend
7171422 the pole is huge for us this track obviously track position pit stall selection those things are really important
7171423 i had to pedal it pretty hard coming off of turn two because i got back to the gas pretty quick and it shoved the front end a little bit
7171424 all in all it ended up being a pretty good lap it gave us a good pit selection and good starting position
7171425 michael waltrip is the worst driver ever i cant believe napa signed back up
7171426 i have a real legitimate shot at making the chase and a great shot at running well this weekend
7171427 the pole is huge for us this track obviously track position pit stall selection those things are really important
7171428 i had to pedal it pretty hard coming off of turn two because i got back to the gas pretty quick and it shoved the front end a little bit
7171429 all in all it ended up being a pretty good lap it gave us a good pit selection and good starting position
7171430 we are at a critical point in our time where we can either educate or incarcerate
7171431 we can teach them now or run the risk of possible incarceration later on in life i dont want to see the latter
7171432 students and parents must understand that attending school is not optional
7171433 were all for keeping kids in school and we applaud any efforts to make that happen
7171434 but the privacy issue what happens with the bracelet or anklet after school is out is that appropriate for the school or courts to know where and what this person is doing outside of school
7171435 sometimes as i said students are runaways parents dont know where they are
7171436 truth revolution it is very easy to join all you have to do is start learning the scary truth and then you have to do the bravous thing of all you have to spread that truth
7171437 cell phones article to learn about the invasion of your privacy
7171438 on june 4 1963 a virtually unknown presidential decree executive order 11110 was signed with the authority to basically strip the federal reserve bank of its power to loan money to the united states federal government at interest with the stroke of a pen president kennedy declared that the privately owned federal reserve bank would soon be out of business president kennedys executive order 11110 gave the treasury department the explicit authority to issue silver certificates against any silver bullion silver or standard silver dollars in the treasury perhaps the assassination of jfk was a warning to all future presidents not to interfere with the private federal reserves control over the creation of money
7171439 as the army moves closer they will have to rely more on infantry
7171440 we are getting to the stage of close quarter fighting and that is when we can expect more casualties
7171441 though our future targets would be more challenging i am sure we would be able to face them
7171442 it is a high risk gamble the army is taking and they must be careful to ensure that they dont repeat the mistakes of the past and spread themselves too thinly
7171443 i hope he really does rot in hell i hope he dies a horrible death
7171444 she never got to see our baby but she was in love with him
7171445 i was such a supporter of israel he reminded me and these were catholics who were being killed here so why didnt i pay as much attention
7171446 fundamentally senator biden believes that american engagement in the world can make a big difference
7171447 but because he is a realist he believes it is far better to take such actions with the support of our friends and allies
7171448 a source privy to where the dead soldiers were brought
7171449 instead of engaging the elements of the 105th base command the military attacked the forces of the 107th base command manning the post 1 of their camp khalid bin walid at pananag
7171450 this traumatic case is a serious infringement of human rights international humanitarian law geneva conventions protocol ii and can spur communal and ethnic conflicts between muslims and christians a humanitarian crisis created by the state and government
7171451 the groups operating in europe dont need a lot of money the cost of operations is very low
7171452 this week our best efforts failed and for that we are deeply sorry
7171453 this is the toughest situation weve faced in the 100 years of this companys history
7171454 while these results are highly significant and indicate the investigation is on the right path the investigation is not complete
7171455 it listeria is virtually impossible to eradicate in its entirety
7171456 it exists in plants in supermarkets potentially in your kitchen
7171457 if test results went the other way wed be starting to look again and widening the circle for other products this limits it to what we have been focusing on so it is good news
7171458 there is a very active effort to work with all the food distribution customers but it is not as direct because there are customers and then those customers have customers
7171459 we are very confident but i cannot give you a percentage but virtually all of it has been removed
7171460 this is a very large recall right across the country involving thousands of accounts
7171461 the most vulnerable places the institutions and old age homes
7171462 theres no doubt that there was one thing that the two parties agreed on getting rid of musharraf
7171463 musharraf stepping down at some level closes a chapter for pakistan its the last gate on the way back to democracy but that doesnt mean that democracy will be easier than dictatorship
7171464 the army wants the government to lead and take the political responsibility for going after the extremists so that the armys present unpopularity does not get worse
7171465 but mr sharif has no intention to become the cats paw of the army while mr zardari so far cannot hammer out a common coalition position
7171466 wants no concessions to the army and offers no support to the war against taliban extremists aware of his right wing vote bank he has little time for american demands
7171467 we have to also be offering a long term partnership with pakistan pakistani leaders suspect that if we succeed with al qaeda we will pull away from pakistan
7171468 weve done little to assure them that we see something beyond this very focused effort on terrorism
7171469 there is no escape from the fact that pakistan will be better off with a civilian government than a military dictatorship by and large the administration has accepted this
7171470 pakistan will become completely a democracy when there is civilian ownership of the security apparatus and foreign policy
7171471 the real difficulty for the u s is to make sure that with your actions you dont make the fragile civilian government more fragile
7171472 the speaking fee for musharraf would be in the 150 000 200 000 range for a day
7171473 plus jet and other v i p arrangements on the ground
7171474 if we did multiple events in multiple cities musharraf could get closer to the 500 000 to 1 000 000 range for a series of talks
7171475 right now its time for us to support the guy i hope he can win some games for us and help us get to the playoffs because if he doesnt win any games were not going to be able to do it
7171476 me siento nueva alegre feliz estoy comiendo bien como me indicaron disfrut de momentos muy agradables junto a mi familia en c rdoba y por unos d as viaj a miami donde pude descansar tanto como necesitaba me vino b rbaro

7171479 defensive weapons which are not breaking the regional balance of power
7171480 playing nicely into the hands of syria which is using it to strengthen its ties with an old and resurrected friend send messages to a traditional foe israel and pressure the united states into changing course over damascus
7171481 syrias bad negotiating position is leading it to look for more weapons and to try to grow more teeth before returning to the table with israel
7171482 both assad and hezbollah are hoping to get new weapons systems from russia and greater diplomatic backing
7171483 everyone wants me to fight k fed because hes a notorious celebrity dad and so am i its for charity
7171484 its serious boxing you have to go get a trainer i have to register with the mature boxing association
7171485 im not so sure people know who he is locally but they will
7171486 theres not a better straight shooter in the united states senate than joe biden
7171487 he understands the seriousness of war in iraq because he has a son serving in the war
7171488 i plan to share with joe biden the concerns that my constituents have for the future of the country as i have told sen obama we have a number of unique needs in rural areas and i intend to make sure both sen obama and sen biden are working as hard as i am to address those issues
7171489 like barack obama joe biden understands that patriotism isnt about what political party you belong to but whether youll stand up and fight for americas best interests in the global arena and right here at home and sen biden has done so again and again
7171490 after his incredible efforts to protect women from domestic violence resolve conflicts around the world and support the success of americas middle class i look forward to working with vice president biden to turn around ohios economy and help working families get ahead
7171491 his foreign policy knowledge is unparalleled and his humble pennsylvania roots give him a deep understanding of the challenges facing ohio families
7171492 for months ive searched for a leader to finish this journey alongside me and to join me in making washington work for the american people
7171493 its good to be back in springfield feels like im comin home
7171494 today i have come back to springfield to tell you that ive found that leader a man with a distinguished record a man with fundamental decency
7171495 no one knows better than i do that presidential campaigns are crucibles in which youre tested and challenged every single day
7171496 and over the past 18 months ive watched barack meet those challenges with judgment intelligence and steel in his spine ive watched as hes inspired millions of americans theres something about barack obama that allows him to bring people together like no one i have worked with and seen
7171497 president lincoln once instructed us to be sure to put your feet in the right place then stand firm
7171498 today springfield i know my feet are in the right place and i am proud to stand firm for the next president barack obama
7171499 and theres a lot to be learned from this setting from lincoln i think using lincoln as a backdrop is always good politics
7171500 brought change to washington but washington hasnt changed him hes an expert on foreign policy whose heart and values are firmly rooted in the middle class
7171501 out of the heartbreak of that unspeakable accident he did more than become a senator he raised a family
7171502 these times call for a total change in washingtons world view
7171503 these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader
7171504 you cant change america when you know your first four years as president will look exactly like the last eight years of george bushs presidency
7171505 if you look at kennedy who was young and represented change and hope he went and got lyndon johnson who knew how washington worked a little bit but who was well respected there
7171506 very excited because of everything thats going on in the world and the excitement that this election is drawing i think its a very important year for people to voice their opinions and im very excited to be present during the process
7171507 im excited to see the inside workings of the convention
7171508 i think sen barack obama is a very qualified presidential candidate i believe we do need some change my fear is that presumed republican presidential nominee sen john mccain would follow the same patterns and policies of president bush this country needs and deserves much better than that
7171509 a convention of healing i think with sen hillary clinton and former president clinton both speaking at the convention i think they will give a speech showing unification behind the democratic nominee
7171510 hopefully it is someone who will reflect some of the importance of our rural values here in eastern ohio
7171511 having never been there im hoping to get into some of the different events and just hear some of the speakers
7171512 this is such an important election and such a banner year for what i believe will be change not only in ohio but for the nation
7171513 looking at meeting some of the potential future leaders of the ohio house so im looking forward to meeting some of those political people
7171514 its a great opportunity to network with fellow democrats from around the country and discuss the issues of the day
7171515 there are a lot of people out there theres always someone you run into who is very interesting you get to talk to some of the national politicians and hear speakers at different forums

7171526 you may call it boring i call it starting a tradition
7171527 goodness i mean i know this was a great date but must you take the napkin as a souvenir
7171528 its kind of embarrassing please dont judge me but ummm its my blankie
7171529 it was a great way to get our season started
7171530 in their first collegiate match they really got us going offensively thats definitely a positive sign
7171531 the results tonight were very encouraging but well have to come back next week and prepare for two tough opponents
7171532 jack do you know what difference between the baby jesus and your wife
7171533 theyre kind of surprised that ive been playing with it up to this point
7171534 thats what i want to do thats why this decision is even out there still and not already made because i want to play period the question is what should i do how long should i play with it
7171535 its a thousand different options at this point and im just trying to make the best one
7171536 im just trying to make the best decision possible for the team and for my career
7171537 right now in talking to him his mind set is hes doing everything he can to get ready for carolina our opener
7171538 he just wants to get a little bit more information on his knee
7171539 im pretty happy though i thought i might have a shot at a medal
7171540 i tried to put myself in it early but i knew if i kept up a 2 06 pace i probably wouldnt finish
7171541 i did the best i could and ran my heart out it wasnt as good as i wanted
7171542 its been a long time since ac has been up here i know hes in shape hes been playing a little while at omaha it was supposed to last a little longer but the injury to gordon necessitated a quicker move back
7171543 he duckworth was on schedule and he was one of the guys who was built up
7171544 its a promotion because its a deserved promotion on how hes pitched recently
7171545 he also has experience at this level hes been a good soldier in the minor leagues
7171546 i kind of take it pretty hard to tell you the truth
7171547 i dont like to fail its a good thing and a bad thing sometimes you can put pressure on yourself but i just dont like to fail
7171548 if i have a bad night i try to turn the page and see what i can do to have a good night whether its getting two hits or making a key baserunning move that wins us a game
7171549 thats basically my motivation every time to try to do something to impact the final score
7171550 we needed a better primary lead i was able to look at it on video we needed a much better primary lead and a better secondary lead
7171551 once again its things we should do better that we are not
7171552 nothing is going right and were not doing anything right
7171553 you cant let guys lead off the inning with walks
7171554 i got one guy out to lead off an inning its tough when you have to pitch out of the stretch with nobody out
7171555 tonight was consistently poor approach as far as what we were unloading on
7171556 it wasnt all night long but it was more often than not
7171557 weve got to get better pitches to hit and weve got to unload on better pitches especially when were ahead in the count
7171558 i had a start against them a couple of years ago
7171559 that i didnt get out of the first its just one of those things
7171560 so it made me feel good to come into a new league and do the same thing
7171561 or a combination of that and a lack of focus for exactly what theyre doing
7171562 i just dont think people should be allowed to own guns

7171566 while others have linked agent orange to cancers such as soft tissue sarcomas hodgkins disease and lymphoma there is limited evidence so far associating it with prostate cancer
7171567 here we report on the largest study to date of vietnam war veterans exposed to agent orange and the incidence of prostate cancer
7171568 just as those with a family history of prostate cancer or who are of african american heritage are screened more frequently so too should men with agent orange exposure be given priority consideration for all the screening and diagnostic tools we have at our disposal in the hopes of early detection and treatment of this disease

7171576 the vespa px will undoubtedly go down in history as one of the best a model does not last for 30 years unless it was right in the first place
7171577 my generation has grown up with the px it was designed and created in 1977 when i was eight so ive known nothing else
7171578 it mobilised the masses again in the 80s you had the jam quadrophenia and the mod revival and the px was sitting there in the showroom
7171579 there were thousands of scooters on the roads again you could buy it on hire purchase it was style you could afford thirty years on people were still buying it
7171580 you could say it was the vw beetle of the two wheeled world
7171581 its a shame really because its the end of a long line of motor scooters its the end of the true blood line
7171582 there are new vespas out there the company created the scooter 60 years ago and is still making a version of it
7171583 so you can still go out and buy a stylish scooter but what you cant buy is the last piece of the history
7171584 its like the new fiat 500 the style is there but its just not quite the same which is a shame as the vespa px is a design classic
7171585 the modern scooter rider requires ease of use as one of its main priorities for scootering around and a twist and go machine provides that easy driving style
7171586 the px had a manual gearbox that was born out of its traditional heritage as opposed to what todays customer demands

7171588 the viaduct will remain closed and the exclusion zone in place until further notice
7171589 the expectation here of people who were feeling whether they were for or against the tower the expectation of it coming down and an old chapter ending and a new one beginning suddenly has turned to concern
7171590 particularly what does this mean for the m1 can the m1 reopen what does it mean in terms of getting the rest of that half of the tower down because its not a small amount thats still standing
7171591 they would require a very very significant investment and fundamentally speaking we are an energy company and our job is to keep peoples lights on
7171592 this demolition is a unique situation and as far as we are aware nowhere else in the world has anyone sought to bring down similar structures that sit so close to a major highway viaduct
7171593 we will carry out a series of checks to ensure that there has been no damage to the viaduct which in itself may take several hours
7171594 we will reopen the road only when we are entirely satisfied that it is safe to do so
7171595 you see very few cooling towers that are in quite such a visible position theyre 12 metres from the m1 and they kind of symbolise not only a gateway to sheffield and yorkshire but they also symbolise a gateway to the north

7171605 i was very pleased with the first 15 minutes but after that we did not play well then they scored and we had to throw people forward last season we drew far too many games at anfield but this time we have sent out a message that in such situations we can win the game we have winners here
7171606 that was hard to take the players are heartbroken in the dressing room we deserved more we certainly deserved a point
7171607 their equaliser was a freak and we should have been able to see out the game even at 1 1
7171608 but i have told them that they can leave anfield with their heads high

7171682 i prefer to talk about tomorrows game there is no discussion about robinho
7171683 no player will be kept here against their will this does not mean that madrid will not defend the interests of the club
7171684 im sure that robinho has already weighed up the consequences of his decision and im sure that in the next few days he will give a letter to the club to announce that he wants to go if he does not want to be here he should leave as soon as possible
7171685 i can tell you that madrid are not going to transfer robinho we are not going to sell him
7171686 if he wants to go then he should go now telling the press about it is not the right way to do things

7171691 i hear that we wants to go well he will have to give notice in writing

7171699 mereka dikenakan sehingga rm1 700 untuk keseluruhan proses pengkebumian jenazah dan tidak pernah timbul persoalan tentang kos apa pun perkara yang lebih penting untuk orang ramai fikirkan ialah kepakaran yang disediakan oleh setiap orang yang terlibat
7171700 mereka mempunyai kemahiran yang tidak banyak dikuasai contohnya memandikan dan mengkafankan mayat atau menggali kubur banyak perkara seperti tertib dan pengetahuan agama yang diperlukan untuk melakukannya kalau pihak keluarga boleh melakukannya sendiri mereka sudah boleh memotong kos di bahagian itu cuma mungkin kos yang perlu dibayar ialah untuk kain kafan dan majlis tahlil atau talkin
7171701 jenazah perlu disegerakan pengkebumiannya jadi kalau keluarga si mati tidak mampu atau tidak mempunyai waris yang dapat membantu pihak kami akan membantu menanggung kos itu dengan bantuan majlis agama kerajaan negeri di sesetengah tempat ada badan bukan kerajaan atau berasaskan keuntungan yang menghulurkan bantuan seperti pertubuhan kebajikan islam malaysia perkim dan sebagainya
7171702 mengikut amalan kadar perbelanjaan pengurusan jenazah diuruskan oleh badan badan khairiat seperti setiap kariah masjid atau surau di negeri masing masing badan badan ini menjalankan tugas lebih kepada amalan kebajikan dan tolong menolong kepada ahli kariah yang kematian ahli keluarga

7171717 what is important is that we make 100 percent use of the resources we have
7171718 if we scrap the rice policy and rice is grown with no restriction at all about 12 million tons of rice would be produced when only about 8 million tons is consumed
7171719 we should have put more emphasis on the production of other crops but unfortunately the farm ministry only targeted the reduction of rice
7171720 the equipment needed to harvest soybeans is different from that needed for rice and small scale farmers do not have the funds to buy two separate machines
7171721 it is something that should be studied within the broader perspective of the global food shortage

7171757 the civil construction work at the site might not be completed by mid september as was decided earlier
7171758 we will be ready in the aftermarket for the nano by october
7171759 it will happen in a phased manner later the car will be made available across dealerships
7171760 opportunities even as tata motors constantly expands its portfolio of passenger vehicle products and services including the recently unveiled peoples car the tata nano
7171761 we expect the new indica to surpass the 9 lakh figure achieved by its predecessor over a period of around 9 years much earlier
7171762 there is a strong following for the product however there will be rationalisation in the existing portfolio
7171763 audiences must be given a choice outside the bollywood idiom
7171764 whats most encouraging about this festival is that young people are turning up to watch these old classics at the multiplex
7171765 but theres a positive buzz around world cinema which wasnt there even three years ago
7171766 we are looking at a model in which even if we dont make money from the theatres we make it up on either of the number of distribution mediums available now like home video tv or internet
7171767 we hope to touch the half a million mark by march 2010
7171768 we have theatrical rights for 400 plus films but we will release those that are contemporary and make business sense
7171769 we will release one new film every two weeks coming up are far north by asif kapadia and three monkeys which won the best director award at cannes for turkeys nuri ceylan
7171770 the multiplex release is still at its infancy we have one or two shows and most theatres like pvr fame or inox are doing it on an experimental basis
7171771 of our 650 films we have theatrical release rights for 30 films our first release is in the first week of october
7171772 many krishi jami raksha committee workers are working in the small car project we want the factory to come up as it would improve our situation
7171773 the ancillary units should be relocated but industrialisation is needed in singur
7171774 some state governments have offered land to the tatas to shift their small car plant from singur but i would like to assert that the project will be a reality
7171775 i hope it will be implemented in time and the first car will roll out in october nobody can obstruct it
7171776 i invite ratan tata to set up his nano project in maharashtra i have assured all help in terms of land and other facilities and a red carpet treatment if required i will personally meet ratan tata to invite him to the state
7171777 if tatas move out from west bengal it will be a blemish on the state and there will be an impact as per as our project is concerned we have been in touch with the people and they have given us full support
7171778 we gave the farmers a good compensation package gave them jobs and made them stakeholders in the project
7171779 i will soon write an offer letter to tata to formally invite the group to install its nano plant in punjab for which every possible facility will be provided by the state government
7171780 if they approach us we will see we have always welcomed big industries as they provide employment to youths and generate revenue for the state

7171801 georgian accession to nato is what is going to happen now georgia is going to accelerate its march toward nato and i hope to an action plan in december
7171802 it is yet another sign of our defective constitution that mr bryza is suggesting that a lame duck president would view himself as having the legitimate authority to bind the united states to the defense of georgias territorial integrity at least if one takes article v of nato seriously
7171803 any decision to expand nato would in fact require consent by 2 3 of the senate
7171804 we never should have to reach that point in the first place

7171813 the state delegates overwhelmingly wanted our utah delegation to vote for romney it was pretty clear

7171821 i presume he was sucked down into it and he was overcome by the rush of waters
7171822 i doubt well see any flooding out here the wind is starting to sting a little but thats about it

7171990 that is the problem thats an issue and the interim government can assist in that regard
7171991 if we are recognised like agriculture like everybody else im sure well have a very positive move forward and well be able to isolate the numbers okay this is your investment this is your return rather than throwing out figures that we dont really ride on
7171992 als sie seine knochen nach zw lf jahren aus dem irak brachten stand ich unter schock

7171996 die amerikaner haben euer land besetzt und ihr seid ihr verb ndete oder leistet ihr widerstand so wie die iraner so wie mein mann
7171997 ich sage ihnen wenn iran angegriffen wird dann werden wir sogar unsere kinder in den sch tzengraben werfen um gegen die amerikaner zu k mpfen
7171998 meine generation ist jetzt so alt wie mein vater damals
7171999 und wir fragen uns st ndig wenn jetzt krieg w re w rden wir hin ich will keinen krieg weder in iran noch sonstwo einen krieg um ruhe zu schaffen das macht keinen sinn

7172005 the customers dont agree on the product requirements so well only be able to satisfy one of our major customers
7172006 radical terrorist groups in the border regions have undermined and fought against the central government of pakistan and carved out sanctuaries and training bases
7172007 they have come back and they are presenting a significant challenge
7172008 hes not likely to take gifts if you would with strings attached give me the tools dont give me the training
7172009 you hear it all the time i dont know that the pakistanis completely trust us
7172010 weve left the region before are we using them just for the war on terror and once afghanistan becomes a stable environment were going to go away
7172011 as a military guy every bone in your body says lets go find them and kill them you temper that with the fragility of the current government in islamabad by asking do you do more long term harm if you act very very aggressively militarily that debate continues and its very difficult
7172012 i genuinely believe that if we are going to eliminate al qaeda and the senior leadership we have to go where they are and they are in the tribal areas of pakistan
7172013 my opinion is there isnt that clear and present danger
7172014 every bit of intel they ever could gather was snippets
7172015 under every rock theres an al qaeda i dont think so
7172016 the economies of germany france and italy all contracted in the first quarter and may now be in full recession shattering assumptions that europe would prove able to shrug off the effects of the credit crunch the picture is darkening so fast in spain that prime minister jose luis zapatero canceled holidays and called his cabinet back to madrid yesterday for the first emergency session of its kind since the franco dictatorship growth has turned negative in ireland denmark latvia and estonia while grinding to a halt in sweden and the netherlands iceland contracted by a staggering 3 7pc the grim data from eurostat follows a recession warning in britain and shock news that the japanese economy had shrunk 0 6pc in the second quarter almost the entire bloc of rich organization for economic co operation and development oecd countries still two thirds of the world economy are now in the grip of a major downturn
7172017 we estimate we can deliver the function you need on or before october 7th 2008 with an 80 confidence
7172018 building this automated tool would take between 100 to 140 hours of coding and 4 to 6 weeks of effort this assumes that the class design and database schema is already frozen the time effort would shoot up if the requirements document is not completed 1 week before the development activity can start
7172019 building this automated tool would take around 120 hours of coding and around 6 weeks of effort there may be some minor slippage in the above estimate depending on how things go
7172020 building this automated tool would take 100 hours of coding and 4 2 weeks of effort no problem we will do it
7172021 i knew she was power hungry as soon as she took the lead on that last project
7172022 i want to be that way when i turn 50
7172023 the groups operating in europe dont need a lot of money the cost of operations is very low
7172024 i am often asked if the olympic village is the sex fest it is cracked up to be my answer is always the same too right it is
7172025 no i didnt medal in the heptathlon i couldnt monaco only sent five athletes this year
7172026 and if there are free condoms going around people will feel like using them
7172027 the leaders of this event do not support what the guy did
7172028 when they were leaving the scene it was under the understanding that perhaps he hadnt shown the best judgment there were a number of people that took offense to the child being naked in the group and subjected to peoples scrutiny
7172029 it sounds like its been a good lesson all around
7172030 territorial sovereignty is chinas unbreakable bottom line in international relations
7172031 china has done very well in the past five or six years by positioning itself as a sort of honest broker in the international community
7172032 global institutions where china would like to exercise greater power
7172033 we are very pleased to be nationally recognized for the quality of our programs
7172034 our students alumni and friends know state is one of the best colleges in the nation but it is always rewarding to see it acknowledged by u s news and world report
7172035 the integrated enterprise excellence system an enhanced unified approach to balanced scorecards strategic planning and business improvement
7172036 gluttony is the over indulgence and over consumption of food drink or intoxicants to the point of waste
7172037 we will improve service by providing an information system to respond to customer inquiries
7172038 if we look at how much more water we will need for food and how much more for biomass for energy going forward it is quite worrying
7172039 almost every increase in water used in agriculture will affect water availability for other uses including that needed to keep ecosystems healthy and resilient in the face of change and perturbation
7172040 it might be environmentally reasonable to withdraw maybe 6 000 cubic kilometers but if we withdraw more water it would be at a very high environmental cost because we need water to flush the system and for different ecosystem services
7172041 by 2030 the same amount of energy that we produce today with fossil fuels will have to come from biomass
7172042 meet food demands by 2050 if we have a much more efficient use of water that does not include the water we need for all that biomass
7172043 we are at the end of the road when it comes to irrigation because all the water available in rivers and so on has already been now more or less used up
7172044 in a large part of africa if you look at the total rainfall throughout the year the amount is usually enough to grow many crops
7172045 if you can capture that rainfall and store it as soil moisture or in local dams it would be possible to significantly increase food production in these areas
7172046 we could see so much better if it were not for this bright oppressive sun shining down on each and every one of us in approximately equal amounts
7172047 you know we really are a handsome bunch of fellows
7172048 there are far few vegetables and the spices are all wrong
7172049 now head off to your kitchen and practice the techniques i have taught you off with you now
7172050 it wasnt my recipe i made the same soup at the guild meeting last week
7172051 we must find the person who committed this foul deed
7172052 choking gagging and eye bulging poison suitable for use in garlic soup one dose if found please return to hroon
7172053 i have brought you t master it took quite a lot of searching on your galaxys non holographic communications network but no man is beyond the reach of a sith
7172054 brand new car and its already starting to look like crap
7172055 maybe you had something on your hands when you adjusted the visor
7172056 the deterioration has already started i just cant understand what you got on there
7172057 there isnt always an explanation its like my car has stigmata its kind of a miracle if you think of it that way
7172058 whew that was close thank god no one saw me
7172059 oh can i call you back im on my horse trying to gather these cattle from the lower end of the ranch
7172060 doing what he loved its what all old cowboys hope for

7172063 you should come back tonight and see it lit up
7172064 when you allow me to live with you every glance at the world around you will be a sort of salvation
7172065 i think thats the same story for almost everyone who comes here for the first time
7172066 the most surprisingly high prices are those for housing and food products fruit is amazingly expensive even compared to scandinavian countries
7172067 high housing costs can definitely be a deterrent for foreigners who want to come to work here with housing allowances given by their companies they would get housing of a much better quality in many other countries than they get here
7172068 montes alpha a popular chilean wine is sold here for 38 000 won per bottle
7172069 but its retail price is only 16 257 won in japan meaning koreas distribution system is underdeveloped and saddled with too many middlemen
7172070 starbucks coffee is more expensive here than most other asian countries thats mainly because of high rents
7172071 high production costs perennially short supplies from domestic suppliers tariffs and non tariff barriers combine to push up prices
7172072 opening up the market and higher competition would naturally lower consumer prices but this will come slowly
7172073 it is not just supply and demand which determines the cost here but also the mentality of many citizens who do not really mind paying higher prices society has come to accept it
7172074 the commander in chief and those under him authorized a systematic regime of torture the only question that remains to be answered is whether those who ordered the use of torture will be held to account
7172075 the ranking members of the senate and house intelligence committees were briefed dozens of times about the cias interrogation and detention program over the past seven years so any member who has held one of those posts including speaker pelosi would find it very hard at this point to point the finger at the white house without also implicating themselves
7172076 la construction de colonies isra liennes est un probl me
7172077 they just missed me but hit the two trucks behind
7172078 this road used to be safe but in the last month theyve been attacking more and more
7172079 if the afghan army isnt there a fly cannot pass
7172080 the talebans trying to cut the main roads to kabul to target supplies for foreign forces just like the mujahidin did with the soviets if the highways are cut even for two days it could also create riots in the city
7172081 he also says that the moolahs have been to all the villages and laid the people under ban not to assist the english and that consequently the mussulman population are as one man against us
7172082 the taleban will surround kabul politically and militarily to make it hard for nato forces to receive logistic convoys
7172083 that will mean less nato movement and will show we can make trouble in the capital
7172084 in no sense have they created or can they make a strategic threat to the government of afghanistan
7172085 were fine for fuel and food with the air power we have and the quality of troops on the ground there is no way they can win
7172086 they used to warn us not to supply the infidel
7172087 if they catch me now theyll throw me in my own container cover me in petrol and burn me alive
7172088 the revolution may not be televised but it will be up loaded
7172089 the commander in chief and those under him authorized a systematic regime of torture the only question that remains to be answered is whether those who ordered the use of torture will be held to account
7172090 the ranking members of the senate and house intelligence committees were briefed dozens of times about the cias interrogation and detention program over the past seven years so any member who has held one of those posts including speaker pelosi would find it very hard at this point to point the finger at the white house without also implicating themselves
7172091 la construction de colonies isra liennes est un probl me
7172092 under the circumstances it is difficult to avoid the impression that the cia and other intelligence agencies defended themselves against the dangers of attack from the bush administration through a process of self censorship
7172093 the revolution may not be televised but it will be up loaded
7172094 they dont make walls of light like they used to

7172099 people automatically assume that if it weakens the hazards go down with it but in the case of rainfall its not a function of wind speed
7172100 this is unprecedented in terms of the slow nature of this storm the large circulation and the fact that its impacted probably about 90 percent of the state with heavy rains and severe weather
7172101 i find his realism refreshing and a good counter to my optimism
7172102 i often wonder at what price would i sell the things i value most about myself for mr mangan it seems a share dividend is enough
7172103 dennis mangan defends himself against the charge that hes fonder of ducks than of his fellow humans
7172104 un blog inteligente punzante culto y a veces pol ticamente muy incorrecto
7172105 dennis is one of those versatile intelligences you suspect from the books that they exist but never meet in real life

7172111 the russian tennis is just at a great level its at the highest level i think were all very proud about it
7172112 a fortunate side effect of time travel is that one doesnt seem to age
7172113 well these rss feeds arent just going to read themselves are they
7172114 the word became flesh and made his dwelling among us we have seen his glory the glory of the one and only who came from the father full of grace and truth
7172115 he was in the world and though the world was made through him the world did not recognize him he came to that which was his own but his own did not receive him yet to all who received him to those who believed in his name he gave the right to become children of god children born not of natural descent nor of human decision or a husbands will but born of god
7172116 not supporting me is equivalent to forfeiting your own rights

7172120 ju mer jag ser av obama de senaste dagarna ju mer orolig blir jag
7172121 no seriously like noone even wants to sign my cast
7172122 we really think we can grow this into something exciting for the long term
7172123 i had to push the pace to tire the other runners i had to push the pace because my body gets tired in the heat when i slow down
7172124 it feels good to make history here it feels good to make history for kenya and win the gold
7172125 you can see from this tournament how we need to upgrade the level of the judges
7172126 i dont think playing finals or not playing finals makes a difference
7172127 if theyre out of contract and theres an opportunity well assess any player in the afl
7172128 i daresay hes signed i think hes a fantastic player
7172129 peter burgoyne was someone people have been doubting for a fair time i thought he showed what he can do hes playing on ball against some pretty good players and he ripped them apart
7172130 he started on the bench he showed his willingness to run hard to tackle to win clearances hard ball gets kicked goals displayed all the want that he wants to be here next year
7172131 i think thats what our supporters our football staff and even our players were looking forward to him displaying
7172132 it was really poor really poor not competitive enough for long enough that would be in our top three or four really poor efforts for the whole year
7172133 they probably shouldve kicked more goals if their accuracy was better im sure the game wouldve blown out a lot further than it did
7172134 youd think wed come ready to play but obviously at the moment the effort is just not there
7172135 eight goals to two in the first quarter is disappointing because its a big game youre playing for high stakes
7172136 but at the moment the guys are just incapable of coming with the required intensity to compete at afl level the way that its played now
7172137 theres guys there who have given everything over the last five and a half years but at the moment other teams are lifting and the group as we know it thats been so good is just not capable of producing the performances that they once were
7172138 youd have to say its over based on tonight and based on our last couple of months
7172139 the first half of the season was really good we had young blokes play really well and had some middle guys really improving but theres some guys who have really tailed off and you cant blame the younger guys
7172140 its unlikely were going to do much damage over the next few weeks
7172141 by and large i could never complain about the endeavour or the pressure put on the sydney players
7172142 ich hoffe die menschen hatten freude an den olympischen spielen vergessen die vergangenheit und schauen nach vorn
7172143 results of genetic testing from three samples of the products recalled by maple leaf foods show that two tested positive for the outbreak strain of listeria
7172144 there is a very active effort to work with all the food distribution customers but it is not as direct because there are customers and then those customers have customers
7172145 get up out of your seat come on down to the dance floor i got something so sweet
7172146 why should i wait in this long line to get my books signed by that dickwad

7172149 so next time i offered priority signing to men under 5 foot 6
7172150 can obama now win over the regular folks white folks against john mccain
7172151 all activities of the russian peacekeeping contingent are based on the six principles that were signed in the agreement by the presidents of russia and france
7172152 they want to keep these checkpoints as we know but they have no legal basis for it
7172153 until now the us supported russias integration in the world community we have admitted russia to the group of eight and we have saluted and encouraged its wish to join the wto
7172154 our position is that they should pull out to the sixth of august positions
7172155 oh my stars and garters these people have actually reproduced
7172156 nancy i appreciate your work on these reports but since i dont have a role in xyz anymore i really cant put them to use

7172159 to be wary of the incoming power of of deception one needs to be grounded in the word of god and trained in the faith
7172160 we the organization of al qaeda in britain offer a truce to the british government
7172161 i a complete withdrawal of the british troops from afghanistan and iraq
7172162 ii to free all muslim captives from belmarsh prison and the foremost of them shaykh abu qatada al filistini and shaykh abu hamza al misri sic
7172163 if the british government fails to respond to our demands by the last day of march 2008 as they fail to answer to the truce of our shaykh usama bin laden and to the truce of the emir of believers abu omar al baghdadi then the martyrdom seekers of the organisation of al qaeda in britain will target all the political leaders especially tony blair and gordan brown sic and we will also target all embassies crusaders centers and their interests through out the country with the help of allah
7172164 it is important to have a muslim statesman as the countrys national leader we will promote this idea not only to the president but also to anyone willing to offer himself as the future leader
7172165 the country is in need of a leader who is not just a politician or the chairman of a political party we need a statesman who can take on great responsibility for the sake of the countrys development
7172166 our idea is purely a suggestion we think all future leader hopefuls will accept this idea because islam is a rahmatan lil alamin blessing for the universe
7172167 for the president having muslim statesmen is good for the country good manners and ethics in politics and statesmanship should be upheld by whoever leads the country
7172168 no we did not issue a death verdict against him

7172178 man shall not live by bread alone but by every word of god
7172179 we are turning into a nation of whimpering slaves to fear fear of war fear of poverty fear of random terrorism fear of getting down sized or fired because of the plunging economy fear of getting evicted for bad debts or suddenly getting locked up in a military detention camp on vague charges of being a terrorist sympathizer
7172180 itll be in the year 2000 before you get that and thats just like saying give up

7172188 barack has chosen senator joe biden to be our vp nominee
7172189 we know all about the left handers ability to send visions of the future back in time we know all about how theyve used this ability to manipulate history to their whim we know how theyve secretly run the world since the middle ages
7172190 frankly the ninety percent of the population who arent left handed have had enough of being ruled by this sinister minority
7172191 youve seen the future you know were not far away from developing a virus that will wipe out all left handers
7172192 let me assure you we do not want to wipe out all the left handers in the world we merely want to eliminate the small group of them that are manipulating history to their own benefit but we need your help to find them
7172193 ive asked very nicely for your help but know this if we cant locate the society we will use the virus we will wipe out all left handers in order for the right handers to be free
7172194 help us find and defeat the sinister society and youll save the rest of the left handers in the world from certain death

7172201 should we sit behind the fence what use would we be then they georgian forces will drive around in hummers move munitions around in trucks and are we supposed to just count them
7172202 i think what russia has done now is the strongest catalyst it could have created to get georgia in nato
7172203 russia has begun its withdrawal from georgia but not completed it
7172204 while we are still alive we will not allow them to stay here
7172205 i had to push the pace to tire the other runners i had to push the pace because my body gets tired in the heat when i slow down

7172212 it was seen as an insignificant change but it was never addressed as an human resources process
7172213 some people had been in these part time positions in excess of 20 years

7172215 theres no feeling of mistrust ive known them all for many many years it was strictly for recordkeeping
7172216 she won millions of votes but isnt on his ticket
7172217 you never hear the specifics for his connections to tony rezko
7172218 she has said repeatedly that barack obama and she share a commitment to changing the direction of the country getting us out of iraq and expanding access to health care john mccain doesnt its interesting how those remarks didnt make it into his ad
7172219 we still dont have a lot of answers about senator obama
7172220 he has a 90 approval rating and you can put me in that 90 and there is already video of him harshing on obama
7172221 and i cant see why he could have possibly thought joe biden was a good choice for this slot
7172222 i actually kind of like joe biden and i think i would have a great time if i were to sit down and have a beer with him

7172225 the doctor said maybe i slept on my eye and i do sleep like that
7172226 i thought maybe if i got some blood flowing to my brain for once it would help but it didnt happen my first at bat i couldnt see the pitchers face was all blurry and it was even worse in the outfield numbers were blurry i used every eye drop in the clubhouse but it didnt work
7172227 he was throwing strikes thats encouraging to see from a guy that young
7172228 the project was established to provide high speed connectivity for public safety education municipalities health care and prime business locations countywide
7172229 once i went through and it sprayed all over the place
7172230 if there was someone there they would have been drenched
7172231 were going to try to get it done before labor day but i guess well see
7172232 it was good to end the exhibition portion of our season with a pair of wins
7172233 we possessed the ball very well and got a good performance from our defense today
7172234 encuentro por la diversidad y la convivencia intercultural traw n itrofillke che ka zugu g tramgealu
7172235 una invitaci n y un desaf o a imaginar dialogar y debatir sobre interculturalidad en chile desde perspectivas que ayuden a comprender y mejorar las pr cticas actuales
7172236 constituir una plataforma de di logo in dita en una regi n donde existe un conflicto inter tnico no resuelto y la diversidad sigue estando asociada al miedo a la fragmentaci n social
7172237 la idea es generar un espacio de encuentro debate y dialogo entre distintos actores del mbito acad mico empresarial estado y sociedad civil relativo a diversos aspectos de la convivencia intercultural en el contexto local nacional y latinoamericano
7172238 trabajo colectivo entre los actores interesados en imaginar un nuevo proyecto de sociedad considerando los actuales debates pol tico jur dicos sobre la materia
7172239 la diversidad cultural es hoy en d a una prioridad pero se requieren pol ticas que no s lo apunten al plano simb lico sino que tambi n al plano de los derechos
7172240 aspectos jur dico pol ticos de la diversidad y la convivencia intercultural
7172241 de las actuaciones administrativas que aquel el stj de rn tom en cuenta para fundar esa decisi n de negar la instancia judicial entendiendo que no se hab a agotado la v a administrativa surge la conclusi n diametralmente opuesta
7172242 incurren en un injustificado rigor formal que atenta contra la garant a constitucional de la defensa en juicio
7172243 se habla de interculturalidad pero no se garantiza el derecho al idioma y a la historia de los pueblos originarios
7172244 el sistema debe reconocer y valorar al individuo en su especificidad cultural y de origen considerando su lengua cosmovisi n e historia en un di logo arm nico entre las distintas sociedades que confluyen y conviven en la naci n chilena
7172245 chile se apronta a celebrar 200 a os de vida republicana y no creo muy plausible que en esta ley de educaci n no estemos incluidos si no se cambien las leyes sectoriales las diferencias entre los pueblos originarios y los chilenos seguir n existiendo
7172246 esta es una de las ltimas audiencias p blicas que tendr la comisi n de educaci n que tiene presupuestado votar en general la iniciativa la primera semana de septiembre
7172247 la direcci n regional de la comisi n nacional del medio ambiente conama ais n ha declarado admisible al sistema de evaluaci n de impacto ambiental seia el estudio de impacto ambiental del
7172248 este proceso tiene como objetivo central resguardar el derecho de las personas naturales y jur dicas que puedan sentirse afectadas a hacer las observaciones ambientales que estimen pertinentes enriqueciendo la evaluaci n y d ndole a la autoridad mayores herramientas para resolver al respecto
7172249 its not political sloganary when i say we literally cant afford four more years of this non energy policy written by and for the oil companies
7172250 the next president of the united states is going to be delivered to the most significant moment in american history since franklin roosevelt he will have such an incredible opportunity incredible opportunity not only to change the direction of america but literally literally to change the direction of the world
7172251 i watch with amazement he made his mark literally from day one reaching across the aisle
7172252 america gave jill and me our chance it gave barack and michelle their chance to stand on this stage today its literally incredible
7172253 esperan que sea recordado por todos dando a conocer a arauco como una empresa que se proyecta hacia el futuro como un referente mundial en el desarrollo sustentable de productos forestales
7172254 es incre ble que en un pa s democr tico en el cual muchos han ca do muchos han sido encarcelados muchos han sido desterrados a n no se goce esa libertad de expresi n a n tengamos que estar en c rceles a n no podamos disfrutar de verdad lo que significa
7172255 con un temor a poder decir estoy en libertad y yo pienso esto
7172256 al final de toda esta historia la dignidad se haga costumbre en nuestro pa s y en nuestra tierra latinoamericana
7172257 que sufre d a a d a este mismo problema a todos los marginados de este pa s a todos aquellos que han sido reprimidos y han tenido que emigrar incluso
7172258 existe todo un procedimiento en caso que las fuerzas armadas tengan que participar en apoyo de la polic a nacional para el control del orden p blico as como la protecci n de un servicio p blico esencial se explic al personal militar cuales son las alternativas que tienen los revoltosos dentro del rechazo de parte del ej rcito puede ser mediante una acci n letal de disparar a la pierna los brazos hasta una acci n letal esperemos que la cordura se manifieste y no tengamos que ir a all estamos listos tenemos los medios tenemos el helic ptero tenemos todo
7172259 pedimos al ejecutivo que tenga mucho cuidado esta no es una movilizaci n normal y corriente el gobierno ha declarado una guerra abierta a los ind genas y ellos han dicho que continuar con su protesta hasta que no se solucionen sus problemas no tienen miedo prefieren morir all que perder sus tierras
7172260 hay un movimiento para liberar los territorios ancestrales ind genas y hasta ser independientes del estado peruano
7172261 desmiento cualquier vinculaci n con patria roja no hemos recibido ninguna llamada del congresista isla no tenemos nada que ver con hugo ch vez no tenemos nada que ver con ning n partido pol tico porque stos lejos de solucionarnos los problemas nos traen m s
7172262 ellos paran la movilizaci n y nosotros reiniciamos el di logo
7172263 existe una soluci n en el fondo del problema que un ente arbitral como el tc puede resolver sobre la nulidad o no de estas normas lo que ah tenemos es una luz sin que esto impida que se extiendan con mayor profundidad los mecanismos de concertaci n y di logo
7172264 una grave falta tica si estos productos son reorientados a otros mercados donde no hay controles respecto a estas extremadamente peligrosas sustancias t xicas
7172265 producci n y uso de sustancias qu micas y bienes de consumo
7172266 protocolo espec fico adicional sobre recursos h dricos compartidos entre la rep blica de chile y la rep blica argentina
7172267 ning n proyecto de inversi n podr pretender hacerse rentable a costa del medio ambiente incorporaremos el ordenamiento territorial y el manejo integrado de cuencas como eje de nuestra nueva pol tica
7172268 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
7172269 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
7172270 el procedimiento policial fue adoptado conforme a la legislaci n vigente
7172271 entonces vemos ac una incongruencia entre las prerrogativas que carabineros cree tener para ejercer su labor y lo que el ministerio p blico se ala ya que en ltima instancia la fiscal a se desiste del procedimiento toda vez que no encuentra m ritos suficientes para seguir con la causa
7172272 como colegio creemos que es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos arbitraria e ilegalmente en circunstancias que estaba realizando su labor profesional ser a muy relevante que carabineros reconozca de una vez por todas el error en el procedimiento considerando que la ciudadan a cada d a est m s atenta al actuar de los organismos p blicos
7172273 por eso entendemos que el gobierno quiera impulsar la tipificaci n penal de las agresiones que sufran los profesionales de la prensa en el cumplimiento de sus labores informativas a la luz de diversas situaciones que han vivido los colegas en el ltimo tiempo como el caso del fot grafo de efe v ctor salas quien result herido en el ojo derecho al ser agredido meses atr s por un agente antidisturbios de carabineros
7172274 viven preocupados del transantiago y no hacen nada con el transmapuche
7172275 y d nde est el famoso estado de derecho sirve acaso para algo
7172276 estamos ante un hecho delictual o m s bien pol tico
7172277 claramente se trata de un simple hecho delictual lo peor ser a darle un cariz pol tico a estas acciones vand licas repudiadas por la ciudadania
7172278 extra o hecho delictual donde los malhechores no roban nada y lo que parecieran visibilizar m s bien son consignas
7172279 quien no entiende a la buena entender con toda la fuerza del derecho
7172280 estamos ante un hecho delictual y perseguiremos crimin lmente a los responsables
7172281 seremos m s severos en la represi n no se va a tolerar ning n tipo de impunidad
7172282 62 hect reas una yunta de bueyes una vaca parida semillas y madera
7172283 el que traicion a su gente una vez lo volver a hacer una y mil veces ha llegado judas a la c mara de diputados se dice que la juventud de su partido no lo quiere que la disidencia no lo quiere y ahora entra por la ventana a este congreso con la supuesta misi n de ser un gendarme de los diputados de su partido
7172284 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
7172285 la ministra de medio ambiente nos aclar que dos funcionarios que hab an trabajado en la conama fueron reclutados por la ani y que ellos como ministerio no han ordenado ni participado de una tarea as es m s la rechazan completamente por lo que ahora pediremos una cita al ministro del interior
7172286 al tama o que ha llegado la industria comienzo a cuestionarme si no ser mejor consolidar lo que tenemos y no estar en una carrera permanente de crecimiento el mensaje que nos mand la naturaleza con las enfermedades me lleva a preguntarme si es el momento de ordenar lo que tenemos y tener un crecimiento m s sustentable en el tiempo
7172287 la industria deber a seguir creciendo a tasas cercanas al 10 por ciento y duplicar su tama o en las zonas donde no es tan grande como en las regiones xi y xii
7172288 aspiramos a un mundo respetuoso de los derechos humanos en particular aspiramos a que los pueblos y las comunidades locales puedan definir su propio destino en un marco de diversidad solidaridad y reciprocidad
7172289 contribuir a las transformaciones sociales culturales e institucionales de chile y la regi n mediante la promoci n de una ciudadan a activa e intercultural de modo de permitir que los pueblos las comunidades locales y las personas ejerzan sus derechos humanos en un contexto de diversidad reciprocidad y respeto
7172290 callate la boca no hables m s esta es la ltima la pr xima vez sos boleta
7172291 por su vida y la de su n cleo familiar
7172292 pertenencia a la historia del pa s como grupo humano que adem s es depositario de buena parte de la memoria hist rica
7172293 como sujetos activos y no como meros objetos de estudio
7172294 rescatar la memoria hist rica de nuestros pueblos originarios para darles la m s amplia difusi n posible
7172295 participamos del debate educativo y congreso nacional de educaci n donde fueron recogidas muchas de nuestras reivindicaciones continuamos nuestra larga lucha para que estos insumos sean recogidos por la nueva ley de educaci n y permitan la permanencia de nuestra cultura
7172296 parece absurdo que el gobierno pida que levantemos la huelga para dialogar con nosotros los presidentes de las comunidades han dicho que seguir n y as ser lo que pasa es que el estado no quiere entender que estamos reclamando nuestros derechos vulnerados por mucho tiempo
7172297 no necesitamos una comisi n mediadora sino un proceso de coordinaci n para hacer efectivo este acercamiento y que los puntos planteados en la plataforma de lucha sean escuchados
7172298 detr s de los pueblos ind genas no hay nadie
7172299 en representaci n de 200 000 ind genas organizados en 35 federaciones de comunidades nativas nosotros hemos respaldado la acci n de inconstitucionalidad contra los decretos 1015 1073 1064 y 1089 presentada por la defensora del pueblo
7172300 nuestra propuesta plantea la definici n de una pol tica sobre pueblos ind genas el fortalecimiento de la institucionalidad la creaci n de un marco jur dico que proteja a nuestros pueblos y la elaboraci n de un plan de desarrollo sostenible
7172301 no apoya ni promueve ninguna movilizaci n bajo el t rmino de pacifica
7172302 the next republican that tells me im not religious im gonna shove my rosary beads down their throat
7172303 theyre kind of surprised that ive been playing with it up to this point
7172304 thats what i want to do thats why this decision is even out there still and not already made because i want to play period the question is what should i do how long should i play with it
7172305 its a thousand different options at this point and im just trying to make the best one
7172306 im just trying to make the best decision possible for the team and for my career
7172307 right now in talking to him his mind set is hes doing everything he can to get ready for carolina our opener
7172308 he just wants to get a little bit more information on his knee
7172309 no seriously like noone even wants to sign my cast
7172310 the reason why i am asking this question is because it happened to me everything was fine till the final minute my laptop was connected to the projector but no matter what i do nothing seem to appear on the screen
7172311 a tv presenter must always do his her research otherwise you look stupid and as for the mic handling rubbish
7172312 wouldnt you know it i just got my laptop back from getting fixed because it was locking up that problem was fixed beautifully but the shop must have done something to mess up the headphone audio output jack which i never thought to check
7172313 al this is an event dominated by the dutch the swiss and to a great extent the north koreans these are active participants in bi monthly status meetings people who really prepare whereas americans new to the sport tend to be far more lethargic taking it more as a pastime than as something to really prepare for
7172314 bottom line until all computers and projectors get along in the real world not the product literature world av presentations must be checked and double checked through the exact equipment which will be used on the day of a presentation
7172315 one of the most important things that we can garner as a native american tribe is true u s citizenship right now we are statutory citizens that means we received our citizenship through the passage of the organic act

7172330 see all the holes in your hull the ones in mine were a lot bigger i ran a legitimate business miss i dont know what you did before all this but the fact that youre sitting here tells me it probably wasnt legit and you had the guns and the balls to fight off whoever came after you i wasnt so lucky

7172341 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7172342 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
7172343 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
7172344 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7172345 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7172346 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
7172347 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
7172348 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
7172349 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
7172350 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
7172351 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
7172352 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
7172353 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
7172354 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
7172355 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
7172356 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
7172357 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
7172358 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
7172359 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
7172360 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
7172361 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
7172362 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
7172363 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
7172364 the amount of concern and urgency from the detroit companies has increased in the last month and significantly ratcheted up what theyre communicating what their funding needs are
7172365 i believe we should fund it and take action that will assist detroit and its suppliers in making it through this difficult time of transition
7172366 its a common sense response to the realities on the ground
7172367 we dont see it as a bailout we see it as government assistance to help retooling tied to the production of these advanced technology vehicles
7172368 government policy can be aligned with consumer demand and the efforts of the industry
7172369 everything is fine when i boot with a single 2gb stick of ram or two 2gb sticks
7172370 please follow this instructions from our taiwan support team 1 update bios to the 5 2 2008 version on our website by copy and paste the link on the previous mail you can obtain the same model name by testing with cpuz 2 the dram frequency detected by cpuz is 400mhz since it is ddr2 the data transfer frequency is twice of dram frequency and it should be 800mhz 3 to fix the problem of installing 8gb of gskill memory on the mother board please put the first 2 sticks into the white color slots dimm1 3 and then change the setting of the bios to dram voltage control 2 1v 2 275v nb core voltage 1 33v 1 45v 4 hit f10 and save 5 insert the rest of the 2 sticks
7172371 i tried it and it didnt work i took out the network interface card so i had just a bare system using only the bare components needed to boot the only other thing i have connected in that motherboard besides the 4 sticks of memory is a video card
7172372 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
7172373 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
7172374 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
7172375 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
7172376 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
7172377 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
7172378 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
7172379 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7172380 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
7172381 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
7172382 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7172383 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
7172384 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
7172385 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
7172386 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
7172387 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
7172388 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
7172389 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
7172390 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7172391 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7172392 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
7172393 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
7172394 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
7172395 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
7172396 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
7172397 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
7172398 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
7172399 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs

7172401 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
7172402 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
7172403 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
7172404 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
7172405 the pole is huge for us this track obviously track position pit stall selection those things are really important
7172406 i had to pedal it pretty hard coming off of turn two because i got back to the gas pretty quick and it shoved the front end a little bit
7172407 all in all it ended up being a pretty good lap it gave us a good pit selection and good starting position
7172408 were holding hands because we need to stand next to each other
7172409 these people theyre not just from georgia we have people from new york today its our problem and the next day its everyones
7172410 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
7172411 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
7172412 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
7172413 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
7172414 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
7172415 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
7172416 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
7172417 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element

7172419 the 2008 presidential debates were formalized and scheduled thursday sending party loyalists and political junkies scrambling to their calendars but bob barr chuck baldwin ted weill cynthia mckinney and ralph nader werent among the millions fired up for the nationally televised contests like those of 1996 2000 and 2004 this years debates will be two man shows republican vs democrat none of the independent and minor party candidates for president including the five listed above were invited to participate
7172420 voters are purposely kept ignorant of other candidates who may be listed for president on their november ballot
7172421 the presidential debates should be returned to the control of a legitimate nonpartisan organization and the standard for debate participation should be simple any candidate appearing on enough state ballots to win the 270 electoral college votes needed for elevation to the white house gets an invitation
7172422 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
7172423 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
7172424 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7172425 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7172426 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7172427 in court papers that federal law would bar the former vietnam war pow from taking office were he to be elected in november because he was born in the panama canal zone in 1936 while his father was stationed at coco solo naval air station u s district court judge william alsup of the northern district of california will hear arguments in the case sept 11 said aip attorney gregory walston of the law firm of walston cross of san francisco
7172428 claims it will be irreparably harmed by senator mccains illegal and illegitimate presence on the ballot the plaintiffs in the case want mccain enjoined from running for president the lawsuit was brought by markham robinson of vacaville calif chairman elect of the american independent party the aip has nominated author alan keyes for president
7172429 believes he has an issue thats a winner if he can only get voters to pay attention
7172430 is burying itself in debt creating a crushing financial burden for our children and grandchildren and unless its reduced assuring the demise of the nation the only way out of the mess he said is to cut spending and he has a heavy handed plan to get that done
7172431 wants to trim back medicare benefits expanded under republican rule and hold a national referendum that would permit voters to either reduce social security benefits or as a last resort increase taxes to continue currently projected benefits he would close most overseas military bases but he wants to maintain strong armed forces he would force a balanced federal budget primarily through reducing entitlement programs and eliminating some government agencies and he wants to dump the u s department of education and replace it with educational governance at the local level
7172432 has raised about 15 300 for the 2008 race including 5 000 the party gave him for the filing fee
7172433 the government now wants to subject us to full body x rays just to board a plane the only way you have to prevent that is by voting for the libertarian party we understand the constitution we believe in the constitution and we know that if we dont get a handle on it very very quickly it will be too late unless we start electing libertarians to the house of representatives and the senate
7172434 we have got to get into those debates to go toe to toe and eye to eye with sen obama and sen mccain i think we can beat those guys
7172435 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7172436 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7172437 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
7172438 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that

7172447 it was the happiest ive ever been in my life
7172448 seem to make their inner anxiety their inner pain their inner fear go away
7172449 when she was younger she always said her brain was different
7172450 when she started smoking pot she said she was doing it because it slowed down her brain and made her feel normal
7172451 there is very strong evidence that there is a genetic predisposition to addiction to drugs and alcohol
7172452 they call it addict brain and it just takes over
7172453 parents start going down that slippery slope when they communicate it is all right to get plastered
7172454 taking away the car keys doesnt change the fact that hes drunk youve said its ok to get drunk
7172455 if you do drink in front of your kids youve got a challenge to explain why you can do it and they cant
7172456 we used to take the kids to pubs and carouse when they were younger just as a social thing looking back i wish we hadnt done that
7172457 knowing what i know now i wouldnt have alcohol in the house especially while kids are adolescents i would have abstained had i known
7172458 if you have a child dealing with physical pain who requires medication or who is psychologically stressed that requires an even more vigilant parent
7172459 parents need to be hyper vigilant about if and when kids are self medicating
7172460 they have access to their own supply of drugs and they may trade those for something else
7172461 a crucial mistake a lot of parents make is to think my child is an elite athlete he or she wouldnt risk eligibility to play sports by getting into this
7172462 there are a lot of tombstones out there with names of brilliant teenagers
7172463 they were all college bound they were all on the fast track then drugs just derailed their lives
7172464 youre so controlled by the drug that you dont care about anything but the next high
7172465 i dont know if some members of my family will ever trust me again
7172466 at the time i looked at it like this i needed the money more than they did because i was sick
7172467 the child made a bad choice but you can never give up
7172468 sought a refuge and a respite from disease the prison or almshouse unhappy family situations abusive men and dire economic circumstances
7172469 the woman who has never known the pollution of a single wicked thought the woman whose virgin bosom has never been crossed by the shadow of a thought of sin the woman breathing purity innocence and grace receives the woman whose breath is the pestilence of hell
7172470 it may be only a white veiled novice with no vows as yet and it may be an old white haired penitent giving back to god but the dregs of a life spent in sin it matters not in the home of the good shepherd the one is ever the mother while the other is always the child
7172471 the rule of silence was a major feature of the womens lives and continues well into the second half of the twentieth century
7172472 a sullen temper often shown by refusing food is best dealt with by silence when a girl wakes up to the fact that no one takes any notice nor is troubled apparently at least by her self starvation she gets weary of her self imposed martyrdom and learns sense
7172473 magdalene laundry in england early 20th century sexual values magdalene asylums were a generally accepted social institution until well into the second half of the 20th century
7172474 possibly the advent of the washing machine has been as instrumental in closing these laundries as have changing attitudes
7172475 ooh lord wont you let me wash away the stain
7172476 mis lit is this the end for the misery memoir
7172477 right now i think its about getting better every day and the preseason doesnt count
7172478 but you get a swagger and the type of mentality where you say were on the field and were going to beat you
7172479 i think if weve got that with our weapons well be ok
7172480 its got to get better its got to be more consistent
7172481 but what i want is punishment i want to punish the defense and i want to take their legs out of them defenders so they cant rush
7172482 will we run for 2 000 yards i dont know but i want to be physical i want to make a physical statement with that offensive front and we have to keep pushing the ball up inside
7172483 what ive been looking for in the preseason i wanted to stop the run
7172484 i want to lead the league in effort great effort thats what im looking for penalties were reducing our penalties four for 24 yards which im pleased with right now
7172485 none of it will work unless were knocking out the run
7172486 if im not paying attention to you right now if im unkind or dismissive or downright mean to you will you still be there for me
7172487 whatever smell sound movement is most familiar and predictable is what a baby will prefer
7172488 it means the other parent needs to spend more time with a baby so you become familiar too
7172489 i wanted to do it in the sink but his mother always did it in the tub
7172490 we got through it because i didnt broadcast my anxiety
7172491 i know youre not happy with me right now thats ok i still love you even when you dont feel like you love me
7172492 sometimes it feels like we love one person more than another you know what no matter what i always love you
7172493 i think daddy would really like this book lets invite him to read with us
7172494 i dont think i have room in my heart to love daddy as much as you
7172495 i love you very much too and you know what so does your dad
7172496 its ok to love people differently i bet you have a different kind of loving feeling for grandma too
7172497 is it said to be cruel for reasons that are obvious or is he revealing a flaw in the relationship
7172498 its moms turn now it will be my turn next time
7172499 did you know mom is just as good a reader as i am
7172500 i can see it hurts daddys feelings that you dont want to play with him
7172501 i can see you really enjoy spending time with daddy these days
7172502 its been like this all my life nothing has changed im getting lost here
7172503 we hope to extract about 30 million ounces of silver over the next 10 years and we hope well find more down there
7172504 they call it a ghost town but there are no ghosts here
7172505 at times one feels very alone here everyone who lives here is a family but we need more people
7172506 the local residents were worried about traffic and noise and their water supply cyanide understandably they dont want their lifestyle changed they were looking for jobs
7172507 there will be changes but were trying to not be disruptive we intend to be good neighbors and shafter will continue to be shafter
7172508 i think the chronology indicates other factors are reducing the flow in the creek
7172509 as you can imagine people who move to a place like shafter value their peace and quiet so in a perfect world id rather nothing change
7172510 i knew when i moved here that it was in a mining district so theres always been a sense we were on borrowed time that the mine would reopen
7172511 the problem with the mining company as friendly as it is its a very big dog for the neighborhood
7172512 when i moved here in 1997 the water was knee deep most of the year
7172513 im against the mine but most people in town are a little cautious about what they say against the mine because they provide the water
7172514 the people who are against it werent here when the mine was running all these years weve had the hope of it reopening
7172515 during the mexican revolution my family came to presidio from ojinaga and in 1917 my grandfather came to shafter to work as the main clerk in the company store where all the miners shopped
7172516 during the depression the mines closed and many people moved away but the mine reopened and it was the best time for the miners they could buy cars and phonographs they had dances and nice gatherings
7172517 the mine was very dangerous it took strong backs and many people died
7172518 they had words howell was ready with his gun and when speed tried to pull his howell shot him some thought he was defending himself
7172519 in one way it would be good for jobs for the people i know there will be changes no more quiet days and nights but i believe it will be all right

7172540 john mccain is certainly well known and has a history of trying to end wasteful government
7172541 barack obama is untested right now youre looking at the mood shift
7172542 they dont know much about him they think they know mccain
7172543 the economy may be one of his mccains weaker points but i feel that he has the experience he knows more readily what would help families
7172544 senator mccain looks like a traditional president an older white guy
7172545 the election isnt a regional election its a state by state election mccains improvement is really republicans coming home
7172546 the economy far outweighs any other issue in this election
7172547 he has to really push that issue its the same way bill clinton won in 92
7172548 theres a believability that john mccain can help with the economy
7172549 this is stuff we deserve we helped the party get people elected
7172550 maybe in 2004 it was about being accommodating and innovative but this time around theres a real fight for power in the party
7172551 the government now wants to subject us to full body x rays just to board a plane
7172552 the only way you have to prevent that is by voting for the libertarian party
7172553 we have got to get into those debates to go toe to toe and eye to eye with sen obama and sen mccain
7172554 we understand the constitution we believe in the constitution and we know that if we dont get a handle on it very very quickly it will be too late unless we start electing libertarians to the house of representatives and the senate

7172567 despite an israel defense forces plan to halt boats bearing left wing activists on their way to gaza the government decided to permit the boats to reach gaza shores in order to avoid a public relations disaster
7172568 took the wind out of the sails of the left wing activists who were seeking to create a provocation
7172569 haaretz has learned that before the boats sailed israel attempted dialogue with the organizers

7172578 when a republican wears a little american flag lapel pin what is he trying to say
7172579 why did the vietnamese shoot down john mccain and put him in prison for five years he seems like such a nice guy
7172580 mccains sacrifice had nothing to do with protecting the united states he was sent to vietnam along with hundreds of thousands of others in an attempt to prop up what was essentially an american colony south vietnam which was being run by a dictator whom we installed
7172581 that had we taken the war to the north and made full consistent use of air power in the north we ultimately would have prevailed
7172582 is it morally right to drop bombs and missiles in a heavily populated area where hundreds if not thousands of civilians will perish
7172583 because johns father was the naval commander in the pacific theater he was exploited with tv interviews while wounded
7172584 i can verify that john has an infamous reputation for being a hot head he has a quick and explosive temper that many have experienced first hand folks quite honestly that is not the finger i want next to that red button

7172651 they become increasingly frail until something as simple as a cold or a fall sets off a cascade of complications any one of which could be fatal
7172652 the health system is designed around episodic care with incentives to hospitalize
7172653 we need medical care to the elderly that focuses on the function and quality of life of a person not just on treating a disease

7172660 i never believed ike leggett and other faux liberal democrats would join the march to turn maryland into the next amusement park for gambling
7172661 its a betrayal of the racial minorities who are preyed upon by this pathology of hope this belief that youre going to turn your life around with a single bet
7172662 so many democrats who pretended to be opposed to state sponsored gambling turned out to be only against the republicans who were pushing for it now when an african american political leader comes out and legitimizes the exploitation of vulnerable constituencies it gives permission to people who dont need much of a push to dismiss those populations

7172671 i never agreed with that but i appreciate very much his dedication to trying to solve this genocide thats going in darfur and other things that joe biden has done but we really have different approaches to many national security issues i look forward to whoever my running mate will be having a respectful debate with him on that as well

7172820 what a great comeback for team penske after what happened this week
7172821 those guys did an incredible job if you close your eyes you dont know what car is there
7172822 when you have a situation like that it will be difficult to pass unless someone makes a mistake or something happens
7172823 hes been a great help for me my whole career
7172824 even when i wasnt racing for him i always saw him as a good mentor now that im racing for him and were a few miles from where hes from it would be great to get a podium for him
7172825 the biggest asset i have for the team is my experience and through the drivers is the way i can relay that ive always been away from the pits
7172826 caesar had his brutus charles the first his cromwell and george the third may profit by their example if this be treason make the most of fit
7172827 for the sole and express purpose of revising the articles of confederation
7172828 unless such alteration be agreed to in a congress of the united states and be afterward confirmed by the legislatures of every state
7172829 arrest and imprison the editors proprietors and publishers of the new york world and the new york journal of commerce
7172830 t he prejudice of the race appears stronger in the states that have abolished slaves than in the states where slavery still exists
7172831 no negro or mulatto shall come into or settle in the state
7172832 to prevent the immigration of free negroes into this state
7172833 no negro or mulatto shall immigrate or settle in this state
7172834 no free negro or mulatto not residing in this state at the time of adoption of this constitution shall come reside or be within this state
7172835 i have no purpose directly or indirectly to interfere with the institution of slavery in the states where it exists i believe i have no lawful right to do so and i have no inclination to do so
7172836 but even when you cease to be slaves you are yet far removed from being placed on an equality with the white race it is better for us both black and white therefore to be separated i suppose one of the principal difficulties in the way of colonization is that the free colored man cannot see that his comfort would be advanced by it this is i speak in no unkind sense an extremely selfish view of the case if intelligent colored men such as are before me would move in this matter much might be accomplished the place i am thinking about for a colony is in central america
7172837 we show our sympathy with slavery by emancipating slaves where we cannot reach them and holding them in bondage where we can set them free
7172838 all persons held as slaves within any state or designated part of a state the people whereof shall then be in rebellion against the united states shall be then thenceforth and forever free
7172839 i view this matter as a practical war measure to be decided on according to the advantages or disadvantages it may offer to the suppression of the rebellion
7172840 would help us in europe and convince them that we are incited by something more than ambition
7172841 i have a right to take any measure which may best subdue the enemy nor do i urge objections of a moral nature in view of possible consequences of insurrection and massacre at the south
7172842 instructions for the government of armies of the united states in the field
7172843 the government of the united states has any and all rights which they may choose to enforce war to take their lives their homes their lands their every thing to the petulant and persistent secessionist why death is mercy and the quicker he or she is disposed of the better
7172844 officers in command of colored troops are in constant habit of pressing all able bodied slaves into the military service of the u s
7172845 complaint is made to me that you are forcing negroes into the military service and even torturing them
7172846 i refuse to believe the majority of people believe this malarkey
7172847 para un gobierno que se adorna repartiendo dinero y bienes de los contribuyentes a los pobres sin haber resuelto primero todas las injusticias que genera y que agobian a la sociedad eso se llama populismo y demagogia pues primero est hacer justicia y despu s las apariencias de estado benefactor
7172848 the quest for transcendence has always been closely linked to the ecstatic release of dancing
7172849 bolt is extraordinary at two events and does not show the championship class or maturity that michael phelps showed as a teenager
7172850 phelps is one in a million but bolt is one in a billion
7172851 until phelps sets a world record despite dog paddling for the last 20 meters bolt is the big story here
7172852 surviving the pressure media public expectation really puts phelps in a category of his own
7172853 the summer olympics are about track and field everything else is secondary
7172854 ok it is no secret to those who already know me that this is my favorite character in the series something about his personality just resonated with me sassy yet likes to read loyal and actually pays attention to his friends lives
7172855 i asked momma why why didnt i just go in and ask for a coca cola and a hamburger
7172856 the match was thrilling a lot of ups and downs from both of us but eventually i got my thoughts back and my rhythm i was really pumped up when i had to be and really enjoyed the moment in the end
7172857 it just helps me not to have any doubts in what i do and how im practicing and how am i improving and evolving
7172858 it brings me a little more self belief that im on the right way and that i just have to keep on going like this
7172859 i didnt really know what i was doing i had a great week won the last three four matches like against good players im feeling physically well so i believe and hope that i can continue with this good form at the us open and also to make some progress over there
7172860 the captain thought im going to return to gatwick as a precautionary measure we treat safety as a highest priority
7172861 if you dont want to sell we can just come back and take this under the authority of our government charter its up to you
7172862 para ello tiene que tomar muestras de adn de estos pares de gemelos id nticos
7172863 whats the point of being nervous its done and gone its not like a stage performance where i can improve on the performance mumbai meri jaan and maan gaye mughal e azam are very different films am i proud of both films im happy with both films i was even proud of a few of my three scenes in shaurya
7172864 i got to do comedy again in maan gaye mughal e azam this is an entirely new genre for me the director sanjay chhel comes from gujarati theatre i play a ghazal singer haldi hassan with a roving eye slightly sleazy and though i sing quite well i left it to the professional playback singers to sing for me im only an actor
7172865 but genres are not relevant i leave it to the pundits to segregate by genre i go by what the script requires from me for me acting is cathartic it gives me a chance to be and do what i wouldnt in real life we actors are a blessed lot acting gives me a chance to recognise myself
7172866 i play an unemployed guy he can apply himself to work but chooses not to and hangs around with younger boys in an irani caf its all very interestingly done
7172867 i used to joke about me being a garlanded photograph in sarkar raj
7172868 i didnt even know it was a tear there was a lot of pain in bangkok and i didnt know what it was i thought it was a problem related to my flat feet but after i returned to mumbai and finished with johns abraham brothers wedding reception i got an mri done it showed a tear
7172869 its a very common occurrence in the legs of active people like dancers and athletes that tear just stays theres no cure for it if you lead a routine life it doesnt bother you at all otherwise theres arthroscopy but my orthopaedic surgeons have not advised it i can walk work out dance do everything
7172870 i didnt want to inconvenience anyone during the shooting so as a precautionary measure i kept a therapist around because during a dance movement there was some swelling none of the dance steps changed dancing is a routine activity so the therapist was just a precautionary measure
7172871 its part of our job its no big deal you just have to understand your body and be careful four years back i ran with the wrong shoes it caused a knee problem i immediately corrected that i believe in long term health and when i work out i listen to my body if any part of my body gives me any pain i stop immediately and no trainer can push me
7172872 bud if you be jesus can you give sight to the blind can you heal the sick can you raise the dead
7172873 no but if you be jesus give me a bud
7172874 no but if you thirst after me ye shall never thirst
7172875 kita akan melaporkan ke komnas ham atas pelanggaran ham yang dilakukan terkait penggusuran yang dilakukan
7172876 i think whats wrong is that there are so many good drivers
7172877 i really do its a hard pill to swallow to go from last year going from 18 cars and having a couple of front row starts to this year having 26 27 good cars
7172878 i would say 2008 has been an up and down year
7172879 maybe a year with a bit of drama in it everything from the highs and the lows so its been interesting its been exciting its been frustrating its been all those things but at the end of the day what ill remember about this year is that i won my first race which is a good memory to have
7172880 im not a big fan of regret you just keep growing as a person
7172881 i looked at each and everything that ive done on or off the track and learned from it
7172882 i believe its good whenever you get things off you chest whenever youre able to fully communicate theres nothing ever wrong with communicating
7172883 i will always say when im at a racetrack cameras are rolling and there are many things that become a story because ive been fortunate enough to have people following me since very early in my indy career
7172884 its like when you tune into a golf game you want to know how tigers doing you dont really care you just want to know and that carries over in a lot of sports with a lot of popular athletes
7172885 was checking a temporary storage closet and discovered material belongings of john g moorehead the victim in a closet assigned to trooper d p starcher
7172886 taking pictures of an old ladys exposed breasts asking him to stop
7172887 know who gets prosecuted for criminal acts and who does not
7172888 the institutional tendency to tolerate police perjury likely stems from the prosecutors interest in maintaining smooth working relations with police who gather the governments evidence and are often its most important witnesses at trial and from the prosecutors own competitive drive to win and to advance professionally
7172889 the record and investigation will clearly show criminal behavior and a violation of the laws of the state of west virginia by trooper doug starcher and his supervising officer sgt
7172890 it has been a long and humiliating ordeal for me and my boys

7172897 man kan ta politiker fr n politiken men inte politiken fr n politiker
7172898 i definitely want to be a little more of a threat up there
7172899 i feel like one of them it reminds me of what we had in oakland
7172900 i feel im 22 or 24 my body is 30 but the state of my mind is younger
7172901 were not going to say we think were going to win the division right now but well sure give it a run
7172902 and if not well try to spoil someone elses day everyones written us off and thats fine with a youth movement i think young guys are showing theyre comfortable in their roles and not having a ton of pressure
7172903 now i see why none of the u s sprinters was chosen to carry the flag at opening ceremonies
7172904 shut up or well ship your dog to the chef at guolizhuang to be used for spare parts
7172905 the olympics is a wonderful flower that just opens up in these 17 days of the games
7172906 dear guests we wish that you enjoyed a pleasant time in beijing
7172907 i feel good about the team but im a little concerned with the o line and d line
7172908 well have to commit to kids and count on them while they get experience in our pre district games
7172909 thats what those games are for so theyll be above average players when we get past that point of the season
7172910 we have three linemen who are as good as any in the area
7172911 oakley watkins is a division i prospect aaron mayes is moving to center and will also play defensive tackle and we have pat brown at offensive tackle and middle linebacker
7172912 and thatll be key for some of our younger players
7172913 we just have to get some experience under our belts
7172914 we have a junior quarterback back and with receivers like deron hicks kevin stiles brandon meriwether damian hicks jeremy gardner and franklin goins that could be the strength of our team and get us through some tough spots
7172915 there are some things we need shore up and we need to work on but overall i was pleasantly surprised with some things and how we did
7172916 and our starting running back was out so we had some kids playing out of position
7172917 our junior and sophomore classes are thin we have a good senior class and a good sized freshman group we have good players in the sophomore and junior classes just not a lot of them
7172918 we have 25 to 27 freshmen out and theyre a good group of kids
7172919 they like to work and they do it the right way
7172920 we were banged up the second week of the playoffs and got beat
7172921 any time you play harrison county its a hard hitting physical hard fought game its become a rivalry they have a really great tradition and we have a good tradition
7172922 wed like to beat them in the regular season and the post season
7172923 at the same time when we played bourbon and pendleton at times they took it to us a little bit we know theyre young hungry and were not taking anyone lightly on our schedule
7172924 theyve been coachable and theyve put the time in to be successful
7172925 maybe he nair san was the first person in the world to conduct a student agitation against the british this is a thrilling biography of him
7172926 it is a docudrama he fought against the british from japan later the japanese government presented him with the title san
7172927 his efficiency in japanese chinese and spanish languages lifted him above all other indian freedom fighters in japan such as netaji subhas chandra bose rashbehari bose pratap singh and barkathullah
7172928 i know that person i have met him and i have been to his restaurants in japan also long back i am talking about 23 years back
7172929 he is doing a small role there is an action sequence he is doing
7172930 it is 160 days of shooting for me the film will cover the life of nair san from his age of 35 till his death
7172931 it is about the kargil war how it happened and how it ended we shot in real locations like kargil and drass
7172932 only one character major mahadevan in kirti chakra appears as colonel mahadevan here in kurukshetra
7172933 it will not be in major cities like kochi or thiruvananthapuram we will stay about 40 to 50 km away from such cities whatever amenities multiplexes provide will be available but at a lower scale
7172934 previously there was a ban on releasing films all across kerala but now we can release films throughout kerala people in smaller towns did not have enough theatres we are aiming at these pockets
7172935 i dont want to get into politics i know about the state i know what is happening in the country but i am not very keen on party and all i have friends in all parties
7172936 it is the one to whom i give the bread dipped in the sauce
7172937 when he flipped over and they pulled down his sock thats a very bad sign
7172938 i dont know if it took some steam out of us but it was a touchy situation
7172939 the damage from fay is a reminder that a tropical storm does not have to reach a hurricane level to be dangerous and cause significant damage
7172940 i slept through the whole thing it wasnt very dramatic when it came onshore
7172941 i just think were so fortunate we didnt have high tide and a stronger wind because hurricane dennis is still fresh in our mind the tidal surge we had in here
7172942 its going to be very different from the opening ceremony which was burdened with heavy responsibility to show chinese culture to the world
7172943 it will be simple youthful athletic loud and proud like london entertaining and fun
7172944 see i place before you today a blessing and a curse the blessing will come to those who hearken to the commandments
7172945 1 do not harden your heart and 2 do not close your hand
7172946 before g d your lord you shall eat it year by year
7172947 we need to use our global supremacy to protect our children we need to use our children to protect our global supremacy

7172949 the only reason l c gets paid more than anyone else is because she demanded in her original contract that no one could ever get paid more than her
7172950 toute l gende est tir e de faits r els
7172951 when you consider that it doesnt include another four years of secondary education plus five more years of medical school if he wants to follow his previously stated goal to grow up to be a doctor like his daddy this will come as an interminably deep chasm of drudgery and imprisonment to connor
7172952 its difficult to know the effect on his psychological well being when he grasps the full truth that his education will be followed by approximately four decades of work bills and taxes during which he will also rear his own children to face the same fate all of which will of course be followed by a brief almost inconsequential retirement and his inevitable death
7172953 even a 50 year old adult would have trouble processing such a monstrous notion
7172954 i noticed it a little bit last year sometimes its just by habit youve been around certain people so long around the same environment for so long you just start getting used to it but weve been doing a great job this year of being put in different environments doing different activities helping to get us closer as a team
7172955 theres a difference between being a dangerous dog and being declared a dangerous dog by a bureaucrat who has never met them
7172956 thats a pretty crazy argument to say that your house is not a safe place to keep your dog
7172957 when asked about the signs he said there were so many people coming to his party that he did not want anyone else parking in front of his house
7172958 its another concern that citizens should have about how our government at whatever level is being run
7172959 living here we have a concern for our neighbors and they are our neighbors
7172960 and yet they just want us to sit back and trust them
7172961 ive seen estimates that the furniture market could be down by 25 percent or higher
7172962 we dont have a proposal for you at this point but everyone is working hard
7172963 then two of them would climb onto the roof and drop pellets of zyklon b through a vent
7172964 she said it was our turn to go out and make a difference
7172965 i know you dont think when you call people names that it means anything but it can turn very ugly
7172966 i thought what kind of evil remains in this place that after 60 years the birds wont sing
7172967 believed in prayer and her life was built around prayer
7172968 i believe my kids would get a fair or good education at any school however they wouldnt get the reinforcement of the spiritual values that were teaching at home
7172969 the staff and faculty there are dedicated to living the christian lifestyle we just want our kids to have not just a good education but we want our kids to grow spiritually
7172970 the children are still growing in their faith and theyre like plants in a greenhouse we will keep those plants in the greenhouse with the right temperature right soil and habitat where they can be nurtured and their belief systems fostered until they go out into the cruel world
7172971 we understand that some day theyll have to go out in the secular world theres sometimes an anti christian philosophy in the public schools youre not going to find concepts of biblical christianity being taught in public schools
7172972 when you leave god out of education then you have to determine your own moral system
7172973 because the public schools left god out a long time ago thats why theres no established system of right and wrong kids need more than just rules they need a foundation so that when they leave school they can make the right choices
7172974 the benefits for the public school system for us have been giving our children a well rounded education because we like to expose them to our diverse society
7172975 we dropped in to see the elementary school and it was just really chaotic and not a whole lot of teaching going on because of discipline problems
7172976 and then we visited at wilmington christian academy and it was a night and day difference the halls were quiet and i didnt see the discipline problems theres more teaching and the fact that its christian based i think the bible and prayer should be taught in all schools
7172977 because of the fact that we do have a basis to teach values and character thats going to in turn cause our students to be definitely viable in our community
7172978 our students are the future of our community and they may end up being business leaders or ministers and we want to equip them to continue to serve and have a sense of service in their community
7172979 building a brotherhood and a sisterhood amidst the growing muslim teen population in our community
7172980 we do lose some students to the public schools because of athletics but weve seen enough growth to continue offering new things
7172981 but our class sizes will stay small we never have more than a 1 14 teacher to student ratio
7172982 our defense made a bunch of plays on the ball when we needed to
7172983 when they were driving down the field it always seemed like we got a turnover and we got the ball back to the offense im sure it hurt their team a lot cause they were driving down the field and they were making big plays and good plays and then wed get a turnover and capitalize and score
7172984 i thought they played well spotswood the wing t is a good misdirection offense and they gave us some problems there especially the big fullback nick wimer hes a good runner and they did a good job on the blocking that misdirection blocking really hurt us
7172985 i really thought the score could have been 7 7 at the end of the first half if we dont make mistakes
7172986 but you cant say that either cause thats football taking nothing away from harrisonburg cause theyve got a great football team i told coach sarver i hope thats the best team we play all year you never know but theyre a very talented football team and we knew that going into it for us to beat those guys weve got to do all the little things right and tonight we just didnt do it
7172987 so its not gonna be easy its going to be really hard were gonna have to work at this everyday but i want to do that because i want you i want all of you forever everyday you and me everyday
7172988 i ricordi sono in fila e non mi mollano ad uno ad uno salgono e mi tormentano
7172989 elections have changed dramatically over the years money power and name recognition are the three basic ingredients for a winner whether or not that candidate has any qualifications
7172990 this is fine for the corporate world or the entertainment industry but not for democracy
7172991 voters are bombarded with repetitive subjective messages about the candidates personality and biography
7172992 the system seems designed to focus their attention on what the candidates look like or who is ahead rather than what they promise theyll do for the country with an awareness of the techniques campaigns use and how to find better information people can look beyond what the candidates want them to see and understand the truth about the people who are looking to represent them and how they propose to represent them
7172993 that global warming is unequivocal and that human activity is the main driver very likely causing most of the rise in temperatures since 1950
7172994 with ties to the oil and gas coal and timber industries
7172995 why dont we pass 1 3 trillion of that back to the people who pay the bills
7172996 it is going to be a very emotional time for me
7172997 living in the south i never thought i would see the day
7172998 some people have a vision of tennessee as one of the racist places
7172999 verbal dissent should be placed in the appropriate place in the baggage before we leave
7173000 the only reason l c gets paid more than anyone else is because she demanded in her original contract that no one could ever get paid more than her
7173001 i definitely want to get something bad on the road big enough for all my friends and to scare all the cars away from me im a good driver but its everyone else that im worried about
7173002 the curfew has been imposed to pre empt the rally
7173003 the rule is closely related to everyones daily life we want to hear more public opinion on the whether or how to keep the rule
7173004 the citys air quality was highly satisfactory during the games in the past two weeks
7173005 last week was more getting my feet wet it was like this is what im doing now but i had a little more confidence tonight especially when one of your first runs is a big run it builds confidence as a runner so that being said i just kind of kept things rolling after that
7173006 the only thing i had to do was run to the sidelines and cut it up that is how good the blocking was
7173007 the offensive line did a tremendous job all night and fullback brad hoover hes our lights in the dark so he just kind of leads and guides us and we have to pick and choose holes
7173008 it gives me a lot of confidence just to know that coming off toe surgery everything is going well and starting to roll
7173009 im getting the offense down now just to go out and perform in my second preseason game like i did tonight i just think overall as a whole team we did better than we did last week and that is what coach told us he wanted us to do
7173010 you have to do the best you can while you are out there and try to get better the next week and keep the progress going
7173011 the first game i didnt play much and the last game when it started pouring the big thing was to get the snap and dont do anything stupid but i needed this i needed to get hit i needed to play i made a few mistakes early on that was huge for me i knew i needed it but i didnt think i needed it as much as i did
7173012 exceeded my expectations i think hes helped himself and is someone ive seen grow since hes been here
7173013 a couple of years ago i was able to buy everything practically new
7173014 you just have to do some things different to adjust
7173015 weve seen an increase in terms of clothes school supplies broken in sports gear its a great way to get brand name styles for cheaper
7173016 its not just the working poor were also seeing more middle class families coming to us
7173017 parents would go naked before they would send their kids to school without the right tools to be able to get an education
7173018 you dont want a child to feel embarrassed or left out
7173019 thats not a good way to start the school year
7173020 gas alone is making me rethink a whole lot of things it looks like well have to do fewer projects or just come up with another creative way to do them
7173021 she said she cant have a regular calculator it has to have different functions on it
7173022 you make sure that the teacher understands whats going on so they dont penalize them comments
7173023 they know youre there theyre looking at you if they wanted to hurt you if they smacked that tail on you youre gone youre dead
7173024 what i find annoying and frustrating is the arguments coming from people overseas they havent been here and been in with the whales
7173025 its not in our interest to harass the animals they are our livelihood
7173026 i found i couldnt tell people about it when i got out of the water
7173027 their beauty their gracefulness the lack of fear in something weve nearly hunted to extinction
7173028 theres just something there that i connected with and ive never found it anywhere else
7173029 some have quite a close encounter and we have no doubt its a fantastic experience and for many a very emotional experience
7173030 it could be argued that if you offer that kind of experience to the general public then youre creating a passion for the whales that could ultimately save the whales
7173031 i fear if that happens again the government might stop it completely
7173032 that you can swim with the whales here is very very important for tourism ive done it once its just an awesome experience
7173033 to me it was obvious he was unable to continue
7173034 being named the u s flag bearer for the closing ceremony is almost like winning a gold medal
7173035 i thought i could win a gold medal in competition but i never thought id have this opportunity im truly truly proud to be an american citizen and part of the u s olympic team
7173036 the doctor said maybe i slept on my eye and i do sleep like that
7173037 i thought maybe if i got some blood flowing to my brain for once it would help but it didnt happen my first at bat i couldnt see the pitchers face was all blurry and it was even worse in the outfield numbers were blurry i used every eye drop in the clubhouse but it didnt work
7173038 he was throwing strikes thats encouraging to see from a guy that young
7173039 there is some serious hand sewn crap up in here

7173041 i think people in the united states can get a little irritated by my work
7173042 frustrated even they think im a clever clever boy but ive found its okay to be in a state of conflict and opposition you dont want to be too embraced
7173043 at least as long as i can get up and down the stairs
7173044 the three set in europe were told to me by other writers and my publisher while the newark story happened to my stepfather he was actually there when the mayor broke down and cried in the middle of the riot
7173045 a coup by legal and political means the reality is that al gore was elected which means were living in an alternate universe an alternate reality like owen brick in the real world there would be no war in iraq no torture at abu ghraib and possibly just possibly no 9 11
7173046 the idea that this great man should have to suffer the loss of such a fine son is appalling
7173047 i wrote man in the dark during a very short period of time
7173048 just four months it kept writing itself it was the most intense experience ive ever had as a writer
7173049 i write everything by hand paragraph by paragraph and then at the end of the day i type up what ive written usually 1 000 words on a typewriter when the book is done ill do handwritten corrections then retype it all on the typewriter i wrote a screenplay on a computer once and hated it so much that i vowed i would never do it again i got carpal tunnel and wound up having to wear a brace
7173050 most of whats on it is false ill give readings where the person introducing me will provide information that is simply wrong ill ask them where they got it and invariably theyll say the internet
7173051 novels are about inner life about the experience of being in the world from inside
7173052 films are about life from the outside rarely do they touch the depths of novels

7173060 mccain was the same for nearly seventy years then he changed
7173061 claiming that mccain suddenly transformed into a different bad man is not plausible
7173062 launching implausible negative attacks is not the new politics weve been promised
7173063 its not just something biden is making up back during the primaries i remember talking to a lot of people about how i thought the 2000 version of mccain might have made a pretty good president but the 2008 model not so much but then the 2000 version would never have won the republican nomination which is why he moved so far to the right
7173064 but as ive said for a long time records are meant to be broken i certainly thought that by this time someone would have won it twice

7173077 i met a lot of people in europe i even encountered myself
7173078 to travel is to discover that everyone is wrong about other countries
7173079 the uses of travel are occasional and short but the best fruit it finds when it finds it is conversation and this is a main function of life
7173080 travel can be one of the most rewarding forms of introspection
7173081 its easy to spin it however you want to its time for us to get behind this sport and talk about the good things

7173122 stole the marginal votes gore may have needed to clearly carry florida and the election
7173123 they dont want to look themselves in the mirror for betraying their finest progressive traditions and so they have to lash out at someone
7173124 theyre not going to blame themselves for selling out again and again and again
7173125 they make mistake after mistake after mistake because theyve lost their self respect they dont know who they are anymore theyve lost their identity
7173126 theyre basically appealing to the public by saying do you know how bad the republicans are people say they dont think that much of the democratic party but do you know how bad the republicans are if you define yourself by the worst instead of the best you can be theres something wrong with your psychological makeup as a party
7173127 gore is to the right of bradley on almost every important issue
7173128 he had at various times in his political career been a neoliberal tough on crime and communism a new agey environmentalist and techno futurist and an old fashioned bible thumping populist gores response to problems said a long time aide was to consult five pollsters
7173129 thats basically trying to be like the republicans but not quite like the republicans and still have a democratic image
7173130 gore advisers say naders appeal will dim as the election draws closer
7173131 theyre also counting on reform party candidate pat buchanan to nab would be bush votes
7173132 yeah what they should have said is hey the green party is for this this and this
7173133 its not my job to elect al gore or george bush
7173134 i think its an ego trip and people have lost sight of what the goals are
7173135 why didnt the democrats stop bush on iraq why did they surrender their declaration of war powers authority under the constitution and send it up pennsylvania avenue to the white house
7173136 it got so bad that everything bush did i was blamed for until i ended up saying gee i know someone who should share the blame with me barbara and george bush
7173137 they created him why dont you go back to the origins
7173138 he had called me and i think reached out to my campaign my sense is that mr nader is somebody who if you dont listen and adopt all of his policies thinks youre not substantive he seems to have a pretty high opinion of his own work
7173139 ralph nader is trying to get attention he has become the perennial political candidate
7173140 i think its a shame because if you look at his legacy in terms of consumer protections its an extraordinary one but at this point hes somebody whos trying to get attention and his campaign hasnt gotten any traction
7173141 when i saw him at a book signing last year in a downtown bookstore i stood in line with 300 people

7173145 senates do have a watchdog role australians dont want a rubber stamp senate
7173146 and i think some in the liberal party wish they were saved from workchoices with a senate that could have blocked it
7173147 we got some decisions wrong as the previous government and thats why were out of government
7173148 ive always believed we should have a more robust senate

7173211 i urge your colleagues to take even bolder steps toward solving the climate crisis
7173212 we have an historic opportunity to shift to a clean energy economy and in the process create new sustainable jobs to support the development and deployment of these new technologies
7173213 im afraid right now that we are more concerned about the business climate than the earths climate
7173214 until we realize they are not mutually exclusive we wont be able to address these issues
7173215 but it should be clear to anyone who has been watching the session that weve already
7173216 under governor patrick massachusetts joined the regional greenhouse gas initiative and became the first state in the nation to require greenhouse gas analysis and mitigation in major real estate projects
7173217 comprehensive energy legislation the oceans management bill and pending biofuels legislation all put massachusetts into a leadership position nationally we support the creation of an economy wide cap as the next step in reducing greenhouse gas emissions but many details remain to be worked out with the legislature

7173221 obama is doing very well with women voters but there is the other side
7173222 someone else more than half of clintons supporters are still not on board with obama the holdouts tend to like mccain more than obama and have more confidence in mccains ability to be commander in chief
7173223 at least i dont cake on the makeup like a trollop you c t
7173224 someone else more than half of clintons supporters are still not on board with obama the holdouts tend to like mccain more than obama and have more confidence in mccains ability to be commander in chief
7173225 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
7173226 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
7173227 theres a short list for show and then theres the actual short list
7173228 the ultimate fascination with veepstakes is as much about who is on the list as much as who might actually be chosen
7173229 that was a classic example of people benefiting from being on the list
7173230 before if you followed the nfl it was enough just to know the player
7173231 now more fans tend to know who the strength coach is for the baltimore ravens
7173232 al gore and dick cheney have redefined the vice presidency probably forever
7173233 that elevated the notion of do no harm to the golden rule of vice presidential selection
7173234 even though the president is the president this is going to be john mccains convention and you want it to be about john mccain and what his presidency would be
7173235 the two of them would embrace and make brief remarks and bush would escort reagan off to air force one and salute the president as he departed new orleans and the convention and then george bush would get in his motorcade after saluting ronald reagan and go downtown to be the nominee of the republican party
7173236 balance benefiting from voters desires to continue the clinton approach while allowing gore to take the torch and emerge from the large clinton shadow
7173237 i dont think there are a lot of people who want to see him at the convention
7173238 should stay home from the republican convention and everybody would be better off
7173239 the presidents approval rating among republicans base voters who are needed for a successful mccain campaign is relatively high
7173240 the assumption would be that there will be some kind of physical handoff
7173241 i think there is a sense that they would appear together he is the sitting president hes still popular among hard core republicans mccain has some issues with hard core republicans some people will say this was a bad way to play it but i think its one of those things where you have to run through it and do it and embrace it

7173243 but were just going to have to wait and see
7173244 especially a guy like osi he definitely means a lot to this team and franchise anytime a guy like that goes down it definitely hits you right in the throat
7173245 i just told him to keep his spirits up were praying for him and wish him the best
7173246 hes got 11 days to get better hes got 11 days to get back in the game hopefully hes back by the opener on sept 4
7173247 its amazing this is what i get paid to do this is what i live for
7173248 this is all i really want to go out there every fifth day and do my job
7173249 last year battling through this surgery and having this team behind me with their support its meant everything
7173250 ninety pitches in five innings isnt going to cut it every time out i realize that but its a big win for the team right now
7173251 hes in our rotation and thats the bottom line i think it means a lot to him especially what hes been through to be able to come out and contribute at such an important time of year
7173252 obviously he wasnt lighting up the radar gun but you dont have to do that in this game if you hit your spots
7173253 i think he wanted to get out there and prove himself to new york
7173254 thats the most important thing if youre out to prove something to everyone else i think it takes away a special part of being in the major leagues
7173255 obviously theres been a lot going on the last four years i cant ignore that but im still the same person i was four years ago when i go out there on the mound
7173256 the hitter walked toward the dugout to throw his bat and helmet away he in doing so has abandoned his effort to reach the next base
7173257 right now its time for us to support the guy i hope he can win some games for us and help us get to the playoffs because if he doesnt win any games were not going to be able to do it
7173258 we would like the teams to listen to the ideas that we have come up with and revise the policy
7173259 the hope is they take a step back listen to their most loyal fans and revise the policy

7173274 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
7173275 a career legacy politician who fell hook line and sinker for the administrations case for a disastrous war and dragged much of our party with him
7173276 the most inexperienced ticket in the history of the world
7173277 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
7173278 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
7173279 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted

7173283 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
7173284 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
7173285 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
7173286 when the former vice president left office al gore was worth an estimated 2 million
7173287 zeb i think the main difference is gore is a politician whos learned to manipulate science while suzuki is a scientist whos learning to manipulate politics
7173288 it is no crime to be ignorant of economics which is after all a specialized discipline and one that most people consider to be a dismal science but it is totally irresponsible to have a loud and vociferous opinion on economic subjects while remaining in this state of ignorance
7173289 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
7173290 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
7173291 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
7173292 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
7173293 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
7173294 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
7173295 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
7173296 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
7173297 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
7173298 youve gotta stand for something or youre gonna fall for anything
7173299 smack some sense into our so called president with my bare hands
7173300 senator tom coburn announces that he will introduce a bill of impeachment
7173301 to protest the arrogant conceit of the obama administration the republican members of his cabinet resign en masse i never wanted the job anyway comments postmaster general joe lieberman
7173302 november 19 2010 president obama holds private talks with house speaker savage two days later the republicans introduce a flurry of bills
7173303 senator tom coburn announces that he will introduce a bill of impeachment
7173304 to protest the arrogant conceit of the obama administration the republican members of his cabinet resign en masse i never wanted the job anyway comments postmaster general joe lieberman
7173305 november 19 2010 president obama holds private talks with house speaker savage two days later the republicans introduce a flurry of bills
7173306 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
7173307 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
7173308 if your are going to go with gore why not go with hillary who really earned her place there by campaigning for the presidency and winning 18 million supporters i guess it is too much to ask for a woman to be seriously considered even when she is qualified
7173309 efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change
7173310 the mere fact that diane nash was born and raised on the southside of chicago but ended up in nashville tn at fisk as one of the movements most dynamic young leaders is astounding while just a few miles away in carthage tn was al gores home and later gore moved to nashville to work as a journalist while ms nash was on the front lines of the civil rights movement in this country mr gore was in vietnam although they started in tennessee with separate missions what they did through out their lives changed the nation and impacted the world i look forward to hearing their testimonies
7173311 we feel that if we pay these fines we would be contributing to and supporting the injustice and immoral practices that have been performed in the arrest and conviction of the defendants
7173312 do you feel it is wrong to discriminate against a person solely on the basis of their race or color
7173313 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
7173314 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
7173315 why in the world couldnt we have landslided this bumbling governor from texas with the terrible record
7173316 hey the green party is for this this and this did you know that the democratic party is also for this this and this why should you vote for the green party vote for us
7173317 oh now were going to have a lean and mean military budget
7173318 how do you think they are on the redirections of the country that people care about
7173319 you know they have half the market wed better look like them
7173320 what are you doing competing dont you know its a two party game a two major party game what are you doing competing
7173321 now you only have two on the ballot to choose from
7173322 gee you know what was kerrys excuse why didnt he win
7173323 gee i know someone who should share the blame with me
7173324 barbara and george bush they created him why dont you go back to the origins why dont you go back to ann richards who could have easily defeated him when he ran
7173325 oh i see so hes doing all this to win the election and then hell be different
7173326 well lets start with my disagreeing with barack obama disagreeing with himself
7173327 if i had my way and if i could single payer but i cant unilaterally so ill do this
7173328 oh well you know the republicans are filibustering or something
7173329 oh weve got more important things we have to do
7173330 aside from producing green obama t shirts earlier this year the obama campaign has not yet displayed the rhetoric or resources necessary to win its share of the irish american vote
7173331 barack obama needs the huge irish american vote in closely fought pennsylvania battlegrounds like pittsburgh and the philadelphia suburbs there are similar pockets of irish american swing votes in other key states
7173332 to ignore this irish dimension serves to the advantage of the implicit republican appeal on racial issues like affirmative action and religious issues like abortion
7173333 one cannot imagine hillary clinton avoiding such a trip surely an aspiring world leader would want to acquaint himself in greater detail with an apparent success story in the resolution of conflict
7173334 a more likely explanation might well be the unimportance his campaign strategists attach to the irish vote in america
7173335 hot rod came up to me and goes come down the tunnel with me
7173336 play the way were capable of playing every night dont take anything for granted 15 game lead or whatever
7173337 and everybody probably saw the white sox lost friday so we definitely wanted to get a win everyones been talking about this road trip and how we dont play as well on the road so i think to get off on a good start is definitely going to help us going forward
7173338 the more wins we get early hopefully were not going to feel like we have to salvage the road trip

7173342 you are always concerned any time a player like that goes down
7173343 thats not good we know the type of player he is and if he can come back he will but we have the personnel to step up in his absence
7173344 unfortunately they were called back i think all we have to do is watch the film to see we have a lot of potential
7173345 in this case it would be easily justifiable to say for me to play a series if not there are a lot of things we can learn from the film
7173346 we need to make a few more plays we just need to work on our third down conversions and find a way to put more points on the board
7173347 any time you have 12 penalties and 10 of them are on offensive plays thats an issue

7173355 i cant say enough about the horse i always felt he had that ability
7173356 when youve been around horses for a long time the really good ones do things very differently than the usual ones this horse from day one had shown that he never did anything ever to disappoint me
7173357 the project was established to provide high speed connectivity for public safety education municipalities health care and prime business locations countywide
7173358 its one of those deals where i couldnt get by him i couldnt get by him and i just had to ask myself would he do that to me
7173359 and he has before so thats the way it goes
7173360 whatever carls going to say hes sorry that he didnt want to race that way but he always does well take it well go on and well race him that way in the chase if thats the way he wants to race
7173361 well if taiwan was invaded youd see as many taiwanese out today
7173362 domestic demand was weak and came in far below expectations and only strong demand from emerging markets helped to still achieve decent growth
7173363 i invented the whole thing and ive never seen a dime from it
7173364 if a musician records a song does he not get royalties for every purchase if an author writes a book does he not see royalties too if a barely eighteen year old girl stars in a porno does she not receive money im just asking for what i rightfully deserve
7173365 its not as if someone can just cut gore a huge check
7173366 hes going to have to track down each individual that ever bought sold or profited off the internet in the last three decades the amount of time and money to do this could potentially be even more than the money gore could possibly collect
7173367 i cant honestly expect to collect from every little guy grandmas selling quilts online and the like but i certainly will be targeting the big guys like google microsoft and smooth operator
7173368 its just not so easy to keep it up all the time
7173369 eventually sometimes they get you like andy got me this year or james got me this year and fernando gonzalez at the end of last year
7173370 these guys all play good tennis so when it all doesnt come together and maybe i just dont play my very very best its obviously not enough
7173371 thats why i want him on the ballot hell drain 1 percent of obamas vote it will be a close election and that will make a difference
7173372 a lot of foolish people will vote for ralph nader this was a strategic signature
7173373 the only way the major candidates are going to address these issues is if they are at risk of losing votes
7173374 in the streets it is prohibited to spit and to speak breton
7173375 lyndon b johnson was initiated on october 30 1937 in johnson city lodge no 561 at johnson city texas but completed only the entered apprentice or first of the three masonic degrees for this reason he is not included in the gallery
7173376 what makes you believe this awful situation the yankees are in can turn around
7173377 he carl pavano is a yankee i think hell be welcomed with open arms
7173378 those are some pretty good horses that he ran against today
7173379 we just wish they ran the bernard baruch twice a year instead of once a year

7173381 grab hold of that ball dont spit on it and get those fellas out
7173382 every time i meet a nice girl either shes married or i am
7173383 i wasnt planning on it being as meaningful of a week as it came to
7173384 but any week i can share with my family my aunt and uncle who i had not seen in four or five years thats what its all about the win second third place is great and all but at the end of the day all we have is our families and friends and thats whats most important to me
7173385 my dad was approached by a gentleman yesterday and it was really neat he said i used to know this guy named hap streelman we used to call him hap because he was always happy thats my dads father
7173386 one of the dumbest plays i ever made trying to do what i did out of the rough there
7173387 it wasnt what i was looking for i got off to a good start but i just stunk it up
7173388 they try to pretend to be friends but theyre no kin and theyre gonna bend
7173389 im happy we dont have contact sports especially with rafas biceps
7173390 the carl rove divisive swift boating character assassinating partisanship that calls every disagreement treason or appeasement every electoral rival an enemy of the people
7173391 now when jesus was born in bethlehem of judaea in the days of herod the king behold wise men from the east came to jerusalem saying where is he that is born king of the jews for we saw his star in the east and are come to worship him and when herod the king heard it he was troubled and all jerusalem with him
7173392 never vote for a junior senator running for president regardless of who he she might be
7173393 start of a new day in america under obama start to loose freedom start to loose liberty keep growing government bigger and bigger start of socialism in the american government
7173394 as a lifelong democrat who will be voting for mccain this fall
7173395 just about every indication that i have charlie from people close to the process is that theyre going to try to hold this until saturday
7173396 to get the word out just a little bit before barack obama and the pick show up in springfield illinois
7173397 if you listen to barack obama and the people around him they certainly seem to be signaling that the choice will be someone who has instantly recognizable national security experience
7173398 that means joe biden maybe evan bayh not tim kaine of virginia and maybe even the big surprise you know someone like hillary clinton or al gore
7173399 just about every indication that i have charlie from people close to the process is that theyre going to try to hold this until saturday
7173400 to get the word out just a little bit before barack obama and the pick show up in springfield illinois
7173401 they the heartland americans are bitter clinging to guns and religion and have atipithy toward those who dont look like them
7173402 they will try to make you afraid of me because i dont look like the other presidents
7173403 one night after being mistreated as a pow a guard loosened the ropes binding me easing my pain on christmas that same guard approached me without saying a word he drew a cross in the sand we stood wordlessly looking at the cross remembering the true light of christmas
7173404 leaving his shovel on the ground he slowly walked to a crude bench and sat down he knew that at any moment a guard would order him to stand up and when he failed to respond the guard would beat him to death probably with his own shovel he had seen it happen to other prisoners
7173405 not long ago in baghdad al qaeda took two young women who were mentally disabled and put suicide vests on them sent them into a marketplace and by remote control detonated those suicide vests
7173406 if that isnt evil you have to tell me what is
7173407 i have a long record of that support of alternate energy ive always been for all of those and i have not missed any crucial vote but my citizens in arizona know that when im running for the president of the united states i have to be out campaigning
7173408 if you were president and you knew that bin laden was in pakistan and you knew where would you have u s forces go in after him
7173409 larry im not gonna go there and heres why pakistan is a sovereign nation i think the pakistanis want bin laden out of their hair and out of their country as causing great difficulties in pakistan itself but i want to assure you that i will get osama bin laden as president of the united states and i will bring him to justice no matter what it takes
7173410 hey lou i just got this package from al gore he asked us to hide it
7173411 this idiots voting for mccain but he knows nothing about him
7173412 this guy has his facts wrong and hes voting for obama
7173413 and maybe even the big surprise you know someone like hillary clinton or al gore
7173414 if anyone says something about my surname i say we are not related i am ashamed
7173415 however nothing rallies the righties like a clinton a recent poll showed 49 of americans would never vote for hillary
7173416 our pitchers did a great job and we didnt help them we had plenty of chances
7173417 you cant expect your pitchers to bail you out when you only score one run
7173418 theres nothing else they could have done we know what we have to do
7173419 buddy byers was holding on for dear life hes an extremely brave man
7173420 women getting the right to vote and so much of that history was done here in upstate new york
7173421 we should be very proud that it was the women of new york who began the womens suffrage movement
7173422 an awe inspiring and transforming event in the history of america
7173423 its an elegant thing you can take time from your busy life to do something that is calming
7173424 its a different kind of social than were used to
7173425 luckily these valves are new in the 20 inch break the valves were old it took all night to shut that off
7173426 its a national audience in prime time and i get to hear the name of west virginia a few times however short my time may be im going to give it all i can
7173427 im going to talk about the strengths of governors how they lead and how they make decisions in non partisan ways
7173428 that is the direction in which we should go as a nation working on what is best for the nation as a whole
7173429 im going to tell them that the dream is still alive even in our little state and that we need to have a person as president who can keep the dream alive in america and put us on the right track its going to go by really quickly
7173430 you never know what comes from there or goes from there
7173431 on social issues they might not line up 100 percent with barack and they might feel they line up better with presumed republican presidential nominee u s sen john mccain r ariz like they did with george w bush
7173432 but what people have to understand is that there are checks and balances in government a governor or president cant make changes just because they disagree with something
7173433 while barack and i may not agree he is the person to bring change to put us back on the right path
7173434 our problems are so great and he is someone whose highest priorities wont be social issues changes
7173435 we also have an education system that isnt competing globally
7173436 there is is a better way and we can change there are many who want to talk about the sins of the past i say fix the problems of today and quit blaming and talking about it we just want to fix it thats what we do as governors and what we should do on the national level
7173437 it is for him to get the numbers i am sure he will face a lot of problems we have decided to preserve ourselves as a political group and will approach people sooner
7173438 there is no point in accepting the post now it is up to guruji jharkhand mukti morcha chief sibu soren to see whether he can secure a majority
7173439 it is for him to get the numbers i am sure he will face a lot of problems we have decided to preserve ourselves as a political group and will approach people sooner
7173440 we have to see what kind of amendments come then only we can decide
7173441 it is quite a remarkable feat that 45 different sovereign nations should decide to have one point of view over any issue
7173442 no member of any delegation has told me that they are against giving india a special exemption that the india us nuclear deal requires
7173443 concerns remain though differences have narrowed down the moment of truth will be when all 45 counties agree we realise it is a process they have to feel comfortable
7173444 i mentioned it to your government its been mentioned by much higher pay grades than mine
7173445 that guy looks just like billy murray i think its bill murray
7173446 i have received reports of five deaths however i have to re check before confirming the death of laxmanananda saraswati
7173447 i spoke to the union home secretary to rush additional forces and allow extension of the stay of seven companies of crpf which had been deployed in the district since december 2007 when communal violence had broken out there
7173448 there are going to be a lot of students and a lot of traffic and probably a lot of late students to class i imagine
7173449 people like to run on this bridge and exercise if theyre are trying to run and come through bikes it is going to be crazy i actually got hit by a biker once and that was outside so it will be a little frightening
7173450 he was his own guy he started everything he was the rock n roll guy
7173451 ive always loved elvis my family has always loved elvis when i came up with this theme being how were full blooded greek i needed to have a greek theme so a little greek a little rock n roll a lot of java and here we are
7173452 they wear their elvis clothes they have elvis purses elvis jewelry anything that they can put on them thats elvis physically they do it and then they bring pictures and talk about elvis
7173453 i have a little bracelet here ive got my rings my earrings my little watch this is actually a bullet that was shot by elvis down at graceland
7173454 remembering the man and his music this is what we mainly like to do remember the man and his music
7173455 we started bargaining in july of 2006 this is august of 2008 i think that shows a willingness on our part to negotiate a contract without taking some type of job action
7173456 the window of opportunity to do a lot of this is closing
7173457 im going to go in there with the attitude that were going to get this resolved and im hoping the union leadership comes in with the same attitude

7173466 gee the value is too large better stuff each byte into the receiving value sequentially
7173467 tragically documented cases of torture and inhumane and cruel behaviour have occurred at various sites in the war on terror and current law opens procedural loopholes for more to continue
7173468 there is a perception out there in the middle east that were willing to accept any action in order to fight this war against terrorism
7173469 we are the conservatives let there be no mistake on that who wholeheartedly support the war against terror but that does not mean by any means necessary
7173470 as american christians we are above all motivated by a desire that our nations actions would be consistent with foundational christian moral norms
7173471 we believe that a scrupulous commitment to human rights among which is the right not to be tortured is one of these christian moral convictions
7173472 furthermore the na has been taking notice of global warming i mean thats really all theyre doing suggesting that god whom they believe intelligently designed the world might be annoyed if we unintelligently destroy it
7173473 h ow is population control going to be achieved if not by promoting abortion the distribution of condoms to the young and even by infanticide in china and elsewhere
7173474 really very vile not something we expect from brothers and sisters in the faith
7173475 i actually think evangelical successes in non traditional areas such as trafficking and aids have strengthened our hand on domestic policy and will continue to do so
7173476 because clean air pure water and adequate resources are crucial to public health and civic order
7173477 government has an obligation to protect its citizens from the effects of environmental degradation
7173478 a real problem that ought to matter to us as christians
7173479 the general stereotypes of environmentalists that have been perpetuated by rush limbaugh and others
7173480 theres this belief that all environmentalists love big government and population planning
7173481 the gospel of judas really has been a surprise in many ways
7173482 you realize that whoever wrote the gospel of judas was a very angry person
7173483 t he gospel of judas is a kind of protest literature
7173484 it contradicts everything we know about christianity but theres a lot we dont know about christianity there are different ways of understanding the death of jesus that have been buried and suppressed this author suggests that god does not require sacrifice to forgive sin and that the message of jesus is that we come from god and we go back to god that we all live in god its not about bloody sacrifice for forgiveness of sins it suggests that jesus death demonstrates that essentially and spiritually were not our bodies even when our bodies die we go to live in god
7173485 and he walks with me and he talks with me
7173486 i dont believe any of that what he was saying
7173487 thats not how it works i dont think god cares at all about all the yelling
7173488 but you have made it a three ring circus and not in a good way
7173489 if you are a democrat or a republican before you are a christ ocrat you are an idol worshiper
7173490 if you reject christ if you have never been born again you are not going to heaven
7173491 is well adapted to the true christian message of love and brotherhood and especially brotherhood with those on whom the rich and self glorifying wouldnt deign to wipe their feet
7173492 the seven deadly sins are those transgressions which are fatal to spiritual progress you probably commit some of them every day without thinking about the rich tradition of eternal damnation in which youre participating welcome to your source for information for history on the seven deadly sins and the seven heavenly virtues
7173493 sluggishness of the mind which neglects to begin good it is evil in its effect if it so oppresses man as to draw him away entirely from good deeds
7173494 failure to love god with all ones heart all ones mind and all ones soul
7173495 the peace of god is no peace but strife cast in the sod yet brothers pray for but one thing the glorious peace of god
7173496 father we thank thee for these thy gifts which we are about to receive from thy bounty in the name of christ the lord amen
7173497 god is good god is great help me get the biggest plate
7173498 i believe you said on that last tape that you were six when you first had a mystical experience is that right
7173499 i was six when i saw that everything was god and my hair stood up and all that
7173500 it was on a sunday i remember my sister was only a very tiny child then and she was drinking her milk and all of a sudden i saw that she was god and the milk was god i mean all she was doing was pouring god into god if you know what i mean
7173501 i remember about the fifth time i ever went on wise child i subbed for walt a few times when he was in a cast remember when he was in that cast anyway i started bitching one night before the broadcast seymourd told me to shine my shoes just as i was going out the door with waker i was furious the studio audience were all morons the announcer was a moron the sponsors were morons and i just damn well wasnt going to shine my shoes for them i told seymour i said they couldnt see them anyway where we sat he said to shine them anyway he said to shine them for the fat lady i didnt know what the hell he was talking about but he had a very seymour look on his face and so i did it he never did tell me who the fat lady was but i shined my shoes for the fat lady every time i ever went on the air again all the years you and i were on the program together if you remember i dont think i missed more than just a couple of times this terribly clear clear picture of the fat lady formed in my mind i had her sitting on this porch all day swatting flies with her radio going full blast from morning till night i figured the heat was terrible and she probably had cancer and i dont know anyway it seemed goddam clear why seymour wanted me to shine my shoes when i went on the air it made sense
7173502 he told me to be funny for the fat lady once
7173503 i didnt ever picture her on a porch but with very you know very thick legs very veiny i had her in an awful wicker chair she had cancer too though and she had the radio going full blast all day mine did too
7173504 yes yes yes all right let me tell you something now buddy are you listening
7173505 i dont care where an actor acts it can be in summer stock it can be over a radio it can be over television it can be in a goddam broadway theatre complete with the most fashionable most well fed most sunburned looking audience you can imagine but ill tell you a terrible secret are you listening to me there isnt anyone out there who isnt seymours fat lady that includes your professor tupper buddy and all his goddam cousins by the dozens there isnt anyone anywhere that isnt seymours fat lady dont you know that dont you know that goddam secret yet and dont you know listen to me now dont you know who that fat lady really is ah buddy ah buddy its christ himself christ himself buddy
7173506 you see kids you meet all types in the wild world of web design
7173507 statistically the most dangerous sporting activity you can be involved in
7173508 youre bouncing all over the place it keeps you on edge the whole way through
7173509 it was wild not knowing what to expect it was a really neat time
7173510 suddenly a wave of nostalgia for times past came over me
7173511 theres the heat from the exhaust the ride is quite rough and the spray is constant and unlike running a car the surface youre riding on is constantly changing
7173512 it was the scariest boat i ever drove ive been around boats but i was unnerved
7173513 these are not pleasure boats so you have to be cautious with them
7173514 tata motors can produce from pantnagar up to a capacity of 30 000 35 000 nanos
7173515 in case singur fails the roll out is expected from that plant its capacity could be ramped up later on
7173516 even if the singur issue doesnt get resolved the nano roll out is expected to happen on time from their other facilities either in pantnagar or pune pimpri
7173517 it is very possible that tata motors may move out of singur
7173518 i definitely want to be a little more of a threat up there
7173519 i feel like one of them it reminds me of what we had in oakland
7173520 i feel im 22 or 24 my body is 30 but the state of my mind is younger
7173521 were not going to say we think were going to win the division right now but well sure give it a run
7173522 and if not well try to spoil someone elses day everyones written us off and thats fine with a youth movement i think young guys are showing theyre comfortable in their roles and not having a ton of pressure
7173523 the only reason l c gets paid more than anyone else is because she demanded in her original contract that no one could ever get paid more than her
7173524 it represents borders the experience of immigrants the experience of segregation the experience of racial hatred it is the experience of a third world person coming into the heart of europe for example the space which illegal immigrants occupy is a negative space and so this piece is a negative space
7173525 im actually taking a very conservative viewpoint here im claiming that parsons was above all else traditional country i dont care what beat backed him or that he put a little fuzz tone on a pedal steel he was actually getting much closer to the essence of country music when he died and i have over 2 100 so far who agree that he would have ultimately led the way into the future
7173526 well lets just say well after midnight weve got a lot of great music on tap
7173527 i planned on holding the g3p on the 35 th year of grams demise long before i discovered that the ama was holding their convention at the same time
7173528 i was a bit surprised to find they really werent dealing with this important date in music history their own history
7173529 ama showcase acts cannot play a show in nashville for 14 days prior to the start of the convention
7173530 but we got equally great replacement bands so lets concentrate on the positive
7173531 there seem to be two groups of people out there those that act like they own grams memory or soul and those that know him only because of the way he died
7173532 look it up in wikipedia or anywhere else youll find more on that stupid affair than on his music which influenced directly or indirectly all country music today had he lived who knows what the sound of country would be
7173533 gram probably has more biographies written about him that just about anyone in music who only lived for 27 years
7173534 what the ama is doing as opposed to what theyre playing at the opry
7173535 sure well sound a lot like what the ama is doing at times but well also sound country the two are not separate although we do need to come together there needs to be the kind of convergence that parsons was attempting when and many people dont know this gram played the grand ole opry in 1968 with the byrds
7173536 country always has a way of getting lost but then finding its way back home again
7173537 twenty thousand roads i went down down down and they all led me straight back home to you
7173538 thats how it evolves and in our time gram led the way
7173539 i have told our performers to think about how gram influenced their music and then choose their own material that most closely reflects that
7173540 we hit our initial target of 1 000 in four months
7173541 there were a lot of folks talking the talk but they werent walking the walk
7173542 these performers are traveling and playing just for the love of gram parsons
7173543 stop can just a while and then you could run faster
7173544 its a good way for drivers and other trucking company employees to meet each other and have fun out of the work place its also a great way to celebrate trucker appreciation week

7173552 we dont know the exact severity but hes moving around and the signs are good gruden said
7173553 the king james bible is the true word of god
7173554 yes its a terrible tragic thing but they know what hes like if only theyd accepted jesus
7173555 imagine the world if we took the bible literally just based on what it seems to be saying and didnt read selectively or with regard to its context
7173556 now that i am here i will tell you its purpose if you achieve the purpose you need not follow it to the letter
7173557 this son of ours is disobedient and out of control he will not obey us he is a wastrel and a drunkard
7173558 i took this woman and slept with her and did not find proof of virginity presumably an unbroken hymen in her
7173559 i gave my daughter in marriage to this man and he has turned against her he has trumped up a charge and said i have not found proofs of virginity in your daughter here are the proofs
7173560 my husbands brother refuses to perpetuate his brothers name he will not do his duty by me
7173561 thus we requite the man who will not build up his brothers family
7173562 just pull yourself together and start looking for a new place to live nbsp stop feeling sorry for yourself and realize that there are people around with much worse problems than your preoccupation with your neighbors opinions of you nbsp stop obsessing over the husband who left you 25 years ago and get a life now nbsp stop letting your husband make all the financial decisions take some responsibility go to al anon nbsp aa
7173563 you are the sort who hold yourselves out to other people as righteous but god knows whats in your hearts and the self serving righteousness which people esteem god despises
7173564 watch out for the scribes they like to wear fine clothes to be conspicuous when they mingle with the crowd and receive deferential treatmentwhen at worship in between bouts of prolonged praying theyll go out and foreclose on a poor widows house god will condemn them
7173565 these rich men have donated a small part of their wealth but this poor widow has given all that she had in gods eyes she has done more than all of them
7173566 to those who have much much shall be given to those who have little little shall be given
7173567 whoever does not engage in procreation is like someone who spills blood
7173568 look at him a glutton and a drinker a friend of tax gatherers and sinners
7173569 if that is the position with husband and wife it is better not to marry
7173570 that is something which not everyone can accept but only those for whom god has appointed it for while some are incapable of marriage because they were born so or were made so by men there aer others who have themselves renounced marriage for the sake of the kingdom of heaven let those accept it who can
7173571 why do you love her more than all of us
7173572 why do i not love you like her when a blind man and one who sees light are both together in darkness they are no different from one another when the light comes then he who sees will see the light and he who is blind will remain in darkness
7173573 let mary leave us because women are not worthy of life
7173574 behold i shall guide her so as to make her male that she too may become a living spirit like you men for every woman who makes herslef male will enter the kingdom of heaven
7173575 ill tell her what to do if she needs telling
7173576 i join the ranks of those who are angry because i have watched as the faith i love has been taken over by fundamentalists who claim to speak for jesus but whose actions are anything but christian
7173577 the religious left is a shadow of what it was in the 60s
7173578 im quite confident that in the struggle for hearts and minds weve got a lot more boots on the ground than they do
7173579 im an evangelical christian who thinks that justice is a biblical imperative
7173580 forgive us the wrong we have done as we forgive those who have wronged us
7173581 as long as you acknowledge jesus christ as your lord and saviour you are
7173582 as far as i can tell that is the main tenet of many born again christians
7173583 its all so simple once you acknowledge that jesus is lord hell walk with you and hell talk with you and hell always say exactly what you need to hear
7173584 lord lord did we not prophesy in your name cast out devils in your name and in your name perform may miracles
7173585 i never knew you out of my sight you and your wicked ways
7173586 an eye for an eye a tooth for a tooth
7173587 when jesus had finished this discourse the people were astounded at his teaching
7173588 dont have children if you cant support them dont have animals you cant evacuate or feed dont live in places that are overcrowded and you cant escape
7173589 if youve never had doubts about your faith then you havent thought about it
7173590 and he walks with me and he talks with me
7173591 jesus survival is revealed right there in the actual gospel account
7173592 there are two completely separate and distinct christianities embedded in the new testament
7173593 the most disappointing and shocking event in jesus entire life
7173594 he firmly believed that if he and his followers offered themselves up placing their fate in gods hands
7173595 up until the last minutes perhaps jesus believed that god would intervene and save his life and openly manifest his kingdom
7173596 the king james bible is the true word of god
7173597 was undertaken with the object of providing english readers with a faithful rendering of the best available greek text into the current speech of our own time and a rendering which would harvest the recent gains of new scholarship
7173598 which in the new testament date only from 1551 and
7173599 if a man goes so far as to have intercourse with her and any of her discharge gets on to him then he shall be unclean for seven days and every bed on which he lies down shall be unclean at first i thought discharge of blood must mean bleeding other than menstrual bleeding but the
7173600 they shall accept responsibility for their sin and shall be proscribed
7173601 is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife on any and every ground
7173602 did moses lay it down that a man might divorce his wife by note of dismissal
7173603 it was because your minds were closed that moses gave you permission to divorce your wives but it was not like that when all began i tell you if a man divorces his wife
7173604 if that is the position with husband and wife it is better not to marry
7173605 that is something which not everyone can accept but only those for whom god has appointed it for while some are incapable of marriage because they were born so or were made so by men there aer others who have themselves renounced marriage for the sake of the kingdom of heaven let those accept it who can
7173606 if your right eye is your undoing tear it out and fling it away it is better for you to lose one part of your body than for the whole of it to be thrown into hell
7173607 what you a jew ask a drink of me a samaritan woman jews and samaritans do not use vessels in common or are not on familiar terms with samaritans
7173608 everyone who drinks this water will be thirsty again but whoever drinks the water that i shall give him will never suffer thirst any more the water that i shall give him will be an inner spring always welling up for eternal life
7173609 give me that water and then i shall not be thirsty nor come all this way to draw
7173610 in saying that you have no husband for although have had five husbands the man with whom you are now living is not your husband you told me the truth there
7173611 our fathers worshipped on this mountain but you jews say that the temple where god should be worshipped is in jerusalem
7173612 it is no longer because of what you said that we believe for we have heard him ourselves and we know that this is in truth the savior of the world
7173613 are we not right in saying that you are a samaritan
7173614 master this woman was caught in the very act of adultery in the law moses has laid down that such women are to be stoned what do you say about it
7173615 that one of you who is faultless shall throw the first stone
7173616 nor do i condemn you you may go do not sin again
7173617 that one among you who is without that sin adultery shall cast the first stone
7173618 the letter kills the spirit gives life you will love the lord with all your heart all your soul and all your mind and you will love your neighbor as yourself on these two commandments hang
7173619 to commit to producing 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
7173620 if money is no object were very close to having no technological obstacles to providing the electricity from solar and wind sources
7173621 if money is an object the 10 year timeline is not realistic
7173622 well be much more able to make solar reasonably close in cost to current generators of electricity if you take into account the lifetime of the system and no fuel charges
7173623 the cost of not trying to reach gores goal will be even greater than seeking to accomplish it
7173624 its going to be a challenge given the limited funding and time
7173625 would deal a devastating blow to the u s renewable energy industry just as it is beginning to take off
7173626 the tax credits are needed to make the projects pan out tep is very supportive of the extension
7173627 my first big break came when i was five years old its taken me more than seventy years to realise that you see at five i first learnt to read its that simple and its that profound i left school at thirteen i didnt have a formal education it has been a long return journey from my two room fountainbridge home in the smoky industrial end of edinburgh opposite the mccowans toffee factory there was no bathroom with a communal toilet outside for years we had only gas lighting sometimes the light in the shared stairway would be out after some desperado had broken the mantle to bubble gas through milk for kicks
7173628 i definitely want to get something bad on the road big enough for all my friends and to scare all the cars away from me im a good driver but its everyone else that im worried about
7173629 why is china being subjected to this humiliating investigation when it has submitted a copy of gymnast he kexins proof of age as required by the ioc
7173630 some of the european and american female athletes look like guys not only in their aggressive manner but in their bone structure body shape and facial features
7173631 should we demand more testing more intrusive and extended investigation than what the ioc has conducted so far
7173632 when you consider the standard of the team its a special honour for me

7173637 as you do to the poorest and most miserable of my brothers you do to me
7173638 its easier to get a camel rope through the eye of a needle than to get a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven

7173642 it was incredibly earnest you said prayer was like having this intense profound longing that you just had to be with that you put the longing in the hands of god in a certain way that it was important to be receptive to the unfulfilled and not fill it or deny it

7173645 cell phone only households are similar to landline households in political attitudes
7173646 people are truthful in public opinion surveys but there are times when the truth is stretched a bit a recent wall street journal story reported that in a 2005 harris poll 58 percent of interviewees told the live telephone interviewer that they exercise regularly but in an online survey only 35 percent reported exercising regularly
7173647 reluctant to say theyre voting against a candidate because of race as a result polls tend to overstate the level of support for a black candidate by five to 10 points
7173648 nearly every national poll interviews only registered voters but some try to identify those people who are most likely to vote
7173649 are considered to be more predictive of the actual election results because about six out of every 10 registered voters will go to the polls in november
7173650 if one day makes such a difference in polls results
7173651 how accurate can polls be three months before an election
7173652 im talking only about scientifically designed polls that use random sampling not internet surveys or other amateur efforts that do not purport to represent an entire electorate
7173653 hey welcome to the not going to give you a heads up on anything so you can now feel free to die repeatedly while you attempt to figure it out isnt that fun

7173662 life was extremely difficult we were poor and we lived from hand to mouth
7173663 my mother was humiliated she took me by the collar and we left the synagogue that was the last time i ever set foot into a synagogue i never had a bar mitzvah and my father who never returned from the front never had his last wish fulfilled
7173664 i am now a rabbinical student and i promise you that if parents do not have the means to make a bar mitzvah for their son i will always remember your story and will not charge the parents for their sons bar mitzvah

7173669 everything has its season and there is a time for everything under the heaven a time to weep and a time to laugh a time to mourn and a time to dance a time to embrace and a time to shun embraces a time to be silent and a time to speak a time to love and a time to hate
7173670 a cheerful external countenance even if his heart is grieving
7173671 instead of listening to the heart we are pressured to chemically silence the heart
7173672 i am not bad or crazy it is normal to feel this way
7173673 while i wait patiently for the pain to fade i can strengthen myself spiritually pray do acts of kindness or engage in other meaningful activities i will be grateful for what i have and humbly accept that whatever i do not have is also a gift from g d to bring me closer to him

7173677 how about a world where there are animals that can be eaten but some will be forbidden and others permissible
7173678 in my research i have found that disease poisons and or emotional stress have one thing in common they all have an oscillating energy pattern if you would like a complete list of foods that have oscillatiing energy patterns read the fourteenth chapter of deuteronomy in the bible the foods moses said not to eat all have an oscillating energy pattern
7173679 we patronize them for their incompleteness for their tragic fate of having taken form so far below ourselves and therein we err and greatly err for the animal shall not be measured by man in a world older and more complete than ours they move finished and complete gifted with extensions of the senses we have lost or never attained living by voices we shall never hear they are not brethren they are not underlings they are other nations caught with ourselves in the net of life and time fellow prisoners of the splendour and travail of the earth

7173684 yes indeed four years ago i respectfully urged the government to increase its effort because this was something very important
7173685 i think this scheme of own the podium program is a very good one for obvious reasons there is a bigger drive for winter sports than summer sports in canada because of the climate and the geography
7173686 i think i should commend the government for what it has done but also the regional governments many provinces have been supportive
7173687 is this enough its up to the canadians to tell not for me im happy to see theres been a positive change but youll have to quantify it yourself i dont believe it will be short term i really believe its going to be in the long term

7173690 we heard allegations about the ages we took that very seriously we asked the international federation to open up an inquiry themselves eligibility of the athletes is the responsibility of the international federations not the ioc but of course we consider this as being a very serious issue
7173691 the u s mint buys direct from the refiners and this suspension of gold eagle sales may be an indication that the supply line is already backing up or that the mint expects that it will back up for the rest of the year i wonder who would give up physical metal at these prices and under these circumstances except distressed sellers the central banks are in a hunker down mode as far as i can determine and its the mines that supply the refiners so if the mint which buys from the refiners is having a difficult time locating metal what does that tell you i keep saying that we may get a surprising rubber band effect later in the year when the pre holiday festival season kicks off in september october it may happen sooner one of our indicators of approaching a bottom in gold is how many calls centennial precious metals gets from our u s based indian clientele heres a quote from my offices report to me at the end of the day today today was a good day there must have been an indian convention where someone was handing out usagold business cards that may give you a clue as to thinking in india proper and probably the rest of the asian rim

7173697 black white world if you dont agree with her then youre a bleeding heart liberal who doesnt deserve to live here
7173698 we should invade their countries kill their leaders and convert them to christianity
7173699 when contemplating college liberals you really regret once again that john walker is not getting the death penalty we need to execute people like john walker in order to physically intimidate liberals by making them realize that they can be killed too otherwise they will turn out to be outright traitors
7173700 failed to uphold the christ like spirit that harding seeks to embody

7173717 the increased number of investigations is providing further assurance that this serious virus is not present in the general horse population across the state
7173718 if you have a concern about your horse you should stay away from it and not hesitate to call because we are here to provide our expertise and support and to take action in cases of concern
7173719 when owners and veterinarians with concerns about a sick horse call us they are supporting queenslands effort to effectively monitor our horse population and combat disease
7173720 japans fertility rate is so dead low that the population is just starting to drop and then it will fall precipitously
7173721 its a major tournament for us so were going to be there and try and move on and do well
7173722 thats why we are putting a 20 year moratorium on all mining activities bulk sampling and exploration over the mcfarlane deposit in the whitsunday region
7173723 the governments oft promoted support for the industries generating queenslands wealth seems to have become hostage to the guerrilla tactics of fringe groups like greenpeace
7173724 what next greenpeace resource sector target will have the queensland government folding under a tiny bit of pressure
7173725 ms bligh has made the right decision to prevent any new shale oil projects from taking place in the state but it is an easy decision the next step is to announce a stop the expansion of the coal industry in queensland
7173726 queensland energy resources proposal came at a time when the worlds scientists are warning that we have as little as 10 years to radically reduce greenhouse pollution if we are to have any chance of avoiding catastrophic climate change
7173727 i dont envy ms bligh given the economic power of the greenhouse mafia but sometime soon she is going to have to make the tough decision to put the future of the state ahead of the vested interests of the coal lobby
7173728 johnny is an out and out goalscorer as well we could change our shape a bit
7173729 i think we need to be versatile you look at different teams and you play them different ways
7173730 and when johnny comes back and poppa captain and centre back tony popovic comes back and forward brendan santalab well have a bit more speed because santa is lighting quick
7173731 it just gives us different options and we need to play different ways against different opposition
7173732 it was fantastic the one touch football we played and little angles and triangles we created in the first half in particular it was great to watch it was fun on the sideline to be honest
7173733 giving them two easy goals but then coming back was great
7173734 and then to lose it with a free kick like that was hard to take because i thought we were dominating the game at that time
7173735 si robinho no quiere jugar me lo tiene que decir a m y no lo ha hecho
7173736 si robinho no se quiere quedar el club le debe buscar una salida
7173737 no mantendremos nunca a un jugador en contra de su voluntad
7173738 el trazado nos gusta a los pilotos porque es seguro
7173739 si robinho no se quiere quedar el club le debe buscar una salida
7173740 si robinho no quiere jugar me lo tiene que decir a m y no lo ha hecho
7173741 el trazado nos gusta a los pilotos porque es seguro
7173742 edward scissor hands is a very sad and wonderful movie
7173743 every movement is blurred im not coming on to you or anything but i love you michelob your a true pilsner
7173744 when you started out you were so full of beer i took everything you had to offer greedily and without thought now i move onto an identical can that carries the same name ill forget you but not because you never had a place in my heart you dont likely understand this i myself only understand dimly but i thought id let you know for whatever its worth
7173745 the indian art market is becoming global and indian artists are now featuring in international auctions quality indian art has an important edge over international art
7173746 some time ago i was speaking to a billionaire from italy who found an indian artist featured in one of the catalogues of a global auction
7173747 he said indian art was so inexpensive if he had to purchase similar work by an american artist he would have to purchase it for 1 million whereas he would be able to buy similar quality art for 50 000 from an indian artist
7173748 the economy has changed anyone can buy indian art be it a sheikh from dubai or collector from hong kong one does not go to the west to validate it
7173749 those were the times when our country was battling several issues and there was no one to validate art but not any more
7173750 the indian art market is becoming global and indian artists are now featuring in international auctions quality indian art has an important edge over international art

7173755 the lord is the portion of my inheritance and my cup you support my lot
7173756 the final decision about use of aspirin must eventually be made after discussion with a healthcare provider
7173757 currently the recommendations in the uk are that aspirin is prescribed after a full risk assessment under medical supervision to those who have established cardiovascular disease
7173758 further robust research is needed before aspirin should be considered as a blanket primary prevention measure in the uk
7173759 its no good sitting there and looking on you have to do the exercises
7173760 it has helped her longevity everyone is amazed by the fact that she got to 100 and that she was in an exercise class
7173761 she was always very active she has always done plenty of walking and she reckons this has kept her fit
7173762 she was the youngest of nine and shes a strong fit woman after my father died she even took up outward bound for the elderly
7173763 we keep phoning the patients to encourage them as the exercise is so agonising but they are so strong minded
7173764 she had a boyfriend at the time with a zimmer frame who could not walk as fast as her though and she was always complaining that he could not keep up with her and how could she do her brisk walking
7173765 it is incredibly important for older people to take regular exercise to stay fit and well in order to maintain their physical and mental health
7173766 exercise can help older people to stay mobile and independent ensure a healthy heart keep weight and stress levels under control and promote better sleep
7173767 short bursts of exercise dont have to be overly strenuous and can make a big difference to an older persons health
7173768 exercise through social activities such as interactive games can also play an important role in maintaining the physical and mental wellbeing of older people
7173769 despite the benefits many older people still arent exercising enough
7173770 the end of faith religion terror and the future of reason
7173771 promises covenants and oaths which are the bonds of human societies can have no hold upon an atheist
7173772 i contend that we are both atheists i just believe in one fewer god than you do when you understand why you dismiss all the other possible gods you will understand why i dismiss yours
7173773 say pat would you mind lending me some of your gold
7173774 people are born so that they can learn how to live a good life like loving everybody all the time and being nice right
7173775 well dogs already know how to do that so they dont have to stay as long
7173776 the helicopter was supposed to fly over the course friday and drop 1 500 numbered golf balls
7173777 he hit me getting in to turn one you know whatever carl will say hes sorry and he didnt want to race that way you know mr ed like well race him that way in the chase if thats the way he wants to race
7173778 it was one of those deals where i couldnt get by him and couldnt get by him and then i had to ask myself would he do that to me and the answer was yes and hes done it to me before
7173779 in the back of my mind i was still thinking about a nationwide race at richmond when he was driving through the field and he pile drove me
7173780 the goal is to first identify the veterans that are among the unclaimed remains out there
7173781 the point man was out in front leading the others
7173782 and in new hampshire theyre walking point on this issue
7173783 as long as were fairly certain no family members are going to come forward and object to it
7173784 as cemeterians we always want to have people have their final resting place at our cemeteries versus on a shelf at a funeral home
7173785 we want to have people buried with the dignity that they deserve
7173786 her family is doing right by claiming her and burying her
7173787 thats one of the most disrespectful things ive ever heard a loved one called
7173788 it just seems nice rather than just scatter them in the woods
7173789 a lot of money has taken over in the series but were doing it the hard way
7173790 im a race car driver and im extremely competitive i feel very good when we beat these big teams
7173791 before and after the race you know what youre up against
7173792 when the green flag drops i dont care if theyre dei or joe gibbs or whoever were a family team and my job is to win races were going to try to beat them we have two very good race cars the problem is we dont have six
7173793 definitely gives me the bug but i dont have the desire to run it fulltime
7173794 id like to run all the tracks close to home
7173795 the championships were way more than i thought id ever do to do it as an occupation i never thought i could do it and winning in loudon 2006 was a big goal of mine
7173796 would i do it fulltime i guess if it was with the right people
7173797 if grizzy former owner steve griswold was involved i would still do it i would like to do more than two or three races a season but thats what the marketing budget allows
7173798 i dont believe we have the equipment these kids have
7173799 but it must be the time we have on the tracks really though these kids do have talent
7173800 we want to win it were not dreaming by saying we want to win it
7173801 i have to tell you he is one of the best i have seen come along in the past 31 years that i have been in the business
7173802 it is great to watch these kids livin the dream especially when you get one like joey who is totally grounded and earns everything he works for
7173803 the main reason i think he has a chance here is that he is old style enough to know the importance of working on his own car and he has learned how to race in our very structured and disciplined system over the past four years he actually knows how to pass people from having to come from out back week in and week out throughout his act career my best guess is that he can be the next craven kind of success story and perhaps even more
7173804 this self described citizen of the world has no foreign policy experience at all
7173805 the selection of biden points to barack obamas weaknesses in areas that show he is unprepared to be president
7173806 transformational leader who can really bring about change we can be a respected nation again with this pair
7173807 a barack obama joe biden ticket brings the kind of experience and balance that is exactly what the country is looking for when people talk about change in washington d c joe biden has outstanding foreign policy credentials that will help restore america to the level the country was at before the devastating policies of george bush and john mccain
7173808 hes an old friend and im so pleased hes back again anything he asks me to do ill be only too glad to do it
7173809 certainly great news for new hampshire senator biden has been coming up to new hampshire for well over 30 years he has great friends and supporters here and has been a steadfast supporter of the new hampshire primary
7173810 bidens a blue collar guy he connects with blue collar people
7173811 hes a real person an ordinary guy who does enormously well with ordinary people who are the majority of the population
7173812 senator biden is a leader and an expert on foreign policy he shares granite staters middle class values of hard work fiscal responsibility and standing up for working families he and senator obama will make a great team to fight for the change our country needs
7173813 im very pleased with barack obamas choice of someone so eloquent so extremely knowledgeable in foreign policy and with such terrific ideas for our role in the world hell be a terrific voice for the middle class
7173814 the democrats will deliver a ticket of experience judgment and intellect with a voice and proven capacity to govern after the last seven years of foolishness near criminal behavior and apparent never ending misjudgment im thrilled to see a top of the ticket that could not be better
7173815 if i were heating this home with oil it would cost me at least 4 000 a year im confident that with the system were using it will cost between 1 500 and 1 800 a year deshaies said
7173816 its a complete heating ventilating and air conditioning system and it only costs 13 500
7173817 were using spray polyurethane for insulation which produces a weather tight envelope for the house said bernier
7173818 i think the commuters are going to be very happy considering we were starting out with no bus service and we were able to come up with an agreement that i think provides enough options for people through the day
7173819 i was surprised to see a decent sized turtle shell appear on the surface
7173820 and on the next lunge i saw the turtles head latched onto one or both of the gooses feet
7173821 i follow your column and have noticed how many times mountain lions have been sighted
7173822 take this for what it is worth last thursday as my kerry blue terrier and i were traveling down huse road in manchester just about 30 or so feet from the powerlines we saw a lion cross the road it took about two strides for him or her to get to the other side
7173823 ive seen the lions in zoos etc and i am convinced that is what i saw
7173824 require that 10 percent of our energy comes from renewable sources by the end of my first term more than double what we have now
7173825 we will get 1 million 150 mile per gallon plug in hybrids on our roads within six years
7173826 i will set a hard cap on all carbon emissions at a level that scientists say is necessary to curb global warming an 80 percent reduction by 2050
7173827 in colonial days when the only fuel we burned was wood
7173828 we dont want to return to marginal rates of 60 or 70 percent
7173829 philadelphia is a good football team and we all know that there were certainly a lot of things we could have done better out there friday but i think it was a good learning experience for us
7173830 there are a lot of things where there are injuries to other positions its difficult right now just because the people that are in there were not executing
7173831 regardless of whos in there were not executing thats the bottom line for us
7173832 those guys are great athletes and good players and those are the types of plays that they can make i have to trust them and give them an opportunity to make those plays
7173833 im still a young player on this team learning every day and trying to grow and staying up to speed
7173834 i think we all need to just work on the little details and worry about getting themselves better and we will start playing more productively as a unit
7173835 we are rapidly approaching the point when students will begin to question the return on investment for a college education
7173836 the price of the degree what customers pay in tuition discounted or not keeps rising this cripples families in debt
7173837 i loved my time at college and dont regret it
7173838 it has small classrooms the teachers knew my strengths and weaknesses and you could walk around campus and the president knew your name
7173839 i am using my analytic and research skills in my job but i am hoping to get something higher paying
7173840 i might go to work for a union but graduate school is out of the question
7173841 can we honestly say that for most college graduates todays diploma has increased ten times in value from their parents diplomas
7173842 i chose psychology based on the subject matter because i am interested in the process of how social and psychological modes shape us
7173843 this will enable me to better pay off my undergraduate expenses absolutely
7173844 i was making more as a cook in the short term but in the long term i was more inspired to work in counseling psychology
7173845 i dont think taking on debt or feeling overwhelmed is abnormal to some degree going through the feeling of being a lost soul is what college is about
7173846 i was just down in south carolina for work and had to speak in front of 200 people and you know i wasnt even scared
7173847 before the community policing unit was working very well however the officers were bouncing all around the city doing different things
7173848 we want our officers to concentrate on a specific area and we want the specific areas to be familiar with these officers
7173849 but theres no blame to go around here its the market for recruiting police officers people just arent entering public safety right now for some reason
7173850 were going to have plenty to talk about with president obama gov lynch sen shaheen and congresswoman shea porter
7173851 the boards basically saying they dont want me as the person in that position
7173852 i can certainly read the tea leaves so to speak
7173853 we have every confidence that the information remained secure absolute confidence
7173854 lgc did not notify workers covered by its benefits programs because we did not want to alarm anybody unnecessarily
7173855 certainly all our members are concerned about their information if there was a chance it was compromised they should have been alerted to that
7173856 if nothing happened then why did they call the concord police
7173857 i dont think youre pushing the panic button when you let people know theres a potential breach that police have been notified about
7173858 some records were mislaid if we have mislaid something like this we have a process where we go on alert to find them and to make sure that nothing is released that should not be and thats what happened here
7173859 texas does not treat new hampshire as well it favors larger states more
7173860 should include only the critical increases that you can strongly defend if you believe budget increases are absolutely essential in one area of your budget then you should recommend reductions elsewhere
7173861 continued innovation and increasingly efficient use of our limited resources
7173862 low taxes are the result of low spending that was my husbands mantra bob clegg has worked for the last 20 years at the local and state level with exactly that philosophy
7173863 after the primary i am absolutely convinced that the pocketbooks of the citizens of the 2nd district will open up
7173864 i know all the mistakes i made and im going to help her avoid them
7173865 i think i must qualify for a supreme court nomination
7173866 were working on the budgets here in town now and i know the people in this town of candia are not going to be able to afford what we turn in theres no money
7173867 weve got homeowners that are going to be losing their homes
7173868 weve got people working two or three jobs trying to make a living they cant afford to pay higher taxes they just cant
7173869 i think all managers and administrators are nervous this year
7173870 its a double edged sword because you have the revenues dropping and then on the other side the people are saying you cant increase our taxes so the money has to come from somewhere or you have to cut services
7173871 it may not be as easy to go get a building permit or pay your taxes or even go to the dump
7173872 will try to defer maintenance for another year until the economy gets better
7173873 the fuel oil and the diesel costs have gone up so drastically theres no way we can try to keep the budget down yet weve got to
7173874 i said people cant afford it and thats before the downturn because i could see this was an issue before the fuel costs spiraled out of control
7173875 any time you have a bad economy people look to lets save money where we can and where we can is closest to home
7173876 a personal or business loan without filling out any paperwork or going through any credit checks
7173877 and then youre talking about increasing costs in so many other areas that people are finding it harder and harder to just tread water
7173878 when you combine that with flat values and a downturn in your local revenues it makes it quite a challenge
7173879 well you sharpen your pencil and you start looking under every rock for things you might be able to defer in different ways
7173880 when peoples personal situations are getting hard they dont really want to see their taxes go up
7173881 in other words no new programs just do what youve been doing and tell us what thats going to cost and well go from there
7173882 theres also the risk that you can eliminate what makes a town a place where people want to live and that will erode your tax base
7173883 keep an eye on your revenue sources and act prudently with that eye
7173884 not fixing anything theyre driving them until they totally fall apart and then junk them
7173885 hey sexy your so fine lets meet up and get a drink then have crazy monkey sex oooohh yeahhh baaabbyyy
7173886 secara bergilir sosialisasi ke tiga desa sudah dilakukan dan terakhir sabtu lalu

7173890 i think thats the first time youve sworn in front of me
7173891 oh 55 in a 45 not too bad she probably thinks im crazy
7173892 rata rata pengunjung tiap malam 10 000 orang mereka bukan saja warga kota bumiayu saja melainkan juga dari kecamatan tetangga seperti tonjong sirampog paguyangan dan batarkawung bahkan dari ajibarang dan wangon banyumas ada yang datang ke sana
7173893 karena di kota brebes setiap peringatan kemerdekaan ada pameran pembangunan dan pasar malam warga bumiayu menuntut acara serupa

7173897 its one of those deals where i couldnt get by him i couldnt get by him and i just had to ask myself would he do that to me
7173898 and he has before so thats the way it goes
7173899 whatever carls going to say hes sorry that he didnt want to race that way but he always does well take it well go on and well race him that way in the chase if thats the way he wants to race
7173900 should not honor those who act in defiance of our fundamental moral principles
7173901 i was raised at a time when the catholic church was fertile with new ideas and open discussion about some of the basic social teaching of the catholic church
7173902 he led me to see that if you cannot defend your faith to reason then you have a problem
7173903 has inspired his advocacy on issues such as genocide universal health care education workers rights and violence against women
7173904 help move our nation beyond the divisive acrimonious and unproductive debate
7173905 catholic and working class roots have been a source of solidarity for him with hard working american families who are suffering the most from the current economic crisis
7173906 any public discussion of whether life begins at conception can only help the pro life cause because the scientific facts are hard to deny
7173907 compared with what we ought to be we are only half awake
7173908 so its going to be like the last time you got this done
7173909 how many dumps did i have to take today i took a lot of dumps today
7173910 i hired a campaign manager to win the servant towel award people like that dont deserve to win it
7173911 however in hindsight i think it might have been better to have told him in front of john macarthur so that dad would just say grace to you
7173912 he told me look we wont be remembering this at your thirtieth wedding anniversary
7173913 of course i start to breathe after somebody passed gas
7173914 jeesh just told a story about being hit on by an old lady
7173915 im like a fountain of wit or the fertilizer of said fountain
7173916 holy crap we lost 99 48 in the season opener i see they stopped worrying about updating the score list
7173917 do you enjoy making people feel retarded you behave like that is your job in life
7173918 stephen sounds so smart when hes on the phone what happens when he hangs up

7173921 well youre her boss and shes your your your whatever
7173922 its hard to fill a gas tank on the shoulder of the interstate in 4 inch heels while someone is mocking you with a camera but thats what happens when you dont think the gas gauge really means it yet
7173923 its been a while since i took geometry its been even longer since you took geometry
7173924 you know what else is strange looking at a total stranger who looks totally familiar then comparing life stories only to realize that you are the only common link it was six degrees of john letoto and it was hilariously awkward i think its fair to say we both blame your camera
7173925 ill be away from my desk invoking a john maneuver
7173926 there are limits on what i will forge for you mr letoto
7173927 the three worst words in the english language as a brother

7173932 being older and still single makes you more single more single than say katie mohler
7173933 were talking about logic and about the law of non contradiction in worldviews and im pretty sure theres a law that says if theres food being given away and letoto is present then letoto is eating
7173934 yeah the pee phrase kept coming out of order something about how he peed in worship it confused me
7173935 i like how we just had an extended conversation about ryans buttocks actually i dont really like that
7173936 thats hawaiian harassment and i dont have to stand for it
7173937 shipping will be extra to hawaii alaska or any of the other non contiguous u s states
7173938 in some northern countries they can use their watches to tell the time

7173944 its like my car was trying to do a yoga pose my car was doing a headstand in a ditch
7173945 the first step is admitting you have a problem the first step is admitting im a stupid haole
7173946 im wondering how lucrative my five star hotel will be on mount doom

7174086 i cant explain the honor of having two quotes on your profile it gives one the sense that they are going to be somebody wow
7174087 can i suck some of your blood so that i can be a pirate
7174088 if i was bored and had a lot of spare time i would count how many pictures of lauren duncan i had on my computer

7174096 the sixty second film isnt about a hard product sell
7174097 the film captures relatable late night antics who hasnt been out with friends and wanted to jump on the counter for a flash dance moment or eat and run its the ultimate in getting chucked
7174098 last week someone left a nice big tv our buildings garbage area with note on it saying it works great just needs a remote i carried it home only to find that the power cord had been cut off the tv had been there less than an hour in the past year i have seen many electrical devices with the cord cut off i always assumed that meant they didnt work ive since been told by two people that the cords are cut off to sell the copper i found on the internet that the price of copper has gone up a lot in the past year so if youve seen cords cut off appliances lately that explains it you might want to advertise any old appliances that you think someone could use rather than leaving them around where their cords are likely to be cut off and if the appliance is really dead you might want to cut the cord off to reclaim the copper
7174099 to link the olympics and politics is just not right

7174101 how much money has been spent on this sale a lot of consultants have been used

7174108 and a battle hymn for the peoples unity against the great enemy of mankind the united states of america
7174109 into every corner of the world the enemy happens to carry it into his home and his centres of entertainment
7174110 wherever death may surprise us let it be welcome provided that this our battle cry may have reached some receptive ear and some other hand may be extended to wield our weapons and other men be ready to intone the funeral dirge with the staccato singing of the machine gun and new cries of war and victory
7174111 no one is stopping people doing weird stuff to each other but they would be strongly advised not to put it on the internet
7174112 tell them to get their heads out of their ass cracks
7174113 the ability to unite people around a politics of purpose a politics that puts solving the challenges of everyday americans ahead of partisan calculation and political gain
7174114 that in a tolerant america your name is no barrier to success
7174115 there are not red states or blue states but the united states
7174116 id rather have jesus than silver or gold id rather be his than have riches untold id rather have jesus than houses or land id rather be led by his nail pierced hand
7174117 do you not know that the unjust will not inherit the kingdom of god do not be deceived neither fornicators nor idolaters nor adulterers nor boy prostitutes nor sodomites nor thieves nor the greedy nor drunkards nor slanderers nor robbers will inherit the kingdom of god that is what some of you used to be but now you have had yourselves washed you were sanctified you were justified in the name of the lord jesus christ and in the spirit of our god
7174118 therefore god handed them over to degrading passions their females exchanged natural relations for unnatural and the males likewise gave up natural relations with females and burned with lust for one another males did shameful things with males and thus received in their own persons the due penalty for their perversity and since they did not see fit to acknowledge god god handed them over to their undiscerning mind to do what is improper they are filled with every form of wickedness evil greed and malice full of envy murder rivalry treachery and spite they are gossips and scandalmongers and they hate god they are insolent haughty boastful ingenious in their wickedness and rebellious toward their parents they are senseless faithless heartless ruthless although they know the just decree of god that all who practice such things deserve death they not only do them but give approval to those who practice them
7174119 only god can judge but that verdict is not pending
7174120 no one can judge me not you and not god
7174121 father joes blog is great fun to read too bad i will have to strike him dead with lightning some day
7174122 right after evening prayer i regularly read his blog and note corrections for my upcoming encyclicals
7174123 before i have my security council meeting each morning i check to see whats new at fr joes blog
7174124 this infidel priest is not funny and is ill informed
7174125 he is a right wing bigot who is anti choice and anti woman the goddess is not happy with his blog
7174126 he is the poorest priest i know always pontificating about things he knows nothing about he is a disgrace
7174127 the invasion is going as planned and soon all the clergy will be pod people from outer space starting with father joe
7174128 never have i met someone who was so opposed to true ecumenism and religious freedom i would like to sacrifice him in my dinner pot and wear his head as an ornament voices like his need to be silenced we should all pray and sup together
7174129 brush the dust of the town off from your sandals
7174130 let he who is without sin cast the first stone
7174131 that obama lingers below the 50 percent mark is a mystery among politicians in both parties it is particularly troubling to democrats who recall past democratic presidential candidates taking a huge lead over the summer before being overtaken or nearly overtaken by a surging republican opponent in 1976 jimmy carter took a 33 point summer lead over president gerald ford and won in a photo finish in 1988 michael dukakis led george h w bush by 17 points after being nominated in atlanta but ultimately lost the election al gore and john kerry were ahead of george w bush in the summer
7174132 i understand feeling as small and as insignificant as humanly possible and how it can actually ache in places you didnt know you had inside you and it doesnt matter how many new haircuts you get or gyms you join or how many glasses of chardonnay you drink with your girlfriends you still go to bed every night going over every detail and wonder what you did wrong or how you could have misunderstood and how in the hell for that brief moment you could think that you were that happy and sometimes you can even convince yourself that hell see the light and show up at your door and after all that however long all that may be youll go somewhere new and youll meet people who make you feel worthwhile again and little pieces of your soul will finally come back and all that fuzzy stuff those years of your life that you wasted that will eventually begin to fade
7174133 and i dont know how or why theyre doing this but im a resident up here and it really dont make sense
7174134 with the vandalism going on up here thats got to stop
7174135 my boundaries have been crossed i have some really good neighbors on our row and for the last three weeks to a month someone has been doing something every day to someones property

7174137 we want people to know that were in this community
7174138 yeah we live in low income housing but we count too
7174139 i had to push the pace to tire the other runners i had to push the pace because my body gets tired in the heat when i slow down
7174140 it feels good to make history here it feels good to make history for kenya and win the gold
7174141 you can see from this tournament how we need to upgrade the level of the judges
7174142 that experience is going to make this experience that much better

7174155 ill have to get up in two aerosmiths and a duran duran
7174156 guys like dan quisenberry kent tekulve and dennis eckersley had a great deal of success
7174157 but for every sidearm reliever you can name that made it you probably can name 10 that didnt
7174158 its not that you have to bust every lefthander inside because if a lefthander can turn on a ball you want to pitch him away it depends on their weaknesses that determines how you want to pitch a guy its a matter of changing speeds and throwing strikes which is the biggest thing about pitching
7174159 i fooled around with it on the side in early may while playing catch and it felt more comfortable
7174160 the more i did it and the lower i got the more comfortable it became
7174161 i may give up two or three miles in velocity but ive added movement my fastball sinks and runs and i can throw it for strikes at the end of the day i liked the stuff i could throw from down there and my arm was healthy
7174162 it was something i did out of necessity early in the year because it was so much easier and less taxing on my arm
7174163 it was something i had to do in retrospect i realized i wasnt where i wanted to be
7174164 being a reliever and having to pitch on random days you need to feel good anything that creates less strain on your arm is good i found i had the best results when i was dropping down
7174165 when he gets on top of the ball that gives it depth it has more of an angle going down ive told him the key is his staying on top when hes coming through the zone
7174166 but whats good about beau is hes very positive on the mound and has an aggressive attitude at this level it looks like he hasnt changed a bit
7174167 when you come up from double a to this level its a big jump because youve got good hitters in this league guys that have been to the big leagues and guys that are on the brink of going to the big leagues
7174168 when youre doing well at the double a level there isnt much you should change especially when youve had success at where youve been
7174169 beau has three pitches he can throw for strikes were not afraid to bring him in a game in any situation
7174170 first off it shows the kids will to make it you can see the kid has a lot of heart the will to make it and wants to pitch in the major leagues i love the attitude he has
7174171 some guys spend more time in the minors than others but i think if he does well the rest of the year and comes back here next year hes going to have an opportunity to get to the big leagues next year at some time
7174172 when you talk about 5 years for most guys theyre in the big leagues by then
7174173 but everybody has a different journey im happy with the one ive had up to this point and by no means is it over im ready to push on through its part of the challenge
7174174 no kid growing up or no kid in high school says hey you know what i want to be a phenomenal triple a pitcher
7174175 i take the attitude i dont like to lose i get frustrated when i give up runs but when youre in this business you have to strive to be the best if youre okay with not being the best then you have no business being in baseball
7174176 its amazing how many club officials read fire brand of the american league
7174177 it isnt a magic trick we work at it and if a product isnt good enough we cancel it
7174178 theyre essentially design geniuses making games easy enough for casual players and deep enough to attract and hook hard core players
7174179 simple to learn difficult to master is the holy grail of game design
7174180 you know a game is ready when management has to send e mails out after lunch begging people to get back to work

7174183 theres no doubt many horse owners are hendra aware and theres been a modest increase in the number of people calling about possible testing
7174184 the increased number of investigations is providing further assurance that this serious virus is not present in the general horse population across the state
7174185 if you have a concern about your horse you should stay away from it and not hesitate to call because we are here to provide our expertise and support and to take action in cases of concern
7174186 when owners and veterinarians with concerns about a sick horse call us they are supporting queenslands effort to effectively monitor our horse population and combat disease
7174187 thats why we are putting a 20 year moratorium on all mining activities bulk sampling and exploration over the mcfarlane deposit in the whitsunday region
7174188 the governments oft promoted support for the industries generating queenslands wealth seems to have become hostage to the guerrilla tactics of fringe groups like greenpeace
7174189 what next greenpeace resource sector target will have the queensland government folding under a tiny bit of pressure
7174190 ms bligh has made the right decision to prevent any new shale oil projects from taking place in the state but it is an easy decision the next step is to announce a stop the expansion of the coal industry in queensland

7174192 its a major tournament for us so were going to be there and try and move on and do well
7174193 johnny is an out and out goalscorer as well we could change our shape a bit
7174194 i think we need to be versatile you look at different teams and you play them different ways
7174195 and when johnny comes back and poppa captain and centre back tony popovic comes back and forward brendan santalab well have a bit more speed because santa is lighting quick
7174196 it just gives us different options and we need to play different ways against different opposition
7174197 it was fantastic the one touch football we played and little angles and triangles we created in the first half in particular it was great to watch it was fun on the sideline to be honest
7174198 giving them two easy goals but then coming back was great
7174199 and then to lose it with a free kick like that was hard to take because i thought we were dominating the game at that time
7174200 theres no doubt many horse owners are hendra aware and theres been a modest increase in the number of people calling about possible testing
7174201 the increased number of investigations is providing further assurance that this serious virus is not present in the general horse population across the state

7174203 when owners and veterinarians with concerns about a sick horse call us they are supporting queenslands effort to effectively monitor our horse population and combat disease
7174204 but your so smart your in like smart math classes you made it farther than me
7174205 having the mental capacity to learn how to do something doesnt make it any funner
7174206 ill tell you what makes me angry seeing my quarterback get off the ground
7174207 thats the thing thats hurting me right now to see carson getting hit
7174208 this was the type of game we kind of looked at as a unit

7174212 fool me once shame on you fool me six times shame on mike brown
7174213 its simply an opportunity for us to see shane and see where he is where it goes from there is wide open
7174214 the only reason youre conscious right now is because i dont want to carry you
7174215 ill tell you what makes me angry seeing my quarterback get off the ground
7174216 thats the thing thats hurting me right now to see carson getting hit
7174217 this was the type of game we kind of looked at as a unit
7174218 we wanted to have a good showing defensively they obviously didnt have their top guns
7174219 he had a good pregame but i wanted to err on the side of caution

7174235 based on your refusal to a debate membershipfirst and the membership at large can only come to the conclusion that unite for strength has no intention on presenting and defending its stance on the myriad of issues facing our union outside of blogging postings on unstructured bulletin boards and the information provided on your web site
7174236 assumes that the only candidates members deserve to hear from in this election are those affiliated with our two slates
7174237 they demanded the new york board rescind their resolution that didnt happen
7174238 they also were whining about how theyre being picked on and not trusted and abused that fell on deaf ears everywhere

7174246 i have seen two of my friends killed i have scars from defending myself with my fists i am good with my fists
7174247 since 1982 we have added 25 million plus jobs in this country we will have a larger pie
7174248 people will be fighting over the pie but thats a wonderful thing even if we grow at 1 percent per year we double the gdp per capita in 75 years the pie will grow enough that everyone will get more of the pie
7174249 i have enormous respect for warren but i have to disagree
7174250 i have already taken into consideration that the pie is going to grow
7174251 i like to buy stock in businesses that are so wonderful an idiot can run them because sooner or later one will
7174252 we need to increase age for full retirement benefits slowly and with warning
7174253 were living longer and were living younger and we need to think about working until 70 rather than retiring at 65
7174254 it introduces risk into a safety net system it is enormously expensive to do and it isnt necessary we can sit down right now and fix it and make social security solvent
7174255 i appreciate his encouragement but i think if i hadnt seen the movie and just listened to him i would think i could ignore the problem a little longer

7174260 jake i see your point about the inherent qualities of a given work but i disagree with some of t
7174261 seems like an awfully cheerful place for lovecraft to be buried i want to see barren tors and mourn
7174262 im sure ill have to repeat this a bunch of times but im getting real tired of the
7174263 13 anthony i noticed the cord going straight up too its because houses only had a few electr
7174264 i think if we dont see a change well be disappointed
7174265 i never thought in a million years that i was ever going to have a problem with working and making money
7174266 it was either pay one bill or pay another or not eat or not have a roof over my head
7174267 hes had a lot of problems paying his loans back and hes spent an awful lot of time out there talking about his problems rather than trying to pay his loans back
7174268 the cases are so harsh in measuring what an undue hardship is that anybody who is working and maintaining any kind of home life has very little chance of discharging these things in bankruptcy
7174269 at the time that people graduate from school almost everybody is technically eligible for bankruptcy because they have debts that exceed their assets
7174270 why would anyone lend you money if you had the option to walk away
7174271 what wed like to see is that people who have made a good faith effort to repay their student loans but for whatever reasons have hit a hard patch or hit a difficult stretch that there be some flexibility
7174272 ive always been curious about why phenomenon are the way they are
7174273 i just keep finding new things to ask questions about
7174274 every business idea has a kernel of a good idea but it isnt always executed well
7174275 a number of people myself included think the settlement sends the wrong message that if you can afford the fines you can stay in business without playing by the rules
7174276 we did not find that mortgage specialists owners or anyone still with the company engaged in any fraud
7174277 its a harsh expensive settlement that establishes clear procedures to ensure compliance going forward
7174278 no consumers were ever hurt either before during or after the alleged misdeeds

7174284 once russia invaded georgia i would have bet it would be sen biden
7174285 so people could get a measure of who i am
7174286 john edwards disgraced himself and his family and put the edwards name on the front pages i knew when that happened i knew the obama campaign had little choice but to not release my name
7174287 i still might not have been the final choice but i think we would have had the opportunity to present our case to the country
7174288 showed that i could go toe to toe with republicans
7174289 but in my book hes a good horse ive observed him under pressure of one sort or another hes a man with very good judgment and very well balanced
7174290 around the first week in july i was driving from waco to dallas when i got a call on my cell phone he said hi chet this is barack obama how are you i almost said yeah right and im john mccain he asked if i would have any problem with his campaign officially vetting me i said id be honored
7174291 it was tempting for me throughout this process to let it leak that i was being vetted because i was the unknown candidate
7174292 i didnt start out this process looking for a new job and i dont end it looking for a new job
7174293 at the tuesday morning meeting with committee staffers biden launches into a stream of consciousness monologue about what his committee should be doing before he finally admits the obvious
7174294 seems to me this would be a good time to send no strings attached a check for 200 million to iran
7174295 it was a very big goal for me to win this title my
7174296 but they all probably know more about proper punctuation and capitalization
7174297 the judge knows no more than what his eyes see
7174298 it was a very big goal for me to win this title my
7174299 i dont know im not worried about that its a great personal accomplishment but my motivation is one reason and one reason only and thats to get to the playoffs and win the world series
7174300 i will take 15 wins and a world series and id be the happiest player in baseball
7174301 it was as hot today as it was in florida at least as humid it was sticky out there
7174302 but i felt like i got stronger as the game went on i was able to maintain myself
7174303 outside of brandon webb there arent too many people pitching better than he is
7174304 i know he set a personal best but he is not satisfied he is one of those guys that has busted his tail to put himself in this position hes been just unbelievable for us
7174305 i didnt have it today when i got to the ballpark i started feeling weird in my stomach
7174306 you can only work out of so many jams against such a good ballclub
7174307 its amazing this is what i get paid to do this is what i live for
7174308 this is all i really want to go out there every fifth day and do my job
7174309 last year battling through this surgery and having this team behind me with their support its meant everything
7174310 ninety pitches in five innings isnt going to cut it every time out i realize that but its a big win for the team right now
7174311 hes in our rotation and thats the bottom line i think it means a lot to him especially what hes been through to be able to come out and contribute at such an important time of year
7174312 obviously he wasnt lighting up the radar gun but you dont have to do that in this game if you hit your spots
7174313 i think he wanted to get out there and prove himself to new york
7174314 thats the most important thing if youre out to prove something to everyone else i think it takes away a special part of being in the major leagues
7174315 obviously theres been a lot going on the last four years i cant ignore that but im still the same person i was four years ago when i go out there on the mound
7174316 the hitter walked toward the dugout to throw his bat and helmet away he in doing so has abandoned his effort to reach the next base
7174317 do the rights of religious freedom and free speech as guaranteed in both the federal and the california constitutions exempt a medical clinics physicians from complying with the california unruh civil rights acts prohibition against discrimination based on a persons sexual orientation our answer is no
7174318 all persons within the jurisdiction of this state are free and equal and no matter what their sex race color religion ancestry national origin disability or medical condition are entitled to the full and equal accommodations advantages facilities privileges or services in all business establishments of every kind whatsoever
7174319 it really is as if california has banned its citizens from having moral consciences
7174320 you must merely obey what the state says you have no right to follow your own moral guide
7174321 these were doctors who did not feel right morally about performing the procedure they actually treated the lady in many aspects but at a certain point said no we cant participate in this for moral reasons because the person is not married and referred her to another doctor who would have provided the treatment but just couldnt do it immediately
7174322 imagine somebody who runs a store for maternity clothing who refuses to serve single women or gay women because the owner believes that it is immoral for such a woman to have had sex let alone to have a child
7174323 up until the 1960s the courts general view was that the free exercise of religion clause in the u s constitution does not give anybody the right to exemption
7174324 discrimination against healthcare professionals on the basis of their sincerely held ethical standards
7174325 rather than striking a more reasonable balance between fair return for effort and tying up information the balance has gone awry
7174326 tengo buenas sensaciones para el partido porque este equipo tiene juego ganas e intensidad
7174327 no veo esta situaci n como una ventaja para el encuentro sino m s bien como una mera informaci n
7174328 el valencia saldr a lo suyo y espero ganar el partido
7174329 jackson is very interesting sort of small towny yet very elegant in its own way
7174330 and the drive through the grand tetons on the way to the park is a great thing even if they didnt stop but just drove through it theyd see the mountains and the views its just incredibly beautiful
7174331 not at all i was a good friend of davids even before he got the role of the doctor and hes the most delightful chap
7174332 plus theres the fact that we come from the same area of scotland
7174333 id love it if the next doctor who was also scottish
7174334 hed crack up the daleks with a few well timed gags then afterwards they wouldnt be so morose
7174335 they might even come to the conclusion that you dont have to rule the universe to have some fun
7174336 after it was cancelled i fought for years to make executives change their minds so its good to know that i was right all along
7174337 luckily ive had my own wee bit of fan fervour last year i was also in stratford acting opposite ian mckellen in king lear
7174338 loads of doctor who fans came along to watch and get autographs afterwards
7174339 i didnt mind that they still thought of me as a time lord
7174340 it just meant that the doctor was steering people towards shakespeare which is no bad thing
7174341 people who listen to the music might think its sweet but in reality its about people being threatened with torture and execution
7174342 although its set in japan gilbert and sullivan were actually writing about the britain of the victorian era
7174343 we were doing a lot of nasty stuff back then with our empire
7174344 these days you could look at the mikado as a piece about american or russian imperialism
7174345 i decided to do it for a bet me and my school friend danny sweeney bet each other that wed go down and tell the local priest that we wanted to train for the priesthood
7174346 my pal chickened out but out of bravado i went through with it then stayed on for four years
7174347 eventually i decided that i preferred chasing skirt to wearing one
7174348 but it made great training for acting since both involve wearing a great costume and performing in front of a captive audience
7174349 i suppose you could also say doctor who is a religious show
7174350 hes a being from outside our world who is willing to risk his own life to save us all
7174351 i was an actor working at the roundhouse in london at the time
7174352 the rolling stones were playing there so i was asked to work the stage as a bouncer
7174353 this was in the innocent days before violence was invented
7174354 so i just danced about the stage next to the band then went for drinks with them afterwards
7174355 so no one better dive onto the stage during the mikado
7174356 or i really will be using my bouncer training to make sure that a few heads really do roll
7174357 tuve dudas sobre mi futuro pero despu s de las vacaciones hable con guardiola y l me coment que confiaba mucho en m y en mi calidad y que pensaba que esta temporada pod a ayudar mucho al equipo
7174358 yo no quer a quedarme solo por quedarme sino para participar no hubiese seguido si no contasen conmigo
7174359 yo viene aqu para ganar t tulos y esta temporada tenemos todo aqu para lograrlos ste ha sido otro aspecto importante para quedarme
7174360 si me quedo me quedo aqu para todo el a o no me gustar a quedarme pensando en qu va a pasar en tres o cuatro meses o si me tengo que ir o no en enero la temporada es muy larga y necesitamos a todos los jugadores pensando en el bar a desde el primer d a hasta el final
7174361 este a o no necesitamos trabajar m s fuerte yo estaba acostumbrado a entrenar diferente cuando llegu aqu pero ahora estamos trabajando muy bien y muy duro desde el primer d a
7174362 porque en una temporada hay 60 70 partidos cada centrocampista tiene una calidad distinta y necesitaremos a todos en la mejor forma
7174363 si robinho no se quiere quedar el club deber a facilitarle salida
7174364 im not against it i dont think its the most important thing for doctor who
7174365 a movie is one 90 minutes a year so yes so long as it never gets in the way of the show if it gets in the way of the show thats appalling
7174366 its been in the cinema with peter cushing it would be good to see it in the cinema so long as its great and fantastic
7174367 its a practical issue this is a show thats hard for even the young super fit david tennant to keep up with it might kill someone over 60
7174368 if the doctor turned into an old man you would be a bit p off even william hartnell the first doctor had trouble back then he was often ill and forgot his lines
7174369 creo que el partido de ma ana va a ser diferente al de la ida porque ellos juegan en su estadio y buscar n tener m s empuje
7174370 al ataque a la contra y con jugadas de estrategia
7174371 ganar un t tulos ser a una buena forma de empezar la temporada
7174372 bonito y ante el que est n cada vez m s concentrados a medida que se acerca la hora del comienzo del encuentro
7174373 no me importa lo que le pase a su rival ya que prefiero centrarme en mi plantilla
7174374 never go in against a sicilian when death is on the line
7174375 never let your name be found in a dead mans trousers
7174376 other towers other turrets protruded from the medieval ch teau they called the temple deceptively religious name but this tower was different larger easily 60 feet in height and black like the inside of a chimney and lord of all its secrets whatever was in there stayed there
7174377 legend has it that if you give vidocq two or three of the details surrounding a given crime he will give you back the man who did it before youve had time to blink

7174383 a veces te van bien las cosas y otras no nos hemos quedado fuera por tan s lo algunas mil simas he ido durante todo el tiempo al l mite pero no ha podido ser
7174384 no hab a m s que sacar hemos ido demasiado justos el objetivo siempre es intentar pasar a la q3 y esta vez no ha podido ser los dem s iban m s r pido que nosotros
7174385 salir desde esta posici n tan retrasada tiene una ventaja y es que podemos elegir la estrategia que queramos podemos arriesgar
7174386 sigo teniendo un coche estupendo lo hemos visto en muchas carreras este a o e incluyo la ltima de hungr a pero esta vez espero tener mejor suerte lo m s importante es que hemos trabajado a fondo con el coche y los simuladores y hemos dado con una configuraci n ptima
7174387 espero volver pronto a lo m s alto del podio y para eso es fundamental salir desde la primera plaza
7174388 es muy complicado hacer la vuelta perfecta porque la pista se encuentra cada d a en unas condiciones muy diferentes
7174389 har un esfuerzo para desprenderse de los jugadores con los que no cuenta y dejar la plantilla en un m ximo de veintid s o veintitr s futbolistas
7174390 queda una semana de plazo y seguro que es m s acelerada que las anteriores pero no quiero pasar de veintid s o veintitr s jugadores para que todos tengan su cuota de protagonismo y se sientan importantes
7174391 con maduro hemos hablado de su situaci n y la est valorando
7174392 estamos trabajando en esta l nea hay mucho por hacer pero vamos a intentar apretar esta semana porque el club est insistiendo mucho en ello
7174393 propusimos al ayuntamiento de valencia que construyeran una pasarela peatonal para comunicar natzaret con el grao y viceversa
7174394 ninguna de esas dos alternativas las han puesto en marcha
7174395 110 000 personas estamos encantados de tener aqu la f rmula uno
7174396 volvemos a jugar en nuestro estadio la primera vez esta temporada ante nuestra afici n y tenemos la posibilidad de ganar un t tulo hemos analizado muy bien el partido de ida donde cometimos errores que dieron m s vida al valencia y es lo que tenemos que intentar cambiar
7174397 es una prueba muy importante para el equipo con un resultado parecido al de champions del a o pasado ante el roma venimos con una derrota corta pero posible de remontar los peque os detalles ser n importantes hay que tener paciencia para no cometer errores
7174398 tendr que traspasarle y que le traspase a un buen precio por el bien de las arcas del real madrid
7174399 para que los que si que queremos estar aqu tengamos un grupo unido y fuerte
7174400 encantado de que un jugador nacional pueda contribuir al real madrid grand simo jugador y adem s amigo m o
7174401 todo lo que no sea hablar de ese trofeo tanto esas noticias como otras no es que creen malestar es que no vienen a cuento
7174402 tener atr s una mentalidad y una concentraci n mucho mayor que el otro d a en valencia
7174403 sabemos que el bernabeu es nuestra casa y es nuestro p blico
7174404 recibiremos cr ticas unos d as y si lo ganamos es que el madrid lo ten a que hacer porque es el madrid
7174405 es ahora mismo un profesional del real madrid y tiene que desvivirse por este club que es el que nos est pagando a todos
7174406 el momento m s importante de mi vida desde que soy jugador de f tbol
7174407 un estiramiento brusco en el partido de cuartos despu s de esperar se ha confirmado una rotura fibrilar del adductor largo de la pierna derecha y del m sculo gracilis lesi n que le impide competir y que necesita dos o tres semanas de recuperaci n
7174408 algo que en un primer momento le dej abatido pero ahora se ha dado cuenta de que puede ayudar al equipo desde el banquillo con otros detalles
7174409 hay que darle tiempo al tiempo todav a no s lo que har pero al europeo de polonia igual voy como comentarista de televisi n
7174410 for thousands of years the human race has been at war it is enough now let mankind for a time at least consort in amity and peace enmity and hatred have ruled let the world for a period exercise love for thousands of years the nations have denied each other considering each other as infidel and inferior it is sufficient we must now realize that we are the servants of one god that we turn to one beneficent father live under one divine law seek one reality and have one desire thus may we live in the utmost friendship and love and in return the favors and bounties of god shall surround us the world of humanity will be reformed mankind enjoy a new life eternal light will illumine and heavenly moralities become manifest
7174411 com todas as vantagens t cnicas e operacionais depois de cinco anos o ziplux lamp ter custado 50 de um poste convencional
7174412 i voted for the property relationships part of the bill because i really felt that the situation there was totally discriminatory
7174413 because i see myself as the elected representative of the people of helensville i try to reflect that in my voting on conscience issues as opposed to a personal vote from my own perspective i had done some polling i wouldnt say it was extensive but i did some polling in my electorate and on the basis of that polling i voted against civil unions
7174414 personally i have no problems with civil unions there was an argument put forward that civil unions would undermine marriage and i never believed that line i have been married for 22 years and the fact that a gay couple may choose to have a civil union would have absolutely no impact on my marriage to my wife
7174415 we have friends who are a gay couple bringing up children i would support any gay or lesbian couple bringing up children i would hope for them what i want for any children and that is for them to give the best parental instruction and love and attention that they can for the children that are in their care
7174416 i think we largely live in a secular society i think there are many religions operating in nz and it is in the best interests of the state to make decisions that are on a secular basis so they dont discriminate im no supporter of these hard right religions for instance i was never offered i would never have accepted any financial support from the exclusive brethren i met them as a constituency mp as i would meet anyone as a constituency mp on constituency issues as i believe its wrong to discriminate but i intend having no contact with the brethren going forward
7174417 i dont care what peoples sexual preferences are its for them to determine that we have friends who are gay and lesbian just as we have dozens of friends who are heterosexual i judge my friends on the basis of the friendship that we have and the support we give each other not on their sexual preferences which as far as i am concerned is their business and their business alone
7174418 you can support us or leave to our fate but if they come for us and all hope is gone we will turn the middle east into a radioactive wasteland until the end of time
7174419 excessive speculation in any commodity under contrasts of sale of such commodities for future deliver causing sudden or unreasonable fluctuations or unwarranted changes in the prices of such commodity is an undue and unnecessary burden on interstate commerce in such commodity

7174488 global steel prices have already softened and if the trend continues it calls for a reduction in the domestic market too
7174489 steel prices have been facing a downturn globally and therefore theres no reason why domestic steelmakers should increase prices also iron ore prices a key input of steel have dropped 15 in the international market which is also preventing metal prices from shooting up further we expect prices to remain more or less stable till december this year
7174490 we dont intend to raise prices currently as prices have softened globally but we are yet to review next months prices well reach a consensus only after examining all the parameters

7174502 were always concerned about al qaeda and like minded groups

7174508 if you believe you cant flood thats when you increase the risk of flooding in new orleans i dont think they talk about the risk
7174509 theyve heightened the levees theyre raised up it makes me feel safe
7174510 this wall here wasnt there when we had the flood
7174511 when i look at it now i say maybe if we had had it up it there then maybe we wouldnt have flooded
7174512 we did go in and did a whole bunch of levee work right after betsy
7174513 we were under the illusion that what we had done would prevent another betsy from flooding the area
7174514 the progress i see each time i visit is really remarkable the region has a better hurricane and storm damage reduction system in place than ever before in its history and it will continue to get better

7174520 were in the job of risk reduction not risk elimination
7174521 strictly relying on levees alone should not give anyone the impression they are risk free i think that would be a horrible mistake to make
7174522 what we learn from history is that we learn nothing from history

7174525 when we got to san francisco i was totally surprised by the misconceptions that people had about wikimedia
7174526 its a charity nobody is making any money from the organization nobody has made any money and nobody will ever get rich from it because were never going to sell it were not open for business were not looking for investment
7174527 i remember saying in november before coming to san francisco that we were as unsophisticated as possible
7174528 now we are competent we have a basic idea of what we are doing and a team coming together to get things done
7174529 sue gardner has really been key in professionalizing the wikimedia foundation
7174530 before sue we operated as a community club now we operate as a community club with sound management
7174531 everybody is grappling with what to do about the decline in the newspaper industry
7174532 when i was in the conventional media we all spent a lot of time wondering what we were doing wrong i dont see it that way at all theres amazing journalism going on at newspapers and at npr to me its a market shakeout or a market correction
7174533 we dont yet know a reason for the decline but we suspect it is due not to the wisdom of crowds but to the increased level of conflict among community members often it is not the one with the right answer who has their say but the one who sticks around the longest and is best able to argue his case
7174534 i dont see any competition direct or indirect that will significantly change wikipedia
7174535 i think our next challenge is figuring out how to really support and facilitate their work
7174536 the bills are getting paid the servers are running theres stationery people have business cards this is a really new model something the world has never seen it deserves new approaches

7174540 when i look at it now i say maybe if we had had it up it there then maybe we wouldnt have flooded
7174541 we did go in and did a whole bunch of levee work right after betsy
7174542 we were under the illusion that what we had done would prevent another betsy from flooding the area
7174543 the progress i see each time i visit is really remarkable the region has a better hurricane and storm damage reduction system in place than ever before in its history and it will continue to get better
7174544 we are in pretty good shape financially to do quite a bit of work in this area
7174545 its almost one of those proverbial you cant get there from where we are situations
7174546 all the human instincts post katrina are the same as post betsy
7174547 we keep building in holes and contractors keep trying to move in and take advantage of a situation they come in with a bunch of contractors sell off property in low places take their money and run
7174548 you see that green spot up there thats below sea level well below sea level
7174549 theres some people going to have dinner tonight out there in new orleans east theyre walking on the floor inside their house at 13 feet below sea level
7174550 were in the job of risk reduction not risk elimination
7174551 strictly relying on levees alone should not give anyone the impression they are risk free i think that would be a horrible mistake to make
7174552 what we learn from history is that we learn nothing from history
7174553 and whats going to happen after katrina pick a name and put it on it and its going to happen again unless we pull together to make sure
7174554 three weeks i dont know what im gonna do man im not ready for a child i dont wanna be responsible for putting another fucked up little kid out there
7174555 yeah youd probably raise a pretty retarded kid i mean look at you man
7174556 youre an ass but yeah i dont know anything about kids
7174557 remember that gerbil you had he died in like three weeks how do you expect to raise an infant
7174558 yeah no shit i cant say i didnt see this coming though i had a feeling she was skirting her b c i shouldve like snuck it into her breakfast every morning wrap that shit in a piece of cheese like a dog
7174559 shes not down for it which brings me to why i came over here in the first place i have a vague recollection of you swearing an oath that if anything like this ever happened youd kick her in the stomach for me
7174560 uh yeah i said it it seemed like the right thing to say at the time i mean you were drunk and crying
7174561 well what you want me kick your girlfriend in the stomach
7174562 no no you can go about it however you want do you own any wire hangers
7174563 yeah my abortion hangers are sitting next to my bottle of chloroform
7174564 dude i feel for ya and ill do what i can but i dont know if im down for scooping a fetus out of your girls uterus
7174565 political opponents would file frivolous complaints against web sites in order to try and shut them down
7174566 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
7174567 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
7174568 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
7174569 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
7174570 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
7174571 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
7174572 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
7174573 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
7174574 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
7174575 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
7174576 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
7174577 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
7174578 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
7174579 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
7174580 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
7174581 im not totally disappointed about this first one because of the fact that it is really the first one the heat really got to them we need more stamina out there and oakton really wore them down
7174582 my defense picked right up and took care of business especially guerro our goalie he did a fantastic job i really believe the score would be a lot different with someone else in there
7174583 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
7174584 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
7174585 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
7174586 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
7174587 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
7174588 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
7174589 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
7174590 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
7174591 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
7174592 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
7174593 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
7174594 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
7174595 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
7174596 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
7174597 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
7174598 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
7174599 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
7174600 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
7174601 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
7174602 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
7174603 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
7174604 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
7174605 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
7174606 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
7174607 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
7174608 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
7174609 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
7174610 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
7174611 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
7174612 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
7174613 yes i want to play in the nfl thats what ive always dreamt about doing i cant picture myself doing anything else i cant imagine working a real job
7174614 id rather play the game and get paid to do it
7174615 if for whatever reason it didnt work out i still would be very pleased to have come here ive had a great time
7174616 youve got to have a break youve got to have a team that needs your style of play and you have to go out and perform
7174617 i use it to excite myself and go out and work harder
7174618 hes a big enough kid there are a lot of good quarterbacks that just arent big enough
7174619 hes got the physical tools hes been productive hes smart and a good leader i think hes got the ability to be a very good backup in the nfl
7174620 i do think hell excel in the system we try and put together for him and i think he has the ability to perform at a high level
7174621 because were from such a small school nationally speaking and havent had anybody since kitna make it to the nfl this is fairly new grounds for central to have scouts coming through here like that
7174622 theres not too many people you can turn to and ask questions concerns its nice having a teammate to talk to about it somebody who knows what youre going through
7174623 the census bureau clearly does not go out and contact people
7174624 you dont necessarily want to bet the farm on the data however we shouldnt be ignoring the data if the economy was booming youd definitely be able to detect it through other data like new business start ups
7174625 its very difficult to recruit new business in a rural area
7174626 a lot of that has to do with what is the it information technology infrastructure
7174627 we certainly arent keeping pace with births and children staying here
7174628 if you looked at these numbers and said everythings fine and you shouldnt do anything you would definitely be off the mark
7174629 in the industrial north most people are geared toward working for somebody else
7174630 by for decades having one big company driving the local economy the question is how do you change the culture of a community
7174631 it doesnt have to be that way but it usually is
7174632 when i talked to some communities what were often told is a rising tide raises all ships during the 1990s there were more people added to the population of the u s than in any decade in history
7174633 and yet we know there were 34 counties in illinois that lost population during that time
7174634 to me at least the answer would be the counties have to depend more on themselves for their own destinies you need to put the infrastructure in place so you can take control of your own destiny
7174635 were concentrating on the downtown and redevelopment were concentrating on our infrastructure and now were making a lot of real good progress so were good for another 100 years a lot of it i think you have got to step up and do it yourselves i think each individual community has to really buckle down and fix things up
7174636 i dont think there are any easy answers to this particular question
7174637 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
7174638 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
7174639 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
7174640 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
7174641 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
7174642 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
7174643 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
7174644 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
7174645 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
7174646 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
7174647 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
7174648 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
7174649 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
7174650 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
7174651 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
7174652 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
7174653 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
7174654 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
7174655 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
7174656 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
7174657 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
7174658 who are open to doing something on the production side

7174663 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
7174664 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
7174665 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state

7174688 it was an exciting feeling at about this time last year i was curious to see where id be going and i was looking forward to getting out there and playing again
7174689 definitely any time you get a chance to play its going to be good the best way you can learn is playing through games it was good to get out there and get my first pro experience out there
7174690 its nice you get mondays off so its got to not have to play every day of the week and at the same time its good quality baseball and you cant beat being in hawaii to play
7174691 yeah id say this is where i thought i could be im pretty happy with the way the year has gone so far but weve still got a good playoff run were trying to make right now
7174692 the biggest jump is just that everybody gets deeper and you get deeper pitching staffs and they can throw different pitches in different counts the hitters one through eight one through nine are all good hitters that youve got to focus on to get out
7174693 its always been a dream it was a dream that i could achieve for an occupation and youve just got to keep working hard and hopefully it works out
7174694 its good they talk but right now im just trying to focus on the second half of the eastern league and get into the playoffs and put some games together there
7174695 i am not doing anything even while i see hear touch smell eat walk sleep breathe talk evaluate accept things and even blink my eyes it isnt me who does all this but sense that are doing these

7174698 theyre kind of surprised that ive been playing with it up to this point
7174699 thats what i want to do thats why this decision is even out there still and not already made because i want to play period the question is what should i do how long should i play with it
7174700 its a thousand different options at this point and im just trying to make the best one
7174701 im just trying to make the best decision possible for the team and for my career
7174702 right now in talking to him his mindset is hes doing everything he can to get ready for carolina our opener
7174703 he just wants to get a little bit more information on his knee

7174715 it is a law that the people at whom it is directed believe is unjust and unfair and discriminatory
7174716 as the mother of a daughter who is close to entering college it is deeply disappointing to me that many of our education leaders would support an initiative without doing their homework on the underlying research and science parents should think twice before sending their teens to these colleges or any others that have waved the white flag on under age and binge drinking policies
7174717 i just want to wake up in someone elses arms
7174718 you put your nets out but still you chose to do without
7174719 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
7174720 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
7174721 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
7174722 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
7174723 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
7174724 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
7174725 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
7174726 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
7174727 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
7174728 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
7174729 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
7174730 theres something intrinsically classy about aimee mann class isnt a description one feels inspired to use much these days but theres not a moments hesitation when it comes to this gifted chronicler of the human condition shes able to take discontent and armchair philosophizing and wrangle them into compact dissertations on what makes us tick
7174731 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
7174732 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
7174733 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
7174734 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
7174735 thats probably our biggest question mark but we have some good skilled players to put back there
7174736 well try jesus crawford back there because hes fast and j w forte is a four year starter i think hes going to have a big year for us and joe conti is a solid quarterback i think this reminds me a lot like when we had darryl doe and gennaro leo in 2001

7174739 this is basically what were doing going into old cemeteries and locating burials then documenting whats on the tombstones
7174740 the saddest thing about these old cemeteries is there are more kids than adults many times youll find a whole family all died in a year illness swept through the household probably
7174741 it just makes me feel good to think i might help someone locate a family member
7174742 did yall hear that this guy from tesla knows my name
7174743 weve got a couple of shoulders that look like they will impact on next week in berrick barnes and daniel vickerman theyre unlikely to be available
7174744 it wasnt an easy situation to go into but he certainly relished the opportunity hes been waiting for it hell be much better for it
7174745 the key now is can we back up and therell be many who would suggest we cant
7174746 the history would suggest that also but well get a great opportunity to do that this week and thats what well concentrate on
7174747 we know that we have to better next week but we want to be better and we want to back up because its something that we havent done
7174748 i think its a reflection on how much they guys gave to secure that victory and then also that our feet hopefully are planted on the ground
7174749 we know that this is a two match tour and were very happy with what we achieved today and rightly so but another challenge awaits us in seven days
7174750 its been commented on before the fact that with so many guys that havent got that baggage with us i think that helps
7174751 its easy sometimes when youre sitting behind the glass a long way away with a pen not to have any real sense of the games physicality deans said
7174752 i think sometimes looking through the tv screen and looking from a distance we dont have a sense of that the boys got up and met that reality

7174800 were going to get an mri and well have a stronger evaluation for you sunday
7174801 all we pretty much had to do is run we didnt have to make many cuts
7174802 if youre going to take a whipping like this get it out of way now and come back and respond
7174803 i had a little bit more confidence tonight and especially when one of your first runs is a big run it builds confidence
7174804 but i think what you saw was the explosiveness of both backs
7174805 its great we love to celebrate we were 1 15 last year and we really got away from all that enjoyment of winning and things like that so just to go out and get two preseason games under our belt we just need to continue and push this into the regular season
7174806 with a guy like ted hes got something that you cant coach and thats speed
7174807 its so important to have speed its so hard to score with 12 and 15 play drives on a consistent basis you have to have that quick fire power to be able to score on a big play and ted has that
7174808 i think to put two games together back to back like this we didnt have the best week of practice we fought through and we didnt give up
7174809 to come out here and play ball like this i think were starting to believe in what were doing
7174810 i think these guys are embarrassed about the way they played
7174811 anytime you get shut out if youre an offense youd better be embarrassed
7174812 we dont know the exact severity but he is moving around
7174813 the signs are good but its a scary thing were praying for him obviously but we do have good news from the standpoint that he is moving around
7174814 we dont really talk about monkeys off our back in the preseason
7174815 its pretty much a practice and weve been having great practices we still have to do it against philly in the opener so we cant get too excited about a couple of drives
7174816 i felt i got a foot down but at the same time im not the referee and they made a call off judgment
7174817 i just tried to tell them that i was in i didnt bobble it at all
7174818 i think guys are starting to get it we didnt prepare any different this week than last week its just things worked
7174819 it pushes us back you had a hope or a thought that it could get answered tonight with troy but he didnt have an opportunity to prove that so were still looking to make that decision as we go
7174820 it was a really good chance for me to get in there and get my feet wet
7174821 there were things i would have liked to have done better it was a great learning experience
7174822 whats the last two digits of your social security number
7174823 eh minor details my good sir well figure something out
7174824 marcos is and will be a very important player for villarreal
7174825 this club is doing very well and he is vital to this project as well as that we wants to continue here so we have made the effort to keep him with us
7174826 the new rules are always going to take a bit of time for people to accommodate for
7174827 stuey and im not defending him but he probably isnt aware with how serious the ffa and the referees are about verbal challenges to their decisions because he hasnt been here
7174828 as much you can talk to them about it unless someone actually experiences and sees something its a bit harder to absorb
7174829 but he knows well and truly how its going to be in the future and his head is down because he had a good game
7174830 the player didnt play because he wasnt in the right condition this is what he told me before the game when i spoke to him
7174831 well have to wait and see speak to him then make a decision some players can play under these conditions others can not berba is in the latter category
7174832 djibril only trained with us on friday so i put him on the bench
7174833 its good to look behind me and see him there he gives us good options if things arent going our way
7174834 someone told me he scored on his debut for liverpool but i couldnt care less what he did in the past
7174835 this is a good result for us especially given our away form last season but we wont be dancing in the streets of sunderland just because we have beaten tottenham away
7174836 to lose our first two matches is obviously not good
7174837 at 1 1 we had three further chances to score but we did not take them it just was not to be
7174838 i dont think any side will break into the top four this season
7174839 the strength in depth of the top four teams is great chelsea and united are even further out of reach
7174840 the options that they have on the bench are frightening however i do think you can beat those teams on any given day
7174841 im absolutely flattered that my name is being mentioned about managing the great britain team
7174842 would i take it if they offered it to me absolutely i would be a fool not to
7174843 ive had some great managerial jobs during my career but there is no doubt this would be the icing on the cake
7174844 were not really looking to bring in new players but we might do if there is something that is a good deal
7174845 we are always looking for good deals and good players
7174846 but we had mcdonald and hesselink playing the last few games and they only scored one and they didnt play against falkirk and we scored three
7174847 his injury came as a surprise to us as he trained on friday morning i thought there was something wrong with his ankle but its his abductor muscle so weve got to have a look at that
7174848 he might be fit for next week well see how he reacts in the first couple of days as hes a strong lad
7174849 i have not selected him as i do not think that he is focused enough and i do not feel that he will be good for the dressing room and the team effort
7174850 it doesnt matter how good a player is if he is not in the right frame of mind then he will not perform well the only thing i concern myself with is picking the best team to try and win the game
7174851 i shall talk to the player tomorrow he is our player and we shall work with him at training

7174856 this was the type of game we kind of looked at as a unit
7174857 we wanted to have a good showing defensively they obviously didnt have their top guns
7174858 he had a good pregame but i wanted to err on the side of caution
7174859 im excited about where hes at right now but i held him back we didnt want to go through the scenario of him having a setback

7174867 what lisa means to this team both this year and usa basketball in general i think the gold medals kind of speak for themselves
7174868 i dont know many teams that could have their starting two and three guard go out with foul trouble and still go up 20 points in the first half
7174869 its been an honor for me to represent my country and obviously now in my fourth olympics to have four gold medals shows a level of dominance that ive been able to participate in with so many great players
7174870 i deserved that my fault he had the right to do that
7174871 by building strength we are aiming to improve the quality of life of older people and allow them to maintain independence into later life
7174872 we saw some very significant increases up to 50 percent in muscle strength and power

7174875 the final decision about use of aspirin must eventually be made after discussion with a healthcare provider

7174878 its no good sitting there and looking on you have to do the exercises
7174879 it has helped her longevity everyone is amazed by the fact that she got to 100 and that she was in an exercise class
7174880 she was always very active she has always done plenty of walking and she reckons this has kept her fit
7174881 she was the youngest of nine and shes a strong fit woman after my father died she even took up outward bound for the elderly
7174882 we keep phoning the patients to encourage them as the exercise is so agonising but they are so strong minded
7174883 she had a boyfriend at the time with a zimmer frame who could not walk as fast as her though and she was always complaining that he could not keep up with her and how could she do her brisk walking
7174884 it is incredibly important for older people to take regular exercise to stay fit and well in order to maintain their physical and mental health
7174885 exercise can help older people to stay mobile and independent ensure a healthy heart keep weight and stress levels under control and promote better sleep
7174886 short bursts of exercise dont have to be overly strenuous and can make a big difference to an older persons health
7174887 exercise through social activities such as interactive games can also play an important role in maintaining the physical and mental wellbeing of older people
7174888 despite the benefits many older people still arent exercising enough
7174889 we would urge any older person who is willing and able to exercise to find out what classes are available locally or introduce an easy activity such as walking into their lifestyle
7174890 i deserved that my fault he had the right to do that

7174911 however public expenditure as a share of gdp has not stabilized

7174995 in comparison the four stroke motor is complex and heavier than its two stroke equivalent the upper part of the engine is the head which holds the intake and exhaust valves driven by camshafts engine power comes from petrol shot into the engine via injectors
7174996 the lubrication of the two strokes engine crankshaft and connecting rods is entrusted to the fuel the power is normally governed by a carburettor that has a mechanical operation typically controlled by the depression created by the movement of the piston
7174997 the lubrication of the various mechanisms of the four strokes is entrusted to oil and this can be collected in a reservoir built in the lower part of the engine called a sump which can either be a dry or wet sump depending on whether the oil is collected in a separate tank
7174998 to give the two stroke more flexibility exhaust powervalves were adopted to broaden where the power and torque came in giving more drive when you opened the gas
7174999 the differences on the track were that riding the two strokes smoothness on the throttle and through the corner was the best way to ride and the bike had almost no engine braking and the weight of the machine was lower too
7175000 with a 500 the acceleration phase was the most delicate operation because the violence with which the power came in meant that rider error would lead to sudden loss of adhesion of the rear tyre and a subsequent classic high side

7175014 he shifts from periods of anxious futility to self deprecation and despair both characterized by a demanding irritability and bitter discontent
7175015 we already talked about all this stuff for six sessions when i was at piney ridge get over it
7175016 robert has so many issues that he may never be ready to return home
7175017 the stepmother also has a lot of issues she is dealing with and may never be ready to have robert return home either

7175060 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
7175061 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
7175062 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
7175063 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
7175064 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
7175065 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
7175066 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
7175067 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
7175068 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
7175069 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
7175070 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
7175071 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
7175072 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
7175073 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest

7175083 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce

7175094 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
7175095 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
7175096 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community

7175142 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
7175143 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
7175144 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances

7175146 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
7175147 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
7175148 this is a planning took where all things are going
7175149 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
7175150 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
7175151 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
7175152 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
7175153 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
7175154 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
7175155 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
7175156 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
7175157 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
7175158 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
7175159 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
7175160 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
7175161 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
7175162 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
7175163 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
7175164 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
7175165 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
7175166 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
7175167 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
7175168 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
7175169 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
7175170 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
7175171 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
7175172 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
7175173 enterprise customer directs customer to drive car with unsafe spare tire 400 miles driver has near fatal accident
7175174 i think its a great choice i really think he put politics aside to go with the best qualified person im sure there was a lot of pressure to go with someone whod be able to carry a particular state ive met senator joe biden on a number of occassions and i think hes very respected but hes very combative thats a contrast with senator obama whos hesitant to get aggressive
7175175 the people have proved that when they cannot countenance allotting 800 kanals of land to non state individuals or institutions they cannot keep the entire paradise of kashmir under indian occupation for long
7175176 the cry for freedom and the right of self determination has been raised by the people on their own and it is the people who have launched the movement
7175177 india is misleading the world by portraying the current upsurge as an issue of land a fight for opening roads and an agitation against the economic blockade therefore it is necessary to counter this propaganda by passing a resolution which would also send a clear message to the world community
7175178 the ujc has unanimously decided that there will be absolutely no militant activities wherever rallies processions and marches take place in the valley and militants will not be allowed to display arms
7175179 militants active in the field for the past 20 years have been ordered to keep their guns silent in view of the mass movement and under no circumstances undertake operations in civilian populated areas that might give the indian forces to open fire or perpetrate violence
7175180 according to the decision the militants have been strictly told to join the mass rallies to demand freedom without displaying arms
7175181 with deep respect and humility i appeal to the hurriyat leadership to display large heartedness in accommodating each other and carrying everyone along
7175182 so long as the leadership is united the people are with them but if heavens forbid indian investments pay off and the leadership disintegrates nothing will save them from public wrath
7175183 in order to rectify past mistakes the leadership should take all along who are sincerely in favour of siding with the present movement the leadership should leave no scope for elements to shoot holes in the unity on the basis of minor differences
7175184 the top ranking leadership is united which is a good omen but now it should act generously by embracing those who want to want to move forward with the movement their past misdeeds should be forgiven
7175185 but if they still continue to harm the movement they should be given such punishment as would acts as a deterrent and warning for others
7175186 this is not the final solution of the kashmir issue but an initial step the road should not be like the srinagar muzaffarabad bus service but operational throughout the year and kashmiri fruit and other products should reach markets in central asia
7175187 it would include refusal to pay taxes and refusal to work in government offices
7175188 they have begun talking in terms of freedom on seeing the current public mood but on the other hand they are keeping up their tawaf pilgrimage or circumambulation of delhi which reflects their double dealing
7175189 efforts should be continued to rope them into the movement but if they do not change their tack despite these endeavours then social boycott could be a measure of last resort
7175190 if they the pro india leaders severe their ties with india and join the ranks of the movement they can be given even better positions
7175191 the invitation for talks should be to resolve the kashmir issue there is no harm in talking if it is a trilateral process where pakistan and the people of kashmir are included as primary parties
7175192 talks between india and pakistan which sideline kashmiris cannot solve the kashmir issue nor can the kashmiris accept a solution arrived at through the bilateral process
7175193 i think its a combination of a lot of different dynamics working together well
7175194 they see police taking command of the neighborhood they feel that theres a possibility that if i go around the corner and smash in somebodys window or kick in somebodys front door these officers are going to be on top of them
7175195 the people that i talk with have said that they feel that theres a lot less going on now than there has been in many years
7175196 it needs to be less yet but theyre working on it
7175197 and i know that theyre doing a really good job on it because you complain about something and its addressed quite rapidly
7175198 you cant change america if you sign on to bushs scheme to privatize

7175270 i think we were guilty in the last 15 or 20 minutes of perhaps trying too hard to cling on to the lead and maybe change the type of play that had got us into the lead
7175271 but i think thats fairly understandable were playing one of the top teams in the country
7175272 ive seen two aspects of fulham which i think will be very useful for us in a long hard season
7175273 ive seen the fulham that can play with composure and ive also seen the fulham that when backs are against the wall can produce the necessary fighting spirit
7175274 i think fulham started the game stronger than us and was sharper in the first half although i dont think they created many chances if you look at the whole game
7175275 but they had a corner and they took advantage of it in the first half we were not sharp enough not fast enough on the ball
7175276 i think we were too nervous in the last 25 minutes and wanted too much to create on our own instead of keeping calm we were not at our best today in midfield thats for sure

7175404 that is an increase of about 150 percent over the last six years

7175472 christs faithful have the right indeed at times the duty in keeping with their knowledge competence and position to manifest to the sacred pastors their views on matters which concern the good of the church they have the right also to make their views known to others of christs faithful but in doing so they must always respect the integrity of faith and morals show due reverence to the pastors and take into account both the common good and the dignity of individuals
7175473 the catholic church is the only thing which saves a man from the degrading slavery of being a child of his age

7175517 i did what i came here to do and that was to catch a limit every day i figured if i did that id win and i didnt
7175518 when i put in the boat i noticed the water was up trees were flooded on the bank
7175519 i like it because you can skip it under the brush but in the tournament on the first day i felt the fish werent hitting the jig right they were hitting hard and fast i was getting bites and missing i missed the first four or five bites i had the fish were pretty good size too
7175520 when they hit that worm it has the scent in it and they hang onto it it was definitely the bait its rare to be able to do something like that stick to one bait for four days in a row but i caught so many fish on it
7175521 its loaded with fish you can catch 50 bass before 9 oclock in the morning and any way you want to so you can learn new techniques really fast
7175522 on one hand im disappointed this was a once in a lifetime opportunity i was in a position to win a million dollars and i may never be in that position again

7175526 the speaking fee for musharraf would be in the 150 000 200 000 range for a day
7175527 plus jet and other v i p arrangements on the ground
7175528 if we did multiple events in multiple cities musharraf could get closer to the 500 000 to 1 000 000 range for a series of talks
7175529 people automatically assume that if it weakens the hazards go down with it but in the case of rainfall its not a function of wind speed
7175530 this is unprecedented in terms of the slow nature of this storm the large circulation and the fact that its impacted probably about 90 percent of the state with heavy rains and severe weather
7175531 theres no doubt that there was one thing that the two parties agreed on getting rid of musharraf

7175533 the army wants the government to lead and take the political responsibility for going after the extremists so that the armys present unpopularity does not get worse
7175534 but mr sharif has no intention to become the cats paw of the army while mr zardari so far cannot hammer out a common coalition position
7175535 wants no concessions to the army and offers no support to the war against taliban extremists aware of his right wing vote bank he has little time for american demands
7175536 we have to also be offering a long term partnership with pakistan pakistani leaders suspect that if we succeed with al qaeda we will pull away from pakistan
7175537 weve done little to assure them that we see something beyond this very focused effort on terrorism
7175538 there is no escape from the fact that pakistan will be better off with a civilian government than a military dictatorship by and large the administration has accepted this
7175539 pakistan will become completely a democracy when there is civilian ownership of the security apparatus and foreign policy

7175599 has come to be the aquinas the augustine and the aesop of contemporary evangelicalism
7175600 to continue the legacy of c s lewis a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump
7175601 for we have good reason to believe that animals existed long before men for long centuries god perfected the animal form which was to become the vehicle of humanity and the image of himself eventually god caused a new kind of consciousness to descend upon this organism
7175602 but he man remains still a primate and an animal
7175603 if you mean simply that man is physically descended from animals i have no objection
7175604 he made an earth at first without form and void and brought it by degrees to its perfection
7175605 pregnancy has been long and painful and anxious but it has reached its climax
7175606 i have therefore no difficulty accepting say the view of those scholars who tell us that the account of creation in genesis is derived from earlier semitic stories which were pagan and mythical
7175607 when the consequence is drawn that since we are totally depraved our idea of good is worth simply nothing may thus turn christianity into a form of devil worship
7175608 from ours not as white and black but as a perfect circle from a childs first attempt to draw a wheel
7175609 into a higher form of human culture new age boldly rejects the biblical teaching that mans heart is desperately wicked and deceitful above all else jeremiah 17 9 total depravity was rejected by lewis
7175610 if we were totally depraved we could not know ourselves to be depraved
7175611 experience shows that there is much goodness in human nature
7175612 there are people in other religions who are being led by gods secret influence to concentrate on those parts of their religion which are in agreement with christianity and who thus belong to christ without knowing it for example a buddhist of good will may be led to concentrate more and more on the buddhist teaching about mercy and to leave in the background though he might still say he believed the buddhist teaching on certain points many of the good pagans long before christs birth may have been in this position
7175613 there are three things that spread the christ life to us baptism belief and that mysterious action which different christians call by different names holy communion the mass the lords supper
7175614 this new life is spread not only by purely mental acts like belief but by bodily acts like baptism and holy communion
7175615 there will be every occasion for being the sort of people that we can become only as the result of doing such acts here
7175616 often makes prizes of humans who have given their lives for causes he thinks bad on the monstrously sophistical ground that the humans thought them good and were following the best they knew
7175617 my sheep hear my voice and i know them and they follow me
7175618 his prayers for the dead belief in purgatory and rejection of the literal resurrection of the body are serious deviations from biblical christianity
7175619 there are people a great many of them who are slowly ceasing to be christians
7175620 a christian can lose the christ life which has been put into him and he has to make efforts to keep it
7175621 the point is not that god will refuse you admission to his eternal world if you have not certain qualities of character the point is that if people have not got at least the beginnings of those qualities inside them then no possible external conditions could make a heaven for them
7175622 all the scriptural imagery harps crowns gold etc is of course a merely symbolical attempt to express the inexpressible musical instruments are mentioned because for many people not all music is the thing known in the present life which most strongly suggests ecstasy and infinity crowns are mentioned to suggest the fact that those who are united with god in eternity share his splendor and power and joy gold is mentioned to suggest the timelessness of heaven gold does not rust and the preciousness of it
7175623 every shutting up of the creature within the dungeon of its own mind is in the end hell
7175624 i have the deepest respect for pagan myths still more for myths in the holy scriptures

7175626 wed wait 12 hours to get into our homeland that wont keep us from coming back
7175627 it has gotten so bad we only have two eucharistic ministers for every one parishoner
7175628 i can remember the days when we had more people up here with the priest than we had people in the pews
7175629 i guess people are just more interesting in praying in their pews or contemplating christ or something whatever that means
7175630 ive heard at one parish that the priest actually distributes communion by himself now
7175631 people need to know about the rich spiritual heritage eucharistic ministers have
7175632 why i believe saints peter and andrew helped jesus distribute bread and wine to the other disciples at the last supper well at least that is what i am telling people anyway
7175633 the first thing parishoners will notice when they go up to receive communion is this button it will remind them whose presence they are in
7175634 back when catholics used to believe these hosts were actually jesus body nobody but the priest would be allowed to touch them but now that we have advanced in our wisdom and knowledge we are now allowed to do almost as much as the priests do
7175635 michael if you were on a date having dinner with a nice young lady how would you tell her that you have to go to the bathroom
7175636 im sorry but i really need to go to the bathroom ill be right back
7175637 but its still not very nice to use the word bathroom at the dinner table
7175638 and you little eddie can you use your brain for once and show us your good manners
7175639 critical programming error that can cause votes to be dropped while being electronically transferred from memory cards to a central tallying point
7175640 we are unique in that we do everything here in g p r s and we dont send it out and each brace is fit for that particular patient from the beginning initial visit to the fitting to the follow ups everything is done here in our shop
7175641 what were able to do then is vacuum form the rest of the air out of the bag to make a hard impression of them and at that point well use a digitizer which more or less takes this digitized mold and puts it into the computer which in turn then we have a 3d version of that seating system

7175645 the authoritys work is too important and we needed to move forward past the deadlock
7175646 vivian and i can work together we both have our ideas about projects and committee appointees but most of all it will be an opportunity for vivian and myself to move the tda forward
7175647 the viaduct is clear of debris and initial assessments to date suggest there has been no damage to the viaduct
7175648 the viaduct will remain closed and the exclusion zone in place until further notice
7175649 the expectation here of people who were feeling whether they were for or against the tower the expectation of it coming down and an old chapter ending and a new one beginning suddenly has turned to concern
7175650 particularly what does this mean for the m1 can the m1 reopen what does it mean in terms of getting the rest of that half of the tower down because its not a small amount thats still standing
7175651 what i understand is that a little bit more of the tower has now fallen in on itself and work on the site to get it down as fast as possible has already started
7175652 the whole focus is to get the m1 open as fast as possible and of course thats what people are working on at the moment
7175653 they would require a very very significant investment and fundamentally speaking we are an energy company and our job is to keep peoples lights on
7175654 this demolition is a unique situation and as far as we are aware nowhere else in the world has anyone sought to bring down similar structures that sit so close to a major highway viaduct
7175655 we will carry out a series of checks to ensure that there has been no damage to the viaduct which in itself may take several hours
7175656 we will reopen the road only when we are entirely satisfied that it is safe to do so
7175657 you see very few cooling towers that are in quite such a visible position theyre 12 metres from the m1 and they kind of symbolise not only a gateway to sheffield and yorkshire but they also symbolise a gateway to the north
7175658 theres lot of work involved in a new tour a new stage configuration and lighting has been be going on for the past couple of weeks
7175659 the benefit for us is that we have a retractable roof so weve been unhindered by the horrendous weather weve been having

7175676 no objection to members of the myanmarese community in singapore pursuing their political activities so long as they abide by our laws indeed the police has approved and facilitated many such activities conducted through lawful means
7175677 obp has chosen to do so in open and persistent defiance of our laws obp members were investigated by the police for staging a number of illegal protests the authorities have chosen to issue several of them with a warning for their offences instead of prosecution so as to give them a second chance
7175678 regrettably this leniency is not appreciated some of the individuals concerned in the obp continue to maintain a position that suggests they see themselves being above the law which singaporeans observe
7175679 the obp members have ignored repeated advice from the police to act within our laws a
7175680 the right of a foreign national to work or stay in singapore is not a matter of entitlement or a right to be secured by political demand and public pressure

7175688 i chose the name golden night for the live concert to create an impression and it will be really impressive it is not easy to bring 12 keyboards and pianos to the stage they are gold each musical instrument is priced at least 1 500 and it takes time to transport and set up these instruments so isnt it a golden night
7175689 no me conformaba he arriesgado y volver a a hacerlo
7175690 si salgo de atr s adelante pod a haber peleado un puesto de finalista pero no me conformaba he arriesgado y volver a hacerlo s que me quedan pocas oportunidades de estar peleando con los grandes o de conseguir alguna medalla y si no lo intentas no lo vas a conseguir
7175691 en los primeros 5 kil metros me he encontrado muy bien pero estaba deseando ver en qu momento dejaban de ir en sexta y met an la cuarta para reducir y no contaminar pero no hab a forma
7175692 la temperatura no ha sido determinante que era yo quer a porque sab a que en condiciones normales esta gente es mejor que nosotros y es muy dif cil al ritmo que han salido no tenemos posibilidades de nada lo he intentado y cuando uno intenta y da todo lo que tiene y pelea no se le puede pedir m s
7175693 en los primeros 10 kil metros he quemado muchas naves y del 10 al 15 que quemado a n m s de lo que ten a que haber hecho

7175698 well you can say that im the one curly fry in the box of the regular
7175699 bidens not my fantasy vp choice or close to it but nonetheless pretty good better than many of the other floated names
7175700 bidens not a horrific pick hes fine considering the choices
7175701 biden wasnt my favorite choice for the gig but he was far from my least favorite choice either
7175702 any pick designed to cover up a flaw in obama i e lack of foreign policy credentials only accentuates those flaws
7175703 if obamas core message is change and judgment based on his prescience on the iraq war vote well then biden is the exact opposite of those things
7175704 extremely well suited to be an aggressive attack dog running mate
7175705 given obamas reluctance to play the partisan card it should be fun having a real pit bull in the number two position to do some of the necessary dirty work
7175706 never get into a wrestling match with a pig you both get dirty and the pig likes it

7175732 i had as tough a race as everyone else when i saw the chance to make the break i went for it after that i really gave it everything i had
7175733 it was a really hard last lap but i knew that i could beat him sauser on the climb and thats what i managed to do
7175734 after that i fought hard to hold him off though the last 15 seconds was quite nervous

7175738 the olympic games is a massive motivation for every athlete and four years passes quickly as it has from athens to beijing
7175739 so why not but right now i just want to savor this gold
7175740 its great to do the double it feels totally different from 2004 but this just confirms what i achieved in athens
7175741 i had as tough a race as everyone else when i saw the chance to make the break i went for it after that i really gave it everything i had
7175742 i feel pure joy at what i have finally achieved after so many years of hard work
7175743 winning the gold medal at the olympic games is the crowning glory
7175744 the race was terrible and in the first four minutes i had a puncture
7175745 i had to wait 20 minutes before i could change my tire and then i had another puncture

7175756 east nashville is one of the coolest places to live
7175757 i was out in the backyard the other day and i heard some music i started looking around and i saw peter on the roof with his violin tripod and camera he was doing a promo shoot for his new album
7175758 so kind of tongue and cheek we did this tomato art show and 1 000 people showed up for some unknown reason a lot of those people were wearing costumes it really just captured peoples imaginations
7175759 every year theres something new the neighborhood is filled with artists and musicians they wrote tomato songs and recorded them so we have a cd
7175760 the best story so far is the gentlemen who had seen the place on a sunday morning when we were closed one friday morning he woke up and drove his motorcycle down here from st louis
7175761 gov bredesens had a hot dog he came the day after thanksgiving last year i think he had a chili cheese dog and went and ate in his truck across the street
7175762 what i think is very special about this neighborhood is the fact that it is a neighborhood and that its hard to go get coffee because there are 50 people you know in there and they all end up talking to each other
7175763 ive lived here long enough that i went from seeing vagrants and prostitutes on the street to families and all this great stuff they seem to really want to have fun theyve willed this neighborhood into existence
7175764 their vibrancy and their creativity started turning the neighborhood around its sort of like if one person gets an idea it sparks everyone else
7175765 have to unlearn something that is backwards part of why we love east nashville is that it is an open and accepting neighborhood
7175766 he doesnt see any kind of division or class thing when kids come to school with two mommies or two daddies its nothing unusual to him
7175767 you are judged more by who you are and what you are doing than what you look like or what you drive we have been very happy with that its a good place to live
7175768 when we were rehabbing the space people would drive by and cheer they were ready for a place of their own
7175769 its vanilla with crunched up twix nestle crunch butterfinger and snickers
7175770 i feel sorry for this poor thing because he looks handsome

7175774 what a bunch of thugs they must have on their team
7175775 when americans think of saudi arabian men they think theyre abusers and theyre cruel that they enjoy the gender segregation or enforce it
7175776 and sure some of them do but most just have to live with it
7175777 he was surprised to see her first name on the tag it should have been as private as her hair or the shape of her body and it made her seem defiant he blushed again and turned away from her trying not to turn completely but just enough to indicate that he wouldnt look at her the womans shoulders dropped slightly which seemed to indicate that shed noticed nayirs discomfort and was disappointed by it
7175778 either spit in the face of it or find a way around it it forces aggression or cleverness
7175779 i cant imagine after all the fuss that happened with me just one wife
7175780 we are really blessed to have people who care about the neighborhood and care about their neighbors people look out for each other
7175781 we go down there with the kids and almost always see somebody we know
7175782 it was kind of a sketchy place as far as some people were concerned
7175783 we do have a lot of people who ride scooters to work
7175784 i walk to church the post office library grocery store and park everything i need is within walking distance
7175785 we put about 5 000 miles on our two cars per year
7175786 when we built the new station in 1987 we had a block part for the neighborhood
7175787 guests like that the house backs up to lookout mountain they dont have traffic noise yet they have the convenience of being close to downtown its a city house and country house the best of both worlds
7175788 i think the neighborhoods diversity is its strong suit we have newcomers and we have people who have lived here for 60 years we have black white hispanic we have rich we have poor its refreshing to have so many different people
7175789 one of the central errors westerners are constantly assaulted with is the use of this term jihad
7175790 the central jihad for all of us is to constantly improve and be the best we can be and try to adhere to some very pure ideals
7175791 islam values life above anything we are taught in the quran that mans right to life exceeds even gods rights on man
7175792 i remembered thinking to myself as i had signed the contract recklessly flicking through pages ignoring bold capitals announcing the death penalty
7175793 in a thoughtless flourish i found myself now subject to the laws of saudi arabia decapitation included
7175794 part of the charm of the original space was you kind of had to know about it
7175795 you had to follow an old windy staircase up and come find it
7175796 the bay doors allow us to bring in large scale sculptures for the first time
7175797 basically its an empty shell because it is so open we can build temporary walls that allow us to set up separate spaces or we can leave it wide open if we wanted to we could have 20 artists showing on any given night and have plenty of wall space
7175798 people who can swing a hammer and believe in what we are doing
7175799 we are always looking for artists who are looking for a show
7175800 somebody who has never had a show before is just as likely to show with us as a 20 year veteran
7175801 when i finished the book i was ok with it
7175802 it just hit me hard seeing all those characters that i loved and then seeing their journeys come to a close and my journey along with theirs also ending
7175803 hagrid is fun to hug hagrid is full of love just dont get stuck in hagrids beard
7175804 without this i wouldnt just keep reading the books and watching the movies
7175805 theyre conscientious about being respectful of private property and they dont generate complaints from other park users
7175806 i often commandeer a little popcorn from fans who arent looking
7175807 possibly started as a fight on the bus and continued into the cafeteria i remember those fights we didnt use guns though

7175813 it is hard to compete at an olympic level when you do not get any support from the government
7175814 we need to improve and reform several sectors in cambodias education programs
7175815 part of this improvement should be in sports education which is an important part of the personal development of young people who are the future of our nation people have the tendency to forget cambodia is a nation on the rise and need to give it some time to grow
7175816 if we could get sponsored we could go somewhere with sports in cambodia but the government is not going to support us because they are busy with other things
7175817 i work really hard but do not even have the basic things i need like nutritious food to eat or clothes for training
7175818 the government needs to reform sports and give it a more reliable structure
7175819 from supporting the training and finances of an olympic athlete to building industrial parks and helping cambodia become a leading rice exporter we want to invest in areas that cambodians take pride in
7175820 the next five years will be the time investment takes off in cambodia and the country starts to put itself on the map
7175821 you will see a major change in the country and things like sports which have been overlooked because of the lack of government support may start to receive some funding from the private sector
7175822 i would not have gotten a good education if it had not been for the foreigners who came to my village and started a school
7175823 the days of the khmer rouge are over now and the youth in cambodia face different challenges like how to become socially conscious and have a voice in the development of their country
7175824 cambodia is not competitive in sports education or most jobs right now because we dont have any competition and little opportunity in the country
7175825 but i think with the right support this could change
7175826 i lived in cambodia for five years in the early 90s
7175827 the city has transformed with buildings paved roads and soon skyscrapers but what has not changed that much are the schools i would like to know how much investment is going back in to education
7175828 for example as investors build more hotels in the country others may start to invest in hotel management schools and language schools cambodia will gradually produce more skilled english speaking workers
7175829 being an athlete and just trying to live in cambodia is not easy
7175830 but i think in several years it could get better

7175842 this is welcome news that comes at a time when families are struggling with their power bills and the price of gas our island has som much potential for the production of renewable energy
7175843 the moscow international circus is an international circus that started out in moscow russia the performers are from the moscow state circus school so as youngsters and as second and third generation artists they were taught to be the best performers on the planet and they really are incredible circus artists
7175844 we just have to always remember that what isnt paid by system development charges are paid by the rest of the ratepayers so whatever is delayed by systems development charges could become a burden on the rest of the ratepayers until that amount is collected
7175845 it is very important for the staff from the veterans affairs committee to come to guam to investigate ways of improving claims processing for our local veteran community
7175846 mystery date are you ready for your mystery date open the door for your mystery date
7175847 youre gone for the month i was out of the country for four weeks in singapore and china and you dont know how other people are seeing you are seeing the games
7175848 i get stopped all the time on my way back in the airport in chicago they gave me a standing ovation
7175849 theres really nothing i could have done he said maybe one thing to push the pad a little bit harder because he said every time he saw the replay it looked like i won
7175850 the night before i was bored so i filed my nails
7175851 i cant really get into specifics because nothing has been finalized yet
7175852 we do have students who arent scheduled at 100 percent
7175853 we have two new directors of guidance and they are working furiously to make sure as many students as possible have full schedules
7175854 were believe were ready for the rollout on the start of the school year
7175855 feeling like were not just in the middle and not being valued is important
7175856 being a part of the game on sunday is the biggest thing for me ever
7175857 when i got to the nba finals and i thought that was big but winning an nba championship would never compare to winning a gold medal for my country
7175858 in my opinion being able to develop relationships with people and a sense of trust being able to work as a team are absolutely critical
7175859 its all about whats best for the students and you cant do it alone you have to have that team
7175860 you as a grownup have so much influence over how kids develop and grow
7175861 they know it just doesnt go away that im not going to forget that theyve made a decision
7175862 i really feel that there is no problem we cant solve together
7175863 i want to help children learn get my hands dirty be in the classroom help teachers be the best they can be
7175864 ill be thinking what am i going to do for children today
7175865 i started with a very basic idea in mind making school a good happy place for children to grow and ive been committed to that thinking for years
7175866 i want to ensure the highest possible education for all students
7175867 i want to make the world a better place a really good place for kids
7175868 ive had a very different career path than a lot of people
7175869 she believed education was the most important thing you could ever have
7175870 i played school a lot growing up i helped the teachers i helped the kids in my classes id get my work done fast be the teachers helper
7175871 i had very good administrators who spent time mentoring and modeling administration and i always found the summers too long
7175872 im just curious about the world as a whole and i like to see possibilities
7175873 whenever there are questions like these its important to pursue them
7175874 i think in general though they dont admit it most students are anxious ready and motivated to learn by this time of year
7175875 there is much more educational value to the student day i think in late august than in mid to late june
7175876 it comes to down to the preference of the community
7175877 we would have more summertime and that works best for my family
7175878 were also trying to squeeze in a couple last few fun things before school starts
7175879 those first three days it gives the teacher a day or two to get to know the child
7175880 its kind of a slow acclimation into the school year
7175881 but i also get a lot of parents saying were ready for the kids to come back
7175882 i dont see anything that indicates those days are minimized in terms of educational value
7175883 removing speculators from our oil market is one way releasing a small amount of oil from the strategic petroleum reserve is another
7175884 i agree with t boone pickens a well known oil man that this is one emergency we cant drill our way out of
7175885 we must encourage responsible drilling here at home we must invest heavily in renewable energy sources and we must conserve energy where we can
7175886 we should move quickly to remove restriction on oil exploration in alaska oil and gas exploration offshore oil shale in the rockies tar sands in utah and for other opportunities to increase our energy supply
7175887 by giving businesses and individuals the financial incentive to put renewable energy strategies to work
7175888 we should proceed with new nuclear generating plants and resolve the waste disposal issue
7175889 a new hampshire power plant in the seacoast burns wood not coal due to legislation i wrote when serving in the new hampshire legislature
7175890 this will require more drilling both on land and sea and i believe we have the environmental policies in place to provide reasonable levels of protection to these areas
7175891 impeach the president rescind the policy of pre emption and begin a robust diplomatic effort with iran that would significantly reduce the risk of war thus reducing energy prices
7175892 lower costs for energy health care and food as well as lower taxes preferably a flat tax will help to stimulate the economy for the short term and bring it long term stability
7175893 the most important things we can do to secure our economic future include balancing the budget lowering taxes and getting government out of the way of business expansion
7175894 in order to avoid further bankruptcies caused by food or health care costs
7175895 gives people back more of their own money through tax cuts and make spending reductions to keep our budget balanced
7175896 while i am concerned about the current economic state this is not the great depression and the failure of indymac bank is an isolated event
7175897 say is that the handycam saving the world edition great battery life
7175898 say ive got a great idea lets make a potentially great godzilla type movie but based in america spend gobs on special effects and film it from the perspective of a mentally challenged individual
7175899 ok doctor were going to play along this time but youve still got to take your meds later and no posting on youtube this time
7175900 on their last day in their country of origin with the one you love
7175901 in april the card came along at this perfect time
7175902 i could see the bad thinking coming back on me
7175903 there seems to be a feeling that people in vermont especially the old time vermonter are more conservative than people in new h h
7175904 it was all i could do because i didnt have the money to pay for it
7175905 ive seen people have a sudden change in income anticipating it will be short term
7175906 then they turn to credit and then its not short term
7175907 i havent needed any help of any kind in 15 years
7175908 i like to have a slight bit of security and to me a credit card is security
7175909 unknown political risk and constant negative headlines are not likely to induce investors to buy
7175910 we were concerned that the declining oil price and the mechel case would put pressure on the margins of companies and hence their earnings
7175911 foreigners are selling out bonds which is seen from bigger spreads and stocks which is clear from declining benchmarks
7175912 while many investors were plainly shocked by the escalation of the conflict with georgia we think that those bold enough to increase their russia exposure at this time of perceived elevated political risk may be rewarded
7175913 although volatility can be unwelcome in the short term it is precisely at times such as this that active managers can take advantage of market inefficiencies
7175914 we believe the long term investment case for russia is compelling
7175915 i think there is a new promotion that all toyotas are giving away free magnets with any purchase of a new car
7175916 j d and joe gibbs dont run their company like that it is obviously not a decision that was made from the top or the people that represent their company it was a mistake made by somebody that put their own mind to it
7175917 that was pretty wild for all the races they won i think they should have been a lot tougher on them it was just obvious blatant cheating and a unique circumstance too on the chassis dyno
7175918 theres a little part of you that is ticked because youre competing against these guys and theyre trying to bend the rules
7175919 youre also envious and mad that you didnt think of it yourself you know what i mean
7175920 every sport thats being competed at the olympics is cool to watch because theyre just the best in the world at it the track and field stuff is amazing i got to watch the 100 and 200 and some hurdles
7175921 tom my motor home driver says hes gonna put up a court
7175922 hes really excited about it because we played in school but you play for a week or something and thats all the badminton we ever played
7175923 were 0 3 in the preseason but were still 0 0
7175924 regardless of whos out there its up to us to execute and do our own job it may come out where we may have to be without tom
7175925 we only have another week before we get started but we take a lot of pride in our special teams unit
7175926 theres just no way we can have returns going back on us putting our defense in a tough situation and putting our team in a tough situation
7175927 well get better well watch film and well get better
7175928 i think the players were nervous in the first inning they were feeling a little pressure
7175929 its hard to believe how much happens in one day here
7175930 it took a little government intervention to make that happen
7175931 i think it was the right move at the right time
7175932 its a destination spot where people will want to come to
7175933 we dont want to have traffic backing up on the interstate
7175934 will have free access to the corporate aircraft for his and his familys personal use for the rest of his life after he steps down from the board of the cecil based generic drug giant
7175935 these familiar little words had been around for so long theyd become more than mere mnemonic devices theyd become signifiers of place
7175936 the election is going to consume our attention from now until october
7175937 if your story doesnt somehow some way connect to the election dont even bother
7175938 the danger of course is its clever and you forget the product
7175939 if i were an advertiser thats what i would do
7175940 you expect tanger to help all of washington county including tourism
7175941 its been a very nice summer weve had guests who are corporate people involved in the outlet shops
7175942 washington county is the place to be in southwest pennsylvania
7175943 we are certainly becoming a destination point we are hoping people who come to the tanger outlets will stay for two days and visit other retail shops and tourist attractions tanger is the impetus to come but then there is so much more to see in washington county
7175944 tanger will truly benefit the community because it will draw from the entire tristate area
7175945 at washington crown center we have been getting people from west virginia and ohio for years
7175946 we will reap the benefits of tanger but its up to all of us to try to capitalize on tanger
7175947 we want to capitalize on our exiting customers and local customers who are loyal to washington county
7175948 historically has been a focus for development because of interstate s 70 and 79
7175949 south strabane hasnt had a tax increase for many years and i dont think well be needing one anytime soon
7175950 we are very happy to have a lot of development while still retaining a lot of beautiful green space and family farms
7175951 its not that often we get news of that many jobs being added in manufacturing
7175952 its rare to see such large increases in any manufacturing industry statewide definitely and thats not limited to pittsburgh
7175953 one of our problems has been an aging old work force so theres been a big campaign to attract new talent not only machinists but engineering folks
7175954 the best way to train them is to take it over ourselves
7175955 people talk about the only jobs being at wal mart but we have jobs that average 21 an hour
7175956 in contrast the manufacturing sector which is the biggest contributor to regional income because of the high wages it pays is not only declining but is losing jobs at an accelerating rate
7175957 the baby boomers are retiring and all that knowledge is going out the door and this is recapturing it
7175958 they were going through the same problems most manufacturing companies are going through
7175959 they had jobs available but not the people with the skills and competencies to take those jobs
7175960 we are experiencing huge growth both here and globally because of the energy markets we serve
7175961 we consider ourselves in a david and goliath kind of thing
7175962 they dont have a lot of power on the grid so they have to have their own power plants theres a lot of different applications for the products we make
7175963 while i cant say its recession proof the performance of the video game industry in the last few years in light of difficult economic conditions speaks for itself
7175964 largest most robust cycle in history lazard capital markets analyst colin sebastian wrote in a report to investment clients earlier this year
7175965 probably more than any other medium video games are the best value for the money
7175966 computer and video games are a mainstream entertainment form which captures the imagination of every segment of our society
7175967 you have games that are rivaling film not only in sales but also in excitement for an art form games are now at a high level of photo realism
7175968 the wii is family oriented gaming they can make the investment and the whole family can share in the entertainment experience if it was just an individual shooter game it wouldnt have as much impact on the family entertainment dollar
7175969 theres much more supply of the product it used to be very difficult to get and its at a price point thats very attractive
7175970 intriso di citazioni nascoste e rimandi e allusioni e intertestualit varie
7175971 their postpaid counterparts usually meet stringent identification conditions that make them traceable
7175972 but with the new development all users of telephone services in nigeria must be identifiable and traceable
7175973 cheating the bad things good nascar nextel cup racers do in pursuit of speed
7175974 yes indeed four years ago i respectfully urged the government to increase its effort because this was something very important
7175975 i think this scheme of own the podium program is a very good one for obvious reasons there is a bigger drive for winter sports than summer sports in canada because of the climate and the geography
7175976 i think i should commend the government for what it has done but also the regional governments many provinces have been supportive
7175977 is this enough its up to the canadians to tell not for me im happy to see theres been a positive change but youll have to quantify it yourself i dont believe it will be short term i really believe its going to be in the long term
7175978 i take it with a big smile i was giving him what i think is fatherly advice and i stand by it
7175979 hes a 22 year old and its time to mature and show respect for his opponents
7175980 we heard allegations about the ages we took that very seriously we asked the international federation to open up an inquiry themselves eligibility of the athletes is the responsibility of the international federations not the ioc but of course we consider this as being a very serious issue
7175981 i had to push the pace to tire the other runners
7175982 i had to push the pace because my body gets tired when i slow down
7175983 in the last 10 kilometers 6 2 miles it was unbelievable what the africans were able to do under these conditions
7175984 its one of those deals where i couldnt get by him i couldnt get by him and i just had to ask myself would he do that to me
7175985 and he has before so thats the way it goes
7175986 whatever carls going to say hes sorry that he didnt want to race that way but he always does well take it well go on and well race him that way in the chase if thats the way he wants to race
7175987 disappointed that china has not used the occasion of the olympics to demonstrate greater tolerance and openness
7175988 you may like it now but how will you feel when you are 200 years old
7175989 im tellin ya everywhere i stand shes lookin at me
7175990 the faith based groups help through the longest period of time and thats true for every disaster
7175991 it was an amazing transformative experience we can talk about changing the world but to give somebody the means to do it is something you cant teach in a classroom
7175992 it makes a difference in the life of a kid whos gone through trauma to just come and be their friend not questioning them on their katrina experience but rather letting them run over to you at lunch rip out your hair tie and start braiding your hair
7175993 it makes a difference to the people here in new wilmington to actually see the work we did in new orleans
7175994 he told me that for the first time in over a year he got up and didnt care how he felt because he had something more important to do
7175995 it has been almost three years since he has had a meal in his own home
7175996 prayerfully the table will remain in our family for years to come and we can pass the history of the table to our future generations
7175997 for the first time in 51 years i feel like im making a difference
7175998 he was beaming as he sat back and watched all of us eat
7175999 i had worked in his home the year before and he looked beaten the difference in his demeanor was like night and day
7176000 that was the greatest witness for our students to see that and reflect on how they want to behave in their own lives when they are confronted by challenging circumstances
7176001 the first thing he said when he came over to talk to us was thank you for coming down here
7176002 there are just too many veterans that need help and its unacceptable to me
7176003 when i go home i still cant believe it it looks like a place on cape cod its beautiful quiet serene
7176004 im here to help because they did so much for me
7176005 coupled with the internet creative individuals can live in a rural area and enjoy the quality of life rural living can offer while still earning a decent living
7176006 the conference will address the economic stimulus the arts and crafts industries can provide small rural communities and the lowered cost of living artists can enjoy living away from big metropolitan areas
7176007 ill also have an electric wheel that people can use to throw their own pots free of charge
7176008 itll be a chance for visitors to see what pottery making is all about
7176009 if i was a member of the public i would be watching these board members
7176010 its hard to believe how much happens in one day here
7176011 it took a little government intervention to make that happen

7176025 we are very happy to have a lot of development while still retaining a lot of beautiful green space and family farms
7176026 there are very few administrators he hasnt had a hand in bringing in
7176027 the fair policy is to ensure that goods donated at this store remain in this store
7176028 that kept me coming back because it was more fun
7176029 i remember going to the circus with a friend at age 8 walking down the midway and hearing this great music
7176030 the tent opened up and a group was performing this amazing shuffle i was mesmerized its the only thing i remember about my first outing to the circus
7176031 i love playing always did and never even considered an alternate career
7176032 i met rare silk through jerry granelli when they were just getting started in boulder
7176033 jerry played several gigs with them and recommended me for the drummer job which i eventually got
7176034 im a stay at home dad while she teaches full time
7176035 im excited about moving to an area with such a great jazz heritage and am hoping to become part of the local jazz scene
7176036 i love teaching and dont mind taking on beginners with no experience at all and watching them grow as drummers
7176037 mikes a real smooth and tasty player fits in really well and is an important addition to the local jazz scene
7176038 its ironic that our road department travels right over a road they dont maintain
7176039 because of that proximity we feel we can do a more efficient job maintaining it
7176040 but they do have to travel 5 miles to fill one pothole the borough wanted to maintain the road to its standards and on its schedule
7176041 its an item that will cost the borough money we realize that
7176042 we feel that the taxpayers of franklin park and allegheny county will benefit
7176043 franking park is growing we add about 90 new homes each year
7176044 as additional traffic is placed on our roads it create areas where you need additional traffic control measures and these are some of the things that we are doing for our residents
7176045 they are in a position where they want to implement the best practices to ensure that the good life is around for a long time in cranberry township
7176046 we dont have to be proactive but we have always thought that planning was important
7176047 the biggest thing i noticed when i first got here was that theres people everywhere on main street and cars everywhere
7176048 i perceived butler as being a rural area but it has this great downtown area i really like how its laid out and the people well they seem so friendly
7176049 she brings some new energy and some new ideas to this new position
7176050 as the project unfolds we will see she has the talent to do what needs to be done i think its going to be a great great step for the city
7176051 i really like the idea of instead of tearing down all these buildings that are americas heritage that we can modernize them instead
7176052 we can update them inside but leave the character thats been there for years on the outside
7176053 the city has really been getting things down and i am anxious to see more goals set
7176054 i really like to see these places that have this great value historical value succeed we have downtowns and too many of them are being neglected we can reuse and prevent sprawl i think it is less wasteful
7176055 we would love to approve this as long as it meets the code
7176056 tonight is the best most productive conversations weve had in the past year
7176057 anderson identified numerous health and safety violations at the cabana bar which were in violation of the township code the international building code the international fire code and related health and safety codes
7176058 a little big huh you trying to say im fat
7176059 i was very scared that i was going to jerk back and fall down
7176060 but it was really fun i just stayed focused aimed and shot the gun i was proud of everyone
7176061 working together to get things done sir thats probably been the most fun
7176062 its a great place to be at and learn a lot of stuff
7176063 they leave with a feeling of accomplishment theres a certain pride as they march onto the graduation field in front of their parents
7176064 when my father passed away i wanted to do something in his memory i thought with my philosophy with dealing with youth it would be better to make a contribution to the camp cadet program
7176065 featuring the big picture in our modern times and future times to come
7176066 oh my lord i can hear the jokes starting already ac under a heading of vim and vigor
7176067 i wanted to be someplace where emotions were palpable where the pain outside matched the pain i was feeling inside
7176068 no matter how much you try to remember how that person lived his life you cant forget how he ended it
7176069 the reality is that i have a better understanding of the men that i work with strengths and weaknesses im probably more focused on specific areas of our football teams development as opposed to last year when i was looking at everything
7176070 you probably dont miss as much when you have a focused attention to what it is youre looking at as opposed to watching the whole thing
7176071 he is quietly a very effective football player tomlin said
7176072 sometimes you say hes a good little football player but hes 310 pounds he plays with great leverage hes football smart he has position flexibility hes a guy who always is in the hunt and probably will be up until the 11th hour
7176073 you told us exactly what to do and it worked

7176075 at this point the ball is with council staff to develop a proposal that will come back to council over the next few months but it could involve stickers badges posters and t shirts similar to the safe place pink triangle campaign
7176076 we have to create awareness that homophobia is not acceptable
7176077 its a gimmick a token effort to do with a very serious problem
7176078 its essentially signs and stickers what we need is more police and if they dont have the resources council should provide money to employ security guards
7176079 more education in anything doesnt go astray but we need both awareness and more police
7176080 we need more police presence and safety measures not just putting a label on it
7176081 gay men also wrote to me about homophobic abuse from nightclub patrons
7176082 there are no big problems i have all my marbles

7176091 this congress has been one of the most unproductive on record theyve failed to address the challenge of high gas prices members still have time to take action on this vital priority for the american people they need to send me a bill next month that i can sign so we can bring relief to drivers small business owners farmers and ranchers and every american affected by high prices at the pump
7176092 no one can dictate to poland what it should do thats in the past our neighbours should now understand that our nation will never give in nor allow itself to be intimidated
7176093 when you threaten poland you perhaps forget that it is not 1988 its 2008 and the united states has a firm treaty guarantee to defend polands territory as if it was the territory of the united states so its probably not wise to throw these threats around

7176106 were probably going to have to as most universities are get much more aggressive in some of our efforts
7176107 when students of color are doing as well as white students youll feel like youve got equal opportunity
7176108 its certainly critical to the experience of every individual student to have other students in his or her midst from very different backgrounds
7176109 its an essential part of every students education its also essential to the state the state needs to be invested in having its young people learn and grow up in a diverse environment
7176110 for a long time i used to feel very inferior on campus
7176111 sitting in a classroom of 500 white students i was one pea in a pod of people that didnt look like me
7176112 youre in one of those minority programs where you go for free
7176113 i think it means data gathering about what has worked and what hasnt worked so well
7176114 and it might mean making the hard decisions to reallocate funds to different programs and try some new strategies
7176115 the numbers of students we see at the middle school level and the numbers of students we see applying here are somewhat different
7176116 hes coming across as very genuine and sincere in his concerns
7176117 i am impressed especially since this is the smaller farmers market
7176118 it sounds like hes stepping into things right away its a nice feeling to know that hes willing to listen to people and is open to changing things that need to change
7176119 this man i think hes going to do some great things
7176120 i think there is a honeymoon period and i think were still in it
7176121 we want these kids to have the supplies they need
7176122 its the biggest event of the year for 100 black men
7176123 its instant gratification to see these kids faces it really does get them thinking school
7176124 he likes to get along with people he likes to listen to them
7176125 a lucky politician is one who knows how to take advantage of a break when he gets it
7176126 look at his life and there are half a dozen times when he could have failed being abandoned by his father his troubled adolescent years but he seems to weather adversity better than most
7176127 he has this unusual combination of life experiences that dont fit in any stereotype
7176128 he wasnt part of student government he wasnt in any ap advanced placement classes he was a young man concerned with hanging out with his buddies playing basketball body surfing and eating in excess
7176129 my mother was pretty instrumental in helping barack cultivate this internal flexibility
7176130 after the childhood we had different could never be jarring or dislocating
7176131 growing up i wasnt always sure who i was or what i was doing
7176132 push questions of who i was out of my mind
7176133 hes a gregarious guy and he loves people but he also loves his own company he doesnt expect those closest to him to be all things to him
7176134 its not all fire inside of him there are wide cool pools of water as well
7176135 he wasnt trying to get peoples goats or get a rise out of them
7176136 i didnt socialize that much i was like a monk
7176137 he would tell us youve got to do things right youve got to take the high road
7176138 he would talk about no permanent friends no permanent enemies
7176139 he became very effective at getting people who initially did not get along to work together and build alliances
7176140 he found a way to be tough and challenging when he didnt like something at the same time he was not one to burn his bridges with people
7176141 black people would say harold will take care of the problem
7176142 the victories were small they changed peoples lives but they didnt change american society and he wanted to do that
7176143 means you can take risks you can try to do things to improve society and still land on your feet
7176144 he was very straightforward and had a no nonsense all the cards on the table approach
7176145 by choosing to move to hyde park he moved in an area where an independent can come out of nowhere to win
7176146 by choosing to work at that law firm he was making a political statement to where he stood
7176147 he worked all the right circles if you dont like the guy hes a calculating politician if you do hes a smart methodical worker his greatest capability is he never makes the same mistake twice
7176148 law professors especially those from a place like the university of chicago are viewed with a jaundiced eye
7176149 some members of both parties thought that barack was longwinded and a tad aloof and arrogant not me
7176150 how much money do you have in your campaign fund
7176151 i know what its like to have people tell me i cant do something because of my color and i know the bitter swill of swallowed back anger
7176152 my gosh you cant lose two races in a row
7176153 he said if its ok with me it should be ok with you
7176154 if you have the ability to communicate and the timing is right the moment is right things come together all those ingredients were there for barack
7176155 hes the one who walked through it and did the heavy lifting
7176156 as soon as i saw her for the first time i was pretty pumped
7176157 it was absolutely heartbreaking to see him get on that plane
7176158 think of the reality if it i think of how brave these boys are
7176159 the feeling of pride you get cant be put into words
7176160 i had a son i was raising who turned out to be this incredible brave man
7176161 the actions of golf company were directly responsible for setting up the iraqi people for future success
7176162 this time people would wave at us they would talk to us children would come up to us
7176163 under the hardness of her facade a womans heart is still beating
7176164 and it is possible to get a harvard education at the university of minnesota just as it possible to get a

7176196 to travel is to discover that everyone is wrong about other countries
7176197 the uses of travel are occasional and short but the best fruit it finds when it finds it is conversation and this is a main function of life

7176208 people automatically assume that if it weakens the hazards go down with it but in the case of rainfall its not a function of wind speed
7176209 this is unprecedented in terms of the slow nature of this storm the large circulation and the fact that its impacted probably about 90 percent of the state with heavy rains and severe weather
7176210 it was very clear that one was stroking and one was gliding

7176214 bears at least a little awe from all the monday morning quarterbacks out there second quessing sic what thorpe has accomplished
7176215 the timing seemed right because were in these times where people dont necessarily know if their jobs going to be there tomorrow and when a lot of people dont necessarily like their jobs they have now
7176216 why dont you go out there and revisit those kinds of jobs that actually made america great those great working class blue collar jobs thats what these are it was great to get these contestants out of that cubicle that conceptual life were in and get out there and get some real raw experience in a place with high stakes and high rewards
7176217 the first thing that made me laugh out loud was that he was putting on a stage version of erin brockovich in the school
7176218 have you ever considered doing a play that wasnt a popular movie
7176219 i know who this guy is i knew he was probably very very earnest but slightly misguided
7176220 often when i work with people ive got to like their stuff i tend to pick up on their rhythms and their tone so i start doing comedy thats slightly more in sync with whoever it is im working with
7176221 i thought it was smart and funny without being overly cynical
7176222 you dont meet people like him in comedy but you do meet people like him in theater and drama that kind of soul searching angst ridden neurosis you encounter in hollywood and california
7176223 it wasnt really anyone specific you kind of just get a feel think of a voice and dress a certain way
7176224 it made it kind of energetic and it gave it a vibrancy it wasnt lots and lots of bitter twisted middle aged people
7176225 theres a kind of enthusiasm they had that was infectious to me and yes which was really catchy and helps to give an energy
7176226 i think americans started to adapt things like the office have translated so well and caught peoples imaginations americas a big country you cant make generalizations about it the way that you can i think about england actually but americas so disparate theres an audience for esoteric interesting comedy
7176227 were more conversant in american culture than the americans are with british culture because weve grown up on a diet of american entertainment
7176228 weve got a lot more in common with america than we have with our european neighbors because we dont share the language and so we have a historical cultural connection but in terms of pop culture were much much closer to america
7176229 why are all those guys dressed in jeans vest tops and looking like jesus
7176230 it was just kind of a curiosity which i suppose was the point of the exercise

7176242 angel and buffy were part of the lineup of the wb
7176243 if we didnt bring those two to what were doing we would have had people outside with burning torches its about creating a robust lineup this isnt just roll out the library this is about creating a complete schedule that has a lot of great content
7176244 this is not youtube quality this is content thats coming from a studio and as warner bros we have to maintain a level of quality that viewers expect from us this isnt about skimping and making cheap content
7176245 you look at it say i learned something and then you send it to your friends and say you wont believe this

7176251 the wii is family oriented gaming they can make the investment and the whole family can share in the entertainment experience if it was just an individual shooter game it wouldnt have as much impact on the family entertainment dollar
7176252 theres much more supply of the product it used to be very difficult to get and its at a price point thats very attractive

7176291 give me the grace good lord to set the world at naught to set my mind fast upon thee and not to hang upon the blast of mens mouths to be content to be solitary not to long for worldly company but utterly to cast off the world and rid my mind of the business thereof
7176292 the ordinary acts we practice every day at home are of more importance to the soul than their simplicity might suggest
7176293 what does it avail to know that there is a god which you not only believe by faith but also know by reason what does it avail that you know him if you think little of him
7176294 give me the grace good lord to set the world at naught to set my mind fast upon thee and not to hang upon the blast of mens mouths to be content to be solitary not to long for worldly company but utterly to cast off the world and rid my mind of the business thereof
7176295 the ordinary acts we practice every day at home are of more importance to the soul than their simplicity might suggest
7176296 what does it avail to know that there is a god which you not only believe by faith but also know by reason what does it avail that you know him if you think little of him
7176297 one hes feeling better and i want him to feel good for the opener
7176298 but then the other side of the coin is he hasnt really played a competitive down he probably has to do that so just how much he does ill have to wait and see
7176299 first of all our rotation with seven or eight defensive linemen thats how we like to play the game
7176300 were at a good position at defensive end and i think we have good depth but it is a competition
7176301 now who starts the ball game or who runs out of the tunnel i dont get too caught up in that theyre both having good camps its close
7176302 you never know when its going to be your last play
7176303 give me the grace good lord to set the world at naught to set my mind fast upon thee and not to hang upon the blast of mens mouths to be content to be solitary not to long for worldly company but utterly to cast off the world and rid my mind of the business thereof
7176304 the ordinary acts we practice every day at home are of more importance to the soul than their simplicity might suggest
7176305 what does it avail to know that there is a god which you not only believe by faith but also know by reason what does it avail that you know him if you think little of him
7176306 never mind what people say if i want to change the policy because i think i have to i will change it
7176307 i dont care what the opposition says i will do it thats me
7176308 if there is further reduction the government will announce an adjustment every 15 days based on global crude oil price
7176309 the main reason was the sharp rise in the price of jet fuel by 73 per cent causing the companys fuel costs to rise sharply
7176310 last year we expected oil prices of at most us 110 120 but the prices rapidly jumped higher by that time it was too late to raise ticket prices to catch up with the oil prices
7176311 our loss in july dropped significantly and we already saw profit showing in the first half of august
7176312 but our big challenges currently are to regain trust among our customers and business partners and to help customers understand our need to raise ticket prices
7176313 cutting costs is just a dream especially when global oil prices keep rising steeply in practice it is too difficult to catch up with rising oil prices by raising air fares or fuel surcharge fees
7176314 if global oil prices keep going up or stay at a high level we may see more businesses merging or codeshare flights among airlines in thailand
7176315 naturally we respect the ruling of the court this is never an easy decision for any judge to make but we respectfully disagree with some of the findings of the court we will be meeting with the commiss

7176397 and there is no pattern what these guys will do
7176398 est ce que reflet de soci t va prendre position dans la mort de freddy villanueva
7176399 they are easy to grow you have to work to kill them
7176400 then we got a few more and a few more and a few more
7176401 in 2000 we made about 700 and we thought that was wonderful
7176402 the first three or four years man we couldnt get them in the ground fast enough
7176403 plus they are very clear about their christian background sometimes i just minimize the site and listen to the music
7176404 i really believe that part of this is a ministry
7176405 you can use what youre doing to glorify god you can walk through the garden and it makes you feel so good
7176406 i thought you know we ought to take a trip down there sometime
7176407 it was very much worth the drive they are very nice people and we got to walk through their rows of daylilies
7176408 we spent three or four hours just wandering through their gardens
7176409 she just wanted to come down and get some peace
7176410 people say your flowers look so beautiful i say i dont have anything to do with the pretty
7176411 i can water them and take care of them i cant make the sun come up and go down i cant take care of the pretty
7176412 the community of big stone gaps dedication to the preservation of history inspired me to preserve the gaps history
7176413 there is an impressive array of museums programs and historical structures for a town with a population of approximately 6 000
7176414 the book is not only about the history of the town but also what makes up the fabric of the community
7176415 big stone gap is a slice of authentic americana mountain style
7176416 the stories told in photographs and prose on these pages are the stories of small town america preserved with wit hospitality old fashioned elegance a love of art and a keen sense of community
7176417 once you accept your uniqueness and see it as something special you can respect the differences in others a deep love of self empowers you to excel and gives you the ability to focus on the needs of others
7176418 goal will always be to release unheard lost recordings and re releasing out of print music that fits our aesthetic while always bringing new artists to the forefront
7176419 when we first formed we were investigating fascism no bones about that its interesting to see what this tainted ideology which has been so powerful had to say in the beginning
7176420 many years ago i was a sic once a member of the national front it was probably the worse decision of my life and one i very much regret this is the last public statement i plan to make on the subject in the end people will either have to believe me or not
7176421 through egalitarianism everyone loses since in principal it denies the natural order honor might pride and preservation were pillars upon which the west was founded now they are dirty words
7176422 justin ordnung from genocide lolita show up and added some vocals as well
7176423 neo folk acts as a social and ideological glue holding its nazi adherents together as well as drawing in a smattering of younger followers who start out as music fans and end up full blown mystical fascists and without this the ease with which these rats are able to collaborate politically would be massively reduced removed from the access distribution and networking points provided by neo folk the individual and collective influence of this subcultures fascist inspired ideology would be massively reduced
7176424 calm down he just wants to pass you youre not even going the speed limit
7176425 but what about him in the back what will he say about him hes high
7176426 she would describe an experiment and say thanks to allah it turned out well
7176427 what we have learned from her is that she was in custody for over five years
7176428 go back to school and tell your teacher that you want a speaking role
7176429 i feel very honoured to have been part of that era where pretty much every trophy there was to win we got our hands on whereas at the moment were a group that is starting hopefully on a journey that is very productive
7176430 but its only sort of the beginning for this group and i think maybe if you ask that question in a year or twos time well hopefully give you a positive answer
7176431 other than late in the game when we let them back in we had a fair bit of control throughout the whole game so it was slightly different to 2000
7176432 i think 2000 was more of an arm wrestle the whole match
7176433 i probably lost my composure a tiny bit but that was just because i was pretty dirty on myself with what i did a few minutes before to let them score
7176434 so it was a square up so far as i was concerned
7176435 weve come over here so many times and got so close
7176436 its been a constant place where we faced disappointment on disappointment so to finally get the monkey off our back is just great
7176437 we are competing for the tri nations and it is a seriously tough competition
7176438 youve only got to look at the games so far to see that and our mindset is hopefully to get up for the challenge next week
7176439 in many ways my life has been an open book but i havent always been the one

7176445 so because my daughter is disabled you are telling me she cant come in and they simply said yes
7176446 i definitely want to get something bad on the road big enough for all my friends and to scare all the cars away from me im a good driver but its everyone else that im worried about
7176447 what a great comeback for team penske after what happened this week
7176448 those guys did an incredible job if you close your eyes you dont know what car is there
7176449 when you have a situation like that it will be difficult to pass unless someone makes a mistake or something happens
7176450 hes been a great help for me my whole career
7176451 even when i wasnt racing for him i always saw him as a good mentor now that im racing for him and were a few miles from where hes from it would be great to get a podium for him
7176452 the biggest asset i have for the team is my experience and through the drivers is the way i can relay that ive always been away from the pits
7176453 disappointed that china has not used the occasion of the olympics to demonstrate greater tolerance and openness

7176465 began shouting homosexual slurs at all the patrons that were present and attacked the three victims
7176466 ive got a positive outlook on this week and theyre going to do well
7176467 its unlikely that we will see another olympics of this scope and stature again
7176468 the international olympic committee themselves recognise that this is the last edition of a games which is going to look and feel like this
7176469 the stadium will be a very different concept to beijing
7176470 were talking about leaving a 25 000 seater all purpose stadium
7176471 the largest urban park created in europe for more than 150 years
7176472 a huge amount of our investment in the olympic park is for legacy we are cleaning up the land burying overhead power lines upgrading roads and railways and installing new energy infrastructure
7176473 a site of this scale and quality within a few minutes of a great city centre must be almost unprecedented
7176474 it is through my body that i understand other people just as it is through my body that i perceive things the meaning of a gesture thus understood is not behind it it is intermingled with the structure of the world outlined by the gesture and which i take up on my account
7176475 a little bit of both of doing it myself and seeing other people do it
7176476 the goal of our world leading chemicals management plan is to protect the health of canadians from potentially harmful substances
7176477 by identifying four substances that are potentially toxic to human health in this latest batch of substances the government is continuing to deliver results for canadians and meet the commitments we established when the chemicals management plan was launched in 2006
7176478 this is another example of how our government through the chemicals management plan is taking real action to reduce the presence of harmful chemicals in our environment and protecting it for future generations
7176479 the housing here may seem run down but we are very close to each other
7176480 this year both parties understand the need to have greater numbers of bloggers attend while many americans may watch only prime time television broadcasts of the convention speeches party officials also recognize the ability of bloggers to deliver minute by minute coverage of each days events to a niche online audience
7176481 we are doing interviews already lining them up attending breakfasts and panels and the whole nine yards
7176482 this is stuff we deserve we helped the party get people elected
7176483 maybe in 2004 it was about being accommodating and innovative but this time around theres a real fight for power in the party
7176484 bloggers are just like everybody else except that we admit what we do
7176485 we couldnt be more thrilled with our new york run
7176486 when we first announced the new york engagement the plan was to stay for only three months before taking the show on the road but the audiences just kept coming back and bringing their families with them so here we are finally wrapping up after almost two years two different theatres three different actors and over 700 performances only in new york could audiences need so much therapy thank you new york

7176488 selected the most twisted demented responses added some iconic recurring nightmares and created a house that will force audiences to experience awake what few can handle asleep
7176489 with a carnie feel and a cast of legendary horror characters werewolf blob zombie vampire witch frankenstein mummy and of course a maniac with a chainsaw
7176490 a professional woman whos married and has a lovely apartment on the upper west side
7176491 on the surface shes an ideal wife but as the play unfolds you realize how hard shes working and how hard all the characters are struggling to maintain the appearance of normal happy successful all these ideas of what the world is supposed to be and what were supposed to achieve
7176492 ive wanted to do another play since i did neil labutes some girl s off broadway in 2006 i finished my tv show this year and i thought it would be smart coming off that to challenge myself its such a different way of working
7176493 the downside is the other muscles get kind of flabby you have to switch over and slow down mentally and physically you get to think about character and dialogue a lot more and experiment a lot more its fun
7176494 doing a play once a night you go from moment to moment to moment youre in that moment then you move on thats exciting on tv therell be a set up you do one moment nine ten or more times im looking forward to living in the moment and moving through it as opposed to stopping and doing it again and then doing a close up
7176495 i think that was the highlight shes such a wonderful actress and a really smart lady
7176496 my characters had so much tragedy and so many hard times that the writers just wanted to give her some peace basically i go off into the sunset with gorans character goran visnjic plays abbys husband dr luka kovac i think my last episodes will be the second and third of the season
7176497 i dont think that in general what i meant was that the stuff they wrote for me on er was a lot more challenging than anything anyone was offering me movie wise at the time
7176498 i loved primary colors and i really enjoyed semi pro its hard to choose one
7176499 jessica lange paul newman robert redford al pacino my movie knowledge began in the 70s im not familiar with the classics films like all the presidents men and dog day afternoon awakened me to wanting to be an actor
7176500 its what ive wanted since i was very young i acted in high school in college i was a dance major my freshman year but i realized that wasnt what i wanted to be doing i had a lot of friends in the drama department and i switched i felt much more comfortable
7176501 is that a cool thing to say in this day and age that you love your country and that youre fighting for the red white and blue it seems sort of like a day gone by
7176502 to bring the productions sound design technology into the 21st century

7176504 phantom had ground breaking sound when it opened in new york in 1988 and andrew and i have wanted for some time to give our sound system a complete update so that audiences could enjoy the most exciting theatrical sound on broadway
7176505 that will make the 28 member orchestra and 36 strong cast sound more powerful and clear than ever before

7176509 cirque dreams jungle fantasy remains true to my original cirque dreams vision which began with the company in 1993 to blend european artistry with circus and broadway theatrics in a dramatic fashion that transcends imagination and leaves its narration to the eyes of the beholder
7176510 just as stuart eli james approaches his big break as a comic book artist a german babbling soda guzzling shapeshifter appears to unlock his suburban familys hidden skeletons three generations of fierce women surround stuart his mother marnie amy mcwilliams and his aunts lizzie emily townley and sylvia naomi jacobson and attempt to drive back the long forgotten past but these sisters along with their mother ruthie sarah marshall and stuarts cousin hannah meghan grady seem destined to destroy each other eccentrically comic and eerily haunting grotes latest work inspired by friedrich schillers classic tale of warring queens with a supernatural twist shows just how far a family will go to keep the past dead and buried

7176547 when you want to win the goal is still the same and the pressure the same
7176548 im very happy to be number one its a big satisfaction after a long time being number two but at the same time nothing changes
7176549 this is the last grand slam of the season so its going to be very important for everybody
7176550 if i play a good tournament here im going to have chances to continue to be number one for longer
7176551 sport that i would like more if it wasnt so hard to watch
7176552 sport i could compete in if i had a year of solid training and good instructors
7176553 um guys the other team is rowing faster so if its not too much trouble could you increase the tempo
7176554 how in the hell did they get an idea like that to pull off in public
7176555 the olympics demonstrated the success of the current system and the communist partys determination not to reform politically there is no reason to change
7176556 it still has many problems such as the possibility of an economic slowdown
7176557 the olympics were a boon for their performance but did nothing for their procedural legitimacy
7176558 we can say its not for nothing that we have come to the olympics
7176559 of course we had greater plans than this but we have received the bronze medal and we also hope in the future our performance will improve further
7176560 theres a lot of bitterness that we feel a lot of bitterness inside all of us we were hoping for more
7176561 we were hoping to get better results than what we did today
7176562 i feel like its my team my offense and im taking that role
7176563 i think guys understand that and theyre buying into it this summer and im excited and getting ready for this year and trying to help guys out as much as i can
7176564 hes been through his ups and downs and i think he has taken over a leadership mentality hes the face really not only of our offense but of our whole program
7176565 hes been doing a very good job of staying with the lean foods his body is lean hes probably still around 230 pounds hes still very strong and hes cut not that there was a lot of fat but hes just more trim its very noticeable to me
7176566 in high school i didnt have a quarterback who put this much heat on it so i have to get used to it
7176567 i was relaxing and my hands were relaxing and the ball just shot through and hit me right in the face
7176568 we have some receivers who can catch and plus stafford can definitely throw the ball
7176569 thats going to help us out this season that we can run the ball at the same time as pass
7176570 everyone will get their share we have a lot of backs but at the same time a lot of people can make things happen it will just be interesting to see what everybody can do
7176571 i think we have a great chance to be pretty explosive both running and passing
7176572 if the line opens holes weve got backs who can make things happen and if they protect weve got receivers who can run by some folks
7176573 brand china has done an outstanding job of repackaging itself with the help of the american media
7176574 the vast majority of americans have been dazzled right from the opening ceremony
7176575 something that would have taken four or five years they did it in 17 days
7176576 nbc has a ton of money invested advertisers have a ton of money invested
7176577 they dont want a blemish to surface there are too many millions at stake and everyones got their hand in the till
7176578 beijing got what it wanted out of this globally televised spectacular it reaped a huge prestige bonanza that it will surely use to promote its international influence and we fear further tighten its grip at home
7176579 it pocketed these gains without offering any concessions in return
7176580 if chief moli lived on ambae he would not question mrs ligos right to participate in the political arena
7176581 we knew that if we gave in there would be other demands
7176582 a us captain told me to come back with my two other brothers he said we could talk after that
7176583 i waited for four hours an american captain finally interrogated me after 10 minutes he announced that i was under arrest
7176584 they handcuffed me and blindfolded me and put a piece of white cloth over my eyes they bundled me into a humvee and took me to a place inside the palace i was dumped in a room with a single wooden chair it was extremely cold after five hours they brought my sister in i couldnt see anything but i could recognize her from her crying
7176585 the us officer told us if you dont confess we will torture you so you have to confess my hands were handcuffed they took off my boots and stood me in the mud with my face against the wall i could hear women and men shouting and weeping i recognized one of the cries as my brother mutaz i wanted to see what was going on so i tried to move the cloth from my eyes when i did i fainted
7176586 the informant and an american officer were both in the room the informant started talking he said you are the lady who funds your brothers to attack the americans i speak some english so i replied he is a liar the american officer then hit me on both cheeks i fell to the ground
7176587 the cell had no ceiling it was raining at midnight they threw something at my sisters feet it was my brother ayad he was bleeding from his legs knees and forehead i told my sister find out if hes still breathing she said no nothing i started crying the next day they took away his body
7176588 the americans told us nobody is going to sleep tonight they played scary music continuously with loud voices as soon as someone fell asleep they started beating on the door it was christmas they kept us there for three days many of the us soldiers were drunk
7176589 the guards used wild dogs i saw one of the guards allow his dog to bite a 14 year old boy on the leg the boys name was adil other guards frequently beat the men i could see the blood running from their noses they would also take them for compulsory cold showers even though it was january and february from the very beginning it was mental and psychological war
7176590 because i could speak a bit of english i was given the job of emptying the rubbish there was never enough food and one day i came across an old woman who had collapsed from hunger the americans were always eating lots of hot food i found some in a packet in a bin and gave it to her they caught me and threw me in a one meter square punishment cell they then poured cold water on me for four hours
7176591 it became a running joke the other women began to nickname me the queen of the rpg rocket propelled grenade the american interrogators were entirely ignorant and knew nothing about iraqi people the vast majority of people there were innocent
7176592 mrs palmer told us that during the inspection we had to lie quietly on our beds she said that if we behaved we would be allowed to spend more time out of our cells in the sun the following day general miller turned up with a huge number of journalists i heard him telling them that some of the people kept in here were murderers i shouted out we are not the killers you are the killers this is our country you have invaded it after that they didnt let me out of my cell for an entire month a us officer came to me and said because of you we have all been punished
7176593 after eight months in prison they suddenly treated me like a queen it was weird
7176594 they offered me some pepsi i could take a shower there was air conditioning there were four female soldiers to look after me the doctor came to see me four times in 24 hours they made me sign a piece of paper promising not to leave the country and then i was free
7176595 the fact that abuses occurred isnt really news any more we know they did and those who are accused are being prosecuted for it
7176596 for a woman in an eastern society to spend months in us custody is very difficult
7176597 if you believe you cant flood thats when you increase the risk of flooding in new orleans i dont think they talk about the risk
7176598 theyve heightened the levees theyre raised up it makes me feel safe
7176599 this wall here wasnt there when we had the flood
7176600 when i look at it now i say maybe if we had had it up it there then maybe we wouldnt have flooded
7176601 we did go in and did a whole bunch of levee work right after betsy
7176602 we were under the illusion that what we had done would prevent another betsy from flooding the area
7176603 the progress i see each time i visit is really remarkable the region has a better hurricane and storm damage reduction system in place than ever before in its history and it will continue to get better
7176604 we are in pretty good shape financially to do quite a bit of work in this area
7176605 its almost one of those proverbial you cant get there from where we are situations
7176606 all the human instincts post katrina are the same as post betsy
7176607 we keep building in holes and contractors keep trying to move in and take advantage of a situation they come in with a bunch of contractors sell off property in low places take their money and run
7176608 you see that green spot up there thats below sea level well below sea level
7176609 theres some people going to have dinner tonight out there in new orleans east theyre walking on the floor inside their house at 13 feet below sea level
7176610 were in the job of risk reduction not risk elimination
7176611 strictly relying on levees alone should not give anyone the impression they are risk free i think that would be a horrible mistake to make
7176612 what we learn from history is that we learn nothing from history
7176613 and whats going to happen after katrina pick a name and put it on it and its going to happen again unless we pull together to make sure

7176691 in the last several years and years that ive been doing the study you could see that indian gaming has had very healthy growth its continually outdone commercial gaming
7176692 that continued to be true this year but indian gaming had slower growth in 2007 and this is actually the third year in a row of slower growth
7176693 it was about 15 percent growth in 2005 in 2006 it was 10 percent and now its only 5 percent
7176694 but while i think its part of that i think there is a more pervasive reason why indian gaming has been slowing down at least in the last couple years
7176695 by limiting the supply i mean not allowing tribes to have certain types of games or not allowing them to have more games
7176696 what im seeing is the tribes developing their facilities and wanting to do more but theyre not allowed to even tribes where they try to renegotiate with the states or try to get more machines in certain places the state just refuses to negotiate with them and wont give them more
7176697 the fact is that the tribes that are all renegotiating these compacts are trying to get an increase in supply why not because they dont need it theyre doing it because they do need it in california theres going to be a huge increase in the revenue sharing the tribes are willing to pay to do this they dont do that lightly
7176698 there are some of these states where there seems to be limitations on supply but yet the demand is there california for sure washington arizona even some smaller states like south dakota and montana are examples where there seems to be demand greater than supply
7176699 so i think that what ive seen happening is a slowdown but its sort of an artificial slowdown its not all because of the economy its not because the markets saturated theres no more players or they dont want to play its in some ways because you can only do so much with what youve got
7176700 i think the slowdown is likely to continue a bit more until the economy recovers which is going to happen this is the way the economy is up down it will pick up it will eventually turn around
7176701 when it does and when the tribes get the consumer confidence back and theyre able to develop their facilities to fulfill the maximum potential of their compacts youre going to see some good sizable growth youre going to see indian gaming rebound and youre going to see some stronger numbers back to where they had been before this past year
7176702 to come on line and add a new facility is increasing the supply and meeting some unmet demand
7176703 if you offer them non gaming amenities you get people to come from farther distances they stay longer and they spend more money
7176704 insisted on the importance of a rapid pull out of russian soldiers present on the poti senaki route
7176705 who else could have succeeded in mixing the philosopher averroes with fred astaire thats what cinema should be about
7176706 this election is going to be decisive definitely if anwar wins we will be one step closer to taking over the government
7176707 from our assessment we are leading we have to win big it will mean the people reject racial politics
7176708 it is un malay to make these allegations anwar has a family and he has five daughters
7176709 politics is one thing but you are shaming a family man i am afraid that if we go overboard in attacking him and accusing him of anti malay it will backfire we will lose votes we saw that happen in the march polls
7176710 these umno leaders are doing nothing but splitting the people further they have taken this campaign to an all time low by harping on the sodomy allegations
7176711 theres no middle men involved its coming straight from my farm to the consumer and im taking all the precautions to make sure that my produce is safe

7176724 to stay in the game asean must become a strong integrated region
7176725 what we are seeing is that asean is at the focal point of all these trade agreements
7176726 eventually when you consolidate the ftas it is possible that you could end up with something like that an asia wide fta
7176727 substantial gains could be realized from consolidating the many ftas into a single region wide one
7176728 governments need to connect the poor to the thriving regional economy by eliminating labor market barriers investing in workers capabilities and building infrastructure to connect disadvantaged regions with economic centers
7176729 we are witnessing the beginnings of a strong prosperous outward looking asian economic community regionally integrated yet connected with global markets and with responsibility and influence to match its economic weight
7176730 ive got no control over this i cant say enough now alright for five years ive got to keep going back for tests and stuff

7176769 hehehe it was hilarious and great at the same time after strumming we saw sunrise together it was good kahit mejo nasisilaw ako sige then finally nagising na rin giro
7176770 honestly i was hoping for hillary clinton but thats not to be
7176771 i dont know how he would be different from hillary
7176772 he brings a comfort level that hillary would bring its not a disappointing choice its an exciting choice
7176773 it alienates people who supported hillary because one of the reasons stated for not choosing her is shes a washington insider and then he picks someone whos been in washington for 35 years
7176774 im not of the opinion that hillary clinton was seeking the vice presidency to begin with
7176775 the way the campaign was run with everything that was said it wouldnt have been good for the ticket
7176776 because im certain that hes going to use her in some manner in his administration
7176777 participation by civilian and military agencies of a government in any of the action programs taken by another government or other designated organization to free and protect its society from subversion lawlessness and insurgency
7176778 insurgency matters today because it is linked to the phenomenon of transnational terrorism insurgents have long used terrorism in the operational sense deterring those who supported the government and creating an environment of violence and insecurity to erode public trust in the regime but now terrorism plays a strategic role as well insurgents can use terrorism as a form of long range power projection against outsiders who support the government they are fighting this could deter or even end outside assistance it is easy to imagine for instance that the already fragile backing for american involvement in iraq would erode even further if the iraqi insurgents launched attacks in the united states even more important an insurgent movement able to seize control of a state could support transnational terrorists the idea is that insurgents have demonstrated an affinity for violence and extremism which would flavor their policies if they came to power
7176779 it is less the chance of an insurgent victory which creates a friendly environment for transnational terrorism than persistent internal conflict shattering control and restraint in a state during an insurgency both the insurgents and the government focus on each other necessarily leaving parts of the country with minimal security and control transnational terrorists exploit this and protracted insurgency creates a general disregard for law and order organized crime and corruption blossom much of the population loses its natural aversion to violence thus a society brutalized and wounded by a protracted insurgency is more likely to spawn a variety of evils spewing violent individuals into the world long after the conflict ends
7176780 every authority on counterinsurgency emphasizes the need for unity of command in the threatened area and emphasizes the primacy of political planning over military but for various reasons having to do with u s intragovernmental rivalry u s policy perpetuates competing lines of command and competition between military and political leaders in insurgency and preinsurgency theaters
7176781 much must be done to rebuild the department of states capacity to reestablish balanced country teams and strong coms in threatened areas
7176782 low income countries are about 15 times more susceptible to internal conflict than countries in the
7176783 agricultural trade disputes were a key issue in the stalled doha round at the same time the united states must unilaterally give poor countries access to its markets through initiatives such as the african growth and opportunity act
7176784 the governments of major developing countries must play a large part in designing and carrying out new strategies for proof one need only look at the radically different international responses to the locally initiated new partnership for africas development nepad which was embraced and the bush administrations greater middle east initiative which was not
7176785 the first priority for any government facing an insurgency is to establish a secure environment
7176786 gaining and maintaining the support of the population is the overall goal and path to victory since the population is the center of gravity therefore it is imperative for long term success that the population views the government as legitimate it is equally important for the us effort to be viewed as legitimate versus being viewed as an occupier or supporting a puppet government
7176787 it is also important for the governments internal defense efforts to be legitimized accepted and supported by the international community
7176788 if done correctly the first three lines should de legitimize the insurgents and lead to their lasting defeat this line will attack the hard core insurgents some may succumb to offers of amnesty but most will need to be killed or captured through offensive operations
7176789 as the internal security forces are trained the coalition will transition to only protecting the nation from external threats until such a time as the actual national military force is trained equipped and can conduct unilateral operations
7176790 the end state is a legitimate government that the population trusts and is able to detect and defeat internal and external threats
7176791 interfere with impartiality as well as undermine long term programs
7176792 an example would be if a commander directed execution of civil action projects that fall outside his authority rebuilding structures training local nationals and other activities may be good for the local population but they may be beyond the mandate and mission
7176793 ensuring that rule of law to protect property and the right of the public
7176794 transparency in a developing governments decision making its allocation of budgetary funds and its administration of the rule of law must also be promoted
7176795 a vital point here is that the realities of modernity technical social political are inexorable
7176796 as a group they were progressive moderates categorically opposed to terrorism
7176797 the gravest crisis in the world today turns on the question of how to prevent a destructive confrontation between the west and the whole of islam if there is an answer it lies in persuading the great majority of muslims totaling some 2 billion people to choose modernity and moderation and to reject the blind alley offered by its nihilist minority in this context a 200 000 state department program aimed at explaining the basic tenets and promises of american democracy to future leaders of south asia looks more cost effective than a 400 billion defense budget
7176798 cannot simply avoid or wish away dealing with local elites for ultimately their actions not those of the external power will strengthen or undermine institutions money especially money given to governments for their help against an external enemy cannot buy legitimacy
7176799 third in using short term measures to resolve complex crises an external power must be careful not to inadvertently exacerbate the situation or create new problems altogether
7176800 the bloody civil war consumed afghanistan paving the way for the taliban and al qaeda to take control of the government
7176801 community empowerment and citizens to play a greater role in determining afghanistans destiny acs is committed to increasing public participation in the decision making process through democracy building policy development and independent media
7176802 to be credible in such messages the hn government as well as other policy influencers such as clerics educators politicians and media need to condemn the acts while recognizing grievances
7176803 in a struggle for legitimacy founded on justice can a government execute its opponents without trial that was what assassination of insurgent leaders amounted to in el salvador and vietnam
7176804 indirect support focuses on building strong national infrastructures through economic and military capabilities that contribute to self sufficiency
7176805 the arabs loved them as they showed the solidarity of the soldiers hand in hand
7176806 create dissension disorganization low morale subversion and defection within insurgent forces as well as help discredit them
7176807 gain preserve and strengthen civilian support for the hn government and its counterinsurgency programs
7176808 avoid anything that can be turned against hn forces by insurgents
7176809 gain the support of uncommitted groups inside and outside the hn

7176813 i just went to first base to see what happened
7176814 i see the ball in the dirt the hitter walked toward the dugout to throw his bat and helmet away he in doing so has abandoned his effort to reach the next base hes called out according to the rule
7176815 i explained to him that after a crew consultation that you cannot argue the decision after the explanation
7176816 we gave him his explanation and he continued to argue we warned him twice

7176852 in some ways i think we pay more attention to what is going on than the rest of the country
7176853 but we want to hear real concrete answers not hope not change but how the next presidents policies affect our pocketbooks
7176854 if just six bush voters in each ohio precinct had been persuaded to vote the other way kerry would be the president
7176855 there had never been a large focus on how to build strategically something that lasts that has strong grassroots that mobilizes voters and moves the message
7176856 when ted strickland decided to run for governor in 2006 we decided that we needed to build the party from the grassroots up
7176857 kerry focused on only 16 counties out of our 88
7176858 he won 16 and lost 72 two years later strickland focused on all 88 counties he won 72 and lost 16

7176939 joe biden is what so many others pretend to be a statesman with sound judgment who doesnt have to hide behind bluster to keep america strong
7176940 he has stared down dictators and spoken out for americas cops and firefighters he is uniquely suited to be my partner as we work to put our country back on track
7176941 barack obama sounded as though he turned over the top spot on the ticket today to his new mentor when he introduced joe biden as the next president
7176942 the reality is that nothing has changed since joe biden first made his assessment that barack obama is not ready to lead he wasnt ready then and he isnt ready now
7176943 but we really have different approaches to many national security issues i look forward to whoever my running mate will be having a respectful debate with him on that as well
7176944 my child is potty training today we have stuffed her full of drinks and she pees about every 10 to 15 minutes she has used the potty several times when we take her to it at timed intervals she does not seem to understand that when she feels the urge she should go sit on the potty herself she pees wherever she is sitting a few times on us and does not seem to mind i do not want to catch her pee all day long what do you suggest we do
7176945 these were basically attacks intended to result in the social exclusion or humiliation of the speaker punctuated on occasion with profanity a nasty glare or even a solid punch to the arm
7176946 what did the big chimney say to the little chimney
7176947 the predominant verbal reaction to failed humour in our study was oriented exclusively toward attacking the speaker
7176948 being selected as an appropriate audience for a stupid joke suggests that there is something amiss with the hearers sense of humour
7176949 i told them just go out and tell bad jokes be a hero in the field bell said
7176950 the younger you are and the closer you are in age to your failed humorist the more likely you are to attack
7176951 so youre probably talking about 20 percent of the new project and relative to the rest of the roading network its sort of less than two or three percent

7176953 t m on oudoin harrastukseni mutta t ll on omanlaisensa tunnelma
7176954 start spreading the news im not gonna lose i am the intercontinental champion two times two
7176955 get out of your systems because youll never be chanting that again
7176956 there are more living organisms on the skin of a single human being than there are human beings on the surface of the earth
7176957 we knew how to get the milk out of the cows but nothing about processing
7176958 its labor intensive but to hear people say this is the best milk ive had that makes you feel like youre doing a service to the community
7176959 dont pay us a dime until you get it going
7176960 im here to help make it work and get it off the ground
7176961 im retired so i dont have to come to work i like coming down here and doing this
7176962 but glass doesnt affect the taste of the milk and keeps it colder
7176963 everyone would rather drink anything other than milk in warm weather
7176964 you can just imagine a bunch of 50 60 70 year olds getting loaded on chocolate milk
7176965 incredibly down to earth and a very warm person who is well respected in the senate
7176966 what he brings to barack obama is the fact that he is not a yes man hes going to challenge senator obama to be the best president he can be
7176967 mondale brought candid advice to president carter joe biden will do the same for barack obama
7176968 hes exactly what we needed at exactly the right time
7176969 the good thing though is that the mccain campaign has made international relations a big issue and biden makes it a stronger democratic ticket
7176970 first off speaking as a republican id like to say that i think its a very good choice
7176971 it addresses a lot of the weaknesses that senator obama has as a candidate and it adds to the ticket someone with experience
7176972 as a republican leader i think its a good choice for republicans
7176973 an admission that he realizes people are not confident in his foreign policy positions
7176974 we think its really needed because its not something anybody else is doing
7176975 the people we deal with are many of them in extreme poverty
7176976 for many of the kids this is it this is their one chance never have they gone somewhere with the ability to spend 100 in one shot
7176977 just the idea of a new pair of tennis shoes instead of used ones will be meaningful
7176978 shes picking out great outfits she knows what she wants
7176979 ooh thats adorable youre going to look really cute in that
7176980 will you add for me while i say the numbers
7176981 twelve plus nine plus i have no clue well guess 10
7176982 i think we should be good what do you say these shirts are like seven each
7176983 it was a ritual and i wanted to share in someone elses ritual
7176984 its just a nice way to start the year off with a sense of turning over a new leaf
7176985 it gives the kids a lot of self confidence it makes them feel good about themselves it makes them better students
7176986 it was great its nice to see the kids happy
7176987 whoever the donor is i thank them id do it again in a heartbeat
7176988 someone said to me we dont have a white google why do you need a black google
7176989 and i said of course you do its called google
7176990 ive been mayor for 10 years and we havent seen anything like this
7176991 its dirty politics they dont care about the people and all they care about is their interests
7176992 the petrodollar has hovered over lebanon for a long time and now it is landing and will not leave
7176993 attracting the best and brightest into the industry is a challenge its not happening
7176994 essentially we took the nobility and the necessity out of it and replaced it with this vague sense of drudgery
7176995 in the last several years all of the benefits of a career in the trades have kind of gotten lost in the clutter of all the other career opportunities
7176996 what the industry needs is to be much more aggressive in marketing and creating visibility
7176997 its not like going to college where you go to school for five to eight years and have to work a part time job
7176998 i chose the path that i wanted to take and learned as much as i could for that one thing
7176999 you go to college to kind of figure out what you want to do but if you dont figure it out you go out with debt and you still dont know
7177000 its economic formulas are simply not suitable for addressing cost effectiveness in this area of medicine
7177001 it is essential that nice gets its sums right we have seen distraught patients remortgaging their houses giving up pensions and selling cars to buy drugs that are freely available to those using health services in countries of comparable wealth
7177002 we now spend similar amounts to europe on health generally and cancer care in particular but less than two thirds of the european average on cancer drugs
7177003 it just cant be that everybody else around the world is wrong about access to innovative cancer care and the nhs right in rationing it so severely
7177004 the time has come for a radical change in how the nhs makes rationing decisions for cancer
7177005 there is a finite pot of money for the nhs which is determined annually by parliament
7177006 if one group of patients is provided with cost ineffective care other groups lacking powerful lobbyists will be denied cost effective care for miserable conditions like schizophrenia crohns disease or cystic fibrosis
7177007 with a brilliant smile and the early facial creases of happy dissipation he was known for being cranky curious passive aggressive and most of all persnickety
7177008 insulted the honour of a nation the fact that the picture depicts a sumo wrestler who is not actually a sumo wrestler but has been made up to look like one would be considered a high insult to the japanese community
7177009 we go through this expletive every year and at the end of the year well take another ring for us
7177010 theres nowhere else to go its part of the game theres not much you can do about it weve been here before
7177011 theres nothing else to say i didnt get strike one and when i did i couldnt put them away it was just one of those days you have them every now and again youve just got to forget about it and wash it down the drain
7177012 i was rushing through my delivery not a good tempo and when i got the ground balls i needed they werent at people it just wasnt my day
7177013 if you get to the bullpen early you run the risk of pitching guys more than youre supposed to which doesnt help
7177014 but if daisuke matsuzaka comes out and pitches the way hes supposed to today it doesnt matter what happened yesterday or last week
7177015 we go through this expletive every year and at the end of the year well take another ring for us
7177016 the mind set used to be that on your day that was your game
7177017 i learned it fast because i was around jim palmer and some pretty good pitchers when i broke in that there was no way you were going to survive the season going max effort on every pitch
7177018 i needed to come up with a third pitch to survive the philosophy was to get to the sixth inning as fast as you can on the fewest amount of pitches thrown and you had a chance to complete the game and get a win for some reason its done a 180 degree turn and now its go six innings or 100 pitches whatever comes first as hard as you can for as long as you can
7177019 theres been greater emphasis placed on pitch counts for preserving the pitcher for the lack of a better term as an asset just because of the cost to acquire the cost to develop
7177020 so in addition to the information thats proven out if you look back at the pitchers who have thrown three consecutive years at 200 plus innings thats the precursor in a lot of cases to some injuries so i think because of that every effort has been made to keep pitch counts in that 100 115 range and a lot of times thats about seven innings
7177021 theyre kind of accepting the fact now i only have to give them six or seven good innings
7177022 i think the game has become more specialized with roles but i also think its more difficult for pitchers to pitch in the big leagues these days particularly starters because there is so much more information available to the opposition
7177023 i think every hitter now knows the tendencies of every pitcher so if you dont repeat your delivery and execute pitches i think you can find yourself in some long innings so the stress on those pitches can increase the strike zones are smaller because of questec and its the video thats available and the scouting information thats available to everyone i think it makes it that much more difficult to pitch in todays game
7177024 i know its a risk to fight right now but i want to stay busy i think its best for my body to stay sharp and get ready for the next fight im looking for some top contender thats the main thing i want to fight someone tough
7177025 every fight there are different challenges and that could have happened with the last fight and the fight before that i know its a risk but its best for my career to stay busy stay fighting and really keep getting that experience fighting the top guys
7177026 he turns fights into brawls and thats when it starts going in his favor
7177027 facing a guy who has knockout power and has hurt people in the past you have to be smart i could see in the second round that he could see it wasnt going his way and it was frustrating him i could see he knew his gameplan wasnt going to work
7177028 i was definitely tempted at times especially before the fight
7177029 i just kept thinking about my brother keith and head trainer mark dellagrotte and my boxing coach peter welch and all those guys saying stick to the gameplan dont get emotional do what youre trained to do anytime you fight you kind of want to show i have a better chin or i can knock you out
7177030 i dont think he expected my footwork to be as good
7177031 i think he thought i was going to stand in front of him a little bit more i was evasive and i mixed up my attack and i think it just kept him off balance it was confusing him all night
7177032 in the participation age things are just radically different throw out all your preconceptions about how companies should operate and stock should be traded share price is simply an outdated concept in the participation age and stock ownership should not be the exclusive privilege of the wealthy capitalists or just for select company employees
7177033 by open sourcing sun stock we are increasing the opportunity for people everywhere to participate in the growth of our company every download of free shares will generate an increase in market visibility for sun microsystems and should improve awareness of our broad portfolio of free open sourced technology more downloads will generate more visibility more visibility will generate more downloads its as simple as that this kind of positive synergy will undoubtedly reward all the participants in the sun ecosystem thats the power inherent in the participation age

7177042 i think the democrats ought to continue to be overly optimistic about everything that happens this fall

7177069 i cant believe the number of nationally significant stories that are associated with dayton
7177070 honestly its been slow but i think that the community is recognizing its history more and more
7177071 our play ground was an old field where there were some cows we ball and the cow dung was used for bases
7177072 we were not allowed to wear shoes in the summer
7177073 im going to tell your father and he would paddle when he got home
7177074 when i wasnt feeling good two chairs together blanket pillow made a bed to lay down on before noon when i was sick
7177075 boring dresden was boring nothing to do movie but didnt have the money to go home coming was 1 time a year and you got 15 cents to spend you could blow it all in one night or spread it out didnt get paid for chores what you did was expected of you my job was washing dishes which i hated and canning jars the only thing that made you mad was that they would come in and mess it up
7177076 everything that comes out of her mouth is very motivational
7177077 she said she was very proud of me and i was very proud of her she was telling me that i got better since weve played together and she loved the way i worked but half of that goes to her because i admire her and i try to do some of the things she does
7177078 we congratulated each other and said how happy we were for each other
7177079 i put this uniform on when i was in the 11th grade and i worked my way up to the national team
7177080 ive had the opportunity to play with so many great players
7177081 shes going to be in my ear for the next few years
7177082 ill make sure we keep in touch if a torch is handed off i dont have any choice but to take it and run with it
7177083 as an organisation we owe it to our athletes to provide the preparation they need to succeed
7177084 we will do everything we can to figure out what went wrong and to make sure it doesnt happen again
7177085 pure raw talent that has been properly nurtured were reaping the rewards of all that hard work
7177086 that scrappy kid from scranton who beat the odds the dedicated family man and committed catholic the kind of fighter who i want by my side in the months and years to come
7177087 champ its not how many times you get knocked down its how quickly you get up
7177088 thats your story thats americas story its about if you get up you can make it
7177089 the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy
7177090 that rare mix for decades he has brought change to washington but washington hasnt changed him
7177091 tragedy tests us it tests our fortitude and it tests our faith
7177092 heres how joe biden responded he never moved to washington instead night after night week after week year after year he returned home to wilmington on a lonely amtrak train when his senate business was done
7177093 we havent given him the best run support but every game we feel like we have a great chance to win when he pitches and again he pitched great today
7177094 hes been the type of guy that has been plugging away
7177095 unfortunately he hasnt had the best couple of weeks but hes been a player in there working hard every single day so for him to come up with the big hit in the first inning definitely got us out in front and i think that was huge
7177096 hes pitched some good ballgames where he got some losses and hes pitched some real close ones where he didnt get any decisions
7177097 thats my mind set to really focus on preventing runs instead of watching how many runs we have
7177098 were capable of scoring definitely more than three runs a night
7177099 when were clicking were going to average about five runs a game when were really good once we get consistent and start scoring runs like we can and our pitching stays as good as its been were going to win quite a few games
7177100 everything i hit everything i putt just falls in the hole
7177101 we had ups and we had downs just wanted to end on a high moment
7177102 it doesnt make up for it but its a start to the healing process
7177103 we won more medals it just didnt come from where everyone else thought it should come
7177104 a lot of things happened in this olympics that we werent expecting
7177105 but well use that to build on i know next year at the world championships its going to be different
7177106 the boys ran a good race they ran a tough race bekele took charge
7177107 they wanted to end it with a good dose of good ol american apple pie
7177108 my medal count goal is that at the end of the day when 91 000 people leave that stadium
7177109 theyve heard our national anthem so many times that theyre humming it on their way out the door
7177110 were a team thats leading our division and he just comes out there and hes 18 years old and he dominated us he just battled us we didnt have a chance tonight he just shut us down
7177111 you see tears theyre tears of happiness though we came a long way this tournament
7177112 its a blessing for me to be out on this floor now participating in my fourth olympics and walking away with a fourth gold medal
7177113 weve said from day one that top to bottom we are a deep team
7177114 we just send wave after wave of players at you
7177115 we werent going to be the team to let lisa lose
7177116 you cant shoot less than 40 percent and expect to win gold medals
7177117 a strong yet graceful athlete with good bat speed and a smooth swing
7177118 he would get funky with his stride at times his hands would get there too late or too early or hed lose leverage and wouldnt get behind the ball
7177119 no ones going to give you a good explanation for ryan ludwick

7177141 se habla de interculturalidad pero no se garantiza el derecho al idioma y a la historia de los pueblos originarios

7177153 la idea es generar un espacio de encuentro debate y dialogo entre distintos actores del mbito acad mico empresarial estado y sociedad civil relativo a diversos aspectos de la convivencia intercultural en el contexto local nacional y latinoamericano
7177154 trabajo colectivo entre los actores interesados en imaginar un nuevo proyecto de sociedad considerando los actuales debates pol tico jur dicos sobre la materia

7177165 como colegio creemos que es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos arbitraria e ilegalmente en circunstancias que estaba realizando su labor profesional ser a muy relevante que carabineros reconozca de una vez por todas el error en el procedimiento considerando que la ciudadan a cada d a est m s atenta al actuar de los organismos p blicos
7177166 por eso entendemos que el gobierno quiera impulsar la tipificaci n penal de las agresiones que sufran los profesionales de la prensa en el cumplimiento de sus labores informativas a la luz de diversas situaciones que han vivido los colegas en el ltimo tiempo como el caso del fot grafo de efe v ctor salas quien result herido en el ojo derecho al ser agredido meses atr s por un agente antidisturbios de carabineros
7177167 viven preocupados del transantiago y no hacen nada con el transmapuche
7177168 y d nde est el famoso estado de derecho sirve acaso para algo
7177169 estamos ante un hecho delictual o m s bien pol tico
7177170 claramente se trata de un simple hecho delictual lo peor ser a darle un cariz pol tico a estas acciones vand licas repudiadas por la ciudadania
7177171 extra o hecho delictual donde los malhechores no roban nada y lo que parecieran visibilizar m s bien son consignas
7177172 quien no entiende a la buena entender con toda la fuerza del derecho
7177173 estamos ante un hecho delictual y perseguiremos crimin lmente a los responsables
7177174 seremos m s severos en la represi n no se va a tolerar ning n tipo de impunidad

7177181 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
7177182 la ministra de medio ambiente nos aclar que dos funcionarios que hab an trabajado en la conama fueron reclutados por la ani y que ellos como ministerio no han ordenado ni participado de una tarea as es m s la rechazan completamente por lo que ahora pediremos una cita al ministro del interior
7177183 existe todo un procedimiento en caso que las fuerzas armadas tengan que participar en apoyo de la polic a nacional para el control del orden p blico as como la protecci n de un servicio p blico esencial se explic al personal militar cuales son las alternativas que tienen los revoltosos dentro del rechazo de parte del ej rcito puede ser mediante una acci n letal de disparar a la pierna los brazos hasta una acci n letal esperemos que la cordura se manifieste y no tengamos que ir a all estamos listos tenemos los medios tenemos el helic ptero tenemos todo
7177184 pedimos al ejecutivo que tenga mucho cuidado esta no es una movilizaci n normal y corriente el gobierno ha declarado una guerra abierta a los ind genas y ellos han dicho que continuar con su protesta hasta que no se solucionen sus problemas no tienen miedo prefieren morir all que perder sus tierras
7177185 hay un movimiento para liberar los territorios ancestrales ind genas y hasta ser independientes del estado peruano
7177186 desmiento cualquier vinculaci n con patria roja no hemos recibido ninguna llamada del congresista isla no tenemos nada que ver con hugo ch vez no tenemos nada que ver con ning n partido pol tico porque stos lejos de solucionarnos los problemas nos traen m s

7177191 aspiramos a un mundo respetuoso de los derechos humanos en particular aspiramos a que los pueblos y las comunidades locales puedan definir su propio destino en un marco de diversidad solidaridad y reciprocidad
7177192 contribuir a las transformaciones sociales culturales e institucionales de chile y la regi n mediante la promoci n de una ciudadan a activa e intercultural de modo de permitir que los pueblos las comunidades locales y las personas ejerzan sus derechos humanos en un contexto de diversidad reciprocidad y respeto
7177193 es incre ble que en un pa s democr tico en el cual muchos han ca do muchos han sido encarcelados muchos han sido desterrados a n no se goce esa libertad de expresi n a n tengamos que estar en c rceles a n no podamos disfrutar de verdad lo que significa
7177194 con un temor a poder decir estoy en libertad y yo pienso esto
7177195 al final de toda esta historia la dignidad se haga costumbre en nuestro pa s y en nuestra tierra latinoamericana
7177196 que sufre d a a d a este mismo problema a todos los marginados de este pa s a todos aquellos que han sido reprimidos y han tenido que emigrar incluso
7177197 parece absurdo que el gobierno pida que levantemos la huelga para dialogar con nosotros los presidentes de las comunidades han dicho que seguir n y as ser lo que pasa es que el estado no quiere entender que estamos reclamando nuestros derechos vulnerados por mucho tiempo
7177198 no necesitamos una comisi n mediadora sino un proceso de coordinaci n para hacer efectivo este acercamiento y que los puntos planteados en la plataforma de lucha sean escuchados
7177199 detr s de los pueblos ind genas no hay nadie
7177200 en representaci n de 200 000 ind genas organizados en 35 federaciones de comunidades nativas nosotros hemos respaldado la acci n de inconstitucionalidad contra los decretos 1015 1073 1064 y 1089 presentada por la defensora del pueblo
7177201 nuestra propuesta plantea la definici n de una pol tica sobre pueblos ind genas el fortalecimiento de la institucionalidad la creaci n de un marco jur dico que proteja a nuestros pueblos y la elaboraci n de un plan de desarrollo sostenible
7177202 no apoya ni promueve ninguna movilizaci n bajo el t rmino de pacifica
7177203 al tama o que ha llegado la industria comienzo a cuestionarme si no ser mejor consolidar lo que tenemos y no estar en una carrera permanente de crecimiento el mensaje que nos mand la naturaleza con las enfermedades me lleva a preguntarme si es el momento de ordenar lo que tenemos y tener un crecimiento m s sustentable en el tiempo
7177204 la industria deber a seguir creciendo a tasas cercanas al 10 por ciento y duplicar su tama o en las zonas donde no es tan grande como en las regiones xi y xii
7177205 hes like randy johnson when randy johnson was randy johnson if you know what i mean
7177206 im sure there will be good lessons to be learned
7177207 the ball had life out of my hand its comforting to know that when youre trying stuff to get better that it works its a weight off the mind
7177208 hes in great standing with this organization hes very much in our future plans
7177209 it wasnt a terrible start it was encouraging he attacked the zone he was kind of efficient he kept the ball down
7177210 he just had trouble putting hitters away the two strike hits and two out runs got him
7177211 but im not going to do that im going to continue to work hard and get better
7177212 there were a few things that he needed to do
7177213 one was getting his fastball command back that was probably the no 1 issue the velocity were used to seeing would have been a bonus had that come all the way back his velocity came back a little bit
7177214 there also was the focus on the mound the concentration the not letting things get to him and not be so defensive in his approach to pitching and not worry about contact
7177215 and free his brain a little bit and realize theres more that he can do and just sharpen up his game
7177216 he did what we envisioned him going down and doing
7177217 he took a pretty innocent picture and made it look sleazy
7177218 one female student nordic was told by gay that he shared her online personal info with a state inmate who said he gratified himself with her photo and would tear her apart
7177219 so i need to figure out how to do this
7177220 i needed to catch a break and he gave it to me
7177221 it was good right up until whatever lap that was where i made a mistake
7177222 it came out from underneath me there and i had to check up or i would have spun out
7177223 thats as bad of a points night as we could have
7177224 we just have to keep our heads up we know were good enough to go win this championship still
7177225 its good when you can be frustrated with second but we did give one away today when you look at it it was obvious
7177226 this season weve really risen toward the top and we compete week in and week out with the best in the series
7177227 and be subject to one another in the fear of christ
7177228 that the truth of the gospel might continue with you
7177229 if he be for me who can be against me
7177230 he doeth according to his will in the army of heaven and among the inhabitants of the earth and none can stay his hand or say unto him what doest thou
7177231 i in them and thou in me that they may be made perfect in one
7177232 therefore let no man glory in men for all things are yours
7177233 blessed be the god and father of our lord jesus christ who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in christ according as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in love
7177234 seek ye first the kingdom of god and his righteousness and all these things will be added unto you
7177235 they that seek the lord shall not want for any good thing
7177236 i have learned in whatsoever state i am therewith to be content
7177237 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
7177238 its a great thing to honor the people on flight 93 by putting together all three attack sites the pentagon the world trade center and pennsylvania
7177239 its their first runway show but they know what theyre doing theyve done ralph lauren
7177240 this is her third year here so shes a veteran runway model
7177241 its so fun and such a joy to work with the dogs
7177242 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
7177243 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
7177244 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
7177245 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
7177246 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
7177247 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location

7177250 tim yang bermain di lapangan akan selalu memberikan perjuangan maksimal namun saya yakin kalau semangat dari para tifosi ini dapat menyumbangkan tiga atau empat poin lebih tinggi pada kejuaraan ini
7177251 kami akan pergi ke sana kandang artmedia dengan tujuan mengamankan jatah liga champions untuk itu kami harus memiliki determinasi yang sama seperti yang kami perlihatkan di turin

7177258 of his own will begat he us with the word of truth

7177262 theyre kind of surprised that ive been playing with it up to this point
7177263 thats what i want to do thats why this decision is even out there still and not already made because i want to play period the question is what should i do how long should i play with it
7177264 its a thousand different options at this point and im just trying to make the best one
7177265 im just trying to make the best decision possible for the team and for my career
7177266 right now in talking to him his mind set is hes doing everything he can to get ready for carolina our opener
7177267 he just wants to get a little bit more information on his knee
7177268 results of genetic testing from three samples of the products recalled by maple leaf foods show that two tested positive for the outbreak strain of listeria
7177269 there is a very active effort to work with all the food distribution customers but it is not as direct because there are customers and then those customers have customers
7177270 this is unprecedented in terms of the slow nature of this storm the large circulation and the fact that its impacted probably about 90 percent of the state with heavy rains and severe weather
7177271 i want to be that way when i turn 50
7177272 both us and the police are in the middle of investigating whether it happened or not
7177273 were getting two sides of a story of course and we have not fully interviewed everyone that may have information
7177274 weve met with the alleged perpetrator and the alleged victim and well follow our protocol with dealing with this incident
7177275 we felt like we needed to let our campus know that that had occurred
7177276 forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us
7177277 whose sins you have forgiven are forgiven whose sins you have retained are retained
7177278 if the stars were to be appear but one night in a thousand years how would men believe and adore and preserve for many generations the remembrance of the city of god which they had seen
7177279 it must have been a big secret if an 8th grader found it
7177280 for the next phase because of the economy we wanted to be more conservative
7177281 so instead of all 33 we decided to do it in phases so well have phase two three and four
7177282 at this point we have a signed agreement to sell one of the 10 lots
7177283 they have to be a certain value and so many square feet
7177284 they must be 1 800 square feet minimum must have a value of at least 200 000 2007 figures they have certain restrictions to keep uniformity they can be one or two stories and it has to be a residential home
7177285 i love working with individuals with developmental disabilities and the staff that do that job
7177286 you dont ever replace someone like him he brings the heart to the job
7177287 im not sure we can find someone as focused on the individuals
7177288 all the experience of those people who have brought to the job their knowledge and most important their relationships with the individuals we serve as well as their families
7177289 one of the recommendations look at wherever possible consolidating resources and regionalizing
7177290 its probably not a good idea to try to be in two places at the same time you dont get to really be among the individuals people living here and working here as you should but i wanted to be a good soldier and test it out ive done more than an adequate job but the strickland administration director john martin and my boss ginnie whisman are all pretty sure every facility should have their own superintendent
7177291 but it seemed at a time when were telling employees were trying to cut back and save money and by the way were hiring a superintendent seemed like the wrong message at the time
7177292 i put more heart and soul into trying to do whats right in tiffin we have a very new leadership staff in tiffin i think thats something the new superintendent is going to be happy to inherit
7177293 my compassion for the individuals outweighs my compassion for the staff mistreatment of individuals that level of engagement from staff members will never be tolerated
7177294 you can have a phone put it in your locker we have a switchboard we can get a hold of you your not going to be on the phone when your taking care of the people your being paid to i had to see if for myself
7177295 its ok because everyone here is used to it but when youve been at the other 10 centers its not how the other ones look i think they have done a wonderful job trying to make it look as home like as possible
7177296 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
7177297 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
7177298 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7177299 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7177300 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7177301 do all things without murmuring and grumbling that you may be blameless and harmless children of god without fault in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation among whom you as shine as lights in the world
7177302 i have learned to be content i have learned the secret
7177303 but i rejoiced in the lord greatly that now at last your care for me has flourished again though you surely did care but you lacked opportunity
7177304 not that i speak in regard to need for i have learned in whatever state i am to be content i know how to be abased and i know how to abound everywhere and in all things i have learned both to be full and to be hungry both to abound and to suffer need
7177305 i really dont have any needs that arent being met
7177306 i have learned to be content in whatever circumstances i am
7177307 for our light affliction which is but for a moment is working for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory while we do not look at the things which are seen but at the things which are not seen for the things which are seen are temporary but the things which are not seen are eternal
7177308 i can do all things through christ who strengthens me
7177309 and my god shall supply all your needs according to his riches in glory by christ jesus
7177310 a silver lining in these scandals is that infidelity is still scandalous this shows that all the efforts to discount bill clintons cheating as just sex didnt change the national perception or even democrats that fidelity matters
7177311 infidelity sexual or financial carries national security risks making a politician vulnerable to blackmail or criminal behavior to cover up his actions but it also betrays a lack of character and good judgment that he is willing to sacrifice everything that matters even people who depend on him for something not nearly as important
7177312 there are two trend lines that would indicate these concerns will not be a factor one the anxiety level in the public is so deep and serious right now that some of the trivial sensational issues are not going to have the impact they had in the past
7177313 the second thing is that its a mistake to think the public only sees imperfection and failings of just the other side both parties have their share of peccadilloes for every eliott spitzer and john edwards theres a larry craig or a mark foley
7177314 everybody as a whole has to do a better job of keeping palmer clean thats what it all boils down to it hurts to see him coming off the field bloodied
7177315 theyve been better players than that all the way through
7177316 theres going to be hell to pay this week without question
7177317 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
7177318 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
7177319 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
7177320 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
7177321 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
7177322 i would appreciate it if one person on this boat would not assume im an evil lecherous hump
7177323 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7177324 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7177325 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
7177326 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
7177327 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
7177328 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
7177329 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
7177330 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
7177331 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
7177332 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
7177333 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
7177334 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
7177335 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
7177336 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
7177337 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
7177338 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
7177339 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
7177340 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510

7177343 dont you worry we support boeing no matter what awful thing they allegedly have done or not done
7177344 agreed to a higher price for the aircraft than she believed was appropriate
7177345 that the government alleged that boeing double billed for materials used in modernizing kc 135 stratotankers and rc 135 reconnaissance aircraft materials double billed included nuts bolts rivets and fasteners
7177346 that boeing charged for the materials even though those costs were included in the companys contract with the government
7177347 thank you for sharing your thoughts regarding the air force tanker selection process it was good to hear from you and i welcome the opportunity to respond the united states air force is currently looking to purchase a new line of refueling tankers they have come up with a list of 26 requirements that must be met by companies such as boeing in order to receive a contract in 2004 the house armed services committee voted unanimously to require the air force to enter into a multi year contract for new tankers the current line of tankers includes planes that are 40 years old some of which are corroding and the air force now has an urgent need to replace these planes the department of defense is currently considering all options for this contract to ensure that they get the best planes for the taxpayers dollars i believe that boeing is the company that can provide the air force with the best possible planes for the taxpayers money and i am hopeful that congress will work to continue a strong relationship with boeing boeing has a proven track record of providing high quality refueling tankers for the us air force please know that i will continue to support boeing and jobs in the pacific northwest boeings everett plant provides hundreds of jobs for washington families the impact that this contract could have on the economy of our region and the lives of thousands of washingtonians is very significant please know that i will continue to fight on behalf of washington families by advocating that this contract be awarded to boeing once again thank you for taking the time to get in touch with me your interest and input are valued and i hope to hear from you in the future regarding other matters of importance i encourage you to visit my website and sign up for my weekly e newsletter at th congressional district and our nation

7177353 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
7177354 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
7177355 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
7177356 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
7177357 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
7177358 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort

7177362 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
7177363 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
7177364 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
7177365 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
7177366 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
7177367 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7177368 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
7177369 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
7177370 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
7177371 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7177372 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7177373 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
7177374 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
7177375 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
7177376 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
7177377 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7177378 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7177379 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
7177380 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
7177381 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
7177382 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
7177383 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
7177384 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
7177385 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
7177386 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
7177387 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
7177388 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7177389 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent

7177395 weve met tons of olympians over the years who wanted to do great and be great liddell wanted to be good and do good

7177419 god has made me laugh and all who hear will laugh with me
7177420 im always believe in numbers in the equations and logics that lead to reason but after a lifetime of such pursuits i ask what truly is logic who decides reason my quest has taken me through the physical the metaphysical the delusional and back and i have made the most important discovery in my career the most important discovery in my life its only in the mysterious equations of love that any logical reasons can be found im only here tonight because of you you are the reason i am you are all my reasons
7177421 i think ill personally attend the native asset building session and encourage colleagues to attend the others so we can share notes
7177422 assets learning conference how on earth will i choose part two
7177423 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7177424 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
7177425 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
7177426 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military

7177437 reading is the careful study of the scriptures concentrations of ones powers on it meditation is the busy application of the mind to seek with the help of ones own reason for knowledge of hidden truth prayer is the hearts devoted turning to god to drive away evil and obtain what is good contemplation is when the mind is in some sort lifted to god and held above itself so that it tastes the joys of everlasting sweetness
7177438 reading seeks for sweetness of a blessed life meditation perceives it prayer asks for it contemplation tastes it reading as it were puts food whole into the mouth meditation chews it and breaks it up prayer extracts its flavour contemplation is the sweetness itself which gladdens and refreshes

7177446 i just stayed in the round after a little bit of a rough start
7177447 he hits the ball far but he also has a good pure short game
7177448 he can shoot even par he just has a great swing and hes a good putter with a good short game its a pleasure to watch him play
7177449 im pretty straight i try not to hit the ball all over the golf course and usually dont if im playing well i hit a lot of fairways and greens in regulation i guess
7177450 i think part of his good playing is that hes accustomed to the stress
7177451 i would like to compete in the wpial individual and team finals
7177452 it would be great to see the team do well at cedarboork site of the wpial finals individually to do well at wpial finals and make it to states again this year
7177453 the main goal is for the team winning wpials that would be the best way to go out
7177454 i think if we focus and play well we have a real good chance this year
7177455 thats what i love about the kids on this team theyre so devoted in practice they truly practice
7177456 we have a lot of drills we do and the kids are making themselves better players through what we do i like that
7177457 would i prefer to dress jude law instead of rolf harris

7177462 this is a figure of speech known as the transferred epithet or displaced epithet
7177463 a figure of speech by which a part is put for the whole as fifty sail for fifty ships the whole for a part as society for high society the species for the genus as cutthroat for assassin the genus for the species as a creature for a man or the name of the material for the thing made as boards for stage
7177464 a building the grandest which the world has ever seen realizing the most sanguine expectations and the highest hopes of those who in the name of equal impartial and universal liberty laid the foundation stones
7177465 capitol men the epic story of reconstruction through the lives of the first black congressmen
7177466 shes gone to the peter beattie grab bag of tricks for election stunts and announced this competition
7177467 poor imitation of colour the natural bird being extremely glossy and rich
7177468 never for a moment destroyed the desire of obtaining perfect representations of nature
7177469 i think theres a lot of confusion about what architects do
7177470 does it mean you make pretty spaces does it mean you put some nice gables up there and thats what it is to be an architect well no its supposed to be about the health and safety and welfare of people and how well this building youre in your house or office or school helps you live or work or learn there
7177471 people dont recognize that they have a right to well designed buildings and spaces that this isnt just an artistic service its essential
7177472 if doctors said they were only going to treat the medical needs of the wealthy we would be outraged
7177473 but that is what architecture has done and its not acceptable
7177474 you could have been anything you chose to be an architect why doctors save lives architects
7177475 i dont actually come from a background of feeling responsibility to work for social causes
7177476 im very much like the students and practitioners who came out of design centered schools there needed to be a purity about the design if you muddied it with a social agenda or even with financial issues it would dilute the design quality
7177477 i actually still deeply believe in purity of design i just think the issues we should be tackling need to expand
7177478 it has to include social justice and i dont think that mission needs to limit the design opportunity in any way the idea that all these other people may have an influence on the work well thats architecture
7177479 our work is only going to be truly successful if its actually considered mainstream
7177480 if its considered mainstream then it means that the principles were espousing with the 1 projects become part of any project no matter who its for or what its for
7177481 it wasnt trying to be an award winning architectural project
7177482 we were just trying to fulfill the needs of vulnerable patients families and caregivers now we can look at this approach and how to integrate elements of it in other possible settings like intensive care
7177483 there have been firms that weve been courting for years to come on board who are still saying i dont know about this
7177484 my answer to the cry of i cant afford pro bono is look we are having our lunch eaten by all the other professions
7177485 this is a time where architects and the profession have two simple choices
7177486 they can continue going down this path of star architects and marginalize themselves further and further into oblivion or they can choose to become leaders who can solve the very complicated problems of society today not because these problems are all three dimensional or design oriented but because architecture is a profession that understands how to integrate very disparate competing interests into complicated systems that ultimately serve everybody
7177487 i actually think what were about to see is the emergence of almost two different professions
7177488 the reality is that no amount of pro bono can come close to meeting the needs out there that exist because the needs are so vast a public health version of our field is going to have very different clients and a very different business model youll be designing different things but theyll be things that can potentially be replicated millions of times to benefit millions of people
7177489 the first to deal with teens and the problems they face
7177490 ducking into a dark alley and buying something i wouldnt want my neighbors to know about
7177491 there are very few administrators he hasnt had a hand in bringing in
7177492 they are in a position where they want to implement the best practices to ensure that the good life is around for a long time in cranberry township
7177493 we dont have to be proactive but we have always thought that planning was important
7177494 its ironic that our road department travels right over a road they dont maintain
7177495 because of that proximity we feel we can do a more efficient job maintaining it
7177496 but they do have to travel 5 miles to fill one pothole the borough wanted to maintain the road to its standards and on its schedule
7177497 its an item that will cost the borough money we realize that
7177498 we feel that the taxpayers of franklin park and allegheny county will benefit
7177499 franking park is growing we add about 90 new homes each year
7177500 as additional traffic is placed on our roads it create areas where you need additional traffic control measures and these are some of the things that we are doing for our residents
7177501 coupled with the internet creative individuals can live in a rural area and enjoy the quality of life rural living can offer while still earning a decent living
7177502 the conference will address the economic stimulus the arts and crafts industries can provide small rural communities and the lowered cost of living artists can enjoy living away from big metropolitan areas
7177503 ill also have an electric wheel that people can use to throw their own pots free of charge
7177504 itll be a chance for visitors to see what pottery making is all about
7177505 the biggest thing i noticed when i first got here was that theres people everywhere on main street and cars everywhere
7177506 i perceived butler as being a rural area but it has this great downtown area i really like how its laid out and the people well they seem so friendly
7177507 she brings some new energy and some new ideas to this new position
7177508 as the project unfolds we will see she has the talent to do what needs to be done i think its going to be a great great step for the city
7177509 i really like the idea of instead of tearing down all these buildings that are americas heritage that we can modernize them instead
7177510 we can update them inside but leave the character thats been there for years on the outside
7177511 the city has really been getting things down and i am anxious to see more goals set
7177512 i really like to see these places that have this great value historical value succeed we have downtowns and too many of them are being neglected we can reuse and prevent sprawl i think it is less wasteful
7177513 i remember going to the circus with a friend at age 8 walking down the midway and hearing this great music
7177514 the tent opened up and a group was performing this amazing shuffle i was mesmerized its the only thing i remember about my first outing to the circus
7177515 i love playing always did and never even considered an alternate career
7177516 i met rare silk through jerry granelli when they were just getting started in boulder
7177517 jerry played several gigs with them and recommended me for the drummer job which i eventually got
7177518 im a stay at home dad while she teaches full time
7177519 im excited about moving to an area with such a great jazz heritage and am hoping to become part of the local jazz scene
7177520 i love teaching and dont mind taking on beginners with no experience at all and watching them grow as drummers
7177521 mikes a real smooth and tasty player fits in really well and is an important addition to the local jazz scene
7177522 a little big huh you trying to say im fat
7177523 i was very scared that i was going to jerk back and fall down
7177524 but it was really fun i just stayed focused aimed and shot the gun i was proud of everyone
7177525 working together to get things done sir thats probably been the most fun
7177526 its a great place to be at and learn a lot of stuff
7177527 they leave with a feeling of accomplishment theres a certain pride as they march onto the graduation field in front of their parents
7177528 when my father passed away i wanted to do something in his memory i thought with my philosophy with dealing with youth it would be better to make a contribution to the camp cadet program
7177529 we would love to approve this as long as it meets the code
7177530 tonight is the best most productive conversations weve had in the past year
7177531 anderson identified numerous health and safety violations at the cabana bar which were in violation of the township code the international building code the international fire code and related health and safety codes
7177532 featuring the big picture in our modern times and future times to come
7177533 if i was a member of the public i would be watching these board members
7177534 you may like it now but how will you feel when you are 200 years old
7177535 im tellin ya everywhere i stand shes lookin at me
7177536 the fair policy is to ensure that goods donated at this store remain in this store
7177537 that kept me coming back because it was more fun
7177538 you expect tanger to help all of washington county including tourism
7177539 its been a very nice summer weve had guests who are corporate people involved in the outlet shops
7177540 washington county is the place to be in southwest pennsylvania
7177541 we are certainly becoming a destination point we are hoping people who come to the tanger outlets will stay for two days and visit other retail shops and tourist attractions tanger is the impetus to come but then there is so much more to see in washington county
7177542 tanger will truly benefit the community because it will draw from the entire tristate area
7177543 at washington crown center we have been getting people from west virginia and ohio for years
7177544 we will reap the benefits of tanger but its up to all of us to try to capitalize on tanger
7177545 we want to capitalize on our exiting customers and local customers who are loyal to washington county
7177546 historically has been a focus for development because of interstate s 70 and 79
7177547 south strabane hasnt had a tax increase for many years and i dont think well be needing one anytime soon
7177548 we are very happy to have a lot of development while still retaining a lot of beautiful green space and family farms
7177549 we started bargaining in july of 2006 this is august of 2008 i think that shows a willingness on our part to negotiate a contract without taking some type of job action
7177550 the window of opportunity to do a lot of this is closing
7177551 im going to go in there with the attitude that were going to get this resolved and im hoping the union leadership comes in with the same attitude
7177552 there are just too many veterans that need help and its unacceptable to me
7177553 when i go home i still cant believe it it looks like a place on cape cod its beautiful quiet serene
7177554 im here to help because they did so much for me
7177555 its hard to believe how much happens in one day here
7177556 it took a little government intervention to make that happen
7177557 i think it was the right move at the right time
7177558 its a destination spot where people will want to come to
7177559 we dont want to have traffic backing up on the interstate
7177560 the faith based groups help through the longest period of time and thats true for every disaster
7177561 it was an amazing transformative experience we can talk about changing the world but to give somebody the means to do it is something you cant teach in a classroom
7177562 it makes a difference in the life of a kid whos gone through trauma to just come and be their friend not questioning them on their katrina experience but rather letting them run over to you at lunch rip out your hair tie and start braiding your hair
7177563 it makes a difference to the people here in new wilmington to actually see the work we did in new orleans
7177564 he told me that for the first time in over a year he got up and didnt care how he felt because he had something more important to do
7177565 it has been almost three years since he has had a meal in his own home
7177566 prayerfully the table will remain in our family for years to come and we can pass the history of the table to our future generations
7177567 for the first time in 51 years i feel like im making a difference
7177568 he was beaming as he sat back and watched all of us eat
7177569 i had worked in his home the year before and he looked beaten the difference in his demeanor was like night and day
7177570 that was the greatest witness for our students to see that and reflect on how they want to behave in their own lives when they are confronted by challenging circumstances
7177571 the first thing he said when he came over to talk to us was thank you for coming down here
7177572 its the latest sign that telecom companies are finally conceding that their homegrown search services have stalled and that they need help from the internets big guns
7177573 the reason is because the mobile computer is more targeted think about it you carry your phone everywhere it knows all about you we can do a very very targeted ad over time we will make more money for mobile advertising
7177574 we are replacing our static per keyword quality scores with a system that will evaluate an ads quality each time it matches a search query this way adwords will use the most accurate specific and up to date performance information when determining whether an ad should be displayed
7177575 save their web favorites online share them with others see what other technical pros are favoriting and connecting with others
7177576 the only way the bookmarks here would be useful for me would be to consolidate the bookmarks in one place either all in delicious or all in msdn forums
7177577 now the real question for anyone using sharepoint in their enterprise which means a lot of people is when can we have this functionality integrated to our sharepoint server
7177578 obviously we couldnt care less about yet another delicious product unless it offers something we can use in the enterprise any idea
7177579 myspace has generated most of the law in this area
7177580 do these lawsuits work in the sense of recovering monetary awards only occasionally
7177581 i think more important to these companies is the chilling effect it has on spam
7177582 its essentially letting the world know youre tough about this and creating some deterrents
7177583 i would say that my hope is that publicity from some of the recent large judgments would discourage people from this type of behavior
7177584 the reality is that people who do this at a large scale are making a lot of money and you can potentially collect
7177585 these are very sophisticated business people we represent em so we know
7177586 theyve made a conscious decision that they are better off not fighting it than fighting it its a very common strategy
7177587 the one advantage a social network has is the contractual relationship it has with its users
7177588 you agree to pay myspace com 50 for each such unsolicited email
7177589 we can easily forgive a child who is afraid of the dark the real tragedy of life is when men are afraid of the light
7177590 conquest is not in our principles it is inconsistent with our government
7177591 we are pakistanis and pakistan is us because we are tied with the country through islam
7177592 we are pakistanis and pakistan is us because we are tied with the country through islam
7177593 we ask india to start a dialogue over kashmir open the srinagar muzaffarabad road for trade and release all kashmiris in indian jails
7177594 i said the delhi based electronic channels and the owners of the print media were acting as part of indias war machine in kashmir by blacking out the recent developments in j amp k
7177595 kashmiris chant azadi amp jeevay jeevay pakistan in equal numbers and with equal intensity
7177596 there was a green flag on every lamp post every roof every bus stop and on the top of chinar trees a big one fluttered outside the all india radio building road signs were painted over rawalpindi they said or simply pakistan
7177597 we are pakistanis and pakistan is us because we are tied with the country through islam
7177598 do you have faith in my leadership i will be faithful to you till my death and will carry everyone along
7177599 we ask india to start a dialogue over kashmir open the srinagar muzaffarabad road for trade and release all kashmiris in indian jails
7177600 no solution to the kashmir issue other than merger with pakistan
7177601 this is really important because the commonwealth is saying look we are losing these young people who dont seem to be connecting into other things there is a way not to lose them
7177602 if you lose your work slot your youth worker chases you around relentlessly whether its for three months or three years until youre ready to do this
7177603 the integral part to what roca does is this idea that people need to have real work for real pay they fail a few times and someones on them
7177604 it was attractive enough for us to want to take the plunge
7177605 weve had several meetings over the past couple of months with boston police officers to coordinate the event
7177606 any event that draws large crowds be it this event first night sports brings with it certain challenges
7177607 the nice thing is this department has had the experience of dealing with large crowds in a successful way
7177608 this is our culture and we got to keep it alive we come and enjoy ourselves and let the kids follow so they can pick up where we leave
7177609 you have to love doing this and love carnival its a lot of hard work and hard working people that makes carnival what it is
7177610 with the current president its i i i she dont say we
7177611 things can improve maybe when we get a new regime
7177612 the carnival is a labor of love and when you love your culture thats what youre promoting
7177613 costume makers and bands are the ones that make the carnival
7177614 the people really responsible for the carnival dont get the respect they deserve at all and the the billboard is an example of that
7177615 i dont give a damn what they think about it being self promoting
7177616 guess what i am the one that is out there working and getting money to put this carnival on
7177617 were due for improvements but the bigger carnival gets the more complicated organizing it becomes but shillingford gets the money to make things happen shes responsible solely for this carnival
7177618 if it cant be hillary clinton then senator biden is the best choice
7177619 he brings the experience and knowledge of foreign affairs that will balance the ticket
7177620 senator biden will be a great vice president but there wont be the exuberance and the joy
7177621 obama can steal favor with her supporters by keeping her visible retiring her debt and giving her some spotlight
7177622 supporters who have wavered as the critical moment approaches will shift
7177623 its really hillary that needs to be the one getting her supporters clinton needs to rally her troops
7177624 youve got a convention hall filled with thousands of delegates all of them enthralled by ted kennedys video presence
7177625 given that the filmed tributes done for both jack and bobby at the conventions in 64 and 68 have now become classics i think its fair to say that this video will also be impeccably produced and very powerful the kennedys dont do it any other way
7177626 so imagine what would happen at the instant that video fades to black the lights in the hall come up and who is standing there center stage but ted himself the living heart and soul of this party even if he didnt say a word the place would go absolutely nuts
7177627 if theres any way to get teddy to denver i have to believe they will
7177628 if youre asking me do i think it will happen
7177629 id have to say no do i hold out a hope and prayer absolutely
7177630 i mean look at what happened when teddy arrived at the capitol after his surgery to cast a vote that broke a potential tie on the medicare issue the whole chamber people on both sides of the aisle stood and cheered think of that moment and magnify it by 10
7177631 do i think its a net loss not having teddy there
7177632 no but it would be a huge huge gain if he did make a surprise appearance
7177633 when the living icon of the democratic party in effect passed the torch to him with the kind enthusiasm and energy that both ted and his niece caroline did that day barack obama was validated it was more than an endorsement it was a tremendous affirmation what ted kennedy did was say that obama represented the future
7177634 the man has been through so much these past couple of months that its just not reasonable to expect him to make an appearance
7177635 we are going to have to take a further look at this latest fire and see what other things we can do to prevent them from happening
7177636 the fires are a result of the products of the process
7177637 the fires in the past have been in some of the piles that are waiting to be processed and some that are waiting to be shipped
7177638 this victim apparently looked at a photo array and identified the individual and recounted that she was picked up by him and forced to perform oral sex
7177639 the individual said he was a state police officer and head of a narcotics unit
7177640 robert trent hones golf trail is some of the best public golf on earth

7177645 weve got a couple of shoulders that look like they will impact on next week in berrick barnes and daniel vickerman theyre unlikely to be available
7177646 it wasnt an easy situation to go into but he certainly relished the opportunity hes been waiting for it hell be much better for it
7177647 the key now is can we back up and therell be many who would suggest we cant
7177648 the history would suggest that also but well get a great opportunity to do that this week and thats what well concentrate on
7177649 we know that we have to better next week but we want to be better and we want to back up because its something that we havent done
7177650 i think its a reflection on how much they guys gave to secure that victory and then also that our feet hopefully are planted on the ground
7177651 we know that this is a two match tour and were very happy with what we achieved today and rightly so but another challenge awaits us in seven days
7177652 its been commented on before the fact that with so many guys that havent got that baggage with us i think that helps
7177653 its easy sometimes when youre sitting behind the glass a long way away with a pen not to have any real sense of the games physicality deans said
7177654 i think sometimes looking through the tv screen and looking from a distance we dont have a sense of that the boys got up and met that reality
7177655 its a major tournament for us so were going to be there and try and move on and do well
7177656 therefore yourself needed a 50 volume comb how and also could herself subsist unsurprised up protect himself in front of the streets upon unutilized shield
7177657 therefore yourself needed a 50 volume comb how and also could herself subsist unsurprised up protect himself in front of the streets upon unutilized shield
7177658 johnny is an out and out goalscorer as well we could change our shape a bit
7177659 i think we need to be versatile you look at different teams and you play them different ways
7177660 and when johnny comes back and poppa captain and centre back tony popovic comes back and forward brendan santalab well have a bit more speed because santa is lighting quick
7177661 it just gives us different options and we need to play different ways against different opposition
7177662 it was fantastic the one touch football we played and little angles and triangles we created in the first half in particular it was great to watch it was fun on the sideline to be honest
7177663 giving them two easy goals but then coming back was great
7177664 and then to lose it with a free kick like that was hard to take because i thought we were dominating the game at that time
7177665 i feel very honoured to have been part of that era where pretty much every trophy there was to win we got our hands on whereas at the moment were a group that is starting hopefully on a journey that is very productive
7177666 but its only sort of the beginning for this group and i think maybe if you ask that question in a year or twos time well hopefully give you a positive answer
7177667 other than late in the game when we let them back in we had a fair bit of control throughout the whole game so it was slightly different to 2000
7177668 i think 2000 was more of an arm wrestle the whole match
7177669 i probably lost my composure a tiny bit but that was just because i was pretty dirty on myself with what i did a few minutes before to let them score
7177670 so it was a square up so far as i was concerned
7177671 weve come over here so many times and got so close
7177672 its been a constant place where we faced disappointment on disappointment so to finally get the monkey off our back is just great
7177673 we are competing for the tri nations and it is a seriously tough competition
7177674 youve only got to look at the games so far to see that and our mindset is hopefully to get up for the challenge next week
7177675 south africans are a proud nation they want to be winners they want to back a winning side
7177676 one big message that we want to get out there is that we will never go out and lose a game on purpose
7177677 rome wasnt built in one day so i think we should be patient as the players should be more patient on the team
7177678 i would ask that the public still give us some time
7177679 the laws have changed you look at how we were caught fast asleep in the first half of the super 14 by not changing quick enough to the laws
7177680 i believe that we are on the right track and the players do believe it
7177681 its just that they have to get used to it and we will get used to it
7177682 yes we believe in it and i think we worked hard this whole week on exactly what we want to do on the field
7177683 its just about execution the chances are there but were making too many mistakes for international players thats unacceptable
7177684 were the springboks were the world champs and we lost two games in a row
7177685 i think if you go to the change room and you look at the players theyd be feeling worse than the crowd out there
7177686 its our jobs its our work its our passion its our lives and its unacceptable for us to play like that
7177687 therefore yourself needed a 50 volume comb how and also could herself subsist unsurprised up protect himself in front of the streets upon unutilized shield
7177688 therefore yourself needed a 50 volume comb how and also could herself subsist unsurprised up protect himself in front of the streets upon unutilized shield
7177689 therefore yourself needed a 50 volume comb how and also could herself subsist unsurprised up protect himself in front of the streets upon unutilized shield
7177690 therefore yourself needed a 50 volume comb how and also could herself subsist unsurprised up protect himself in front of the streets upon unutilized shield
7177691 therefore yourself needed a 50 volume comb how and also could herself subsist unsurprised up protect himself in front of the streets upon unutilized shield
7177692 its not my truck if you find something its not mine if there is anything in that black bag its not mine
7177693 i contend for a legal approach and not a legalistic approach
7177694 its a sad day for us because were not supposed to be here fighting with our own government
7177695 all my life ive been poor and homeless fighting for the right to be heard and consulted we should be in cape town celebrating the birthday of the united democratic front now not even this constitutional court gives me the comfort that the poor peoples struggle for dignity is over the road of the poor and homeless is long our story is a test for democracy and our constitution and were still struggling
7177696 i dont know why we are here in 2008 fighting about evictions and our right to be heard and holding those in power to promises they make so lightly to the poor
7177697 no one is going to tell me that i cant have sex with my wife
7177698 who are these women to tell me how many wives i should have
7177699 subject civil objects and civilians on the territory of georgia to deliberate attacks
7177700 here i am im gonna change the world for good less work more rest
7177701 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
7177702 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
7177703 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
7177704 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
7177705 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
7177706 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
7177707 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
7177708 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
7177709 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
7177710 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
7177711 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
7177712 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
7177713 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
7177714 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
7177715 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
7177716 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
7177717 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
7177718 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
7177719 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
7177720 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
7177721 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
7177722 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
7177723 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
7177724 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
7177725 its a major tournament for us so were going to be there and try and move on and do well
7177726 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
7177727 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
7177728 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
7177729 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
7177730 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
7177731 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
7177732 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
7177733 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
7177734 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
7177735 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
7177736 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
7177737 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
7177738 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
7177739 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
7177740 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
7177741 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
7177742 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
7177743 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
7177744 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
7177745 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
7177746 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
7177747 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
7177748 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
7177749 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
7177750 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
7177751 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
7177752 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
7177753 sounds like you are giving us a sneak peak of steamy tales from the boudoir m
7177754 sounds like you are giving us a sneak peak of steamy tales from the boudoir m
7177755 sounds like you are giving us a sneak peak of steamy tales from the boudoir m
7177756 sounds like you are giving us a sneak peak of steamy tales from the boudoir m
7177757 yeah yeah i like these hot latin studs exposed too now where was that page again where our hero went down on the sleeping fellow in that prison that was hawt
7177758 sounds like you are giving us a sneak peak of steamy tales from the boudoir m
7177759 sounds like you are giving us a sneak peak of steamy tales from the boudoir m
7177760 i need to and so do a lot of others get out to the country where the voters are where the people are and make sure they understand where john mccain comes from what his policies are and why hes so much better than barak obama for them
7177761 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
7177762 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
7177763 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
7177764 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
7177765 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
7177766 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
7177767 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
7177768 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
7177769 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
7177770 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
7177771 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
7177772 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
7177773 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
7177774 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
7177775 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
7177776 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
7177777 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
7177778 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
7177779 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
7177780 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
7177781 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
7177782 this is a planning took where all things are going
7177783 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
7177784 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
7177785 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
7177786 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
7177787 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
7177788 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
7177789 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
7177790 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
7177791 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
7177792 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
7177793 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
7177794 i think a big reason evolutionists believe what they believe is they dont want to have to be ruled by god
7177795 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
7177796 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
7177797 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
7177798 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
7177799 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
7177800 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
7177801 sounds like you are giving us a sneak peak of steamy tales from the boudoir m
7177802 moment when holding a print copy of one of my books and if that book happens to be on a shelf at b amp n or borders you have this satisfaction of
7177803 sounds like you are giving us a sneak peak of steamy tales from the boudoir m
7177804 i was a tomboy who read stories of adventures and mysteries
7177805 sounds like you are giving us a sneak peak of steamy tales from the boudoir m
7177806 blahblah press is in current violation of our contract as i have not been paid for the recent quarter and an email sent to the publisher resulted in an accusatory response that threatened blacklisting
7177807 lulz yall lookit whut this stupid author publisher sented me
7177808 blahblah presss owner is ripping me off and is totally mentally imbalanced she will pay for what shes done to me
7177809 gp ahead and send this one all over the place too you bitches
7177810 well they should pull those books and submit them elsewhere
7177811 there are secret yahoo groups for small press indy press owners wherein extensive conversations are had regarding specific authors
7177812 you are so mean to bitch about us like that im going to bitch about you with my super duper secret friends you mean tattle tale just you see
7177813 oh yeah they sucked they mistreated me this way and that way and
7177814 you are so mean to bitch about us like that im going to bitch about you with my super duper secret friends you mean tattle tale just you see
7177815 im sorry if you feel that i am singling you out im not its just that your comment set off something that i have always felt but considered not so nice to say to the sad authors who always show up on blogs to complain after the house has collapsed and nothing can be done anymore
7177816 author is prohibited from discussing any business pertaining to the publishing house in any public venue
7177817 included any information pertaining to the termination of said authors contract
7177818 a full stomach makes a full mind an empty stomach you know your mind is not ready to study and its one thing we want to keep these kids full we dont want them hungry i know what its like to be a hungry child
7177819 this is one of our important events that we do here to support our operational budget at the community theatre what that in turn means is having money to support the live quality entertainment that we provide to siouxland
7177820 i feel very honoured to have been part of that era where pretty much every trophy there was to win we got our hands on whereas at the moment were a group that is starting hopefully on a journey that is very productive
7177821 but its only sort of the beginning for this group and i think maybe if you ask that question in a year or twos time well hopefully give you a positive answer
7177822 other than late in the game when we let them back in we had a fair bit of control throughout the whole game so it was slightly different to 2000

7177829 youve only got to look at the games so far to see that and our mindset is hopefully to get up for the challenge next week
7177830 and then at the end he humbles himself and goes
7177831 the spirit of the lord had departed from saul and an evil spirit from the lord troubled him
7177832 faith comes by hearing and hearing by the word of god
7177833 when the evil spirit from god is upon doyle he shall be well
7177834 so it was that whenever the evil spirit from god was upon saul david would take a harp and play it with his hand then saul would become fresh and well and the evil spirit would depart from him
7177835 south africans are a proud nation they want to be winners they want to back a winning side
7177836 one big message that we want to get out there is that we will never go out and lose a game on purpose
7177837 rome wasnt built in one day so i think we should be patient as the players should be more patient on the team
7177838 i would ask that the public still give us some time
7177839 the laws have changed you look at how we were caught fast asleep in the first half of the super 14 by not changing quick enough to the laws
7177840 i believe that we are on the right track and the players do believe it
7177841 its just that they have to get used to it and we will get used to it

7177844 were the springboks were the world champs and we lost two games in a row
7177845 i think if you go to the change room and you look at the players theyd be feeling worse than the crowd out there
7177846 its our jobs its our work its our passion its our lives and its unacceptable for us to play like that

7177867 when the fleet entered the pacific we remarked that the centre of gravity of sea power had changed
7177868 what the future of the pacific is to be only the future can disclose but it is likely enough that s ability to repel a regional aggressor but just as the great white fleet symbolised the rise of american naval power the strategic balance in the pacific a century later is being tested by a new player as a maritime power is increasingly concentrating the minds of defence planners in western intelligence agencies have been trying to glean information about the construction of sanya for years because the new base says much about sanya is reportedly being fitted out with underground berths for up to 20 advanced submarines and has facilities to house several aircraft carriers that chinas nuclear and naval build up at sanya underlines s desire to assert tight control over this region

7177870 i dont think there is any serious view in the australian defence establishment that australia somehow needs to be prepared to face china single handedly
7177871 the question is would we be called upon to assist in some sort of contingency and what would we contribute

7177893 i was national president and we were both in washington at the same time naturally the womens associations were excited
7177894 you would see this woman on the floor of congress and you would ask yourself is she a congresswoman
7177895 we had a woman in congress we also lost a superdelegate for the democratic national convention she was just the kind of woman you could relate to she would never tell you no
7177896 always smiling she was just so full of life and energy she was a dynamic woman

7177899 its got that connection to my dad i think of wherever he went that he tried to make it a better place
7177900 when he was at sears in steubenville the layoffs were becoming prevalent but he went to work every day to make the store better he was a good boss to work for fair but demanding and he brought energy to his job and to the community and showed how that can make a difference
7177901 im sure that as steubenville goes through its challenges it needs more people like my dad who can fight and scratch and claw and work to make a good community for our children and our childrens children thats the whole idea thats kind of the message ill bring back
7177902 he wasnt from there but he tries to make his corner of the world better through organizations and by treating people well and with kindness and with respect
7177903 im very proud john buccigross will be coming to jefferson county to be the featured speaker at our annual chamber of commerce dinner

7177905 ever since espn was on the air back when i was 13 years old and in the eighth grade at aquinas elementary i knew that was what i wanted to do it was always in the back of my mind
7177906 i saw the article and thought so at least i have a name im sure that kids nowadays send resumes to google or microsoft and they never see it here it was this guys job i put his name on it and sent my tape i was shocked when he actually called
7177907 we moved to steubenville when i was 11 and after my freshman year in college my father and family moved to warren so i never got that post high school graduation thing of hanging around with my friends during our summers during our college years
7177908 there are guys i stay in touch with but we didnt get to go out and hang around in bars at age 19 you could do that back then we were grandfathered in so i was kind of cut off from my central years and thats kind of unfortunate
7177909 im proud to be from there and i love the people a couple of years ago when the central football team lost in the state championship i announced the final score and said keep your heads up crusaders i got a great e mail from a player who told me they were sitting around kind of depressed over losing the game and it cheered them up it was really touching

7177924 the real life superhero you dreamed of being as a kid
7177925 i always thought he was invincible a small town superman the big brother who would rip off his shirt displaying a yellow s on his chest and shoot off into the sky
7177926 well i apparently saw him as the wrong superhero he was captain america super soldier patriot and the only superhero who could die
7177927 there will be too many 5 year olds who wont know what they missed
7177928 he will always be loved and missed and will always be the guy who couldnt die even after he did in the physical world we live in well done dan rest in peace
7177929 looking back on his life i can see the impact that he had on people
7177930 if you want to see the biggest impact just look around god used all he did to bring us together through all his crazy adventures he was spinning a web now we can look around and see the fruits of his life i look around and i dont see people who knew dan i see family

7177936 everybody gets their 15 minutes of fame and ive really had my share
7177937 every couple of years this thing pops up again and im answering questions about it
7177938 she knew early on that i had virtually not much in common with the rockefeller family
7177939 referred to me as having been descended from john d rockefeller and such whenever it was to her advantage
7177940 she usually did so in an understated way calling special attention to it by keeping it extra quiet
7177941 sort of psst shes married to a rockefeller its like saying you went to harvard it opens doors
7177942 from what ive heard lately it might not be but as far as i know its my name
7177943 perhaps at some point we can do a dna test to really find out

7177960 disappointed that china has not used the occasion of the olympics to demonstrate greater tolerance and openness
7177961 you are always concerned any time a player like that goes down
7177962 thats not good we know the type of player he is and if he can come back he will but we have the personnel to step up in his absence
7177963 unfortunately they were called back i think all we have to do is watch the film to see we have a lot of potential
7177964 in this case it would be easily justifiable to say for me to play a series if not there are a lot of things we can learn from the film
7177965 we need to make a few more plays we just need to work on our third down conversions and find a way to put more points on the board
7177966 any time you have 12 penalties and 10 of them are on offensive plays thats an issue
7177967 its amazing this is what i get paid to do this is what i live for
7177968 this is all i really want to go out there every fifth day and do my job
7177969 last year battling through this surgery and having this team behind me with their support its meant everything
7177970 ninety pitches in five innings isnt going to cut it every time out i realize that but its a big win for the team right now
7177971 hes in our rotation and thats the bottom line i think it means a lot to him especially what hes been through to be able to come out and contribute at such an important time of year
7177972 obviously he wasnt lighting up the radar gun but you dont have to do that in this game if you hit your spots
7177973 i think he wanted to get out there and prove himself to new york
7177974 thats the most important thing if youre out to prove something to everyone else i think it takes away a special part of being in the major leagues
7177975 obviously theres been a lot going on the last four years i cant ignore that but im still the same person i was four years ago when i go out there on the mound
7177976 the hitter walked toward the dugout to throw his bat and helmet away he in doing so has abandoned his effort to reach the next base
7177977 its one of those deals where i couldnt get by him i couldnt get by him and i just had to ask myself would he do that to me
7177978 and he has before so thats the way it goes
7177979 whatever carls going to say hes sorry that he didnt want to race that way but he always does well take it well go on and well race him that way in the chase if thats the way he wants to race
7177980 the initial x rays were negative about any serious damage
7177981 were going to get an mri and well have a stronger evaluation for you sunday
7177982 all we pretty much had to do is run we didnt have to make many cuts
7177983 if youre going to take a whipping like this get it out of way now and come back and respond
7177984 i had a little bit more confidence tonight and especially when one of your first runs is a big run it builds confidence
7177985 but i think what you saw was the explosiveness of both backs
7177986 theyre kind of surprised that ive been playing with it up to this point
7177987 thats what i want to do thats why this decision is even out there still and not already made because i want to play period the question is what should i do how long should i play with it
7177988 its a thousand different options at this point and im just trying to make the best one
7177989 im just trying to make the best decision possible for the team and for my career
7177990 right now in talking to him his mind set is hes doing everything he can to get ready for carolina our opener
7177991 he just wants to get a little bit more information on his knee
7177992 its great we love to celebrate we were 1 15 last year and we really got away from all that enjoyment of winning and things like that so just to go out and get two preseason games under our belt we just need to continue and push this into the regular season
7177993 with a guy like ted hes got something that you cant coach and thats speed
7177994 its so important to have speed its so hard to score with 12 and 15 play drives on a consistent basis you have to have that quick fire power to be able to score on a big play and ted has that
7177995 i think to put two games together back to back like this we didnt have the best week of practice we fought through and we didnt give up
7177996 to come out here and play ball like this i think were starting to believe in what were doing
7177997 i think these guys are embarrassed about the way they played
7177998 anytime you get shut out if youre an offense youd better be embarrassed
7177999 mr obamas choice of mr biden suggested some of the weaknesses the obama campaign is trying to address
7178000 i never figured on the absolute incompetence of the administration if i knew cheney and rumsfeld so wholly possessed the presidents attention i never would have voted for that
7178001 its a continuation of what weve been doing since the pro immigrant marches of 2006
7178002 the idea is to create a transition from the streets to the ballot box
7178003 a lot of people supported hillary clinton including myself but once obama got the nod our goal became to generate support for the candidate that best represents the interests of our community
7178004 but now i support obama because of his policies particularly in the case of immigration and humane treatment of immigrants
7178005 this is the first time a republican presidential campaign has been able to do that and create that
7178006 it is the driving engine of our growth and success as a community

7178024 the defense has been better every week for them to man up and keep the shut out was awesome
7178025 we were out there for eight plays out there and they only got one yard
7178026 the players all came together and they all came together on the line it was a really nice stop
7178027 our defense has stepped it up the last couple of weeks we brought in some new coaches and theyre coming together as a team thats a major part they play as a team theyre getting a lot more confidence on defense
7178028 hopefully the rest will do us some good and just keep together as a team
7178029 because we had already accepted two b standard swimmers on the basis they should gain experience for london 2012 we took legal advice and we then accepted the nominations athletics ireland are a major federation people have said that pauline curley was 39 years of age but the romanian runner who won the womens marathon was also 39 years of age
7178030 they nominated her we accepted it and we dont regret it there is also the issue of ageism we no longer look at selecting people on the basis of age we could end up in the courts talking about ageism
7178031 no truth whatsoever there are only four officials on the team if they nominated another 20 people there would be no more officials that was a comment made by talking on rte and he was talking through his hat we started with 51 athletes we ended up with 54 athletes there were no other officials added to it
7178032 we have been tainted with a history of problems at the olympic games and we have a bad reputation internationally its bad enough doping humans but when we start to dope the animals it gets even worse though for once and for all we sincerely hope that there will be no hint of any drug taking at the beijing games
7178033 all i know is i have been feeling very bad and have had really bad problems breathing i just assumed it wouldnt affect me but ive been on three inhalers twice a day it started before i got here so its nothing to do with being in beijing
7178034 i dont know if i got too excited beforehand and burned off the energy before i even got there or what but i felt so sluggish i was just not in the game
7178035 ive been using it for years on horses its been effective if i thought it was a threat to me theres no way i would have used it
7178036 it is a forbidden product in terms of preventing pain relief
7178037 it can make horses jump better and enhances the performance of the horse
7178038 very serious repercussions for the entire equine industry in our country
7178039 unless these people get their act together they have a very serious problem
7178040 im appalled that this is happening in this sport but there seems to be something wrong in the equestrian movement and they just have to get their act together this sport could be in very serious difficulties for next years vote whether they remain on the programme or not
7178041 i am deeply ashamed of what happened in my ioc hotel i have even been subjected to snide remarks from my colleagues saying that ireland is at it again
7178042 on the auspicious occasion of janmashtami i extend my greetings and best wishes to everyone
7178043 the life and teachings of lord krishna have a universal message as they signify the triumph of virtue over vice and righteousness over evil and constitute a rejection of intolerance and narrow mindedness
7178044 the festival inspires us towards right conduct and to overcome all obstacles towards achievement of our goals
7178045 we have been finding quite large shards of roman pottery and some iron age pottery which is very soft and crumbly and therefore tends to be found in smaller fragments
7178046 because of their unique gut microbes kangaroos emit much less methane than sheep and cattle
7178047 if we let the kangaroo population rise to 175 million by 2020 farmers could be earning the same amount of money as they would be from cattle without that charge
7178048 the sheer amount of diversity the students discovered surprised everybody
7178049 we have only just begun to tap the potential of these microorganisms our undergraduates have given us a peek at the treasure these habitats hold and we need to move quickly to preserve them
7178050 clearly the inner tissues of plants are a biological niche for microbial life that warrants further exploration
7178051 we didnt expect anything like what you have witnessed to occur
7178052 this is an insult to the olympic vision an insult to the spirit of taekwondo and in my opinion an insult to mankind

7178054 i would have been devastated if they hadnt changed the decision
7178055 i dont think in press conferences we should discuss referees and things
7178056 but i think i deserved a couple of things that didnt come to me
7178057 we got a call of a guy flagging down traffic at hewes avenue and u s 90 telling them he was on a boat that capsized
7178058 he said there were two others on board and that they both had life preservers on

7178060 a flash flood watch is in effect through monday evening for much of southeastern louisiana
7178061 heavy rain is still going to be a threat on the north shore including st tammany washington and tangipahoa parishes
7178062 it looks like rain but nothing like weve seen in florida
7178063 we have activated our teams as a precautionary measure for the safety of the public
7178064 we are prepared to close the gates and run the pumps should the need arise
7178065 this is unprecedented in terms of the slow nature of this storm the large circulation and the fact that its impacted probably about 90 percent of the state with heavy rains and severe weather
7178066 i guess we are betting on paulson we have to believe that his plan carries the day somehow
7178067 what we know is that isolation kills which means it drives up stress and community or being with other people in disclosure and telling the truth is a healing balm
7178068 it is physiologically impossible to be stressed and be grateful at the same time so when you see that bill and think that you just cant take one more thing take a deep breath and be thankful
7178069 this is unprecedented in terms of the slow nature of this storm the large circulation and the fact that its impacted probably about 90 percent of the state with heavy rains and severe weather
7178070 i doubt well see any flooding out here the wind is starting to sting a little but thats about it
7178071 the flooding is definitely something that we are monitoring and tracking and he was down there to see what kind of handle he could get on that
7178072 people automatically assume that if it weakens the hazards go down with it but in the case of rainfall its not a function of wind speed
7178073 this is unprecedented in terms of the slow nature of this storm the large circulation and the fact that its impacted probably about 90 percent of the state with heavy rains and severe weather
7178074 i wouldnt doubt that there are a lot of backstroms around
7178075 i think it will be a great resource for people who want to do art history in connecticut
7178076 in the second year well try to make a systematic effort to find the art
7178077 always made enough money to live on i never had to worry
7178078 im hoping the public will be able to add more information
7178079 we are progressing week in and week out last week against carolina was kind of mixed emotions because of the conditions and the weather we had several key mistakes so we were able to learn from that we were able to put some things together consistently we sustained some drives and came out with points which was big for us
7178080 you have to give guys opportunities to make plays and we did that today
7178081 its obviously big when you lose somebody like kevin curtis who had 77 catches last year and then you dont have your other top receiver in reggie brown the preseason gives guys an opportunity to come out and showcase their talents and do great things for us we have a ways to go but its a good sign
7178082 my confidence comes from how the team feels and i think the team is really on a high right now
7178083 it was just like old times for the most part
7178084 of course there are some things we need to iron out as a group and we are going to get them ironed out
7178085 the election is going to consume our attention from now until october
7178086 if your story doesnt somehow some way connect to the election dont even bother
7178087 the danger of course is its clever and you forget the product
7178088 if i were an advertiser thats what i would do
7178089 i looked at the medal around my neck and its such an accomplishment for this team and the usa and these girls
7178090 it just brought tears to my eyes and im more than thrilled
7178091 she tom is our best player shes not going to tip shes going to go up and swing thats what she did she got us here and im happy she swung
7178092 my daughter is moving on and im going to miss her horribly but i told her i wouldnt cry in front of her
7178093 we have a ton of people on campus that help put this together ranging from our hall staff to our university housing dining services to university student activities office our greek life office helps our rotc program helps the physical plan thats of course invaluable to this whole process
7178094 the move in process is going very well its going fast the traffic is flowing you drop off and you wait and then you get a cart and move in
7178095 we appreciate everybodys patience and coordination of this process its a huge effort to move 5 000 people in
7178096 my cheeks hurt from smiling my face hurts from the chlorine my legs are sore from jumping up and down
7178097 im in pain and im tired but im so happy
7178098 i thought maybe i could have gotten the bronze or silver medal
7178099 the chinese didnt build the wall in four years were just starting our dynasty
7178100 were going to be there in 2012 weve already improved so much in the past four years
7178101 its been hard fought to get all of these medals to come out and play against australia is kind of like how the story had to go
7178102 oh the money usually does a pretty good job of that
7178103 to me it was obvious he was unable to continue
7178104 we are doing something extremely well and yet part of our discussion is on what we can do together perhaps a little bit more to have womens opinions of responding to the newspaper
7178105 this is outstanding we didnt even think about getting a gold medal we were thinking third place that was our goal
7178106 i have absolutely no doubt about what is in his heart and the commitment that he has made to racial equality in this country
7178107 so i will provide some testimony as they say in church
7178108 joe biden is that rare mix for decades he has brought change to washington but washington hasnt changed him
7178109 hes an expert on foreign policy whose heart and values are rooted firmly in the middle class
7178110 he has stared down dictators and spoken out for americas cops and firefighters
7178111 we dont have to have four more years of george bush and john mccain
7178112 joe and i have been friends for many many years and we know each other very well and so i think hes made a very wise selection i know that joe will campaign well for sen obama and so i think hes going to be very formidable obviously joe and i have been on different philosophical sides but we have been i consider him a good friend and good man
7178113 barack obama sounded as though he turned over the top spot on the ticket today to his new mentor the reality is that nothing has changed since joe biden first made his assessment that barack obama is not ready to lead
7178114 sen obama has continued in the best traditions for the vice presidency by selecting an exceptionally strong experienced leader and devoted public servant
7178115 but barack i want you to know theres 44 older than me
7178116 its a good choice for southwestern pennsylvania but sen obama still has some work to do
7178117 hes experienced hes one of the most intelligent men i ever heard speak he can talk to normal people
7178118 i dont care whether he came from pennsylvania what matters is who he is she said while she and 100 other scranton area democrats gathered around televisions at cosgroves to hear mr bidens first speech as the presumptive vice presidential nominee
7178119 i had a lot of flashbacks today to when joe biden was little and we lived across a dirt alley from each other
7178120 it brings happiness to me when i see theres someone who says hes going to change everything i know so many people have it so bad and here is hope
7178121 i wanted to biden to be president and i was disappointed when he withdrew but here he is running for vice president we can all be happy now
7178122 that matters a lot hes a scranton native and people here just love that i think the people feel closer to obama now because he has someone from scranton and i hope the state feels the same way
7178123 its going to help a tremendous amount in scranton and lackawanna county its going to bring a lot of folks on board who were strong hillary clinton supporters in the primary and have been reluctant obama supporters
7178124 it firms up votes for him in this part of the state but statewide and nationwide its still going to be a race between the no 1s im not trying to minimize it i like joe biden but i dont think he wins the state for obama unless it hinges on people in lackawanna county who would otherwise be undecided
7178125 scranton is typical of a lot of working class cities
7178126 people here value their faith they value their work and they value their families scranton is a microcosm of the rest of the country
7178127 this is a fine choice it was my preference for a long time
7178128 joe biden understands the economic hardships because of his own life story he is someone who has never forgotten where hes come from not only in a geographic sense but he understands his roots
7178129 he has a clear connection with scranton that will not be broken
7178130 in terms of ability to speak to the lunch pail blue collar american obviously hes got some credentials
7178131 ter os jogos e n o ter uma caixinha n o poder folhear o manual nah
7178132 his project was the reason behind the unity of many political blocs that once differed in viewpoints
7178133 such a person if he would assume the vice presidency post would not serve to improve iraq usa relations

7178148 i had to ask myself would kyle busch bump me
7178149 kyle already hit me this year in a nationwide race
7178150 the first thing that made me laugh out loud was that he was putting on a stage version of erin brockovich in the school
7178151 have you ever considered doing a play that wasnt a popular movie
7178152 i know who this guy is i knew he was probably very very earnest but slightly misguided
7178153 often when i work with people ive got to like their stuff i tend to pick up on their rhythms and their tone so i start doing comedy thats slightly more in sync with whoever it is im working with
7178154 i thought it was smart and funny without being overly cynical
7178155 you dont meet people like him in comedy but you do meet people like him in theater and drama that kind of soul searching angst ridden neurosis you encounter in hollywood and california
7178156 it wasnt really anyone specific you kind of just get a feel think of a voice and dress a certain way
7178157 it made it kind of energetic and it gave it a vibrancy it wasnt lots and lots of bitter twisted middle aged people
7178158 theres a kind of enthusiasm they had that was infectious to me and yes which was really catchy and helps to give an energy
7178159 i think americans started to adapt things like the office have translated so well and caught peoples imaginations americas a big country you cant make generalizations about it the way that you can i think about england actually but americas so disparate theres an audience for esoteric interesting comedy
7178160 were more conversant in american culture than the americans are with british culture because weve grown up on a diet of american entertainment
7178161 weve got a lot more in common with america than we have with our european neighbors because we dont share the language and so we have a historical cultural connection but in terms of pop culture were much much closer to america
7178162 why are all those guys dressed in jeans vest tops and looking like jesus
7178163 it was just kind of a curiosity which i suppose was the point of the exercise
7178164 they looked i dont know like theyd just arrived at woodstock
7178165 maybe she throws a handful of tic tacs at him
7178166 everybody gets in an uproar about 130 pitches but you have to understand the anatomy of whats going on in the game
7178167 where guys get in trouble is with 20 25 and 30 pitch innings c c has none of those
7178168 theres no abuse going on its a plan that im looking at and put into play so that it not only takes care of our starters and gets them deep into games but our bullpen too
7178169 ive just got to try to ignore that because people have no idea what im going through and the injuries ive had
7178170 socialismul are si parti bune dar s a dovedit a fi o oranduire neviabila ca atare a capotat aproape in toate statele lumii dar nu vad nici capitalismul o oranduire a viitorului prin inechitatile sale sociale o societate a viitorului fiind o alta care sa imbine elementele pozitive ale socialismului si capitalismului
7178171 if we win the majority of our games going forward were going to the make playoffs were focused on getting back to where we were when we left fenway last
7178172 once we lost joba chamberlain it just seemed like we spiraled were trying to find ourselves again for the most part we have not hit with runners in scoring position for the year our offense has been a real problem for us this year

7178175 ron paul delegates and alternates to the republican convention of whom there are many do not plan to go with the flow on the glorification of war the fed and the police state during the anointing of mccain
7178176 joe and i have been friends for many many years and we know each other very well and so i think hes made a very wise selection
7178177 are there any rules the old clich is that the only rule is that there are no rules that is true for the art of letterboxing in many senses although there is some common sense etiquette
7178178 joe biden is a real pot roast and potatoes guy he knows how to fight
7178179 if you want four more years of what weve got
7178180 you made a lot of chinese have their dreams broken
7178181 everyone from the outside would talk about my unstable psychological state
7178182 every time they talk about these short points i felt a psychological stinging
7178183 you can only see one color national flag raised to the roof
7178184 this is perfect ending for chinese national table tennis team
7178185 every time i won a silver medal i thought i was closer to the target because of the pain i withstood in the past i could harvest great joy today
7178186 i believe in terms of myself and ma our play was level
7178187 the only thing i did not do so well i did not control some of the critical points in a subtle way
7178188 i think you have your own dream you have not yet realized

7178193 the good thing about tennis this year is that you have many players who are winning some major events
7178194 its a bigger competition its more attractive for the fans
7178195 i know there are some hungry guys desperate to make some type of mark
7178196 its always been difficult to beat all these guys its just not so easy to keep it up all the time eventually sometimes they get you
7178197 i think thats maybe what i feel most this year you know just losing too many matches
7178198 they ask me why im high and my reply until the day i die dont wanna picture this cold world through sober eyes
7178199 plus all my homies wanna die call it euthanasia dear lord look how sick this ghetto made us
7178200 theres a deal for the director to helm a third pic but he has yet to decide on whether to tackle it yet we have no idea where chris is going with this we havent had any conversations with him about it
7178201 superman didnt quite work as a film in the way that we wanted it to
7178202 it didnt position the character the way he needed to be positioned
7178203 had superman worked in 2006 we would have had a movie for christmas of this year or 2009
7178204 but now the plan is just to reintroduce superman without regard to a batman and superman movie at all
7178205 shes magical and shes childlike and na ve the whole series is about aphrodite and eros and how they find peoples soulmates i work with them and ive never been in love i dont know what true love feels like so my whole goal in life is to fall in love shes kind of like a 13 year old girl in a 23 year olds body

7178209 we wont know until tomorrow what exactly they will have to do if they have to do anything we are just going to have to wait and see
7178210 i hope hes in practice by monday and that it was just a little tweak
7178211 the regular season is september 4 were not worried about the fourth preseason game
7178212 i dont think hes going anywhere the game is in 11 days after today so he has 11 days to get better and 11 days to get healthy hopefully he can get healthy in 11 days
7178213 he definitely means a lot to this team and anytime a guy like that goes down it kind of hits you right in the throat
7178214 hopefully its nothing that serious and hopefully he can get back here
7178215 i havent had a chance to talk to him hes been in the training room hopefully its nothing serious and hopefully he wont miss any time
7178216 especially with a guy like osi whos a pro bowler and a team leader but it is part of the game
7178217 we came in here knowing full well that it was a half and a half and that it would be a good go for our team as well as the jets playing their starters for a half we went ahead and followed through with that plan offensively and we had a chance we were down there in the tight green zone and didnt come away with any points at all anytime you do that you are pretty much going to regret that toward the end of the game
7178218 im disappointed we didnt get any points on the board
7178219 i dont think we made many mistakes we just didnt convert on some third and short yardage situations missed a pass here tried to run and didnt get it its something we need to work on when you cant convert those third downs it is hard to maintain some long drives
7178220 it was good to get a two minute drive at the end of the half
7178221 we drove down there and did pretty well in the two minute offense but we didnt get any points off of it i put david diehl in a bad position by dropping way back on that last pass it was good we got that drive weve always been good in the two minute and you want to have an opportunity in the preseason to go with the no huddle we had a good scoring opportunity we just didnt capitalize
7178222 we had one touchdown and that is really what has to happen the ball has to get put in the end zone again he was pressured and we didnt respond very well to it so i am disappointed in that we work as much and as hard as anybody against a team our own defense blitzes and has a tremendous pressure package and we work against that all the time so for me to see us have trouble tonight with the holding up protection wise doesnt make a whole lot of sense we are back to work
7178223 he can still play this game at a high level he made some throws that only he can make we were fortunate on a couple plays that were called back hes definitely going to help the jets this year
7178224 it is not the way it is intended to be but obviously we have to improve some there
7178225 i dont know how well we blocked at that position as well
7178226 it took us a few days to shift some assets and get a clearer picture of what was actually going on

7178258 kami tidak bisa mengulang kesalahan yang sama seperti ini jika kami hanya bermain tanpa gol di babak pertama maka saya yakin kami tidak akan memenangkan pertandingan
7178259 kini kami harus mampu melupakan kekalahan ini kami harus bangkit dan memenangkan pertandingan selanjutnya

7178292 i am 20 years old i am self revealing neat unpredictable silly charming aggressive assertive organized and far from ordinary i happen to be a social chameleon
7178293 hey what if we put a heater in the seat to make our customers even more comfortable
7178294 0833 and it will give you the option to read the opinion on the screen or to print it
7178295 develop educational plans that are reasonably calculated to ensure that all children with disabilities receive a free appropriate public education
7178296 a group of qualified professionals and the parent of the child must determine whether the child is a child with a disability
7178297 mindful that the judiciary generally lacks the specialized knowledge and experience necessary to resolve persistent and difficult questions of educational policy
7178298 the provision that a reviewing court base its decision on the preponderance of the evidence is by no means an invitation to the courts to substitute their own 4 notions of sound educational policy for those of the school authorities which they review
7178299 all children with disabilities who are in need of special education and related services
7178300 c hildren who are suspected of being a child with a disability and in need of special education even though they are advancing from grade to grade
7178301 claimant must show that school officials overlooked clear signs of disability and were negligent in failing to order testing or that there was no rational justification for not deciding to evaluate
7178302 i t is reasonable to conclude the lea provided class support to the child that was sufficient for the parents and teachers to be satisfied with his progress
7178303 child responded to the 5 classroom interventions and had reasonable academic and behavioral performance in the fourth grade
7178304 reasonable for the lea to believe the parents intended to follow up on the add evaluation
7178305 who by reason thereof needs special education and related services
7178306 who are in need of special education and related services
7178307 a neurologically based difficulty perceiving processing and understanding nonverbal information the problems associated with a nonverbal learning disability often impact a childs functioning in many areas including writing organizational skills abstract reasoning socialization speeded processing and fine motor control
7178308 i too worked at getting a p some special education help it was explained to me that he had been referred in grade three and that he did not qualify for any assistance
7178309 the deference traditional on appellate review to the hearing officers assessment of the credibility of those witnesses who testified before her
7178310 it cannot be overstated that our review of an administrative judges credibility findings is highly deferential
7178311 b efore a child is referred to a planning and placement team alternative procedures and programs in regular in fact new federal regulations that went into effect in 2006 confirm that pre referral processes are permissible under the idea
7178312 t he screening of a student by a teacher or specialist to determine appropriate instructional strategies for curriculum implementation shall not be considered to be an evaluation for eligibility for special education and related services
7178313 recommended clarification regarding whether states can develop and implement policies that permit screening of children to determine if evaluations are necessary
7178314 t here is nothing in the act that requires a state to or prohibits a state from developing and implementing policies that permit screening children to determine if evaluations are necessary
7178315 either a parent of a child or a public agency may initiate a request for an initial evaluation to determine if the child is a child with a disability
7178316 had not submitted a request to have a child evaluated for a disability or identified as a child with a disability
7178317 a student is not afforded the rights of procedural safeguards which are required upon initial referral for special education or when a parent requests an evaluation
7178318 an opportunity for the parents of a child with a disability to examine all records relating to such child and to participate in all meetings with respect to the identification evaluation and educational placement of the child and the provision of a free appropriate public education to such child and to obtain an independent evaluation of the child
7178319 special education and related services are provided in conformity with the individualized education program
7178320 reasonably calculated to enable the child to receive educational benefits
7178321 failure to have the childs program comport with the iep was largely due to the parents delays
7178322 only long enough to notify the lea of their intent to place the child in a private school
7178323 i f there was any sincere interest in resolving the issue the father would have agreed to attend an iep meeting in the fall as the lea requested and as the law requires
7178324 t his is not a question of conformity with the iep it is a question of whether the iep or the parents can determine the assignment of personnel
7178325 t he program does not fail to provide the child with fape because of the location of the service
7178326 i f he appears to be less able to tolerate this type of group setting
7178327 the attainment of passing grades and regular advancement from grade to grade are generally accepted indicators of satisfactory progress
7178328 this court has looked to test scores and similar objective criteria
7178329 if a handicapped child has available a free appropriate public education and the parents choose to place the child in a private school or facility the public agency is not required by this part to pay for the childs education at the private school or facility
7178330 because we conclude that the board had offered james an appropriate placement the briggs are not entitled to reimbursement of the costs of sending james to the soundings
7178331 its very important that consumers talk to their pharmacists about health issues particularly their medications
7178332 doing so can clear up a number of misconceptions that could affect your health
7178333 but they do this stuff all of the time why cant we change to a new company
7178334 its unbelievable that someone that young would die like that
7178335 its a pain you feel as a parent and that is all there is to it
7178336 we have children of our own we wouldnt want that to happen to one of our children
7178337 this is a shock its hard to believe still that this has happened
7178338 he always had it rough because he had alopecia he was ridiculed in school

7178355 you have to be a fool not to go study what it is that theyre doing

7178357 i was often taking the side of the studio and the network

7178377 luchamos para salir adelante para que no todo sea alcohol o droga por un pa s mejor con educaci n salud y vivienda digna
7178378 el grupo surgi por la preocupaci n de ver que los chicos s lo ten an a mano el alcohol las drogas y la deserci n escolar
7178379 para que los j venes no terminen en la delincuencia o en la droga que es lo que m s cerca tienen
7178380 cuando hablamos de virtud les hacemos ver la importancia de estudiar para conseguir un trabajo
7178381 no sab s el cari o que te dan no tienen nada y dan todo una sonrisa y el entusiasmo
7178382 vino la mam de un nene que le dicen chinito para ver qu pasaba ac porque el hijo preguntaba toda la semana cu nto faltaba para que llegara el s bado el d a que vamos al barrio

7178390 son insuficientes y el tiempo se agota el campo sigue con las manos vac as
7178391 son muchos los temas que quedan por resolver las respuestas son insuficientes
7178392 no es cierto que con la ca da de la resoluci n 125 de retenciones a las exportaciones el problema del campo est resuelto esa resoluci n era la gota que rebalsaba el vaso pero dentro de ese vaso hab a muchos temas y problemas
7178393 los instrumentos necesarios para el sector se van a parir en el congreso y a ese lugar vamos a ir a buscar las leyes que hagan falta
7178394 quieren instalar la idea de que con el voto de el vicepresidente julio cobos el 17 de julio el problema del campo se termin pero no es as
7178395 entonces fui a la cocina agarr de la mesa un cuchillo volv a la pieza y me arrodill en la cama

7178400 los proteccionistas est n en una burbuja regalando perritos en c rdoba y san mart n si se oponen no protegen la salud del animal al contrario fomentan la actividad clandestina que los inescrupulosos que hay en todas las actividades dopen a los animales o no haya veterinarios el estado tiene que regular la competencia
7178401 la actividad es una forma de maltrato en un corto lapso los galgos quedan destrozados por el estr s de las carreras y la aplicaci n de sustancias estimulantes
7178402 blanqueo otorgar a control es la manera de protegerlos con veterinarios cuidados y registros para que responde el due o si el animal es da ado adem s como se hace en palermo o san isidro la recaudaci n se destinar a a ayuda social como es ahora s lo se benefician los organizadores
7178403 lo nico que quiero es jugar a la pelota nada ni nadie me hace sentir m s feliz que divertirme con mis amigos
7178404 ojal que mi venta sirva para que central se salve econ micamente
7178405 tenemos una red de vendedores informantes que vigilan de cerca a la competencia
7178406 incluso podemos portar armas de fuego aunque no lo hacemos
7178407 las variaciones que estamos viendo sobre las decisiones que van a tomar son muy confusas
7178408 el congreso tendr la posibilidad de no aprobar el precio y determinar cu l puede ser la instancia posterior que puede ser la expropiaci n
7178409 la derrotada ha sido la propuesta de algunos legisladores que pensaban que pueden enviar a la quiebra a aerol neas y austral y despu s salieron a desmentir que hubieran presentado un proyecto cuando todo el pa s fue testigo
7178410 fueron los derrotados en esta iniciativa no la iniciativa del gobierno nacional que envi un proyecto y tiene como objetivo fundamental la compra de las acciones
7178411 hay que hacer el corte 2008 al 17 de julio tal cual marca la ley
7178412 the entire vitriolic commentary smacks of typical academic elitism if you disagree with him you are either evil or stupid
7178413 well i think hes a toddler 9 with wide feet but id like to have you measure him to check
7178414 this foot is just over a 9 and that one is a 9 5 i recommend that you try on 10s so that he has some room to grow into them
7178415 im glad to see hes doing well just not against us
7178416 other than that im happy for him hes a good kid and a good player he has an opportunity to show everyone what he can do and hes doing it
7178417 i wish i would have had the chance to play with him
7178418 but this is the next best thing trying to show off some of the things hes taught me
7178419 mickey and i talked about some adjustments he needs to make on the offensive end
7178420 we havent played with an edge but i dont think weve been going through the motions
7178421 if you look at the way guys are preparing its as good as any time weve seen

7178423 je croyais comme tout le monde que c tait ouvert exclusivement aux personnes voluant dans le secteur maritime mais en discutant sur le ponton du port de saint pierre avec des b n voles jai appris que tout le monde pouvait postuler
7178424 ils cherchaient un patron et je nai pas peur des responsabilit s

7178426 la peur on la forc ment cest la panique quil faut viter analyse alexandre mais une fois en mer tu ne penses qu faire ton travail de retour au port tu ressens ensuite la satisfaction davoir bien fait les choses et davoir pu viter le pire
7178427 tre un sauveteur en mer signifie du temps donner et r partir entre sa vie familiale professionnelle et personnelle le but du jeu tant dallier les trois sans n gliger lune ou lautre
7178428 obviously we came here looking to win tonight and i would have loved to finish this trip 3 0 but even this loss cant take away from the overall experience of the last 10 days
7178429 when we got up in the second half i thought we needed a couple of plays to break the game open and we didnt get them i give that team a lot of credit they have been together for five years and they played really well together

7178436 no tiene sentido que haya puestos pr ximos entre s con tres o cuatro guardias que no pueden moverse porque tienen que cuidar el cuartel y de todas formas cuando hay una incidencia deben llamar a la central para que env e la patrulla m s cercana que est libre es absurdo es desperdiciar el personal

7178468 well ive always respected joe biden but i disagreed with him from the time he voted against the first gulf war to his position where he said you had to break iraq up into three different counties countries
7178469 i never agreed with that but i appreciate very much his dedication to trying to solve this genocide thats going in darfur and other things that joe biden has done
7178470 but we really have different approaches to many national security issues i look forward to whoever my running mate will be having a respectful debate with him on that as well

7178493 i feel very honoured to have been part of that era where pretty much every trophy there was to win we got our hands on whereas at the moment were a group that is starting hopefully on a journey that is very productive
7178494 but its only sort of the beginning for this group and i think maybe if you ask that question in a year or twos time well hopefully give you a positive answer
7178495 other than late in the game when we let them back in we had a fair bit of control throughout the whole game so it was slightly different to 2000
7178496 i think 2000 was more of an arm wrestle the whole match
7178497 i probably lost my composure a tiny bit but that was just because i was pretty dirty on myself with what i did a few minutes before to let them score
7178498 so it was a square up so far as i was concerned
7178499 weve come over here so many times and got so close
7178500 its been a constant place where we faced disappointment on disappointment so to finally get the monkey off our back is just great
7178501 we are competing for the tri nations and it is a seriously tough competition
7178502 youve only got to look at the games so far to see that and our mindset is hopefully to get up for the challenge next week

7178516 this discovery puts a tragic end to two weeks of anguish and despair they said
7178517 we wish to thank the people of victoria our family and friends in melbourne and mauritius the media auburn south primary school collingwood english language school and melbourne girls college for their assistance and prayers
7178518 last but not least we will be eternally grateful to the victorian police victorias finest men and women in uniform who did not leave any stones unturned in their quest in bringing yadav back to us
7178519 the olympics demonstrated the success of the current system and the communist partys determination not to reform politically there is no reason to change
7178520 it still has many problems such as the possibility of an economic slowdown
7178521 the olympics were a boon for their performance but did nothing for their procedural legitimacy
7178522 this kind of basic analysis thats not supported by any evidence after two years is not going to assuage family members concerns
7178523 she would describe an experiment and say thanks to allah it turned out well
7178524 what we have learned from her is that she was in custody for over five years
7178525 i have no doubt that there really are real terrorists out there but she isnt one of them
7178526 shes a dangerous person with a lot of ability and the investigation will show how far along she may have been with any plot
7178527 i am informing you that i gave away the precious thing that i have in which it became very cheap which is my own self to lift up the oppression that is upon us through the american government
7178528 i did not like the tube in my mouth now go ahead and accept the rope in my neck
7178529 clearly reflect that the three deceased detainees required significant time to prepare the instruments with which they committed suicide
7178530 the possibility that the detainees used this uninterrupted gap in guard coverage to prepare these instruments cannot be ruled out
7178531 its simply astounding that it took the government over two years to conclude a so called investigation of three men who died in a small cage under the governments exclusive control the investigation itself is what needs to be investigated along with the people whove perpetrated the disgraceful extra constitutional detentions
7178532 i feel that the guards and myself on alpha block did an inadequate job monitoring the detainees that night to make sure that they were following the rules as to show some kind of skin while sleeping
7178533 due to the similarities in the wording of the statements and the manner of suicides as well as statements made by other detainees interviewed there was growing concern that someone within the camp delta population was directing detainees to commit suicide and that additional suicides might be imminent
7178534 representatives of other law enforcement agencies involved in the investigation were later told that on the night in question another detainee who did not later commit suicide had walked through the cell block telling people tonights the night
7178535 i believe the detainees on alpha block knew this was going on and they encouraged them to commit suicide i believed they plotted it and utilized our own rules against us
7178536 although many of the individuals apprehended during the raid have strong connections to al qaeda there is no credible information to suggest ahmed received terrorist related training or is a member of the al qaeda network
7178537 we anticipate an extra 1000 west australian people first home buyers will be able to get a start get their first home and get a place they can call their own
7178538 we have concerns around the welfare of the nurses who are employed by mckesson as mckesson does not wish to undertake bargaining on behalf of their employees with the union
7178539 i think thats the same story for almost everyone who comes here for the first time
7178540 the most surprisingly high prices are those for housing and food products fruit is amazingly expensive even compared to scandinavian countries
7178541 high housing costs can definitely be a deterrent for foreigners who want to come to work here with housing allowances given by their companies they would get housing of a much better quality in many other countries than they get here
7178542 montes alpha a popular chilean wine is sold here for 38 000 won per bottle
7178543 but its retail price is only 16 257 won in japan meaning koreas distribution system is underdeveloped and saddled with too many middlemen
7178544 starbucks coffee is more expensive here than most other asian countries thats mainly because of high rents
7178545 high production costs perennially short supplies from domestic suppliers tariffs and non tariff barriers combine to push up prices
7178546 opening up the market and higher competition would naturally lower consumer prices but this will come slowly
7178547 it is not just supply and demand which determines the cost here but also the mentality of many citizens who do not really mind paying higher prices society has come to accept it
7178548 they were taken under the threat of firearms it was an abduction a security official at a hotel south of the capital told afp speaking on condition of anonymity
7178549 its clear that they were kidnapped because their schedule was to come back to the hotel before 12 in the afternoon and we dont have their whereabouts said abdifatah ajos sanura a director at the shamo hotel where the pair stayed
7178550 we contacted the place where they were heading but so far they havent seen them he added
7178551 has deplored the recent killings of innocent victims and the resulting displacement of people in kismayo said a statement issued by his office in the kenyan capital nairobi
7178552 he said that the fighting was to control the port for resource generation and not as portrayed in some places a political or other issue it added
7178553 kismayo is relatively calm today saturday but residents in janayabdale village reported new clashes in the area said moalin adan warfa an elder from kismayo
7178554 the remnants of the clan militias and some of their commanders tried to cross janayabdale where they encountered an attack from the islamists several people were injured in the clashes said villager hasan muktar
7178555 lets get drunk for the sake of getting drunk and make idiots out of our selves
7178556 what country are you more loyal towards bulgaria or the united states
7178557 they told me that if i did not cooperate with them i would not be able to come back to the u s again
7178558 they apparently have carried out that threat for no reason i was denied a visa when i last tried to visit the u s
7178559 the agency is committed to the health and welfare of those in its custody all those detained by ice receive a medical screening by a physician
7178560 i didnt even know it was a tear there was a lot of pain in bangkok and i didnt know what it was i thought it was a problem related to my flat feet but after i returned to mumbai and finished with johns abraham brothers wedding reception i got an mri done it showed a tear
7178561 its a very common occurrence in the legs of active people like dancers and athletes that tear just stays theres no cure for it if you lead a routine life it doesnt bother you at all otherwise theres arthroscopy but my orthopaedic surgeons have not advised it i can walk work out dance do everything
7178562 i didnt want to inconvenience anyone during the shooting so as a precautionary measure i kept a therapist around because during a dance movement there was some swelling none of the dance steps changed dancing is a routine activity so the therapist was just a precautionary measure
7178563 its part of our job its no big deal you just have to understand your body and be careful four years back i ran with the wrong shoes it caused a knee problem i immediately corrected that i believe in long term health and when i work out i listen to my body if any part of my body gives me any pain i stop immediately and no trainer can push me
7178564 he john coates said id really like for you to be the flag bearer and i just thought oh my gosh i never even saw that coming at all
7178565 i feel so honoured to be given this role and i guess im really looking forward to it
7178566 disappointed that china has not used the occasion of the olympics to demonstrate greater tolerance and openness
7178567 the boisterous sea of liberty is never without a wave
7178568 i never consider a difference of opinion in politics in religion in philosophy as cause for withdrawing from a friend
7178569 rudy giuliani theres only three things he mentions in a sentence a noun a verb and 9 11 theres nothing else
7178570 well also with richards character he argues with anita and of course everyone is annoyed by that but think about it what is he arguing for what is he arguing about alot of it is hes arguing for her morals her christian views and what he sees as right and wrong she use to see life this way till she changed through out the story so in a way richard is an important character he points out things that are seen as wrong and addresses them to anita even his own issues with her are annoying but its probably why anita still talks to him i dont know
7178571 a dense covering of low albedo plants capable of growing on ice under contemporary martian conditions
7178572 the development of such an organism should be attempted only after a thorough and ecologically responsible program of unmanned planetary exploration has been completed
7178573 if i were to try to read much less answer all the attacks made on me this shop might as well be closed for any other business i do the very best i know how the very best i can and i mean to keep doing so until the end if the end brings me out all right whats said against me wont amount to anything if the end brings me out wrong ten angels swearing i was right would make no difference
7178574 am i therefore become your enemy because i tell you the truth
7178575 the first object of teaching then is to stimulate in the pupil the love of learning and to form in him the habits and ideals of independent study
7178576 some wish to live within the sound of a chapel bell i wish to run a rescue mission within a yard of hell
7178577 its the radiocarbon date that to our minds is like a square peg in a round hole its not fitting properly and the question is why
7178578 there is a lot of other evidence that suggests to many that the shroud is older than the radiocarbon dates allow and so further research is certainly needed
7178579 obama recognized the gap on national security and he recognized the need to get tougher on mccain and he chose the guy who can most quickly help him on both counts
7178580 there should be no doubt that this is going to be a rough campaign from here on out and biden knows how to fight im sure that was a strong consideration
7178581 this is an admission by barack obama that he doesnt have the experience to be president more than a vice president hes looking for a hand holder or a tutor
7178582 his brain is an asset but his mouth is a major liability when the latter starts trumping the former and it inevitably will the democrats will have a problem on their hands
7178583 its one of those deals where i couldnt get by him i couldnt get by him and i just had to ask myself would he do that to me
7178584 and he has before so thats the way it goes
7178585 whatever carls going to say hes sorry that he didnt want to race that way but he always does well take it well go on and well race him that way in the chase if thats the way he wants to race
7178586 when love and duty are one grace is within you
7178587 i cant think of a nicer place to sit this spring over a glass of ros and watch the boys and girls in the street outside smiling gaily to each other and wondering where to go for a nosh
7178588 i cant think of a nicer place to sit this spring over a glass of ros and watch the boys and girls in the street outside smiling gaily to each other and wondering where to go for nosh
7178589 ill just remove this indefinite article because coren is an illiterate cunt and i know best
7178590 he has wonderful qualities qualifications and knowledge and we would be foolish not to use his experience
7178591 we are excited because he knows the parents and the kids here
7178592 we are not concerned we just want to share in his gifts and talents
7178593 try eating a hard boiled egg for protein along with a bowl of plain oatmeal topped with fresh berries to boost your mood first thing in the morning
7178594 positive emotions are not only indicators but also producers of success

7178623 i am bisexual i love making out with hot sexy women if im not getting it from bret then im going to go find some hot girl to make out with
7178624 im not familiar with a lot of tools so this was totally new to me
7178625 vamos das uma li o na sele o masculina de futebol
7178626 saya hampir demam kerana tidak dapat tidur dan ini menyebabkan saya tidak boleh bekerja dua hari pilihanraya umum lalu pun tidak seperti ini
7178627 bukan sahaja sesak tetapi yang lebih teruk mereka membunyikan hon sesuka hati tanpa mengira waktu
7178628 pernah anak saya yang berumur sembilan bulan terbangun dan menangis kerana amat takut mendengar bunyi enjin motosikal yang ditunggang oleh budak budak muda
7178629 tetapi apakah cukup sekadar penurunan 15 sen bagi petrol dan 8 sen bagi diesel sedangkan rakyat sudah semakin menderita dengan kekangan kos sara hidup yang semakin menggila dari hari ke hari
7178630 penurunan pada kadar 6 peratus tidak memberi apa apa signifikan langsung di sebalik penurunan harga mendadak harga minyak dunia yang kini dianggarkan pada kadar as115 setong
7178631 amk melihat tindakan ini tidak lebih untuk tujuan mengaburi mata rakyat di sebalik tekad dan komitmen datuk seri anwar ibrahim yang menjanjikan penurunan 70 sen harga minyak sebaik sahaja pakatan rakyat memerintah
7178632 biar apapun usaha umno bn kini rakyat perlu dimerdekakan ekonomi mereka dengan kepimpinan baru yang lebih progresif di bawah pakatan rakyat
7178633 kami ingin tegaskan beberapa kunci untuk menjadi ahli yang bertanggungjawab pertama dap menerima anwar sebagai perdana menteri alternatif dan komited dengan kerjasama dalam pakatan untuk mempromosikan kerajaan cat
7178634 sama ada kita boleh mendapatkan sokongan orang melayu bergantung kepada prestasi kita sebagai pemerintah di pulau pinang perak dan selangor
7178635 terutamanya apabila kita memimpin kerajaan di pulau pinang untuk membuktikan kita mengambil berat terhadap orang melayu dan menyalurkan apa yang tidak berjaya dilakukan bn selama 50 tahun
7178636 hanya rakyat kingmaker kita hanya mahu menjadi pemangkin untuk perubahan dan berkhidmat untuk rakyat berdasarkan prinsip cat

7178639 put his bike for sale so that he could buy a motocycle like daddys
7178640 adrians a safety who runs like a corner and hits like a linebacker he can do it all at any given time we can switch responsibilities and not miss a beat
7178641 what we found out last year is that antrel has a very good feel for the ball
7178642 he has very good ball skills and range now we can do some things with antrel and adrian that will make them more interchangeable as antrel grows into the safety role
7178643 my heel was bothering me for the past four five years
7178644 i got to the point where i couldnt really walk
7178645 im going into this season motivated to prove again who adrian wilson is as a football player ive always said im the best safety in the nfc
7178646 ive never really said i publicly wanted a new deal
7178647 ill let my agent eugene parker be that bad guy
7178648 i think we have a lot of guys with something to prove but we have to put contract issues aside this year is all about winning
7178649 you can call it bad but heres a guy busting his butt
7178650 people do fall off the base hes making it happen thats the kind of stuff that you make an out but it still fires everybody up in the dugout
7178651 at the plate hes swinging at balls that might have hit him hes a little hack happy right now but hes playing the heck out of defense
7178652 i am a little nervous about stuff like that but just do the best you can
7178653 i remember when we first met i hadnt made a fool of my self yet i wanted us to get away but there wasnt any where that we could stay i lost my job and my apartment too just so i could spend more time with you i didnt want ot deal with reality i just want to feel with intensity
7178654 is that you making love http youtu 62 65files 35q 70l a
7178655 thanks now tit for tat well stop making the sounds of an ungreased wheelbarrow every time you bend over to tie your shoe
7178656 its amazing this is what i get paid to do this is what i live for
7178657 this is all i really want to go out there every fifth day and do my job
7178658 last year battling through this surgery and having this team behind me with their support its meant everything
7178659 ninety pitches in five innings isnt going to cut it every time out i realize that but its a big win for the team right now
7178660 hes in our rotation and thats the bottom line i think it means a lot to him especially what hes been through to be able to come out and contribute at such an important time of year
7178661 obviously he wasnt lighting up the radar gun but you dont have to do that in this game if you hit your spots
7178662 i think he wanted to get out there and prove himself to new york
7178663 obviously theres been a lot going on the last four years i cant ignore that but im still the same person i was four years ago when i go out there on the mound
7178664 the hitter walked toward the dugout to throw his bat and helmet away he in doing so has abandoned his effort to reach the next base
7178665 i cant say enough about the horse i always felt he had that ability
7178666 when youve been around horses for a long time the really good ones do things very differently than the usual ones this horse from day one had shown that he never did anything ever to disappoint me
7178667 a funny thing happened on the way to the divorce court
7178668 when hawk mallen took over the company joanne worked for it seemed hed taken over her life as well expecting his new assistant to be at his command day and night and when he offered joanne a dream promotion she realized shed be at his side almost twenty four hours a day working so closely with hawk joanne found it hard to ignore how irresistibly sexy he was she was determined not to have and affair with her boss but what if hawk wasnt looking for a mistletoe mistress but a wife
7178669 tycoon matthew warner had broken samanthas heart once she was determined never to let him get close to her again but what he was proposing wasnt exactly marriage but more of a casual affair samantha knew she should refuse but matt was hard to resist besides samantha was older now and wiser a single minded and successful career girl she could handle a no strings relationship with a devastatingly sexy playboy couldnt she only samantha had broken two unwritten rules shed fallen in love with matt and fallen pregnant
7178670 ive got a long way to go to redeem myself
7178671 im not going to sit on a good start and say things are better im proud of this start and im going to take the positives to my next start but im not totally redeemed
7178672 the key for us was to continue to give ourselves a chance with runners in scoring position
7178673 is john maine 100 percent right now no is he going to hurt himself probably not
7178674 does he want to pitch yes he wants to gut it out i am comfortable with anybody that wants to gut it out period but i do feel that if that is not enough for us to win then i have to make some decisions about that
7178675 it wont cause any serious structural damage but its a nagging thing thats going to be there the rest of the year
7178676 its a little bit easier when he gets runs early
7178677 it allows your pitcher to go out there and relax
7178678 when hes getting ahead of guys hes as good as anybody you want to put out there
7178679 that was a good morning exercise that thing with the large snake what was it
7178680 it was a jutsu that sara and hima showed me pretty interesting right brother
7178681 its something the magos dont have so it should be advantageous
7178682 did i hear the ninja right did something happen between you and ashley
7178683 all that happened was that miss ashley was about to fall out of her chair and hit the floor when i grabbed her and pulled her onto the bed while she was asleep she wrapped her hands around me and held onto me all night thats what the ninja must have seen
7178684 we saw you with your arms around her as well and trent sama said that that was the first time he had seen you in such a peaceful state of mind since the incident so we went to the room down the hall and slept in there
7178685 most of our gear is in there including our shuriken spare kunai and other things
7178686 and the rest of your clothes as well in fact im heading back before i catch a damn cold out here
7178687 i knew i heard someone come in last night i guess we know who now
7178688 okay we have akamaru village over here in harpina and we are over here in lyran and the magos lyranian hq is here in the other mountain range
7178689 wait wait wait there are more then just one hq
7178690 there are at least two the lyranian hq is here that is where me and the fighters from akamaru village were being held the harpinan hq is over here near the water
7178691 well what do you think you will do now that you know there are more then one headquarters
7178692 i have to think about a different battle plan then going in and blowing the place sky high master ang did you by chance
7178693 grab the schematics of course i dont like them for capturing me and destroying my home so by the bear blade law of ethics revenge is allowed when you are disturbed so i want my revenge
7178694 they havent done anything to me so in your plans leave me out of the equation
7178695 we could always ask our comrades to help us take out the harpinan hq since we have a lot of people over there
7178696 that would be great but have the magos done anything to you or your village
7178697 well they tried to invade our city but we were able to drive them back so we wanted to see if we could find strong warriors with grudges against them to help us
7178698 the most superior woman is still infinitely inferior to the most inferior men
7178699 gli stavano a grattugggi i piedi ce stavano le briciole di carne per terra
7178700 as shepherds we shall be for thee my lord for thee
7178701 she was regarded nationally and internationally as one of the leaders of the silk industry
7178702 i wanted to perform the music that she performed as i started to research her i realized there was so much more to the story than gertrude the musician
7178703 in my portrayal of gertrude i have to the best of my ability re created the silk manufacturing process i raised worms i learned to reel the cocoons i learned to weave
7178704 were equal in quality to the best imported goods from europe
7178705 we still have a lot of those silks and they are absolutely stunning
7178706 but she was also an artist and the silks reveal that they made some gorgeous scarves they also made sunday clothes for every member of the harmony society
7178707 its fascinating to me that these people who were basically very plain had these extremely rich sunday clothes
7178708 your average american would not have owned much silk at all
7178709 everything we do at the wilds is mission driven first and foremost for the animals and their habitats but rather than having the broad collection oriented approach of a zoo we focus on a limited number of rare species that match our expertise and resources and require special attention
7178710 all the projects we have undertaken for our human visitors are intended to support that effort
7178711 y dem s yo siempre aguante y hoy ya no me quieren qu les hice o qu ahhhhhhh ya me di cuenta no me quieren por viejo lo entiendo ni hablar
7178712 for months ive searched for a leader to finish this journey alongside me and join me in making washington work for the american people i searched for a leader who understood the rising costs confronting working people and will always put their dreams first
7178713 today ive come back to springfield to tell you ive found that leader
7178714 the roger tory peterson centennial exhibit original paintings by the master nature artist runs june 22 to oct 15 2008 and is a rare opportunity for the public to see some of rogers original artwork
7178715 though the show runs through oct 15 we invite people to visit over labor day weekend for the centennial kick off and open house aug 30 31
7178716 i began my research three years ago at the roger tory peterson institute
7178717 and discovered that there was a lot more about this guy i wanted to know
7178718 i used to backpack the laurel highlands hiking trail from end to end but i began to have some back trouble and i couldnt carry a loaded backpack anymore
7178719 so i tried to find a way to hike the lhht in a way that was not so physically demanding then it came to me do it without the pack and why not invite 249 of my best friends
7178720 my parents live in berlin somerset county so i have been driving under the overpass that carries the laurel highlands trail over the pennsylvania turnpike for 30 years
7178721 every time i passed under the trail i thought to myself im going to hike that trail someday when i heard about the venture outdoors quest series i knew this would be the year id do it
7178722 its just beautiful up there there are some magnificent views from the ridge that take your breath away
7178723 on one of the early hikes we saw so many types of mushrooms i never knew so many different mushrooms existed i have photos of them all
7178724 im just amazed by the beauty of the mountains and how green everything is
7178725 any time you turn a corner or top a hill you never know what beautiful sight is on the other side in illinois you make four turns and you are back where you started i was never an outdoors person before but here it calls out to me and it brings out an adventurous side that i sensed was there but nothing ever sparked it until this
7178726 if you dont know nature is there how will you care when it is gone the lhht is a gift we need to protect it
7178727 it highlights much of what this region is what it has to offer it is a slice of wilderness in your own backyard too many people are suffering from nature deficit disorder the lhht and the laurel highlands region are part of the cure
7178728 the hikers learned to hike no matter the weather one time we hiked in torrential rain for 4 1 2 hours
7178729 we all felt a sense of pride when we were done
7178730 after that any rain that threatened we felt like bring it on we can take it
7178731 they learned how to dress for the weather what food to bring what boots to wear and how much water they needed on some level they got to know themselves in a new way a basic way
7178732 i tell them that if i am its all right with me because im having more fun than ever
7178733 state governments have offered land but id like to assert the project will be a reality
7178734 theres a sense of tension violence its not a conducive atmosphere
7178735 whatever be the cost we will move out if the situation so demands
7178736 west bengal can either host the worlds costliest political blunder or the worlds cheapest car
7178737 ive been advised by pistolas fc medical staff to not play for a month
7178738 which really means i hope to be back august 31st for the playoffs
7178739 i hope we can get at least 14 or 15 guys simply because we need the substitutions so that those playing on both days dont exhaust themselves on the saturday
7178740 in a response from players and fans alike pfc decided now was the time to launch an interactive forum where we can get some fun filled discussions and debates going on
7178741 weve noticed that nobody was commenting on the articles on the official website for whatever reason but a forum provides a more interactive discussion and allows the players and fans alike to start discussion it should be a great experience for all
7178742 of course our concern is for him and that he doesnt risk further injury but im sure eddy knows his body well and will know exactly how much he can give or whether or not he needs to rest speaking on behalf of the team i can say were all ecstatic to have him back
7178743 the olympics demonstrated the success of the current system and the communist partys determination not to reform politically there is no reason to change
7178744 it still has many problems such as the possibility of an economic slowdown
7178745 the olympics were a boon for their performance but did nothing for their procedural legitimacy
7178746 brand china has done an outstanding job of repackaging itself with the help of the american media
7178747 the vast majority of americans have been dazzled right from the opening ceremony
7178748 something that would have taken four or five years they did it in 17 days
7178749 nbc has a ton of money invested advertisers have a ton of money invested
7178750 they dont want a blemish to surface there are too many millions at stake and everyones got their hand in the till
7178751 beijing got what it wanted out of this globally televised spectacular it reaped a huge prestige bonanza that it will surely use to promote its international influence and we fear further tighten its grip at home
7178752 it pocketed these gains without offering any concessions in return
7178753 stai pur certo che a non tentare non si sbaglia mai
7178754 i know all the kids already and the character they bring to the table
7178755 there is a lot of talent in our locker room we have the talent we just need to get organized and put a collection of players together who can win it is a new beginning in our program
7178756 its been a smooth transition for me as a coach
7178757 the only thing i ask of the players is to work hard and respect the opportunity they have to play the game they have worked real hard
7178758 you cant say one team is going to run away with it but our number one goal stepping into the season is defending that title
7178759 teams in the section are always well prepared and every game they come to play
7178760 we have a really tough schedule but i think it will prepare us for league play
7178761 i think we will be in every game our section is always a tough section and there are good athletes throughout it
7178762 if we are not mentally ready to play this year we will get beat
7178763 weve got some players who ride on a school bus one hour to get here
7178764 its tough for an individual who lives that far away to get here for drills in the summer and to get home after practice especially with the way gas prices are
7178765 we have two or three players who live 45 minutes away a couple guys are closer to cameron w va than they are to the school
7178766 with the numbers we have this year we really cant go offense vs defense in practice
7178767 waynesburg is about 8 miles away but thats the closest town of any size and thats a different school waynesburg central district we dont have any central spot like that
7178768 aleppo high and gray high used to have six man teams and theyd play each other
7178769 aleppo would play gray in six man and then theyd go get five other guys and go play cameron back in the early 1950s there were a lot of six man teams
7178770 when rodneys father and his uncle were in high school the football team had winning records its uncanny how many of the guys who were on the team when rodney played had fathers who played with rodneys dad
7178771 yeah like how many miles im putting on my car
7178772 a lot of people might think im nuts but im glad to be out of the keystone conference
7178773 we were competing in the big ten conference when i graduated from belle vernon in 1972 it eventually became the big nine when the wpial switched to four classes in 1980
7178774 we won or shared the keystone title every year during that stretch
7178775 the exceptions were in 1998 and 1999 when the wpial combined the keystone and big seven it was called the keystone conference that year
7178776 the poor performance of the keystone conference in the wpial playoffs has become a major problem
7178777 the last team from the keystone to win a playoff game was belle vernon we advanced to the wpial semifinals in 2000 no teams from the keystone has won a playoff game since then
7178778 and that will continue until they start winning in the playoffs were happy to be in the big seven i want to play the good teams my staff and the players want to play the good teams
7178779 we want to get the program back to where it was the only way to do that is to play in a conference like the big seven
7178780 all the teams are close with the exception of chartiers valley and they are only an hour away
7178781 weve been playing thomas jefferson every year in a non conference game the only difference is that we get them in week eight instead of week one
7178782 i dont like the idea of moving every two years
7178783 its hard to build rivalries when your changing conferences so much
7178784 we would have been one of the favorites in the keystone
7178785 it will be very difficult to win the big seven with a team thats been as dominant as thomas jefferson the past few years
7178786 a good example is our offensive line five of the six starters on our line are 6 feet 3 or taller and they all move very well the only thing im concerned with is our lack of experience
7178787 we had to totally rebuild the offense at almost every position
7178788 its vital for our defense to play well early in the season we need them to carry our young offense
7178789 weve been preparing for this move from the keystone to the big seven since the start of january
7178790 weve made major changes in our conditioning and lifting program weve also made changes to both our offensive and defensive schemes
7178791 our only returning starter on defense is senior tyler reed 5 11 210 and hes moving from outside to inside linebacker so every position has a returning starter
7178792 we will need our offense to pick up the slack until our defense matures
7178793 we have only 13 seniors and only five or six will start we are very excited about our junior and sophomore classes
7178794 we have 21 seniors and only seven juniors its a small class that has affected many of our sports programs fortunately we have a solid senior class our biggest concern is depth we must stay away from injuries
7178795 i know very little about the teams in this conference so im not sure what to expect
7178796 theres a great kinesthetic transfer from one sport to another it also helps an athlete stay in good physical condition throughout the school year
7178797 michael led all class aaaa running backs with 1 300 yards and was named to the first team of the great southern conference all star team last year as a sophomore
7178798 he runs with power has outstanding vision and is very adept at reading blocking schemes he is a quick reactor with excellent anticipation he also has 4 5 speed in the 40 yard dash he combines everything you want in a running back
7178799 i was pleased with my overall performance but things didnt work out as i had hoped at hershey
7178800 the sprain was so bad that i couldnt walk for three days it was a real bummer because i could have done much better
7178801 it was a great experience to win the piaa baseball title
7178802 i hope to win a few more state titles before i graduate
7178803 i actually weighed in at 200 at the end of the season
7178804 now im weighing in at 215 pounds my goal is to win the wpial and piaa titles that eluded me last year
7178805 i started playing football when i was 9 years old
7178806 i spent the first year trying to get used to it i started having fun my second year and have progressed each year
7178807 i like defense better because i can rely on my instincts
7178808 im very good at reacting when im running the ball the focus is on me its much different when i play on defense
7178809 chad decided to concentrate on basketball last year and didnt play football
7178810 its great to have him back in the backfield again even if it will take a few carries away from me
7178811 theres no question michael can be a great college linebacker
7178812 he reminds me of former penn state linebacker paul posluszny and current penn state linebacker sean lee michael certainly fits the mold
7178813 penn state is my favorite but that could change before i finally sign
7178814 i anticipated this and tried to prepare some people that this was going to happen it was sort of inevitable because of the amount of teams in the wpial in class double a
7178815 everyone feels bad about it everyone knows it isnt ideal to have these teams not playing each other but it is the way it has to be for now
7178816 there was nothing wpial executive director tim omalley could do
7178817 his hands were tied in all of this and this was the only way he could go about making the schedule
7178818 do we all wish these two teams could keep playing every year yes but is the wpial at fault no way
7178819 kids make plays in this game that they would never make against another opponent
7178820 everyone elevates their play i dont know if it is pride i dont know what it is but when a kid from monessen looks across the field and sees charleroi and a kid from chaleroi looks across the field and sees monessen something clicks and the level of play rises on both sides
7178821 it was always the game from the time it started because of how these communities are
7178822 and it will always be the game no matter what happens in the future
7178823 when charleroi and monessen get together it will be the biggest thing down here
7178824 oh i think so it is just a matter of time
7178825 it depends on the wpial schedule but i would think we will be playing again in the near future
7178826 that is a no brainer it would be monessen everyone wants to see that game i also think it is just a matter of time before you see us out there against each other again
7178827 he was thrown into the fire last year as a sophomore and he is still learning but we expect big things from him things are going a lot smoother right now with the team the offense and defense are almost identical and its a lot easier for the kids having that recognition we are a lot further ahead right now than we were last year
7178828 we are big up front and we are going to go as they go
7178829 we have a big tackle but no one in the wpial has a clue who he is andrew has long arms and can really move his feet he has come into his own as far as confidence
7178830 well struggle through this season but we need to rebuild this where we can get some success down the road our 10 sophomores are really good ballplayers and we have a good jv team
7178831 if we dont play this year then our juniors careers would be over too and thats the last thing i want to happen
7178832 we need to build some depth on the lines because right now we are plugging in holes with freshmen and you never want to do that
7178833 they say for every sophomore you start you lose a game i dont know how that axiom works for freshmen
7178834 he has come back and he is fully healthy and looks very good
7178835 we are anxious to get him in a game situation so he can feel more confident
7178836 the seniors we lost were pretty important but we have a lot of experience coming back the kids learned a lot last year
7178837 a majority of the skill players are back but were just going to have to shore things up on the offensive line
7178838 we needed some experience and we needed to get stronger and a lot of the kids did
7178839 we are in a tough conference as far as class a goes but we are looking to make a little bit of noise
7178840 and what was unique about that year was that a lot of times in 2001 the game was over at halftime
7178841 so those returning kids all played varsity football that championship year heading into the following year
7178842 if we have a strength its at the skill positions
7178843 with the arrival of some good underclassmen the coaching staff is looking forward to the 2008 football season
7178844 they took some heat from the community on it and we did as a coaching staff who wouldnt that motivated them they worked hard there was a good turnout at winter workouts and summer workouts were a better football team i know that
7178845 no te preocupes danny por algo has venido a estados unidos no s lo a trabajar todo ir bien
7178846 no te preocupes muy f cil toma todo el dinero que tienes he invi rtelo en la entrada a pesar del riesgo que se corre sino resulta te vas directo al concierto haces tu cola y qui n sabe puedes conseguir una entrada
7178847 we are looking to improve our program in all areas
7178848 we will have a young nucleus of players who will improve from week to week
7178849 there are four teams that have a legitimate chance of winning the conference title this year
7178850 we would like to think we are one of those teams there is no dominant team so any of the four could come out on top
7178851 chad rushed for 493 yards and michael ran for 470 as freshmen
7178852 chad decided to concentrate on baskeball last season but is playing both sports this year its good to have them back together in our backfield
7178853 our running backs and linebacking corp are probably as good as any around the wpial
7178854 we could be as good as last year and potentially even better
7178855 are you sure i dont want you to have bad dreams
7178856 scary it is once upon a time out in the middle of a very dark dark campground two young girls heard strange sounds
7178857 im just getting close so i can hear nana my turn
7178858 once perturba time there was a princess and she was lovely in da garden with lovely trees and and and she had on a pretty spawkly dress and a prince came and grabbed her and took her away to da big castle way up high in da sky it was awesome
7178859 yeah but he locked da door and princess had to stay dare all by herself
7178860 but whos going to save the princess oh wait i get it shes going to save herself right
7178861 you cant always trust the ones that are cute and charming and sweep you off your feet
7178862 dont you realize i can kill you with one word
7178863 did you know that i can cause you profound horrifying agony for all eternity
7178864 but as ive said for a long time records are meant to be broken i certainly thought that by this time someone would have won it twice
7178865 we are a young team but our kids are working real hard
7178866 we are not very big up front but if we can keep healthy well be ok
7178867 we are going to try to get through the first couple of games relying on their experience they are a really talented group
7178868 we are going to have to fill some skill positions the older kids have to recognize that the younger kids at skill positions will take a little while to get their feet wet there needs to be patience on both ends
7178869 our quarterback is only a sophomore but he is certainly a tremendously talented young man he can throw and run and we are expecting big things out of him
7178870 last year the only thing that beat us was that we got worn out with players having to flop back and forth between offense and defense
7178871 we had great participation in our offseason conditioning program this year and there is definitely an interest around the program
7178872 he had a very successful surgery and he started rehabbing a week and a half ago
7178873 i really dont know when he will be back but if it is up to him he will be there he wants to be there for his senior year
7178874 overall i just think we will be harder hitting and a little tougher team
7178875 we have a couple kids returning on the line and that should help but we are going to have to get settled in the backfield
7178876 we need a quarterback someone to run the team that is going to be a big question
7178877 we lost one of our running backs last year but we are pretty high on zach
7178878 cory minnick is in his third year now and we went through some growing pains with him early but he is a lot stronger running and throwing the ball he has really matured
7178879 the strength of the team is the experience a lot of these kids gained last year
7178880 i think we are going to have great team unity develop a lot of heart and play with emotion we are like any other class a team we need to stay healthy
7178881 it is going to be harder than it was last year i had seniors and juniors i could rely on to help me through my first season and this year we are really young
7178882 we got a plate of chicken and the head was right in the middle of it it caught me a little off guard but we were told the chinese culture is interested in the beginning and end of things so it wasnt intended to be eaten its about keeping all the parts for the wholeness of the meal
7178883 i love watching people compete and this was pretty fantastic
7178884 the people here have been so hospitable so welcoming and friendly these games have been a long haul and their spirit has remained up the whole way
7178885 the other day i went to the temple of heaven and you can take a straight shot down the regular tourist thing but i really enjoyed going off into the huge garden
7178886 courage believe life in remembrance of john challis no 11
7178887 life aint about how many breaths you take its what you do with those breaths
7178888 lexie gina scott john made me promise to do this
7178889 he told me that you had gotten so many people to applaud him now its your turn
7178890 mike neither the doctors or me think john will make it more than another week
7178891 we want you to be the one to write johns obituary will you
7178892 john when you start feeling better you need to hit the weights because that body isnt going to do much for the girls
7178893 mr white i dont know if i can ever repay you for what you have done for me and getting my message out
7178894 this is where i go a lot of times at night to think
7178895 you have done two great articles in your career the first one was when you made me coach of the year
7178896 marriage will be recognised in the tax system if i am davids chancellor which i fully expect to be then i will implement that there is no disagreement there at all
7178897 of course everyone is entitled to choose how to live their lives and some marriages do fail but we know that in general marriage is an institution that contributes to building a stronger society
7178898 that is why labour was wrong to stop supporting it through the tax system and that is why we will recognise it
7178899 if youre running a race and youre ahead you dont have to keep looking over your shoulder

7178937 in the field of health there have been many initiatives to combat pandemics and put up an alert system for instance there are 500 000 doses of tamiflu in stock in singapore ready to be delivered in any outbreak of bird flu in asean countries
7178938 it may not be used but it gives you security and comfort of what being part of asean is all about

7178994 the leadership and organizational structure over athletics financial operations show signs of being overextended at a time when the football program is undergoing rapid growth and success
7178995 theyre basically diverting funds that were sold as sponsorships to pay for other things that are not on the books of the university
7178996 this is not the right way to spend public money the money should come to the university and then be allocated from there its inappropriate

7179011 it is still utterly deceptive because the irrational appeal of proximity to the jackpot motivates the consumer far more than an expressed intent to support the activity advertised

7179072 philosophy must be of some use and we must take it seriously if the chief proposition of philosophy is that is nonsense then we must take this seriously and not pretend as wittgenstein does that is important nonsense what we cant say we cant say and we cant whistle it either
7179073 we will roll out the red carpet for tata motors if it wishes to set up the small car project in any part of the state
7179074 we are definitely interested in getting the nano project so if the tatas are thinking about moving out of west bengal they should think of maharashtra as the first choice as the company already has a sizeable presence in the state and it offers many advantages
7179075 leaders like mamata banerjee in the state who will oppose the project of such a kind which is going to create thousands of direct and indirect jobs
7179076 we will consider the proposal if the company approaches us
7179077 if the tata group comes forward with a proposal we will consider it favourably
7179078 i cannot disclose the alternative plan we have devised to commission the project and meet the opposition demand but we are working out a solution which i can reveal only after i have met the opposition leaders again the project would be implemented and it is nearing completion i am confident there will not be any problem that will drive away tata from the state but for this i appeal to all opposition parties staging their programmes from august 24 to keep it peaceful and avoid any untoward incident

7179084 dialah allah yang menurunkan kepada kamu al quran daripadanya ada ayat muhkamat mempunyai hukum yang jelas yang menjadi asas kitab al quran dan yang lainnya ayat mutasyabihat samar maka adapun orang yang di dalam hatinya cenderung kepada kesesatan lalu mereka mengikut apa yang yang samar samar daripadanya ayat ayat mutasyabihat bertujuan mencari fitnah dan mencari makna yang lain dan tidaklah mengetahui makna sebenarnya melainkan allah dan orang orang yang mendalami ilmu berkata kami telah beriman dengannya ayat mutasyabihat semuanya dari sisi tuhan kami dan tidaklah mengambil peringatan melainkan orang orang yang mempunyai akal fikiran
7179085 yaitu yang maha pemurah yang bersemayam di atas arsy qs 20 5
7179086 saya percaya dengan apa yang allah turunkan sesuai makna yang diinginkan nya dan apa yang rasulullah sampaikan sesuai dengan makna yang dia maksud
7179087 kami beriman kepada ayat ayat yang mutasyabihat semuanya itu dari sisi rabb kami
7179088 mengasihi dekat dengan makna menerima kebiakan tetapi mushabihah berkeras mengambil makna literal sehingga mereka mengatakan bahwa allah tersenyum atau tertawa
7179089 hai iblis apakah yang menghalangi kamu sujud kepada yang telah ku ciptakan dengan kedua tangan ku
7179090 dari ja a dalam ayat itu bahwa itu adalah pergerakan imam ibn al jauzi juga tidak mungkin allah bergerak
7179091 allah taala tidak di suatu tempat gerakan istirahat dan duduk adalah
7179092 allah duduk di atas singgasana tetapi kita tidak tahu bagaimana
7179093 karena ayat ini berhubungan dengan sayidina ibrahim yang sedang pindah dari iraq ke negeri 2 syam
7179094 pada dasarnya mereka merendahkan kedudukan rasul mereka mengklaim bahwa rasul tidak tahu sifat 2 allah yang diturunkan kepadanya
7179095 allah istiwa yang pantas bagi nya yang bukan duduk punya yad yang pantas bagi nya yang bukan tangan dan punya wajh yang pantas bagi nya yang bukan muka
7179096 s iapa yang mensifati allah dengan sesuatu yang ditujukan kepada manusia telah melakukan penghinaan
7179097 seorang hamba akan mengucapkan sebuah kata yang dia tidak tahu merugikan akan menyebabkan dia masuk ke dalam neraka selama 70 musim
7179098 setiap kata yang diucapkan akan ditulis oleh dua malaikat raqib dan atid
7179099 maka sekiranya kamu melihat orang orang yang berdebat padanya ayat mutasyabihat mereka lah yang allah maksudkan maka jauhilah mereka
7179100 tidak sesat sesuatu kaum selepas memperoleh hidayah yang dikurniakan ke atas mereka melainkan mereka suka berdebat

7179111 shrink subscribed to the fine progressive notion that each day we have lived is a kind of possession and if we are its alert custodian brings us ever closer to knowledge of the slipperiest kind
7179112 we courted in the style preferred by the english alcoholically
7179113 i was young i was not much extracted from the innocence in which the benevolent but fraudulent world conspires to place us as children

7179119 in addition to a great selection of local produce and products we are planning a tomato tasting corn hole tournament corn roast and a kids korner for arts and crafts
7179120 we hope our shoppers will come for their local veggies and stroll around the market munching on some of the delicious food available while visiting with friends and listening to the music of local entertainers
7179121 the overall structure of the software and the ways in which that structure provides conceptual integrity for a system
7179122 the reason you post your nasty pictures of yourself on cl is because that crack between your legs smells like rotting fish and you havent seen action in years and now you are downright desperate seek professional help
7179123 when you look at the deficit that was reported on friday now as a former minister of finance i would say dont jump to conclusions but this is a worrisome trend
7179124 especially since in the analysis that the department of finance put out they said the reason for this two month deficit of some 500 million was erosion of the tax base and increased spending
7179125 well those are the two things that weve been warning the government about for a long time that they were running very close to the edge in terms of canadas fiscal situation
7179126 we have been solidly in the black for the last decade if now there are signs that the governments management style and ideology is about to push the country into the red once again there will be deep concern among canadians about that
7179127 in the actual free market a drop of that scale in projections would be a flaming disaster
7179128 as a nation we now look forward to holding the olympic games in london in 2012
7179129 the golden triumphs of the present british team can only serve as further inspiration to those who will be working hard over the next four years to make the london games a shining example of olympic success

7179137 were trying to get the real facts out about what president bush and john mccain have accomplished while in office
7179138 ah may i ask if you work for the mccain campaign
7179139 well thank you sir try to stay cool in this heat
7179140 welp them southerners will never understand real statistics or logical wording so ill just dumb it down for them
7179141 the ioc and the olympic games cannot force changes on sovereign nations or solve all the ills of the world
7179142 but we can and we do contribute to positive change through sport
7179143 the world learned more about china and china learned more about the rest of the world and together we shared the excitement and drama of the games
7179144 we are first and foremost an organisation devoted to sport but it is sport with a purpose
7179145 placing sport at the service of mankind and leveraging olympic values to promote better understanding between people nations and religions stands at the core of our mission
7179146 no white elephants have been built and the after games use is optimal
7179147 criticism is not going to be of any influence in my decision the organisation ioc was criticised but that is not a problem
7179148 it is clear that china has put the bar very high and it is going to be a challenge for london and all subsequent games
7179149 featuring the big picture in our modern times and future times to come
7179150 the biggest thing i noticed when i first got here was that theres people everywhere on main street and cars everywhere
7179151 i perceived butler as being a rural area but it has this great downtown area i really like how its laid out and the people well they seem so friendly
7179152 she brings some new energy and some new ideas to this new position
7179153 as the project unfolds we will see she has the talent to do what needs to be done i think its going to be a great great step for the city
7179154 i really like the idea of instead of tearing down all these buildings that are americas heritage that we can modernize them instead
7179155 we can update them inside but leave the character thats been there for years on the outside
7179156 the city has really been getting things down and i am anxious to see more goals set
7179157 i really like to see these places that have this great value historical value succeed we have downtowns and too many of them are being neglected we can reuse and prevent sprawl i think it is less wasteful
7179158 we would love to approve this as long as it meets the code
7179159 tonight is the best most productive conversations weve had in the past year
7179160 anderson identified numerous health and safety violations at the cabana bar which were in violation of the township code the international building code the international fire code and related health and safety codes
7179161 there are very few administrators he hasnt had a hand in bringing in
7179162 they are in a position where they want to implement the best practices to ensure that the good life is around for a long time in cranberry township
7179163 we dont have to be proactive but we have always thought that planning was important
7179164 a little big huh you trying to say im fat
7179165 i was very scared that i was going to jerk back and fall down
7179166 but it was really fun i just stayed focused aimed and shot the gun i was proud of everyone
7179167 working together to get things done sir thats probably been the most fun
7179168 its a great place to be at and learn a lot of stuff
7179169 they leave with a feeling of accomplishment theres a certain pride as they march onto the graduation field in front of their parents
7179170 when my father passed away i wanted to do something in his memory i thought with my philosophy with dealing with youth it would be better to make a contribution to the camp cadet program
7179171 its ironic that our road department travels right over a road they dont maintain
7179172 because of that proximity we feel we can do a more efficient job maintaining it
7179173 but they do have to travel 5 miles to fill one pothole the borough wanted to maintain the road to its standards and on its schedule
7179174 its an item that will cost the borough money we realize that
7179175 we feel that the taxpayers of franklin park and allegheny county will benefit

7179195 its been a very nice summer weve had guests who are corporate people involved in the outlet shops
7179196 washington county is the place to be in southwest pennsylvania
7179197 we are certainly becoming a destination point we are hoping people who come to the tanger outlets will stay for two days and visit other retail shops and tourist attractions tanger is the impetus to come but then there is so much more to see in washington county
7179198 tanger will truly benefit the community because it will draw from the entire tristate area
7179199 at washington crown center we have been getting people from west virginia and ohio for years

7179205 its hard to believe how much happens in one day here

7179207 i think it was the right move at the right time
7179208 its a destination spot where people will want to come to

7179218 en cuanto a la actitud y la entrega no tengo nada para decir porque dieron todo
7179219 nos cost seguir insistiendo con lo que est bamos haciendo en el primer tiempo ellos se encerraron todav a m s y no pudimos encontrar la conexi n para poder encontrar los espacios para atacar mejor

7179256 i knew i had to come out and play very physical jump start our team so i tried to come out and be aggressive and let our team know i was there ready to fight the fight for us
7179257 i was really thinking more about candace and sylvia those are the babies and just the fact i felt good about what i was able to do to contribute as a leader in helping them
7179258 sylvia did the running hook that i just showed her five days ago candace got her chance to get out there and cross people over and get to the basket and thats what its about passing the torch
7179259 weve only been together for one month but ive never seen a team so unselfish in a short period of time
7179260 thats what really scared me about coming back to play with a younger group i was i hope theyre not about themselves and thinking about points and all that and i could not have been more wrong about what these young ladies were about
7179261 it was all about team for every minute every second and thats what made us successful
7179262 we appreciate everything theyve done to get us this far but i can definitely see us taking it to the next level
7179263 i wore this uniform for the last time and i won my fourth gold medal
7179264 i am just not cut out to be a leader
7179265 so much of todays market is driven by distress unless interpreted in that context the stats give a rather distorted view of the overall market we know one third of the bay areas resales in july were homes fresh off foreclosure who knows how many more involved a desperate seller and a lender who accepted a short sale
7179266 meanwhile many would be sellers wait for a healthier market and many would be buyers especially those eyeing costlier coastal homes wait for signs of a market bottom or for the return of more favorable financing a clearer picture of the entire housing market will emerge once more of these foreclosures burn off and more lenders sellers and buyers get off the sidelines and back into the housing game

7179296 i was a secular humanist before i knew the term i have not believed in god since childhoods end i believe a belief in any deity is adolescent shameful and dangerous how would you feel surrounded by billions of human beings taking santa claus the easter bunny the tooth fairy and the stork seriously and capable of shaming maiming or murdering in their name i am embarrassed to live in a world retaining any faith in church prayer or a celestial creator i do not believe in heaven hell or a hereafter in angels demons ghosts goblins the devil vampires ghouls zombies witches warlocks ufos or other delusions and in very few mundane individuals politicians lawyers judges priests militarists censors and just plain people i respect the individuals right to abortion suicide and euthanasia i support birth control i wish to good that society were rid of smoking drinking and drugs
7179297 i never accepted religion so i had nothing to reject as such the history of christiansanity my own coinage of which i am proud is so brutal of mind emotions freedom progress science and all that i hold precious that by any standards of justice its leaders in almost any given period would be incarcerated for life or worse
7179298 if i were not an atheist i would believe in a god who would choose to save people on the basis of the totality of their lives and not the pattern of their words i think he would prefer an honest and righteous atheist to a tv preacher whose every word is god god god and whose every deed is foul foul foul
7179299 its a vacuous answer to say that god made the world is simply a more or less sophisticated way of saying that we dont understand how the universe originated a god in so far as it is anything is an admission of ignorance
7179300 what i no longer understand looking back on my life as a christian is the capacity to believe in something so outlandish as the existence of an almighty god much less one who created us all one by one cherishes our immortal souls intervenes on behalf of those who call upon his name and holds a place for his faithful in an everlasting paradise none of us has ever seen this being none of us has ever heard him except in the silence of our own heads none of us can produce a piece of evidence as large as a mustard seed that what we think of as god is anything more than a thought our scientists can see stars that have been dead for a billion years they can document microscopic bacteria that concluded their brief lives on earth eons ago but of god we have no trace except for the testimony of scribes writing of events neither they nor those around them ever witnessed and the faith of millions of people who have managed to convince themselves that he lives and reigns somewhere in the sky
7179301 the bible truly is one of the funniest books ive ever read it was written thousands of years ago when people were even dumber than they are today its absurd to believe in that shit
7179302 the kindly god who lovingly fashioned each and every one of us and sprinkled the sky with shining stars for our delight that god is like santa claus a myth of childhood not anything a sane undeluded adult could literally believe in that god must either be turned into a symbol for something less concrete or abandoned altogether
7179303 religion is regarded by the common people as true by the wise as false and by the rulers as useful
7179304 the world holds two classes of men intelligent men without religion and religious men without intelligence
7179305 youre basically killing each other to see whos got the better imaginary friend
7179306 and if there were a god i think it very unlikely that he would have such an uneasy vanity as to be offended by those who doubt his existence
7179307 is god willing to prevent evil but not able then he is not omnipotent is he able but not willing then he is malevolent is he both able and willing then whence cometh evil is he neither able nor willing then why call him god
7179308 religion does three things quite effectively divides people controls people deludes people
7179309 so you really think that god would plant a bunch of bones in the earth to test your faith either youre in denial or god has some serious self esteem issues
7179310 if we are going to teach creation science as an alternative to evolution then we should also teach the stork theory as an alternative to reproduction
7179311 the world is divided into armed camps ready to commit genocide just because we cant agree on whose fairy tales to believe
7179312 when one person suffers from a delusion it is called insanity when many people suffer from a delusion it is called religion
7179313 hey noodle i just cant take it anymore if it was mon it would be very easy to just get it over with call the atty and be done

7179347 these findings illustrate that nearly every family will be faced with the challenges of caring for a family member with some form of memory impairment
7179348 among the people aged 71 79 a sizeable number had cognitive impairment this is an age at which most people expect to have many productive years ahead
7179349 while the overall rate of progression to dementia is in line with findings from other studies the surprising finding here is that some subtypes of cognitive impairment without dementia progressed to dementia at much higher rates around 20 percent within one year
7179350 given how common cognitive impairment without dementia is physicians should be alert to this problem as they evaluate and treat the patient for other medical problems
7179351 this may have significant ramifications because it means that patients may not be able to accurately portray their symptoms and may not retain important information about their treatment
7179352 as the population ages and works longer understanding the extent of cognitive impairment in the older population is critically important
7179353 research is now beginning to suggest that interventions such as controlling hypertension and diabetes or perhaps cognitive training might help maintain or improve mental abilities with age as such interventions are tested and widely applied we should be able to track their impact through this type of research
7179354 with such a sizable number of americans with some form of cognitive impairment many of whom will get dementia its imperative to increase research funding that could lead to breakthroughs in alzheimers diagnosis prevention and treatment

7179359 tito puente is one of the most important musicians in any genre in the 20th century
7179360 i would put him up there with stravinsky leonard bernstein jimi hendrix etc etc not only was he an incredible percussionist but he was a fabulous composer and arranger i dont think people realize the depth of this mans musicianship
7179361 the drummer is usually in the back of a big band but what tito did with his orchestra is he put the percussion up front
7179362 the conga the bongo and himself on the timbales in the front now that served a dual purpose he could cue the orchestra and it also served as a symbol too that he was the leader of the band to the audience and he was the law as it was concerned
7179363 very funny story once he was warming up and he didnt know the microphone was on
7179364 and he started playing general quarters which means go to your battle stations just to warm up
7179365 i think titos juilliard training comes out in all of the things that he did
7179366 this is a great example of his knowledge of afro cuban rhythm and his knowledge of the orchestra
7179367 a promoter kind of gave him that name to sort of cross over into the so called anglo american market
7179368 well anyone that has seen him live can attest to the fact that he was the most exciting live performer on the planet
7179369 in afro cuban music weve inherited this concept of being possessed by the music on the dance floor

7179403 we issued a release saying that over 40 olympic athletes downloaded the album in an act of solidarity and thats what triggered it then everything got blocked
7179404 some in beijing did download and i think thats what spooked the chinese government
7179405 im delighted to welcome such a diverse group of member companies
7179406 the expansive nature of our membership continues to reflect the transformation of our industry and the broadening of abms footprint
7179407 in accordance to clauses of the 1876 treaty between the kalat state balochistan and the british empire the independence of kalat was announced by the then ruler of kalat mir ahmad yar khan in 1947 prior to the creation of pakistan
7179408 after the partition of india and the creation of the religious state of pakistan the newly independent baloch state came under tremendous pressure both from pakistan and the colonial authorities in india for a merger of the kalat with pakistan
7179409 ultimately when the pakistani government could not bend the baloch will to remain independent by sabre rattling the pakistan army invaded the kalat state to get the merger statement from the khan of kalat at gunpoint

7179438 all the feedback im getting is that harry will be fine
7179439 my cheeks hurt from smiling my face hurts from the chlorine my legs are sore from jumping up and down
7179440 im in pain and im tired but im so happy
7179441 i thought maybe i could have gotten the bronze or silver medal in my wildest dreams i got the gold medal
7179442 i think the seven golds already proved the strength of the chinese team
7179443 i didnt focus on the points but i knew i had a chance to get the gold
7179444 maybe because i was too eager to have a good performance that last round i made some small mistakes
7179445 i didnt feel that much pressure from the chinese i didnt feel any pressure from anybody
7179446 i was not going to let anything external affect how i was feeling only whats in your mind can affect how you dive
7179447 im happy i was able to pull myself together for the bronze medal
7179448 i went into the competition just wanting to do six good dives
7179449 i knew if i dived well the results would look after themselves look where i am
7179450 its a blessing for me to be out on this floor now participating in my fourth olympics and walking away with a fourth gold medal
7179451 weve said from day one that top to bottom we are a deep team
7179452 we just send wave after wave of players at you
7179453 we werent going to be the team to let lisa lose
7179454 you cant shoot less than 40 percent and expect to win gold medals
7179455 i really enjoy being receivers coach here because offensively everything centers around the passing game
7179456 this helps me professionally as far as continually learning offense
7179457 ideally id like to be a coordinator and id like to have a gamut to go and choose from
7179458 you can get caught up in the aura of whats happening and by the time you catch up to the game its too late
7179459 its like going to texas a amp m and watching all the pageantry
7179460 instead of giving big speeches at big stadiums he needs to give straight up 10 word answers to people at wal mart about how he would improve their lives
7179461 serve as a blank screen on which people of vastly different political stripes project their own views
7179462 as such i am bound to disappoint some if not all of them
7179463 i keep telling people that the dean campaign was like the wright brothers and obama was apollo 11
7179464 these guys skipped mercury and gemini they take a guy and they land him safely in the white house the clinton campaign says no 2004 was some kind of fad we have do it a little bit so well look cool but thats it well put terry mcauliffe in charge and work from the top down
7179465 clinton will be the last campaign run from the top down where you think youve got it all figured out
7179466 when you run it from the bottom you hear things and you couldnt help but understand that the quest for change was on fire out there how did they miss it
7179467 she could have started the whole thing off 5 million women willing to take on american politics women ready to protect the planet women ready to oppose the war instead she ran as a quintessential status quo establishment candidate it made no sense that they could miss that
7179468 i want to be on the side of the people on the side of the spirit of history
7179469 we focused on what was important that was delegates we targeted the delegates in the same way that were going after the electoral votes now its the same strategy
7179470 lets look at colorado well have 16 offices in colorado not five not three not two 16 western slope northern colorado eastern slope southern colorado metro denver the whole thing its the same in every state were targeting
7179471 he campaigns on reforming a broken political process yet he has always played politics by the rules as they exist not as he would like them to exist he runs as an outsider but he has succeeded by mastering the inside game
7179472 very methodical going down the field five yards five more yards five more yards very methodical very calculating very scientific very steady
7179473 they said this day would never come they said our sights were set too high
7179474 the question hasnt been asked that much here you have the first african american with a serious opportunity but were focusing not on his race but on the qualities of leadership he would bring to this country
7179475 this is just a first step there are a lot of steps to go
7179476 in fact obamas democratic primary victory is so remarkable that the real danger is in understating just how stunning and unexpected it all was
7179477 a lot of people in the comedy world were thrown back on their heels for a while that it was too hot and radioactive to handle that whole thing after 9 11 where you couldnt criticize those guys or make fun of them i didnt have a problem going after these guys all along
7179478 we had ups and we had downs just wanted to end on a high moment
7179479 it doesnt make up for it but its a start to the healing process
7179480 we won more medals it just didnt come from where everyone else thought it should come
7179481 a lot of things happened in this olympics that we werent expecting
7179482 but well use that to build on i know next year at the world championships its going to be different
7179483 the boys ran a good race they ran a tough race bekele took charge
7179484 they wanted to end it with a good dose of good ol american apple pie
7179485 my medal count goal is that at the end of the day when 91 000 people leave that stadium
7179486 theyve heard our national anthem so many times that theyre humming it on their way out the door
7179487 honestly i was hoping for hillary clinton but thats not to be
7179488 i dont know how he would be different from hillary
7179489 he brings a comfort level that hillary would bring its not a disappointing choice its an exciting choice
7179490 it alienates people who supported hillary because one of the reasons stated for not choosing her is shes a washington insider and then he picks someone whos been in washington for 35 years
7179491 im not of the opinion that hillary clinton was seeking the vice presidency to begin with
7179492 the way the campaign was run with everything that was said it wouldnt have been good for the ticket
7179493 because im certain that hes going to use her in some manner in his administration
7179494 where we play every start matters whether its april or september
7179495 you dont put added pressure on yourself because of the time were in right now the pressures there from day 1 you get used to it its something you thrive on its something i personally like to pitch with that pressure on your shoulders knowing you have to go out and perform
7179496 i think as long as youre in shape you should be fine
7179497 i pride myself on my work ethic working hard and being strong i think i can withstand the workload ive been feeling fine and dont think it has anything to do with the fatigue the part of the season were in today was one of those days i left the ball up and they were whacking it theres nothing you can do about it
7179498 joe and i have been friends for many many years and we know each other very well and so i think hes made a very wise selection
7179499 have to figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
7179500 i know that joe will campaign well for senator obama and so i think hes going to be very formidable
7179501 obviously joe and i have been on different philosophical sides but we have been i consider him a good friend and good man
7179502 it will be more difficult now senator mccain to criticize barack obamas foreign policy credentials when someone like joe biden is on the ticket a very experienced and respected voice on capitol hill in these matters
7179503 well ive always respected joe biden but i disagreed with him from the time he voted against the first gulf war to his position where he said you had to break iraq up into three different counties
7179504 i never agreed with that but i appreciate very much his dedication to trying to solve this genocide thats going in darfur and other things that joe biden has done but we really have different approaches to many national security issues i look forward to whoever my running mate will be having a respectful debate with him on that as well
7179505 were probably being overly cautious but when it comes to somebodys arm and their future i think we need to do that
7179506 hes actually been pretty good about it he wants to pitch but i told him were looking out for his best interest and i think he understands that
7179507 were going about this the right way so i have to be supportive of it
7179508 it definitely doesnt help you to get into a deep state of rem though
7179509 were doing everything in our power to make sure this guy is able to go out and pitch like he can pitch
7179510 its really frustrating because i want to help and i cant
7179511 houseonomics why owning a home is still a great los angeles times
7179512 so youre probably talking about 20 percent of the new project and relative to the rest of the roading network its sort of less than 2 or 3 percent
7179513 it was much better than last year but im not happy the day was developing well it looked very much like nothing was going to happen
7179514 there are people out there who want trouble and they turn up to see it happen and to make it happen and its just unfortunate they chose a student area to do that
7179515 the incident was what we would class as disorder and certainly wasnt anywhere near the scale that we had last year
7179516 its probably a little bit more than an average night for dunedin but not a great many more bearing in mind we had 100 staff working as well
7179517 arise and take our stand for freedom as in the olden time
7179518 we work so hard for candidates this is our one time to get together and have some fun
7179519 when you are committed to reducing your impact on the environment tap water is the smart alternative to bottled water and daytons water quality makes it an easy choice
7179520 water is a driver to the health and vitality of any community dayton is blessed with an abundance
7179521 daytons drinking water consistently meets state and federal water quality standards and is tested 24 hours per day for purity
7179522 i found out many years later that the risk was greater with my special type of tumor for it to travel to the other side
7179523 if it did the tumor would mirror itself in the left breast
7179524 we are finding as breast surgeons that we now have been able to identify all different factors people have that tell us that lady is at an increased risk level for developing breast cancer
7179525 we look at such things as first degree relatives with breast cancer or if theres any genetic mutations
7179526 hopefully it will take away some of the fear factor and erase some of the concerns people have about their image
7179527 when they see a beautiful star having this done hopefully it will cause other ladies to really evaluate the advice they might be receiving
7179528 i felt like a part of me was being taken away part of my womanhood and femininity so to speak
7179529 but at the same time im grateful they were able to catch it when they did because otherwise i might not be here talking today
7179530 i looked at him and the feeling i had was that i was looking at the future
7179531 she clinton has told us to put our full support behind senator obama and begin to move on
7179532 i dont think the democratic party needs a floor fight
7179533 i think the fact that our governor showed that he had juice in the clinton campaign i think hell be courted to make sure that same juice will be delivered for obama
7179534 i was among the grassroots group out of columbus that helped get barack on the ballot to be able to go to the convention is like just wow
7179535 this is the first time i think ive really wanted to be a delegate because i knew this was going to be a historic moment and i wanted to be part of that history
7179536 under the proposed amendment the meeting can be canceled in advance
7179537 the effectual fervant prayer of a righteous man availeth much
7179538 hmm i know lets make all laurens major essays due in the first full month of semester 2 so that the following 2 months she only has 2 minor ones ha lets see her try to do that
7179539 the doctor sent her to a specialist and wanted her to have two mris
7179540 well that costs 5 000 and i dont have the money for it so here we are shes probably not going to get it unless we get medicaid
7179541 bila kursi pks di dpr lebih dari 20 persen pada pemilu 2009 nanti partai akan mencalonkan kader terbaiknya sebagai calon presiden ri mendatang
7179542 la ni tak payah ada hakim semua main sumpah saja kalau macam tu pi mencuri bunuh orang balik mai sumpah imam pulak kena pakai imam umno
7179543 id like to play against the team of all stars superstar basketball put together i believe theyre called team play
7179544 how semi pro inc has that many players and is playing team ball is beyond my comprehension
7179545 we cant play scared out there and i know my teammates were playing scared last week
7179546 we need to step it up and stop playing scared otherwise we lost already
7179547 in the last three quarters of this year under the leadership of our president pat salvo our profits have fallen considerably thus we should ask for her resignation in return for a generous severance package in pats place we should appoint rosa winnings rosa is currently president of starlight jewelry a company whose profits have increased dramatically over the past several years although we will have to pay rosa twice the salary that pat has been receiving it will be well worth it because we can soon expect our profits to increase considerably
7179548 i was under pressure to get off the next issue of the magazine and struggling with layout sheets over my desk when a stranger barged in
7179549 your magazines shit but i can see youre trying so ive come along to help
7179550 then you had better put your pictures where your mouth is because i dont know you or care to show me what you have to offer
7179551 ok im convinced you do have something to teach me who are you
7179552 i do not care if you are jesus christ himself an angel from heaven or the devil himself i do not need to ask you if i can give my wife lisa money
7179553 submit yourselves therefore to god resist the devil and he will flee from you
7179554 if i regard iniquity in my heart the lord will not hear me
7179555 you are a man and not a god though you set your heart as the heart of a god
7179556 there are three that bear witness in heaven the father the word john 1 1 14 and the holy spirit and these three are one
7179557 whoever transgresses and does not abide in the doctrine of christ does not have god
7179558 omdat we een vrij kleine organisatie zijn hebben we besloten om onze pijlen te richten op n evenement zodat we dit kwalitatief op een nog hoger niveau kunen krijgen ik sluit niet uit dat wanneer ons team in de toekomst groter wordt we opnieuw een rallysprint zullen uitschrijven maar voor 2006 in ieder geval niet
7179559 ik heb echt maandenlang moeten wachten op mijn centen terwijl ik er alles voor doe om de a1 goed te promoten
7179560 ga maar na k de laatste tijd ik was op de masters in zandvoort in assen in rotterdam allemaal promotie voor de a1 terwijl er nooit op tijd betaald werd pas vanmiddag zijn de laatste financi le zaken geregeld die nog met vorig seizoen te maken hadden het enige dat we geregeld wilden zien is dat we een garantie kregen voor de tijdige uitbetaling van mijn salaris en dat wilden ze niet geven
7179561 ik weet ook dat er veel fans naar zandvoort komen om mij te zien ik besef dat ze zwaar teleurgesteld zijn daarom vind ik het belangrijk dat ze de ware reden achter mijn besluit nu kennen
7179562 luego del cierre iniciaremos el proceso de revisi n e impugnaci n del padr n electoral si bien el registro es una actividad que se realiza todos los d as del a o la ley obliga a cerrar el padr n electoral 90 d as antes del pr ximo proceso a fin de definir el n mero de electores h biles para ejercer el derecho al sufragio
7179563 thats not true i know plenty of interracial couples why at my own church theres this guy who married a japanese woman
7179564 wait a minute i think youve demonstrated my point every single one of the examples youve given involves a white man and an asian woman as i said though its the asian men who have difficulty in finding a mate
7179565 well im sure that there are plenty of asian men who have no trouble either
7179566 gew hnt euch an so was wir sind ein linkes college
7179567 tony just made the observation in spring practice that defensive tackle gus mustakas makes every play and that defensive tackle mick williams was unblockable
7179568 what do we have to do to counter this if weve got nothing but 6 6 325 guys up front how are we going to match up
7179569 when we got here two years ago this was a very fat unfit football team
7179570 joe thomas was 320 pounds and had 30 percent body fat really a third of his body was fat fat does not produce force now hes under 295 and his body fat is 23 percent on its way to 21 or 22
7179571 ive never been one of those bigger is better guys my concern is for the general overall health of the athlete i know terrell davis very well and im sure he didnt mind winning a super bowl behind an offensive line that had no 300 pounders
7179572 i get letters from people telling me my son is 6 6 335
7179573 theyre wondering if they should get him up to 340 i write back and tell them just let him play im not looking for 340 im looking for someone who can move his feet who can change direction we had mark stepnoski when we were in dallas a very successful player who weighed 268 pounds in our situation here with who we play if you cant move your feet youre going to get embarrassed
7179574 with so many spread offenses you have to be able to make plays in space
7179575 this is something that takes more skill than meets the eye
7179576 hopefully they can discover something off the bowling green game and start building on it well wait and see but the guys have worked extremely hard
7179577 you can be tall you can be short you can be plus size you can be transgender you dont have to be what the modeling industry says you have to be that was one of tyras original missions
7179578 the goal for each of the parties at these conventions is to create a huge propaganda moment
7179579 that demonstrates the values they represent and the leadership qualities of their candidates
7179580 the extra points added by the convention comprise the bounce and size matters
7179581 major slippage is bound to occur think 18 wheeler highway wreck squared
7179582 the two f words for democrats will be family and flag
7179583 obama has to erase any doubts about his religion his values his readiness and his patriotism and he has to show that the obamas are the ultimate american family
7179584 there has never been an election cycle like this one its literally light years from what it was four years ago and that has to do with the relentless scrutiny of the internet
7179585 today these conventions involve so many little nuanced things and everything every word that is uttered can be interpreted in myriad ways its just relentless
7179586 issues of central concern to the family and the home
7179587 a return to the clinton years and the clinton values
7179588 the republicans are united at the moment and democrats still have a lingering hillary hangover
7179589 fire up their supporters to be for obama then it will unite the party and hell get that bump
7179590 its their job to inspire the people that were supporting hillary to rally behind barack then obama has to close the deal with the rest of the country
7179591 the goal is coming out of denver with a strong statement that democrats are unified i dont think anybody is taking anything for granted here
7179592 every single day we have to earn the confidence and trust of americans we have to be out there and connected in terms of what they need in solutions
7179593 we will need to come out united and energized and moving forward for barack obama
7179594 that we put on a show that connects with the american people and moves folks who havent really been paying attention
7179595 mark me down as one who says not being around a long time aint a bad thing there has to be change there has to be disruption
7179596 you know i admire disrupters our founders were disrupters martin luther king was a disrupter rosa parks was a disrupter barack obama will be an agent of change and the rest of us have to help with that disruption
7179597 i had to push the pace to tire the other runners
7179598 i had to push the pace because my body gets tired in the heat when i slow down
7179599 it was hot but to run 2 06 32 in this is incredible i think that just shows hes a very young guy and hes going to be an incredible marathoner
7179600 mentally its tough to convince yourself that its possible for those guys to come back
7179601 i was able to pull away because i had enough power and speed to overcome it
7179602 i knew if i kept up that 2 06 pace that i wouldnt be finishing probably
7179603 i like my spotter hes a good guy but man this is ridiculous
7179604 we took a bunch of cars out for no reason i was just running along heard clear clear clear and went up and there was someone still there we just took out a bunch of cars for no reason and ourselves
7179605 we believe that bringing the gigante stores into the el super family will provide synergies that will benefit both the company and the consumers in southern california
7179606 everything is built around latino strategies for survival and food preferences and these stores are fulfilling that
7179607 when youre buying for a family of five or six a major expenditure of the week goes there so a place that feels familiar is clean and has good bargains it just works for them
7179608 id be worried about the relevance of vons and albertsons
7179609 its a latino store for latinos thats why it works
7179610 ive always liked this place great prices and i like the fresh bakery
7179611 for strategic financial reasons we chose to sell these stores
7179612 were not as big as we used to be so were trying to promote in mexico with partnerships like the one we have with radio shack
7179613 they underestimated the other independent retailers that were here already and the relationships they have with the community
7179614 its a dogfight out there they could have been more aggressive
7179615 herb is the healing of a nation alcohol is the destruction
7179616 i just left it up a little being the hitter that he is its never really going to work out in my favor
7179617 were we not senators id rip your goddamn adams apple out
7179618 i refuse to believe the majority of people believe this malarkey
7179619 okay charlie this is what my mother what do you think of that
7179620 the illusion could be applied to novel displays that change their appearance depending on sound which may be of use in advertising or providing an eye catching multisensory warning or alert in safety critical applications it may also eventually be useful in detecting and diagnosing subtle perceptual differences thought to be characteristic of certain clinical conditions such as dyslexia and autistic spectrum
7179621 i believe that this novel signaling behavior could indicate the owls current reproductive status to potential intruders such as other territorial owls or non breeding floaters
7179622 such marking behavior may have been overlooked in birds and i hope that our story will represent the beginning of new and stimulating explorations on other questions and mechanisms in territoriality and social communication
7179623 feces may represent an ideal substance for marking because it has a minimal energetic cost to the signaler and can continue to indicate possession of a territory when the owner is occupied in activities other than territorial defense
7179624 to obtain stronger evidence on the intriguing idea that eagle owls use feces and prey feathers to signal current reproduction
7179625 we will need to perform further experimental studies and behavioral observations that examine whether feces and feathers provoke specific behavioral reactions and what functional significance these behavioral reactions have
7179626 owls responded so rapidly to the removal of their faecal marks that during the night after the spraying that they came back to defecate not only on the same posts but precisely on the painted stretches
7179627 in the world that i study everybodys trying to kill the biofilm
7179628 but theres not a concrete answer for that and thats why you need to understand methods
7179629 thats why we can be one of the few labs in the world that can focus on methods development
7179630 every time a person buys a product with an epa approved efficacy claim such as kills 99 percent of bacteria the public trusts the validity of the process used to prove that claim
7179631 our goal is to grow bacteria in a way thats relevant to how the bacteria exist where the product is used
7179632 that way we can have more confidence in the products actual effectiveness and so can the public
7179633 so many results depend on the process a person uses
7179634 to have only one way to grow a biofilm isnt going to cut it
7179635 this technique is really the first time that cancer surgeons can see structures that are otherwise invisible providing true image guided surgery
7179636 if were able to see cancer we have a chance of curing it
7179637 the system has no moving parts uses leds instead of lasers for excitation makes no contact with the patient and is sterile
7179638 the future of the technology now is really in the chemistry
7179639 we have to develop agents for specific tumors nerves or blood vessels were trying to visualize
7179640 instead of needing relaxation measurements that require using neutron scattering a national facility with limited time availability we have developed a widely accessible solution in the form of readily available steady state fluorescence measurements
7179641 this will allow pharmaceutical companies to adopt the new metrology weve developed
7179642 our results appear to demonstrate that vigabatrin induced satiety in these animals
7179643 given the growing obesity epidemic we felt that examining vigabatrins therapeutic efficacy for obesity was particularly relevant
7179644 the fact that these results occurred in genetically obese animals offers hope that this drug could potentially treat severe obesity
7179645 this would appear to be true even if the obesity results from binge eating as this disorder is characterized by eating patterns that are similar to drug taking patterns in those with cocaine dependency
7179646 i was told it was not a problem the person even laughed when i asked to reserve the spot and said something to the extent of just come on up and grab a space
7179647 it is not a college or a university its a high school and its supported by taxpayer dollars it is an arm or an instrumentality of the government because it is provided by the government for the use of its citizens
7179648 its not part of the bleachers it is a press box its for the use of media so that the media can transmit reports about the athletic events that take place there to citizens who otherwise cant attend but may be interested in those athletic events the reporter is a surrogate for the people
7179649 personal slight toward me and the bhc especially since other regional writers and media members were allowed in the box
7179650 ras proteins exist in all cells anchored to the inside of the cell membrane where they regulate cell growth and cell division the enzyme we are studying helps ras proteins get anchored to the cell membrane by blocking this enzyme we were able to inhibit the binding of ras proteins to cell membranes and greatly improve the disease symptoms in mice with blood cancer
7179651 when we inhibited the production of the enzyme the development of blood cancer declined and the uncontrolled growth of bone marrow cells was blocked another discovery was that normal bone marrow cells were not significantly affected by the icmt enzyme the means that future drugs for inhibiting icmt could specifically target the pathogenic cells and leave normal cells intact a drub that blocks this enzyme could be an effective future cancer treatment
7179652 you can support us or leave to our fate but if they come for us and all hope is gone we will turn the middle east into a radioactive wasteland until the end of time
7179653 regarding the depiction of nob hill and the nhba as some nefarious organization out to squeeze the last cent out of albuquerque and to completely disrupt the tranquility of life in the neighborhood i would invite you to come and actually speak to some of us
7179654 hey were not as horrible as some of you think
7179655 in case you missed it this week there was a tragedy in kansas ten thousand people died an entire town destroyed
7179656 over the last 15 months weve traveled to every corner of the united states ive now been in 57 states i think one left to go
7179657 there was something stirring across the country because of what happened in selma alabama because some folks are willing to march across a bridge so they got together and barack obama jr was born
7179658 we only have a certain number of them and if they are all in iraq then its harder for us to use them in afghanistan
7179659 ive made it clear for years that the threat from iran is grave
7179660 at what point does a baby get human rights in your view
7179661 well uh you know i think that whether youre looking at it from a theological perspective or uh a scientific perspective uh answering that question with specificity uh you know is is uh above my pay grade
7179662 i am absolutely certain that generations from now we will be able to look back and tell our children that this was the moment when we began to provide care for the sick and good jobs to the jobless
7179663 death conceals everything but truth and strips a man of everything but genius and virtue
7179664 you cant change america when you know your first four years as president will look exactly like the last eight years of george bushs presidency
7179665 hardened professionals and their primary strength lies in their being completely unconflicted
7179666 the primary difference is that on the level of criticizing other blogs and bloggers they can actually do some damage
7179667 excessive speculation in any commodity under contrasts of sale of such commodities for future deliver causing sudden or unreasonable fluctuations or unwarranted changes in the prices of such commodity is an undue and unnecessary burden on interstate commerce in such commodity
7179668 as the commission finds are necessary to diminish eliminate or prevent such burden
7179669 you want people to think well of you dont you
7179670 but i think my booty is admirable too yeah when im visiting italy i get back to my familys house after a walk and my booty is ebony and blue from all the pinches studs give me in the street when i turn around to yell at em they smile and try to get my phone number or ask me to have a swallow
7179671 american children are watching the olympics and waking up tired the next morning

7179677 come unto me all ye that labor and are heavy laden
7179678 reading is the careful study of the scriptures concentrations of ones powers on it meditation is the busy application of the mind to seek with the help of ones own reason for knowledge of hidden truth prayer is the hearts devoted turning to god to drive away evil and obtain what is good contemplation is when the mind is in some sort lifted to god and held above itself so that it tastes the joys of everlasting sweetness
7179679 reading seeks for sweetness of a blessed life meditation perceives it prayer asks for it contemplation tastes it reading as it were puts food whole into the mouth meditation chews it and breaks it up prayer extracts its flavour contemplation is the sweetness itself which gladdens and refreshes
7179680 couldnt sleep so i thought id make some hot chocolate
7179681 i went to check on hermione and then i came down here
7179682 i think she may be keeping something from me i cant put my finger on it but i feel like shes not telling me something important
7179683 tomorrow morning knowing hermione shes putting on a brave face but something is really hurting her on the inside
7179684 im afraid ginny even though the war is over and v voldemort is gone im still afraid that im going to lose her
7179685 dont wait to ask her ron waiting is a horrible thing to undergo
7179686 i tried i tried to keep busy running the da fighting back against the carrows i tried to always keep busy so that i wouldnt have to face the fact that i was waiting for something that might never come
7179687 even detention was a welcome reprieve you always have to be on your toes in the forest the pain from the cruciatus curse keeps your mind off everything else but when youre all alone and you have nothing to do its heart breaking to just wait wait for the person you love most in the world and know that he may never come home
7179688 and then right after you were briefly reunited the next time you see him is dead at the feet of the darkest wizard of all time
7179689 like sometimes her eyes will be unfocused and she wont hear what youre saying but she always shakes herself out of it then other times shell shiver for no reason or grip my hand so hard that its like shes trying to crush my bones into dust plus she has really dark circles under her eyes
7179690 and yesterday at the funeral when she heard about andromedas and narcissas fight her eye went all twitchy
7179691 youre a lot more attuned to people than everyone gives you credit for ron how come you never show that side to anyone
7179692 you knew harry had broken up with me before anyone else
7179693 you were both miserable and wouldnt go near the other one
7179694 how about when i almost drowned in the creek when i was five you were nowhere near me then
7179695 when we were heading back to the house i realized you werent with us so i made bill come back with me to look for you
7179696 how did you know first surely percy the twins or even mum and dad should have known first they slept closer to me you were all the way up in the attic the only way you could have known was that you were more in tune with me than all of them admit it you know im right
7179697 that people will think that im some sort of freak
7179698 youve been given a gift ron the ability to sense when things are wrong with the people you love who knows how many times youve helped someone because of it embrace it its a wonderful gift to possess
7179699 youre so bloody stubborn that you can convince anyone of anything
7179700 why didnt you try to convince harry to take you with us
7179701 because as much as i hate to say this i would have been a liability
7179702 yeah first of all i was underage which meant i was still under the trace and would not have been to perform magic without tom and his cronies knowing about it i knew the basics of duelling but none of the advanced stuff and i would have been a distraction to harry lets face it
7179703 it wouldve brassed a lot of people off if we lost the war because our saviour was too busy snogging his girlfriend
7179704 and imagining you and hermione together is just a pleasant stroll in the park for me
7179705 the family that dear octopus from whose tentacles we never quite escape nor in our inmost hearts ever quite wish to

7179728 the limited release and small production budget works in the favour of phoonk
7179729 phoonk has taken an almost 90 opening at the box office this black magic film is definitely going to be the surprise hit of the year
7179730 initial reports from critics have been encouraging and word of mouth is excellent says siddharth roy kapoor of utv producer of the film
7179731 it definitely is a very important factor in todays time a lot of credit goes to the marketing and distribution strategy adopted by the producers of phoonk
7179732 i just stayed in the round after a little bit of a rough start
7179733 he hits the ball far but he also has a good pure short game
7179734 he can shoot even par he just has a great swing and hes a good putter with a good short game its a pleasure to watch him play
7179735 im pretty straight i try not to hit the ball all over the golf course and usually dont if im playing well i hit a lot of fairways and greens in regulation i guess
7179736 i think part of his good playing is that hes accustomed to the stress
7179737 i would like to compete in the wpial individual and team finals
7179738 it would be great to see the team do well at cedarboork site of the wpial finals individually to do well at wpial finals and make it to states again this year

7179748 it will be more difficult now senator mccain to criticize barack obamas foreign policy credentials when someone like joe biden is on the ticket a very experienced and respected voice on capitol hill in these matters
7179749 well ive always respected joe biden but i disagreed with him from the time he voted against the first gulf war to his position where he said you had to break iraq up into three different counties
7179750 i never agreed with that but i appreciate very much his dedication to trying to solve this genocide thats going in darfur and other things that joe biden has done but we really have different approaches to many national security issues i look forward to whoever my running mate will be having a respectful debate with him on that as well
7179751 when i did i couldnt put them away it was just one of those days you have them every now and then
7179752 any time you can score early against a guy like that obviously it makes the game a little easier for the team
7179753 i was really fedup and just wanted to go out of this house
7179754 i dont make any judgments and i wont say anything because we belong to different parties if i do say then it will be made into a political issue

7179770 women who go through menopause naturally may continue to produce some hormones that are beneficial for sexual response whereas women whose ovaries are removed are not producing these reproductive hormones
7179771 in addition naturally menopausal women have more time to adjust physically to the hormonal changes and may also be expecting changes in their sexual response that reduces their distress about their low sexual desire
7179772 i desired porn physically but in my heart i knew it wasnt what i wanted to do
7179773 i wasted huge tracks of time on porn and fell behind in my work i was spending three to four hours a day on something that had no benefit to me as far as becoming a better person gaining skills understanding the world better or enhancing my relationships with other people
7179774 after a while internet porn took on a life of its own rather than me using it it was controlling me i lost the power to say no
7179775 porn felt good in the moment but then it just took me down
7179776 now that ive stopped using porn i feel better about myself as a human being im able to be more present and connected with other people ive stopped sexually objectifying everyone for the first time in my life i feel here and sexually healthy
7179777 the effect of diabetes on womens sexual function is complex the most consistent finding is a correlation between sexual dysfunction and depression

7179782 the best sex of your life starts in your heart not in your head or between your legs
7179783 most people have a fear of intimacy yet at the same time are terrified of being alone their solution is to form a fantasy bond an illusion of connection and closeness that allows them to maintain emotional distance while relieving loneliness destructive fantasy bonds exist in a large majority of couple relationships the process of forming a fantasy bond greatly reduces the possibility of achieving a successful personal relationship
7179784 we love each other but sex has disappeared from our lives
7179785 he keeps asking me when im coming by the shop to work with him
7179786 ive never thought of myself as a loving soft woman and thats exactly what i started to give up when our relationship became public i changed my actions so i wouldnt have to see myself that way again the way luke saw me in my mind i created a monster out of luke i began to seen him as mean and demanding i found faults wherever i could lukes natural feelings for me made me feel differently about myself made me feel that i was lovable and i couldnt live with that identity so i twisted everything to do away with that feeling about myself and i hurt luke so much in the process

7179816 the days of making an easy sale on ebay us are over
7179817 there is little time left to get a solid negotiating text on the table clearly the clock is ticking
7179818 people in a burning house cannot afford to lose time in an argument
7179819 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
7179820 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
7179821 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
7179822 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
7179823 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
7179824 in most cases the charger uses no more than 6 10 more energy than conventional chargers we are confident that the industry will agree that a small increase in electrical power consumption is a small price to pay for the typically incredible increases in battery capacity not to mention the significant savings because of lower battery replacement costs
7179825 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
7179826 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
7179827 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
7179828 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
7179829 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
7179830 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
7179831 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
7179832 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
7179833 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
7179834 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
7179835 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
7179836 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
7179837 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
7179838 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
7179839 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
7179840 who are open to doing something on the production side
7179841 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
7179842 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
7179843 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
7179844 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
7179845 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
7179846 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
7179847 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
7179848 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
7179849 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
7179850 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
7179851 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
7179852 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
7179853 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
7179854 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
7179855 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
7179856 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
7179857 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
7179858 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
7179859 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
7179860 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
7179861 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
7179862 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
7179863 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
7179864 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
7179865 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
7179866 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
7179867 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
7179868 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
7179869 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
7179870 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
7179871 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
7179872 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
7179873 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
7179874 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
7179875 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
7179876 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
7179877 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
7179878 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
7179879 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
7179880 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
7179881 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
7179882 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
7179883 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
7179884 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
7179885 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
7179886 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
7179887 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
7179888 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
7179889 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
7179890 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
7179891 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
7179892 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
7179893 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
7179894 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
7179895 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
7179896 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
7179897 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
7179898 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
7179899 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
7179900 the timing seemed right because were in these times where people dont necessarily know if their jobs going to be there tomorrow and when a lot of people dont necessarily like their jobs they have now
7179901 why dont you go out there and revisit those kinds of jobs that actually made america great those great working class blue collar jobs thats what these are it was great to get these contestants out of that cubicle that conceptual life were in and get out there and get some real raw experience in a place with high stakes and high rewards

7179988 defensively after we looked at it in detail we have a lot of improvement to make
7179989 were better than that its as simple as that theres no need for panic or anything like that but thats not acceptable and well play better defense in the future
7179990 we havent decided exactly how much were going to play our guys in this last game were going to do whatever we need to do to get ready for the colts so that may be a little bit more at practice than what we normally do
7179991 we havent ever done that and we dont plan on doing that right now thats not the answer we made some mistakes thursday night i wouldnt say that it was all tackling
7179992 we had some missed tackles we made mistakes we didnt play as hard as we need to from time to time we got in position to make some plays and we didnt
7179993 a lot of us are trying to pace ourselves and thats myself too
7179994 its difficult the older you get to go out in a game and know that none of this stuff matters but you still have to play full speed you still have to go hard now its up to us i think we need to turn up the pace a little more change our attitude a little more but im not going to panic i think our guys are capable of doing a great job
7179995 there was a lot at stake out there thursday we wanted to come out and show what type of defense were going to be for the season if we play like that obviously were going to be a pretty bad defense its going to be a replay of how we were last year 28th 29th 30th in the league
7179996 we talk about it but talking about it and doing it are two different things
7179997 we wanted to come out and show the people that we can be a dominant defense everyone just has to look in the mirror see what type of player they want to be see what type of defense we want to be and go from there because if we play like we did thursday night were not going to win many football games
