5320008 if i was doing this just for myself i might have chosen a different course but i put pakistan first as always
5320009 even if i beat this impeachment relations between the presidency and the government can never be fixed pillars of the state parliament and the judiciary would be harmed and god forbid the army might have been dragged in
5320010 no charge sheet can stand against me because i never did anything for myself whatever i did i put pakistan first
5320011 when i took over nine years ago this country was on the verge of being declared a terrorist state on the verge of becoming a failed state
5320012 the challenges of the last nine years have been greater than any in pakistans history yet have i met those challenges
5320013 this is the first time in pakistans political history where you have the people winning against establishment institutions
5320014 thats not an issue on the table and i just want to keep our focus on what we must do with the democratic government of pakistan

5320022 i am born into a family that believes in reincarnation
5320023 and moreover in my family there was said to be a case of reincarnation i am aware that there may be some conscious or unconscious bias in me
5320024 so that my personal belief my personal experience may not infringe on my scientific pursuit i assume the role of a critic when i study these cases not a believer
5320025 what they call a gimlet is just some lime or lemon juice and gin with a dash of sugar and bitters a real gimlet is half gin and half roses lime juice and nothing else it beats martinis hollow

5320047 all of the films we have chosen to support will bring something really special to the independent film industry and represent the great filmmaking talent that is out there right now
5320048 indiepix studios plans on premiering all of these titles during the 2009 world festival circuit with the intent on selling all of their rights to leading distributors this will enable us to continue investing in future projects out there that deserve to be made our goal is to get as many eyes on these films in as many markets and platforms as possible the fact that we have our own distribution entity indiepix films that we can use in conjunction with other distribution companies to help support the life of our films is an important additional factor for these titles
5320049 indiepix studios is a very important development for the independent film industry and this new release slate really offers encouragement to an industry that is currently experiencing challenging times i am extremely excited to be involved in such a forward thinking company and i strongly believe that our new production slate will offer a really important boost for all of the individual filmmakers and the industry as a whole we look forward to seeing each of the projects progress

5320053 as far as the pilots and the west gulf proposal all i can say at this time is theres no need for pilots to take any action on the proposal and we have no further comment
5320054 the pilots showed great flexibility and initiative to handle unique traffic needs
5320055 it is very gratifying to me that west gulf was proactive in trying to keep rates competitive and fair

5320070 but at the moment he still seems to be enjoying himself although one day maybe
5320071 nothing became available in the summer that i wanted a go at or that wanted me is the main thing
5320072 it is a great honour for us so now we have a friendly match with belarus and we go away very happy
5320073 we come back on thursday night which is near the bolton match but we will be prepared to play
5320074 fabricio enjoyed the match it was a great start for him and the rest of the team
5320075 im very happy to be driving at home for a second time its always a special feeling to race in front of my countrymen and im really looking forward to it
5320076 in barcelona we were having a strong race when i had to retire but i hope this time i can get a good result as the circuit will be new for all the drivers
5320077 we were on the pace in hungary the car felt good and we showed we are still moving forward and that we will fight hard to finish in fourth place in the championship
5320078 i like street circuits they are always an interesting challenge and the sensation of speed from inside the cockpit is incredible
5320079 i will do my best to improve the set up of the car over the weekend so that we can aim for a strong result whatever happens i will give my maximum for this second grand prix in spain
5320080 i would like to have another solid weekend starting off with a good day of practice on friday qualifying in the top ten and showing good race pace to hopefully finish in the points thats how i will approach this race
5320081 that was an incredible result and a fantastic feeling i hope it will be the first of many podiums in formula 1
5320082 the important thing was that we showed just how competitive we are at the moment and moved further ahead in fourth place in the constructors championship
5320083 there is a great atmosphere in the team and we are all working hard together to move forward which is why it was so satisfying to get on the podium in hungary
5320084 i did plenty of street races when i was racing in champ cars and in that season almost all the tracks were new to me so i have learnt to adapt quickly
5320085 it looks like an interesting circuit and its quite long so it should be a good show
5320086 arsenal can today confirm that togolese forward emmanuel adebayor has signed a new long term contract with the club
5320087 any player who went back to management or managed his county team of course he would give the dublin job very serious consideration its a very attractive job
5320088 of course all managers would look at that and would take it into account of course they would i wouldnt be on my own in saying that there are plenty of other people who would as well
5320089 i would say at this point in time that dublin would find it very hard to be looking outside their own county
5320090 for the next four or five weeks my mind will be very much focused on the fedex cup playoff series which starts this week at ridgewood country club in new jersey
5320091 to be honest i felt like last years fedex cup came and went without me making much of an impression on things
5320092 obviously im very keen to do a lot better this time around i certainly like the revised schedule giving the players a break between the penultimate event the bmw championship and the tour championship
5320093 thats a welcome respite especially for those of us who are not involved in the ryder cup at valhalla its a two week break for us guys and for me personally thats no bad thing
5320094 students can take their advanced classes via the computer and participate in video conferences
5320095 for instance if there is a shortage in spanish if we need that we can do that in addition to advanced placement classes online
5320096 our staff each year does a tremendous job they use a lot of their initiative and are a very dedicated and talented staff we have a tradition of producing excellent scores on tests and we want to exceed in 21st century skills so our students are successful in a global world
5320097 the sixth graders will be going to moundsville middle school which is no longer a junior high and the sixth graders from sherrard will go to sherrard middle school which is new
5320098 four new rooms have been added to the moundsville middle school in order to hold the influx of students both of those facilities were in our bond package
5320099 we relocated the horticultural program and remodeled classroom space for technology
5320100 we intend to offer more dual credit opportunities for our students from west virginia northern community college and will also be open for adult learning opportunities for example someone at the coal mine who wants to work their way up in ranks to management will have the opportunity to take classes at john marshall high school as if they were at west virginia northern community college
5320101 we have a principals academy to provide them additional training and time to meet together to review procedures and polices
5320102 our excess levy expires at the end of this school year so the board will be setting the levy date in august
5320103 that will be critical to our county system the voters of brooke county have always supported the schools it will be very critical for us to pass our excess levy its our local operating money we do get state money but our county depends on operating money to provide free text books and to try to keep up to date with technologies supplies and instructional materials for students
5320104 we have done over the course of the summer a lot of building maintenance across the county as we usually do with upgrading and improving
5320105 we take pride in preparing not just in july and august its an ongoing process to keep the direction of the curriculum up to date we are excited and anticipating another great year for ohio county
5320106 we are hoping within the week the lights and security bollards will be set it will add something very significant to the front of the building both appearance wise and security wise all of our buses are also ready to go clean and inspected the custodians worked hard over the summer and the buildings look fantastic the students are pretty much ready to come back and we are definitely ready to have them back
5320107 more and more information is but a keystroke away for the modern student
5320108 knowing how to access that information is a key to a competitive education for that reason tyler county schools continues to focus on technology education in all areas of the curriculum and at all levels elementary middle and high school
5320109 we wanted to show the home crowd what we could do
5320110 weve been purring in pre season ready to get going were not going to get carried away but thats what we can do it was a good team performance
5320111 the lads are absolutely delighted with a clean sheet which for me is a good sign but weve got to build on it we cant settle on one game
5320112 weve got to do it consistently week in week out weve got our first points on the board but weve got to keep pushing on

5320115 its easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle
5320116 i want it be easier for rich people to get in
5320117 pastor rick you and i disagree on this im pro choice and like most pro choice people i think we need to make abortion available but also as rare as possible we can talk about ways to do that but look if youre going to make your choice on this one issue im probably not your guy
5320118 but i will say this even if he had no advance help whatsover mccains performance would have been exactly the same
5320119 theyre going to have a problem with obamas stance on abortion and with mccains stance on stem cells
5320120 joe have you seen andrew sullivan and the diarists at kos are accusing mccain of plagiarizing a pow story they are doing that thing democrats dont do
5320121 clearly there has been recent debate about the jury system here in queensland arising out of a couple of cases
5320122 while these amendments have not been designed with any particular case in mind they will apply to any case where an application is heard from the time that the amendments become law
5320123 intolerable prospect of retrials in situations where one intransigent juror had refused to do his or her duty in accordance with the law
5320124 reform of the justice system is needed but whether these proposals are the right reforms remains to be seen
5320125 the latter group women who did not take maternity leave is significantly more likely to have been promoted by june 30 2007
5320126 the figures may also be distorted by the possibility that women having children are at a relatively more senior classification already and simply have less scope for promotion
5320127 having a child brings a great opportunity cost to their career
5320128 i think it is certainly concerning that women are being discriminated against because of their family situation

5320144 as tough a decision that ive had to make not only because there were political consequences but also because saddam hussein was a bad person and there was no doubt he meant america ill

5320147 at what point does a baby get human rights in your view
5320148 well i think that whether you are looking at it from a theological perspective or a scientific perspective answering that question with specificity you know is above my pay grade
5320149 but let me just speak more generally about the issue of abortion because this is something obviously the country wrestles with one thing that im absolutely convinced of is there is a moral and ethical content to this issue so i think that anybody who tries to deny the moral difficulties and gravity of the abortion issue i think is not paying attention so that would be point number one
5320150 at the moment of conception i have a 25 year pro life record in the congress in the senate and as president of the united states i will be a pro life president and this presidency will have pro life policies
5320151 okay we dont have to go longer on that one
5320152 at what point does a baby get human rights in your view
5320153 whether you are looking at it from a theological perspective or a scientific perspective answering that question with specificity is you know above my pay grade
5320154 but let me speak more generally about the issue of abortion because this is something obviously the country wrestles with one thing that im absolutely convinced of is that there is a moral and ethical element to this issue and so i think that anybody who tries to deny the moral difficulties and gravity of the abortion issue is not paying attention
5320155 im absolutely convinced of is that there is a moral and ethical element to this issue
5320156 oh these religious morons and their obsession with abortion of course i could care less about it but i also know its impolitic to say so so ill emit a brief rhetoric fog and hope no one will notice

5320161 its easy for those of us with plentiful food supplies to ignore the issue but we have a responsibility to use science to help the less well off where we can
5320162 we knew we could vastly improve the customer experience by deploying an online booking application to enhance our existing web site ibm came in and really pulled the project together in an amazingly short period of time five months compressing a development cycle that was slated to take 12 months
5320163 when customers book a tour the application is simultaneously booking reservations for hotels buses and so on
5320164 we needed our online system to extend the complexities built into our core business systems out to the web without making the process too complicated for our customers the websphere commerce solution did this without having to completely rewrite our back end systems
5320165 this project is a great example of how ibm is helping clients adapt to constantly changing conditions such as rising fuel costs and new terms of engagement between airlines and travel agencies
5320166 using ibm software and soa companies like vantage can make it easier and less expensive for consumers to book vacations while reducing the time and money it takes to manage a complex business and web site like this

5320172 the virgin mary is acknowledged and honoured as being truly the mother of god and of the redeemer she is clearly the mother of the members of christ since she has by her charity joined in bringing about the birth of believers in the church who are members of its head
5320173 this union of the mother with the son in the work of salvation is made manifest from the time of christs virginal conception up to his death
5320174 we also see mary by her prayers imploring the gift of the spirit who had already overshadowed her in the annunciation
5320175 finally the immaculate virgin preserved free from all stain of original sin when the course of her earthly life was finished was taken up body and soul into heavenly glory and exalted by the lord as queen over all things so that she might be the more fully conformed to her son the lord of lords and conqueror of sin and death
5320176 in a wholly singular way she cooperated by her obedience faith hope and burning charity in the saviours work of restoring supernatural life to souls for this reason she is a mother to us in the order of grace
5320177 this motherhood of mary in the order of grace continues uninterruptedly from the consent which she loyally gave at the annunciation and which she sustained without wavering beneath the cross until the eternal fulfilment of all the elect taken up to heaven she did not lay aside this saving office but by her manifold intercession continues to bring us the gifts of eternal salvation therefore the blessed virgin is invoked in the church under the titles of advocate helper benefactress and mediatrix
5320178 marys function as a mother of men in no way obscures or diminishes this unique mediation of christ but rather shows its power but the blessed virgins salutary influence on men flows forth from the superabundance of the merits of christ rests on his mediation depends entirely on it and draws all its power from it
5320179 no creature could ever be counted along with the incarnate word and redeemer but just as the priesthood of christ is shared in various ways both by his ministers and the faithful and as the one goodness of god is radiated in different ways among his creatures so also the unique mediation of the redeemer does not exclude but rather gives rise to a manifold cooperation which is but a sharing in this one source

5320198 coming to new mexico i can see that theres much more openness to these kinds of therapies as options
5320199 what governs pretty much everything we do in medicine is that old adage do no harm
5320200 most of the time in western medicine there is a large scientific effort that helps us form the answer to that question
5320201 what were then left with are issues of are we sure that what were doing will not harm the patient and is the general perception that it will help
5320202 if we can satisfy those questions and we have patients that request those services then we try to offer them
5320203 we like to offer therapies that have some evidence behind them

5320210 the lasting advantage of a peaceful and democratic ally in the heart of the middle east could still be squandered by hasty withdrawal and arbitrary timelines
5320211 are still trying to square sen obamas varying positions on the surge in iraq
5320212 first he obama opposed the surge and confidently predicted that it would fail
5320213 then he tried to prevent funding for the troops who carried out the surge
5320214 not content to merely predict failure in iraq my opponent tried to legislate failure
5320215 good judgment will be at a premium in the term of the next president as we were all reminded ten days ago by events in the nation of georgia
5320216 veterans should never be deprived of quality medical care and mental health care coverage for illness or injury incurred as a result of their service to our country
5320217 i will make sure that congress funds the va health care budget in a sufficient timely and predictable manner but i will say that every increase in funding must be matched by increases in accountability both at the va and in congress
5320218 the united states supported the transition to democratic government in pakistan and respects the results of the election
5320219 we believe that respect for the democratic and constitutional processes in that country is fundamental to pakistans future and its fight against terrorism
5320220 musharraf made the critical choice to join the fight against al qaeda the taliban and other extremist groups that threaten the peace and security of pakistan its neighbors and partners throughout the world
5320221 one of the worlds most committed partners in the war against terrorism and extremism
5320222 just like you would think in a movie a flash flood comes out of nowhere thats exactly what happened and we ran to higher ground and it never went down after that
5320223 huge wall of water coming at you its pretty scary
5320224 thats all it took just a few days of very heavy thunderstorms
5320225 we were basically stuck up the canyon without our rafts
5320226 we had no supplies no food and very little water we lost everything

5320231 such a show of violence is pushing kashmiri people especially our youth toward revolution
5320232 at this point i think the international community has to step in otherwise we fear a growing extremism this kind of anger comes at the worst time
5320233 pakistan has to put its political house in order before we can say what it means for kashmir
5320234 we have conducted a scientific study which states that some 400 billion is needed to rebuild infrastructure
5320235 i think hes down to earth i think hes just more in touch with the people hes more like one of us i would say than some of the other governors weve had
5320236 the political leaderships in the arab world began to absorb and accept the developments in iraq since 2003 both at the level of acceptance of election results that led to the leadership of the shiite sect of the state having obtained the majority or at work during the national recognition which allowed a margin wide response from the department of iraqi kurdistan in the north of the country
5320237 go and follow up on developments in post saddam iraq and the baath leaving the scene of regional interventions non arab and international levels had reached its final stage
5320238 if some people believe that the arab move came late it ignores the fact that arab capitals which opened on the iraqi scene after the extent of it remained closed throughout the period of totalitarian baathist government were needed to accommodate the control of the merits of that scene difficult and complex which hastened the terrorism world al qaida representative to tamper with it
5320239 regional powers moved researcher on the location of an influential in the yard was not destined for a strong knowledge of the owner or preference to deal with him especially in light of talk about the link iraqi shiites of iranian policy an error was commonplace given the mandate faqih believers sought to confirm this error to remove any influence arab from baghdad singling out the words of the least of them
5320240 if the arabs they conducted post them on iraq many iraqi politicians preferred to also manage their faces from the surrounding arab deputies in the coalition with some of the largest force in the world and to the privileged relations which some have linked to iran
5320241 from several angles the first corner it is most important in my view in terms of emphasis on the arab identity of iraq as arab absence since continued in 2003 for many reasons
5320242 as long as iraqs arab and islamic countries jordan does not find a contradiction in the new iraqi government deal with him and iran because all states to seek their interests
5320243 if jordans good relations with some components of the iraqi people this does not obviate the relationship with the ruling power regardless of the identity on them in terms of race and denomination because the deal is between states on the basis of national identity
5320244 either the second corner they branched jordanian interests in the relationship with baghdad his majesty the king to see the sufferings of its people with higher oil prices and for this we must move to improve the purchase prices of iraq versus sincerity to deal with iraq jordan as always geographical western gate iraq
5320245 from jordanian interests in iraq where investment and export seeking businessmen to participate in the construction and reconstruction and this is not only good relations with the authority of baghdad
5320246 price developments in the month of july last fall is still under the influence of external price shock to the economy posed by the continuing rise in food prices in the international market and come out of imported inflation
5320247 has become affect the local price levels and in a tangible way due to the fact that a food is the main paragraph controlled over two thirds of the relative weight of paragraphs consisting of the base index of consumer prices
5320248 the central bank of iraq will remain at the level of interest has adopted unchanged at 16 percent at the same time using the tools of monetary policy and other means sufficient to absorb external shock thus achieving price stability required in the national economy without mentioning those tools
5320249 the interest rate is one of the effective tools of the bank to absorb inflation is not currently constitute an impediment to development in the iraqi economy

5320271 cq politics is changing the rating of the pennsylvania 11 race to reflect the likelihood of a competitive race this fall between veteran democratic rep paul e kanjorski and republican lou barletta the mayor of hazleton and a prominent opponent of illegal immigration
5320272 by changing the rating of the race from safe democrat to leans democrat cq politics still rates kanjorski as the favorite but acknowledges a strong challenge from barletta
5320273 the public isnt interested in these insider rankings and pay no attention to them
5320274 they dont affect our strategy when no ideas barletta outlines answers for dealing with the energy costs jobs food prices health care and social security then well consider changing our strategy
5320275 the people in washington are starting to see what we have been seeing everywhere we go
5320276 that is the people of the 11th district want change and are excited about my campaign im working hard for every vote and wont take any vote for granted
5320277 meanwhile the republicans are looking to reclaim some of the seats they lost last time
5320278 their best shot appears to be in the northeastern corner where democrat christopher carney defeated four term republican don sherwood who was politically wounded by a sex scandal but carney a military veteran and former counterterrorism adviser to the pentagon is no greenhorn and republican chris hackett who heads a recruitment and temporary staffing business is now an underdog cq politics race rating leans democratic
5320279 chris carney has broad support from every corner of the 10th district
5320280 he is well respected for his service independence and integrity by republicans democrats and independents alike our campaign is about doing what is best for the people of northeast and central pennsylvania and were glad to have a publication as well respected as congressional quarterly affirming our position
5320281 what matters is the voters of the 10th will have a clear choice between a liberal democrat and a conservative republican and were confident that chris hacketts conservative principles line up much better with the people of our district
5320282 the democratic congressional campaign committee dccc the campaign arm of house democrats and an ally of kanjorski has taken notice of the race
5320283 the dccc this week reported spending 151 000 in independent expenditures for a television ad that links barletta to bush who has poor approval ratings
5320284 first of all i always want to know who paid for the poll
5320285 and i want to see all of the questions that were asked when they were asked in what order and if the poll was adjusted
5320286 i want to know what sampling technique was used to be sure there was no sleight of hand
5320287 if you know all this you have a fair poll
5320288 im not suggesting that all polls arent right or accurate but how do you know if you dont have all the information
5320289 say crime is important to a candidate but he or she is running in an area where crime is at its lowest in 30 years
5320290 and say the voters care about jobs the candidate may get the votes of the people interested in crime but wont get the votes of those interested in jobs internal polls will show what voters care about and the candidate will then concentrate on addressing those concerns
5320291 to look as if they give a crap about humanity
5320292 blustered that he would handle the human rights issue as an element for negotiations with north korea
5320293 we categorically dismiss this as a premeditated act of the u s to deliberately throw a hurdle in the process of the six party talks
5320294 the human rights abuses inside the country still exist and persist
5320295 are rational people who use terrorism primarily to develop strong affective ties with fellow terrorists

5320321 but you always want a player like fabregas to be in there because he gives you the quality of the pass
5320322 when are you going to go back to the show
5320323 it was a setup they wanted me to sign a contract for 10 episodes rather than the usual 27 which meant my income which was not that large in the first place was cut in half
5320324 i remember an episode where they had will going to the lamaze classes with me
5320325 i wanted to know why philip wouldnt go with me

5320358 may not have been in the cone of silence and may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama
5320359 the obama people must feel that he didnt do quite as well as they might have wanted to in that context because what they are putting out privately is that mccain may not have been in the cone of silence and may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama he seemed so well prepared

5320455 they were me and my wifes feathers that symbolized our marriage
5320456 to have it stolen and traded for a joint is really offensive
5320457 i was hoping for maturity between our cultures but we have a long way to go lets have some social and cultural responsibility
5320458 the most important event so far of the 2008 campaign
5320459 that 15 million bale export forecast gives us some cause for hope
5320460 even if we dont get to 15 million in exports it leaves us in the situation where we may see a tightening of the balance sheet for u s cotton
5320461 any number between 5 2 million and 7 1 million bales is still better than 10 million bales
5320462 the decline in world cotton production in 2008 09 is attributable mainly to the lower forecast for the united states as this crop is projected 28 percent below 2007 08
5320463 chinas crop is forecast only slightly below that of a year ago while the rest of the world of the world is forecast to fall 2 percent to the lowest since 2003 04
5320464 the u s share of global production is estimated lower at 12 percent in 2008 09 compared with the five year average of 18 5 percent
5320465 input costs for cotton are still high relative to other crops
5320466 the concern now is that when you look at these prices we could still be in a situation where we are still trying to hold on to cotton acres at best we may be holding on but we could possibly lose more acres in 2009
5320467 it may well be that consumers have to curtail clothing purchases because of higher gasoline prices
5320468 if you look at the august crop report over the last five years the crop gets bigger by from 1 million to 3 million bales between august and december
5320469 cotton still appears to be the better alternative because of the sharp increase in indias cotton yields
5320470 the key to the world production and price outlooks may be whether a shift will occur in brazil brazilian farmers are expected to plant more soybeans because of exchange problems and the higher prices offered for soybeans
5320471 while the long term outlook for the cotton sector in the united states is favorable the sector may still endure some pain
5320472 for the last couple of years the cotton market has been tantalized by forecasts of insufficient acreage higher demand and bigger production deficits for the deferred months and in each of those years the forecasts for the tightness have faded and the end result has been the largest carryouts in 40 years
5320473 and we were almost off to the races however after that our carryouts went from 5 4 million to 9 8 million bales an increase of almost 5 million bales
5320474 it doesnt take a rocket scientist to figure out that the carryout will continue to grow until we get a burdensome supply again for this year
5320475 the crop today is at a very critical stage and needs rain immediately if not the crop could be a disaster and u s exports would be the largest beneficiary of that
5320476 one is that the cost of agricultural inputs has risen sharply india is struggling with the high cost of fertilizer and will see a cutback in its use of it two sharply higher transport cost for inputs in countries like brazil which have to import those inputs will cut into profits
5320477 in 2006 07 usda originally estimated chinas imports at 18 5 million bales in july they moved it up to 20 million bales the final import numbers were 10 8 million bales 9 2 million bales less
5320478 in 2007 08 usdas first estimate of chinas imports were at 20 5 million bales but july it was 16 5 million bales and today theyre at 12 25 million and we think its closer to 11 5 million thats another 9 million bale drop off the forecast imports for china
5320479 the 2008 09 season is continuing that trend as usda initially forecast 17 million bales of chinese imports and that is already down to 13 5 million bales
5320480 these statistical adjustments will account for all the slippage in the balance sheet as that happens the screws will be tightened and we will finally drive it in at that point the numbers will finally reflect reality
5320481 a very scary number especially when you measure it against the u
5320482 so we have to ask ourselves if the screws have been tightened all the way down on the statistics or do we need one more year of adjustment this will determine if the cotton market is really set to take off
5320483 if we start the year with roughly 5 5 million to 6 million bales and we maintain all our planted acreage we will get a production of 14 7 million bales a carryout of 6 million bales and a total supply of 20 7 million bales
5320484 if domestic use drops to 4 4 million bales and exports stay around 15 million bales all of a sudden we will find ourselves with an ending stocks figure of 1 3 million bales that number is impractical but it will be extremely bullish on prices
5320485 in 2010 if u s domestic use is maintained at current levels which is very possible due to the domestic support payment in the new farm bill we could find ourselves with a projected
5320486 i dont think i can make this point any stronger
5320487 if the 2008 09 statistics look like theyll hold together this time then the market will have to react and it will have to react long before the planting of the 2009 crop in order to attract cotton acreage back into production away from what is now profitable grain production
5320488 there is not enough carbon dioxide in two cups of carbonated water to suffocate an entire fire ant mound
5320489 the reason why the mound may appear to be dead is you have poured two cups of water on them and they moved because of the disturbance
5320490 several can be connected pour water on them and youre going to make them move
5320491 in keeping with expectations weve been hearing about lower demand and economic slowdowns
5320492 which suggest very little chance of counter cyclical payments or government payments based on the adjusted world price kicking in
5320493 even though the export target wasnt met the carry in is going to rise for 2008 09
5320494 on average over the last 10 years usdas august projection was off about 8 percent from final estimates
5320495 recent history suggests we could swing this crop by 1 1 million bales on either side of the current forecast of 13 77 million bales any way you slice it though were going to come out with lower ending stocks for 2008 09 so there is a stronger rationale there for stronger prices
5320496 we couldnt see any more than 2 7 million bales from this 41 county area
5320497 would depend on continued timely rainfall over the next several weeks coupled with ideal growing conditions and a late fall to make sure the late planted crop is maximized experience tells us this is very unlikely we believe that this is a small crop and will only get smaller from usdas 3 7 million bale estimate
5320498 basically much of the area dedicated to cotton is irrigated its very good cotton soil so its very forgiving of problems that occur early in the year
5320499 might try to take december back below 69 cents if we do i think it will be only marginally below down to 68 cents i dont think it will stay there long i tend to think prices will move back up into the low 70s i dont think well get to 74 cents until we get a better idea of this crop size well still have 51 million bales of cotton around the world next year thats still a big carryover
5320500 i think we have a couple more months before the tightness of 2009 becomes apparent im positive longer term in the next two to three years that acreage in china and india is going to be dedicated to food crops as opposed to fiber which should increase the price of cotton

5320510 taste by 2 magazine i followed the recipe as it is except for sesame seeds as i didnt have any
5320511 that was an incredible result and a fantastic feeling i hope it will be the first of many podiums in formula 1
5320512 the important thing was that we showed just how competitive we are at the moment and moved further ahead in fourth place in the constructors championship
5320513 there is a great atmosphere in the team and we are all working hard together to move forward which is why it was so satisfying to get on the podium in hungary
5320514 i did plenty of street races when i was racing in champ cars and in that season almost all the tracks were new to me so i have learnt to adapt quickly
5320515 it looks like an interesting circuit and its quite long so it should be a good show
5320516 arsenal can today confirm that togolese forward emmanuel adebayor has signed a new long term contract with the club
5320517 it is a great honour for us so now we have a friendly match with belarus and we go away very happy
5320518 we come back on thursday night which is near the bolton match but we will be prepared to play
5320519 fabricio enjoyed the match it was a great start for him and the rest of the team
5320520 i keep saying to him when are you going to move over and let me have a bash
5320521 but at the moment he still seems to be enjoying himself although one day maybe
5320522 nothing became available in the summer that i wanted a go at or that wanted me is the main thing
5320523 im very happy to be driving at home for a second time its always a special feeling to race in front of my countrymen and im really looking forward to it
5320524 in barcelona we were having a strong race when i had to retire but i hope this time i can get a good result as the circuit will be new for all the drivers
5320525 we were on the pace in hungary the car felt good and we showed we are still moving forward and that we will fight hard to finish in fourth place in the championship
5320526 i like street circuits they are always an interesting challenge and the sensation of speed from inside the cockpit is incredible
5320527 i will do my best to improve the set up of the car over the weekend so that we can aim for a strong result whatever happens i will give my maximum for this second grand prix in spain
5320528 i would like to have another solid weekend starting off with a good day of practice on friday qualifying in the top ten and showing good race pace to hopefully finish in the points thats how i will approach this race
5320529 for the next four or five weeks my mind will be very much focused on the fedex cup playoff series which starts this week at ridgewood country club in new jersey
5320530 to be honest i felt like last years fedex cup came and went without me making much of an impression on things
5320531 obviously im very keen to do a lot better this time around i certainly like the revised schedule giving the players a break between the penultimate event the bmw championship and the tour championship
5320532 thats a welcome respite especially for those of us who are not involved in the ryder cup at valhalla its a two week break for us guys and for me personally thats no bad thing
5320533 any player who went back to management or managed his county team of course he would give the dublin job very serious consideration its a very attractive job
5320534 of course all managers would look at that and would take it into account of course they would i wouldnt be on my own in saying that there are plenty of other people who would as well
5320535 i would say at this point in time that dublin would find it very hard to be looking outside their own county

5320578 we have safely placed senator mccain in a cone of silence
5320579 there can be no assurance that any strategic alternative or other transaction will be completed or if completed of its terms price or timing
5320580 i stood at the corner of ravenswood and belle plaine for six hours by myself
5320581 i just started this sport for fun and it wasnt an olympic sport
5320582 then it got into the olympics i went to three games and i have a third medal im still trying to soak it in i think
5320583 this was the first chance to put my best effort forward just to see what i could do
5320584 not making it out of the heats thats just ridiculous
5320585 i couldnt really get out of my bed until two days ago
5320586 it was just a lack of energy my body was just completely fatigued it hurt to touch it hurt to lay down it hurt to do everything i thought i was over it but it seems like it still has taken a lot out of my body
5320587 my coach joel filliol was there and i said i wanted to continue he asked me to try to move my elbow i tried once more and couldnt so i knew i was done
5320588 there is nothing worse than not finishing i wouldnt have cared if i finished last with a broken arm but i needed another arm to climb those hills today
5320589 all we can do now is go back and see how it all plays out
5320590 well come out tomorrow and compete and play the way team canada is supposed to play
5320591 we didnt stick with the plan today which was to control the ball
5320592 it was really fast right from the start i am happy with my strategy
5320593 this is a new routine for us and it was really important to do well on day 1
5320594 robin parrish is the kind of writer who understands how to entertain from the word go his stories are sure to shape fiction for years to come
5320595 the reason why america has been the most dominant country in the world is not because america has more nuclear arms than anybody else
5320596 has anyone seen exactly where a nuclear arm influenced how other people dress the way they talk the way they think
5320597 the best i can do is try to forget about crooked putts
5320598 of course its not easy to do that but its only the sixth hole i still have 12 holes to go a lot of golf
5320599 i actually didnt look at a leaderboard until the 16th hole and i wasnt intentionally looking at it
5320600 when i went to tap in my par putt i caught a glance and saw that i was first i think it was a two shot lead at the time
5320601 i got a little excited but i kind of told myself that i still had two holes to go and just to continue doing what i was doing and to stay in the process
5320602 he also said fuck this job i want fuck all to do with this job
5320603 i wanted to go back down the steps i dont know why i did not have the courage to do so if i did he taliep would still be alive today
5320604 i found myself in the wrong place at the wrong time
5320605 he said he did not want anything to do with any money that was taken from the house because its blood money and he washes his hands of any responsibility
5320606 i thought they were people with a lot of money and i was busy with a robbery how can i now give money back
5320607 quite often you will see walking down the street a lass who is not so attractive with a wide smile on her face
5320608 whether it is recollection of something previous or anticipation for the next evening there is a degree of happiness
5320609 but when i checked it out just for the heck of it i was truly impressed
5320610 i am confident of the fact that this plan will give rise to a fruitful and constructive collaboration that is in the best interests of professional road cycling in this regard and with the respect of the ucis democratic structures i know that i can rely on the indispensable contribution of all our stakeholders to relaunch and maintain a dialogue on the future of professional cycling
5320611 we came to an agreement with the three big tours so that the 18 protour teams that exist will be guaranteed entry into the major tours thats important for sponsors because they want to know what races they will be represented in

5320613 de la competici n del a o pasado en la quincena de los realizadores del festival de cannes creo que se estrenaron una o dos pel culas americanas y nada m s
5320614 viajo bastante por festivales y puedo ver muchas propuestas interesantes que no se acaban distribuyendo
5320615 hay muchos pa ses que ya han confirmado y tenemos distribuci n para francia portugal m xico y argentina
5320616 en espa a el tema de la distribuci n est todav a muy dif cil
5320617 mucha gente lo ha comparado con retablos de la edad media ya que casi no tiene perspectiva es muy plana sin volumen psicol gico ni espacial una cosa muy primitiva simple y austera
5320618 que son m s difuminados y tienen una psicolog a propia menos definida
5320619 me gusta elegir temas antiguos que no tienen nada que ver con el mundo de hoy ni las preocupaciones actuales de la gente del mundo de hoy ni nada con lo que te sientas identificado
5320620 conecto con cierto cine contempor neo porque es sofisticado en cuanto a montaje y concepto y adem s rompe con una serie de mitos como la estructura dram tica la narrativa o los personajes
5320621 pero al mismo tiempo es un cine muy primitivo y puro tiene incluso cosas de cine mudo y del mundo visual casi no hay informaci n sobre la historia sino que simplemente hay unos personajes en movimiento unos cuerpos
5320622 is it made sure people felt that they had no real right to their homeownership
5320623 what we have is a situation in which people are worried theres going to be a reversal of that decision by some means
5320624 and they have such a fear that they want it in the constitution and that protects them permanently
5320625 were talking about an airport were talking about our road systems theyre gone those new developments those new projects they wont happen anymore because the cost will be so great
5320626 driving down the street you can see there are mostly empty lots boarded up storefronts and mostly empty buildings
5320627 population is increasing housing values have gone up substantially theres a lot of development going on in the city and we are much better sounder shape than we were back then
5320628 i had a little bit of hope inside of me but seeing how beautifully she executed her routine i knew
5320629 i think the biggest thing is that nothing is impossible so many people said it couldnt be done all it takes is an imagination
5320630 sometimes you can be pleasantly surprised when something quite unsuitable looking turns out to be very comfortable i was not surprised it was indeed quite uncomfortable

5320633 in the northern territory we saw the greens get 15 of the vote
5320634 we do determine which government goes into power by our preferences and native forest logging is going to be one of the important considerations in our decision about who to support
5320635 i do think that there is a unified voice across the conservation movement that native forest logging must stop and that we must make a complete transfer to plantations and farmed forestry
5320636 our forefathers were preparing us for this by planting many thousands of hectares of pine and blue gum plantations
5320637 the project based approach some educators say encourages active learning and produces better performance in class and on standardized tests
5320638 unless you change how you teach and how kids work new technology is not really going to make a difference
5320639 nos aseguraremos de que nuestra legislaci n incluya y reconozca legalmente la uni n de las parejas del mismo sexo
5320640 la declaraci n sigue a una resoluci n hecha por un tribunal en la provincia de ontario que orden que el gobierno cambiara la definici n del matrimonio
5320641 el que se defina al matrimonio para que s lo incluya a los heterosexuales viola los derechos de las parejas homosexuales bajo la constituci n de canad y la carta de derechos y libertades
5320642 el papel fundamental del derecho internacional en la decisi n del tribunal supremo parece confirmar las preocupaciones de los eruditos legales conservadores que han advertido desde hace mucho tiempo que las leyes desarrolladas en europa y en la onu pueden imponerse en estados unidos la opini n de la mayor a fue guiada espec ficamente por las resoluciones a favor de los homosexuales hechas por el tribunal europeo de derechos humanos
5320643 este tribunal no debe decidir aisladamente si la criminalizaci n de la sodom a del mismo sexo entre adultos que realizan este acto por su propia y libre voluntad viola las garant as constitucionales de privacidad y protecci n equitativa otras naciones que tienen historias sistemas legales y culturas pol ticas similares ya han contestado afirmativamente a estas preguntas este tribunal debe presentar sus respetos a estas opiniones de la humanidad
5320644 junto con los principios de nuremberg del derecho penal internacional desarrollados por los aliados en 1946 para los juicios de los criminales de guerra alemanes y japoneses y la convenci n sobre genocidio de 1948 la declaraci n universal de los derechos humanos se convirti en un pilar del nuevo sistema internacional bajo el cual el trato que una naci n daba a sus ciudadanos ya no era inmune al escrutinio externo
5320645 hoy la declaraci n universal es el nico punto de referencia m s importante para las discusiones internacionales acerca de c mo ordenar nuestro futuro juntos en este mundo interdependiente y cada vez m s atormentado por los conflictos

5320652 un fen meno perturbador que est ganando terreno actualmente se puede describir mejor como la apropiaci n sistem tica de los derechos humanos para servir a intereses especiales y promover agendas dudosas de naturaleza pol tica y generalmente secular
5320653 al comienzo de los a os ochenta un intento que hace reflexionar para volver a formular los fundamentos de la teor a jur dica tradicional empez a hacerse sentir en el rea del derecho internacional desafiando la perspectiva del derecho como racional objetivo y de principios al deconstruir los argumentos jur dicos tradicionales y de ese modo exponer las contradicciones y la falta de claridad de las doctrinas los principios y las reglas jur dicas
5320654 para los proponentes de los estudios jur dicos cr ticos la objetividad no existe sino dentro de las mentes y los prejuicios de los ingenuos
5320655 para los proponentes de los estudios jur dicos cr ticos las afirmaciones de las reglas racionales u objetivas nicamente encubren las verdaderas fuerzas detr s de todo el lenguaje y la estructura jur dicos la pol tica
5320656 los derechos humanos y las libertades fundamentales son derechos de nacimiento de todos los seres humanos que la naturaleza universal de esos derechos y libertades est m s all de todo cuestionamiento y que la orientaci n sexual no debe de ninguna manera invocarse para impedir el disfrute de tales derechos y libertades
5320657 a todos los estados a promover y proteger los derechos humanos de todas las personas cualquiera que sea su orientaci n sexual
5320658 la atenci n dedicada a las violaciones de los derechos humanos fundadas en la orientaci n sexual por parte de los mecanismos especiales en sus informes ante la comisi n de derechos humanos as como por parte de los organismos encargados de monitorear el cumplimiento de los tratados alienta a todos los mecanismos especiales de la comisi n de derechos humanos para que dentro del marco de sus respectivos mandatos presten la debida atenci n al tema
5320659 en d cadas recientes las resoluciones y los actos similares de organizaciones intergubernamentales internacionales han adquirido un reconocimiento muy significativo como fuentes y pruebas de derecho internacional algunas de estas resoluciones declaraciones recomendaciones etc tera pueden o de hecho se convierten en prueba autorizada de derecho internacional
5320660 para comprender c mo las organizaciones internacionales adquieren este reconocimiento es importante recordar que el derecho consuetudinario internacional evoluciona a trav s de la pr ctica del estado hacia algo a lo que los estados se someten por el sentido de obligaci n legal el sistema de votaci n de los estados y lo que ellos expresan en organizaciones internacionales es una forma de pr ctica del estado su significado en el proceso de creaci n de la ley depender del mayor o menor grado de congruencia de la pr ctica del estado con la conducta contempor nea y con los pronunciamientos de los estados en diferentes contextos
5320661 debido al car cter consensual del derecho consuetudinario y convencional internacional y debido a la ausencia de un sistema judicial o legislativo centralizado los estados desempe an un doble papel en el proceso de legislaci n act an de dos formas como legisladores y como abogados o promotores son legisladores o creadores de leyes en el sentido de que la pr ctica de los estados y los tratados que stos firman crean derecho internacional los estados tambi n afirman ciertas posturas en el plano internacional en la correspondencia diplom tica en los tribunales internacionales en las organizaciones internacionales etc tera a trav s de las cuales buscan obtener nuevas reglas de derecho internacional o la modificaci n de otras ya existentes las afirmaciones a nivel individual acerca de lo que es y no es derecho en particular derecho consuetudinario son una forma de promoci n o propuesta y se convierten en una actividad legislativa cuando estas peticiones encuentran el amplio respaldo que se requiere para obtener categor a de ley las declaraciones de los gobiernos acerca de lo que es y no es ley deben tomar en cuenta las consecuencias legislativas de sus acciones
5320662 al haber fallado en la arena pol tica en donde nosotros democr ticamente deliberamos acerca de c mo debemos ordenar nuestra vida juntos el movimiento homosexual no tiene otra alternativa que poner sus esperanzas en los tribunales las regulaciones gubernamentales las organizaciones profesionales y las burocracias del sistema escolar p blico en estas arenas sus victorias han sido sustanciales y sus aspiraciones son aun mayores en todas estas arenas el movimiento homosexual debe ser retado a cada paso sin temor con calma razonablemente sin cesar el bien de innumerables individuos y el bien com n depende de esto
5320663 si las leyes en contra de la discriminaci n se extienden para incluir la orientaci n sexual entonces muy pronto despu s de esto nos encontraremos con la acci n afirmativa para los homosexuales declarados es seguro que suceder a lo siguiente si ahora est mal tomar en cuenta la homosexualidad en cualquier decisi n para contratar a alguien o para conceder vivienda entonces tambi n ha estado mal a trav s de d cadas y siglos pasados pero eso equivale a decir que los homosexuales pueden afirmar que tienen una larga historia de injusta opresi n tal como los estadounidenses de origen africano y otras minor as y el remedio reconocido para ese tipo de cosas es la acci n afirmativa es claro entonces que tenemos no simplemente un cambio gradual el cual permite que algunos ciudadanos adicionales hagan lo que deseen hacer sino que tenemos un cambio radical es decir la movilizaci n de todo el sistema de la justicia social el cual se origin en el movimiento de los derechos civiles para promover cierto estilo de vida
5320664 aunque diferentes investigaciones y compa as de mercadotecnia usan n meros distintos de poblaci n homosexual que van desde el uno por ciento actual al diez por ciento inflado o m s las investigaciones muestran que la situaci n de los homosexuales es por lo menos tan buena o mejor que la del resto del pa s los homosexuales demuestran poder pol tico aun m s all de sus n meros a pesar de que constituyen nicamente el uno por ciento de la poblaci n
5320665 debe estar claro de forma inequ voca que nuestra preocupaci n es una preocupaci n por la justicia la justicia para la gente especialmente para la gente joven atrapada en la perplejidad sexual y asaltada por dentro y por fuera por presiones para que se entreguen a una forma de vida que est marcada por la compulsi n la soledad la depresi n y la enfermedad tambi n por la justicia para la integridad de nuestra vida p blica la cual requiere que la verdad se diga con candor y que los desacuerdos sean arreglados con cortes a finalmente la justicia para millones de personas madres padres y ni os que necesitan todo el apoyo que puedan obtener para sostenerse en el presente y transmitir al futuro el peque o pelot n de amor y fidelidad que se supone que la familia sea

5320669 most countries are feeling the pinch as a combination of high fuel prices and economic uncertainty across europe filter down to the consumer
5320670 yet while markets including the uk and spain show negative growth central and eastern europe have reported healthy sales virtually across the board and we expect europes heavyweights to continue to perform well in these markets
5320671 there is cause for optimism in western europe as well as new models defy overall trends by posting healthy sales
5320672 here i am sitting at a comfortable table loaded heavily with books with one eye on my typewriter and the other on licorice the cat who has a great fondness for carbon paper and i am telling you that the emperor napoleon was a most contemptible person but should i happen to look out of the window down upon seventh avenue and hear the sound of heavy drums and see the little man on his white horse in his old and much worn green uniform then i dont know but i am afraid that i would leave my books and the kitten and my home and everything else to follow him wherever he cared to lead my own grandfather did this and heaven knows he was not born to be a hero

5320674 and as the moon rose higher the inessential houses began to melt away until gradually i became aware of the old island here that flowered once for dutch sailors eyes a fresh green breast of the new world its vanished trees the trees that had made way for gatsbys house had once pandered in whispers to the last and greatest of all human dreams for a transitory enchanted moment man must have held his breath in the presence of this continent compelled into an aesthetic contemplation he neither understood nor desired face to face for the last time in history with something commensurate to his capacity for wonder

5320689 kelly just sat down with me and my mom and my dad and said your son has the potential to make it to the nhl or get drafted into the nhl and play professional hockey
5320690 you have to have the right attitude and get in shape get your eating habits better and i think everything will come and fall into place for you
5320691 he didnt know how to train he loved being on the ice he was a rink rat we said you have potential but this is what you have to do to commit yourself hes a big happy go lucky kid that loves the game
5320692 the only thing they chase and macinnis told me was work out every day and do the right things to make you a better hockey player
5320693 it was my own decision to go out in the gym and work out ride the bike my second year in st louis i did the hockey treadmill throughout the whole season i worked out
5320694 i called paul holmgren and i had a good rapport with him when we were in hartford
5320695 holmgren said they had him rated and he said he was going to look into it i said i think this kid can play and hes really going to turn things around here in the next couple years
5320696 i did pretty good in londons 2004 rookie camp and i went back for main camp
5320697 i came back overweight and out of shape and they said youre not ready for this and they sent me home
5320698 i said i think i can play in this league ohl and i proved a lot of people wrong
5320699 i went up there with a good attitude thinking they would help me out and i helped their team out and it all worked out
5320700 it isnt just his size he has good hands good skills he can pass the puck hes a go to guy and that is something we need hes a difference maker he can beat guys 1 on 1 there are some things he needs to clean up he needs to get himself in better shape and then his skating will get better but hes working on it
5320701 hes got million dollar hands he can put the puck in the net and make plays
5320702 we sat him down when he was in at the end of the phantoms season and talked to him in a very harsh way about what he needed to do in terms of conditioning and hes worked at it
5320703 i think it shows on the ice i think his skating still needs to pick up a notch hes got great hands hes got a great offensive mind for the game
5320704 my feet got a little faster theyre not fast but theyll get better its a process losing weight was a process the eating habits is a process
5320705 i love waking up and working out thinking to myself if i go in the gym every day from here on out i can be a better hockey player be better conditioned to go out there and play in the nhl
5320706 if his skating continues to get better and his conditioning continues to get better
5320707 me gustar a tener tantos ni os como mi cuerpo me permita

5320711 i think i put a little too much pressure on myself and i found myself trying to overthrow

5320714 ive got to put this behind me and move on to the next game
5320715 it is said that there is this race problem they say this race problem will be solved when the third world pours into every white country and only into white countries
5320716 the netherlands and belgium are as crowded as japan or taiwan but nobody says japan or taiwan will solve this race problem by bringing in millions of third worlders and quote assimilating unquote with them
5320717 everybody says the final solution to this race problem is for every white country and only white countries to
5320718 what if i said there was this race problem and this race problem would be solved only if hundreds of millions of non blacks were brought into every black country and only into black countries
5320719 how long would it take anyone to realize im not talking about a race problem i am talking about the final solution to the black problem
5320720 and how long would it take any sane black man to notice this and what kind of psycho black man wouldnt object to this
5320721 but if i tell that obvious truth about the ongoing program of genocide against my race the white race liberals and respectable conservatives agree that i am a naziwhowantstokillsixmillionjews

5320749 deep concerns about the news standards and level of objectivity
5320750 the obama people must feel that he didnt do quite as well as they wanted to in that context
5320751 because what they are putting out privately is that mccain may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama
5320752 we are extremely disappointed to see that the level of objectivity at nbc news has fallen so low that reporters are now giving voice to unsubstantiated partisan claims in order to undercut john mccain
5320753 a lot of our guys think the iraqi army cant handle it on their own

5320800 with less than three months to go before the election a lot of people are still trying to square sen obamas varying positions on the surge in iraq first he opposed the surge and confidently predicted that it would fail then he tried to prevent funding for the troops who carried out the surge
5320801 not content to merely predict failure in iraq my opponent tried to legislate failure
5320802 the lasting advantage of a peaceful and democratic ally in the heart of the middle east could still be squandered by hasty withdrawal and arbitrary timelines and this is one of many problems in the shifting positions of my opponent senator obama

5320948 there has been a tremendous rise in consumer interest in modular homes because they are generally less expensive and more environmentally friendly than stick built homes
5320949 the days are long gone when just calling yourself a modular home or system built company is considered environmentally progressive modular homes are now being made from materials like reused shipping containers recycled steel recycled plastic and certified sustainably harvested wood the new challenge for the modular housing industry is balancing the economics of innovative sustainable design with the realities of construction costs
5320950 the majority of modular home companies in the united states are energy star ready that means when a home leaves a factory it is an energy star certified these homes must meet the guidelines for energy efficiency set forth by the u s environmental protection agency that is they must be at least 15 more energy efficient than homes built to the international residential code irc and include additional energy saving features that typically makes them 20 30 more efficient than standard homes
5320951 one big misconception with green construction is higher building costs while its true that using green materials is more expensive especially three or four years ago the costs have dramatically come down in recent years making it more affordable
5320952 renting cars allows people to explore the hidden gems of holiday destinations we usually only get to see the paperwork side of the car hire business so for a change we want to see where people go in the cars they hire from us
5320953 our previous work in this area showed real potential for an enhanced gun system on the navys ships
5320954 this contract will allow more concentrated research and a live land based firing trial in 2009 will inform further developments on the programme

5320958 the honorary degree president franklin roosevelt accepted at queens and the historic convocation address he delivered that day is one of the most significant events in the history of our university
5320959 we are very grateful that mr mulroney has chosen to help us mark our unique connection to president roosevelt and canadian american relations through this generous donation it will become an honored part of our collections
5320960 the speech by president roosevelt at queens university is a true milestone in canadian american relations
5320961 he visited the queens campus as the worlds clouds darkened with the threat of war and pledged that his nation would defend canada if his neighbour was ever attacked i recall learning about the queens speech in my own student days at st francis xavier university and i am pleased to be able to donate this important artifact to the canadian university where the speech was given i hope queens students of today and in the future will find it valuable for their studies
5320962 during our time in joint office president clinton and i were able to work effectively on trade and other bilateral issues and continue the crucial tradition of close canada us cooperation on a multi lateral level in world affairs
5320963 as i wrote in my memoirs bill clinton with whom i served for only a matter of months january until june 1993 is clearly the most gifted politician by far of his generation we developed an excellent personal relationship and i was not surprised to see him evolve as a highly effective world leader we remain friends to this day
5320964 this is indeed an exciting day for queens archives and its holdings filling the one gap in the documentation of one of the most important events to ever take place at queens
5320965 mr mulroneys generous gift consisting of several pages of president roosevelts speaking notes on the occasion of receiving an honorary degree is added to the documentation we already have of this historic convocation from its conception through its meticulous planning to its actual delivery
5320966 the korean peoples army will not stand idly by as the bellicose forces in the u s and the south mount the ulchi freedom guardian as conservative u s hard liners brand us a rogue state again and erase a series of progress made on denuclearizing the korean peninsula
5320967 that mccain may not have been in the cone of silence and may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama he seemed so well prepared
5320968 senator mccain was in a motorcade led by the united states secret service and held in a green room with no broadcast feed
5320969 may not have been in the cone of silence and may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama
5320970 the obama people must feel that he didnt do quite as well as they might have wanted to in that context because what they are putting out privately is that mccain may not have been in the cone of silence and may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama he seemed so well prepared

5320975 were going to talk about anything that anyone wants to talk about at this conference
5320976 this is an energy summit to look at everything there is no silver bullet
5320977 in the hopes that we will steer the energy policies of the next administration
5320978 if he didnt like it then we need to come up with something because obama and mccain are members of the senate they should be required to vote on something this important
5320979 it is not the responsibility of the federal reserve nor would it be appropriate to protect lenders and investors from the consequences of their financial decisions
5320980 too many underlying factors have started to work in favor of the dollar to dismiss the recent bounce as temporary

5320983 one of the worlds most committed partners in the war against terrorism and extremism
5320984 people come out and tell us that they appreciate us being there and they appreciate what were trying to do
5320985 and the ones who dont appreciate what were trying to do are usually the guys we are detaining at two in the morning
5320986 any murderer is going to have clout with a potential victim but the special groups extremists are losing that with the people to a certain extent
5320987 they have changed their operations from night time to day time to avoid us they dont own the night we do
5320988 they dont want them chasing their daughters influencing their sons
5320989 the people are getting tired of that stuff and i dont think their influence is that big here anymore
5320990 he wasnt trying to give us a lot of baloney he was laying it straight and he trusted us to be able to have that conversation without fear or reprisal he even told us where the bad guys were and everything
5320991 our mission differentiates every night but our main goal is to clean up the streets and help rebuild abu tshir and give abu tshir back to the people so they can live a free life
5320992 right now it seems like nobody is out here but we know that special groups extremists are somewhere around and when we come through the muhallahs they scatter
5320993 they scatter like the rats when they see the headlights
5320994 that is our only focus no matter what it takes to get it done
5320995 they acted like there was a curfew in effect even though there wasnt they didnt mingle we didnt see the kids out playing we didnt see smiles i think they were really scared of what they had coming
5320996 the strategic planning put us exactly where we are at today even though the public and lot of government officials didnt have faith it really pulled us through
5320997 we try to keep them updated as far as what we know is happening and what is in the works
5320998 if we can keep them in a good flow of information we hope that buys a little more patience and that patience is our survival
5320999 these are some of the best iraqi national police i have ever worked with the best iraqi security forces i have ever worked with
5321000 the national police also go out on their own they do their own patrols
5321001 they are really high speed i would compare them to a joe the way that they react is like a regular army soldier
5321002 but as we started doing close encounters and started talking to the people i dont think that reputation is true anymore
5321003 were always going to have spikes in enemy activity but i think overall were going to be able to maintain
5321004 people are changing theyre accepting our help and at the same time they want us out of here so i think they are starting to realize that if they work with us well help them a lot more
5321005 was retarded but kind of awesome right in fact the more and more we watch
5321006 the crazy uncle in the attic no one wants to acknowledge its presence in the marketplace let alone its success

5321009 in order to get approval for the night races from the fia it was essential that the solution presented met very strict safety requirements as well as delivering the best experience for drivers spectators and broadcasters philips heritage in the sporting arena made it a natural choice

5321011 we knew we could vastly improve the customer experience by deploying an online booking application to enhance our existing web site ibm came in and really pulled the project together in an amazingly short period of time five months compressing a development cycle that was slated to take 12 months
5321012 when customers book a tour the application is simultaneously booking reservations for hotels buses and so on
5321013 we needed our online system to extend the complexities built into our core business systems out to the web without making the process too complicated for our customers the websphere commerce solution did this without having to completely rewrite our back end systems
5321014 this project is a great example of how ibm is helping clients adapt to constantly changing conditions such as rising fuel costs and new terms of engagement between airlines and travel agencies
5321015 using ibm software and soa companies like vantage can make it easier and less expensive for consumers to book vacations while reducing the time and money it takes to manage a complex business and web site like this

5321019 younger children seem more interested in setting short term goals for their learning in the game compared to older children who are more interested in simply playing and the actions of playing
5321020 thus younger children may show a greater need for focusing on small aspects of a given problem than older children even in a leisure based situation such as playing video games
5321021 the big picture is that there are several dimensions on which games have effects including the amount they are played the content of each game what you have to pay attention to on the screen and how you control the motions
5321022 this means that games are not good or bad but are powerful educational tools and have many effects we might not have expected they could
5321023 our hope is that with these changes tuesday will be smoother given the severity of the problems today however we do expect that getting the system completely smoothed out will take a few days
5321024 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
5321025 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
5321026 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5321027 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5321028 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5321029 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5321030 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
5321031 at the heart of our portal is that you can get a lot of information from the community
5321032 theres been user generated content in investing for a long time but its been in the form of discussion boards
5321033 with discussion boards things tend to fall off the bottom of the page and theres little incentive to make a really good post our site gives people a platform where they can share their knowledge
5321034 weve put in mechanisms to help prevent stuff like that
5321035 people are encouraged to build a long term reputation on the site
5321036 the only people who bother to spend a lot of time writing are the people who actually know something about the topic
5321037 i was frustrated that the personal finance blogosphere didnt really have a center spot
5321038 so i began putting together a catalog of personal finance blogs with listings by topic i came up with a framework that i hoped would make it easier for readers to find out the main theme of a blog i gave the opportunity for people to list their main topics give a summary of their blogs purpose and their views and even link to their best posts i hoped that this would be useful for readers to find blogs which fit what they were looking for and that bloggers would be willing to participate because it was free advertising
5321039 now that the former part is doing well id like to get more personal finance information itself on the site
5321040 sort of a stage two what are index funds what is a 401 k
5321041 i think its currently unique for its focus on the blogosphere for both bloggers and readers
5321042 there are lots of great finance facts in for example but nothing ive seen about personal finance blogs accumulating finance information is only one of the finwikians goals the main goal being to link people to sites which will provide them a more daily dose if they subscribe
5321043 people like to have a voice and they like flexibility
5321044 nothing is static on a wiki you can add your own blog listing or point of view to a topic then readers like to be able to find information quickly i hope people like this one because it helps them find useful information even if thats not on the wiki itself

5321078 we have six adirondack chairs decorated by different artists in the silent auction
5321079 the piece don gorvett created for the 55th anniversary will also be auctioned off
5321080 a couple of people had seen the chairs decorated and thought it would be an extraordinary idea for a fundraiser

5321277 im 11 years old and im not a huge fan of the jonas brothers sure i like their music but im not one who will scream their head off and pay 200 dollars per ticket to get into their concert still i absolutely loved this movie the music was great and the actors are very talented when it comes to singing i wasnt mesmerized by their acting but hey no one is going to like a movie for just acting the voices of the actors are enough for me if you want a fun chick flick kind of movie or even if you just want to relax and be able to sing along to the songs then absolutely get this movie
5321278 yes i am one of those girls who screams and pays 50 bucks for one the jonas brothers tickets but it is a cute film from disney with good remodels for younger kids it is very good i loved it
5321279 this movie is so great its great for all ages the jonas brothers where so good in this movie so was demi lovato and everyone eles having to dill with lieing in the movie it teachs you a lesson
5321280 if you like to sing watch the movie its awsome i loved it it was like the best movie ever to me i liked best

5321287 sultanas view was that scotts brain was too clouded and i think my personal feeling is that sultana had done everything that could be done with the work very reverently after a huge amount of research
5321288 i respect what edinburgh university press is doing if youre going to do something complete you might as well publish everything but i dont think scott would have wanted it published himself
5321289 shouldnt have been published because walter scott was not quite himself and that his son in law had expressed a wish that it should not be published
5321290 we feel these are interesting valuable works and should be made available to people
5321291 the editors have worked very hard to render them understandable
5321292 repeating words very close to each other in a clumsy way

5321371 but i do really believe in this horse and im glad that hes taking his chance
5321372 hes very well the ground is not ideal but hopefully it will dry out somewhat
5321373 hes won over a mile and a half and hes won on heavy before as well hopefully he is strong enough now to take on the battle hardened older horses
5321374 he ran on heavy ground last year so hopefully that wont cause a problem
5321375 jim is happy with the horse and we are looking forward to seeing him on the racecourse again
5321376 its always a big challenge taking on older horses in a race like this but hes a derby winner so he deserves to take his chance

5321399 hai ahli kitab marilah berpegang kepada suatu kalimat ketetapan yang tidak ada perselisihan antara kami dan kamu bahwa tidak kita sembah kecuali allah dan tidak kita persekutukan dia dengan sesuatu pun dan tidak pula sebagian kita menjadikan sebagian yang lain sebagai tuhan selain allah

5321401 at the heart of our portal is that you can get a lot of information from the community
5321402 theres been user generated content in investing for a long time but its been in the form of discussion boards
5321403 with discussion boards things tend to fall off the bottom of the page and theres little incentive to make a really good post our site gives people a platform where they can share their knowledge
5321404 weve put in mechanisms to help prevent stuff like that
5321405 people are encouraged to build a long term reputation on the site
5321406 the only people who bother to spend a lot of time writing are the people who actually know something about the topic
5321407 i was frustrated that the personal finance blogosphere didnt really have a center spot
5321408 so i began putting together a catalog of personal finance blogs with listings by topic i came up with a framework that i hoped would make it easier for readers to find out the main theme of a blog i gave the opportunity for people to list their main topics give a summary of their blogs purpose and their views and even link to their best posts i hoped that this would be useful for readers to find blogs which fit what they were looking for and that bloggers would be willing to participate because it was free advertising
5321409 now that the former part is doing well id like to get more personal finance information itself on the site
5321410 sort of a stage two what are index funds what is a 401 k
5321411 i think its currently unique for its focus on the blogosphere for both bloggers and readers
5321412 there are lots of great finance facts in for example but nothing ive seen about personal finance blogs accumulating finance information is only one of the finwikians goals the main goal being to link people to sites which will provide them a more daily dose if they subscribe
5321413 people like to have a voice and they like flexibility
5321414 nothing is static on a wiki you can add your own blog listing or point of view to a topic then readers like to be able to find information quickly i hope people like this one because it helps them find useful information even if thats not on the wiki itself
5321415 it defies common sense and it defies imagination and for people to keep on pushing this is offensive
5321416 partner with the west on the middle east iran and north korea
5321417 the events in the caucasus show clearly that such security guarantees are indispensable
5321418 we believe that missile defense is a substantial contribution to natos collective security
5321419 loyalty to the us and receive material benefits for the americans it is an opportunity to expand its military presence across the world including closer to russia for nato this is an additional risk many nato countries are unhappy with this including the germans and the french
5321420 a program could be implemented to create orbital ballistic missiles capable of reaching us territory via the south pole skirting us air defense bases
5321421 theyre both fine but they just wont like the ground as testing as it will be on wednesday theyre not soft ground horses
5321422 hes a big strong horse and hes won on soft ground before so lets hope he can handle it on wednesday
5321423 it is a big ask from top weight and he does have to give quite a bit of weight to young mick but everything is a worry when youre taking on 19 others horses
5321424 our worst two ante post results are 8 1 chances young mick and wicked daze but young mick has shown his best form on fast ground while wicked daze has yet to race on anything softer than good ground
5321425 ante post punters have no going worries about mad rush who showed he relishes soft ground when an easy winner of the old newton cup and we have cut his odds to 5 1 from 7 1
5321426 he was our 10 1 favourite when we opened betting on the race on july 14 and looks certain to start favourite on the day

5321436 it was very hard for me i di not have a lot of confidence but then the coach told me to calm down and i managed to win the game
5321437 during the current crisis the government says it until further notice will not conduct military manoeuvres with russia or visit russian military units

5321445 the patrol identified insurgents with weapons on the roof of the compound preparing to attack and in order to protect themselves launched three rockets all of which hit the target
5321446 unbeknown to the patrol the civilians were inside the compound at the time

5321448 she said shed bake a cake after church next easter sunday
5321449 a leader that god has blessed us with at this time
5321450 now you want to win and saying it doesnt make it so
5321451 it would be nice to think that after eight years of economic disaster after eight years of bungled foreign policy of being engaged in a war that should never have been authorized and should never have been waged that cost us a trillion dollars and thousands of lives that people would say lets toss the bums out toss the bums out were starting from scratch were starting over this is not working
5321452 so i understand why a lot of folks are saying this should just happen why are we having to run all these television commercials why do we have to raise all this money just read the papers these are the knuckleheads who have been in charge throw em out but american politics arent that simple
5321453 the fact of the matter is at a certain point when government has not been serving the people for this long people get cynical they tune out and they start saying to themselves a plague on both your houses they are willing to consume negative information more frequently than positive information for good reason theyve seen how promises havent been kept
5321454 this is a major public health concern that should be given serious consideration in future urban development transportation planning and environmental policies
5321455 health risk can be mitigated through proper urban planning but that doesnt erase the immediate risk to school age children attending schools that are too close to highways right now
5321456 existing schools should be retrofitted with air filtration systems that will reduce students exposure to traffic pollutants
5321457 for many years our focus has been on homes when it comes to air pollution school attendance may result in a large dose of inhaled traffic pollutants that ntil now ave been completely overlooked
5321458 major roads play an important role in the economy but we need to strike a balance between economic and health considerations as we break ground on new areas
5321459 policymakers need to develop new effective strategies that would encourage urban planners to reconsider our current infrastructure particularly when it comes to building new schools and maintaining existing ones

5321527 contract management professionals are keen to capitalize on global opportunities but they face new challenges in doing so including increased volumes of contracts the need to protect intellectual property overseas disparate and changing regulatory requirements and the necessity of mitigating risks across multiple jurisdictions
5321528 given these challenges the importance of effective contract management cannot be underestimated
5321529 few companies surveyed reported that they have a centralized or center led contract management organization
5321530 furthermore many lack standard procedures for contract management and leverage home grown systems of spreadsheets and databases that are not scalable and fail to provide the access and visibility needed to drive cross functional collaboration

5321562 yet despite the traditional prominence of psychotherapy in psychiatric practice and training there are indications of a recent decline in the provision of psychotherapy by u s psychiatrists a trend attributed to reimbursement policies favoring brief medication management visits rather than psychotherapy and the introduction of newer psychotropic medications with fewer adverse effects
5321563 this decline coincided with changes in reimbursement increases in managed care and growth in the prescription of medications
5321564 psychiatrists who provided psychotherapy to all of their patients relied more extensively on self pay patients had fewer managed care visits and prescribed medications in fewer of their visits compared with psychiatrists who provided psychotherapy less often
5321565 these trends highlight a gradual but important change in the content of outpatient psychiatric care in the united states and a continued shift toward medicalization of psychiatric practice
5321566 a key challenge facing the future generation of psychiatrists will likely involve maintaining their professional role as integrators of the biological and psychosocial perspectives while working within the constraints of the strong market forces of third party payers and managed care to implement advances in the diagnosis and treatment of mental disorders

5321595 the research reveals that self service is no longer a stand alone extension to the business and its existing processes but an integrated part of the organisation which complements call centres and physical branches
5321596 were also seeing that companies are offering customers a growing range of alternative self service options including the web kiosks atms cell phones speech self service and interactive voice response ivr
5321597 the concept of self service is becoming increasingly familiar to consumers customers are becoming used to serving themselves across a range of channels and applications from self service for parking and movie theatre tickets up to online banking and automated flight check ins
5321598 in many industries self service options that were once a nice to have or a competitive edge have simply become a ticket to play most consumers today wouldnt even think about joining a bank that doesnt have a solid internet banking platform expect self service to become as central in many other industries over the next few years
5321599 i was discussing taxes with a person on facebook on the issue of the election and he brought up the argument that the government should be allowed to step into society and create social programs to help the people he then argued that there is nothing wrong with using taxes to give to others

5321603 my religion consists of a humble admiration of the illimitable superior spirit who reveals himself in the slight details we are able to perceive with our frail and feeble minds that deeply emotional conviction of the presence of a superior reasoning power which is revealed in the incomprehensible universe forms my idea of god
5321604 im not an atheist and i dont think i can call myself a pantheist we are in the position of a little child entering a huge library filled with books in many languages the child knows someone must have written those books it does not know how it does not understand the languages in which they are written the child dimly suspects a mysterious order in the arrangement of the books but doesnt know what it is that it seems to me is the attitude of even the most intelligent human being toward god we see the universe marvelously arranged and obeying certain laws but only dimly understand these laws our limited minds grasp the mysterious force that moves the constellations
5321605 thus i came to a deep religiosity which however reached an abrupt end at the age of 12 through the reading of popular scientific books i soon reached a conviction that much in the stories of the bible could not be true suspicion against every kind of authority grew out of this experience an attitude which has never left me
5321606 i dont try to imagine a god it suffices to stand in awe of the structure of the world insofar as it allows our inadequate senses to appreciate it
5321607 science without religion is lame religion without science is blind
5321608 i cannot imagine a god who rewards and punishes the objects of his creation whose purposes are modeled after our own a god in short who is but a reflection of human frailty it is enough for me to contemplate the mystery of conscious life perpetuating itself through all eternity to reflect upon the marvelous structure of the universe which we can dimly perceive and to try humbly to comprehend even an infinitesimal part of the intelligence manifested in nature
5321609 the scientist is possessed by the sense of universal causation his religious feeling takes the form of a rapturous amazement at the harmony of natural law which reveals an intelligence of such superiority that compared with it all the systematic thinking and acting of human beings is an utterly insignificant reflection
5321610 in spite of all this i dont let a single opportunity pass unheeded nor have i lost my sense of humor when god created the ass he gave him a thick skin
5321611 where dull witted clansmen of our tribe were praying aloud their faces turned to the wall their bodies swaying to and fro a pathetic sight of men with a past but without a future
5321612 should we be unable to find a way to honest cooperation and honest pacts with the arabs then we have learned absolutely nothing during our 2 000 years of suffering and deserve all that will come to us
5321613 i appeal to all men and women whether they be eminent or humble to declare that they will refuse to give any further assistance to war or the preparation of war
5321614 it is my belief that the problem of bringing peace to the world on a supranational basis will be solved only by employing gandhis method on a larger scale
5321615 then for goodness sake tell me what it is dont keep me in suspense

5321640 it administrators know that archiving is just one of a number of chores in effective data management which requires full control and unbounded flexibility over not just archived email but live email and discovered pst files

5321642 while much corporate email is mission critical an excessive amount of scarce it resources can be wasted on uncritical data
5321643 our research indicates that organizations will archive an estimated 30 000 petabytes of e mail over the next five years mandating the need to automate some of the processes before and after retention policies are sent archive one with intelligent actions represents a systematic and efficient approach to managing email in this content resulting in far more effective use of it resources

5321652 whoever does such things gets mixed up in such things commits suicide and when someone wants to commit suicide nobody can stop them
5321653 of course it has to be organized when there are so many cases with the same substance

5321711 so who are using these services a high ranking amazon executive told me there are 60 000 different customers across the various amazon web services and most of them are not the startups that are normally associated with on demand computing rather the biggest customers in both number and amount of computing resources consumed are divisions of banks pharmaceuticals companies and other large corporations who try aws once for a temporary project and then get hooked

5321713 we knew we could vastly improve the customer experience by deploying an online booking application to enhance our existing web site ibm came in and really pulled the project together in an amazingly short period of time five months compressing a development cycle that was slated to take 12 months
5321714 when customers book a tour the application is simultaneously booking reservations for hotels buses and so on
5321715 we needed our online system to extend the complexities built into our core business systems out to the web without making the process too complicated for our customers the websphere commerce solution did this without having to completely rewrite our back end systems
5321716 this project is a great example of how ibm is helping clients adapt to constantly changing conditions such as rising fuel costs and new terms of engagement between airlines and travel agencies
5321717 using ibm software and soa companies like vantage can make it easier and less expensive for consumers to book vacations while reducing the time and money it takes to manage a complex business and web site like this
5321718 gwyneth paltrow wont be the apple of her daughters eye if she continues to flaunt fur

5321720 gwyneth effortlessly embodies the spirit of the all american woman with timeless elegance and modern flair the perfect representation of the tods woman
5321721 there is nothing feminine about inserting an electrode into the anus of a terrified and struggling fox and then electrocuting it ms paltrow is an actress and seemingly a particularly stupid one at that

5321757 the dia research dates from 1976 and shows the dangers were known about over twenty years ago the soviets used the frequencies and intensities used by mobile phones 1800 mhz and 900 mhz as weapons it is a rule of the intelligence community that you hide things in plain view getting the public to accept microwave mind control weapons which affect their behavior under the guise of mobile phones was a stroke of genius getting the public to pay for these microwave mind control devices so their brains and behavior can be damaged to make them more docile and easy to control was pure diabolical genius
5321758 what happens when the fbi spends millions of dollars targeting an american citizen for an illegal cointelpro operation while perpetrating precedent setting violations of that citizens constitutional rights yet fails to arrest that person the fbi then uses the media to slander the targeted person and coercion to blackmail those around the target including the targets family into keeping silent in regard to the torture they are being subjected to in efforts to drive them to suicide such precedent setting crimes are now being perpetrated against my person by the fbi nsa amp dhs you could be their next victim
5321759 the indigo blue ribbon campaign to promote the awareness of people targeted for mind control amp organized stalking crimes
5321760 what is the us federal government doing using satellites to spy on americans within the privacy of their own homes this has been occurring since long before the 9 11 attacks black operations which were an inside job perpetrated to keep the war on terror open ended so that the illuminati run us federal government can continue to erode our freedoms under the pretext of protecting us from an invisible enemy
5321761 it is illegal amp against its charter for the nsa to spy domestically unless it receives permission from the fisa court to do so and then only if it can prove that the american citizen to be placed under surveillance is in contact with an international terrorist so exactly what is the nsa doing illegally spying on myself and millions of other unwitting americans
5321762 nsa personnel can dial up any individual in the country on the signals lntelligence emf scanning network and the nsas computers will then pinpoint and track that person 24 hours a day the nsa can pick out and track anyone in the u s
5321763 the followings a diagram of the type of mind control software that agencies like the nsa utilize on targets of illegal mind control research any american citizen can be targeted for this satellite based weaponry at any time without their knowledge or consent
5321764 we need a program of psychosurgery for political control of our society the purpose is physical control of the mind everyone who deviates from the given norm can be surgically mutilated the individual may think that the most important reality is his own existence but this is only his personal point of view this lacks historical perspective man does not have the right to develop his own mind this kind of liberal orientation has great appeal we must electrically control the brain some day armies and generals will be controlled by electric stimulation of the brain
5321765 consider the damage done to us as a people by the us congress cia fbi dod nsa and dhs alone the biological chemical and electronic warfare that they have subjected so many of us to the illegal and humiliating nsa satellite spying of us within the privacy of our own domiciles the inhumanity of their mind control torture the complete manipulation of the us economy through the illuminati controlled federal reserve bank and irs and the treasonous crimes committed by them through the improperly ratified and unconstitutional federal reserve act the us federal governments usurpation and manipulation of the us media through the cias operation mockingbird the abject treason of the attacks on 9 11 and one can only arrive at the following conclusion only a population that is either extremely ignorant of the facts or masochistic would ever allow for a government which is such anathema to exist within their country
5321766 so to begin i want to state the most basic of all facts about brainwashing in the entire history of man no one has ever been brainwashed and realized or believed that he had been brainwashed
5321767 nothing would warrant the monitoring of individuals every minute habit 24 7 unless theyre us intelligence doing illegal inhumane testing
5321768 the most powerful weapon in the hands of the oppressor is the mind of the oppressed
5321769 the extensive crimes against humanity which the us federal government controlled by the privately held federal reserve bank has perpetrated against the american people which includes the crime of menticide are so far reaching that in most instances its beyond their comprehension the people of this planet must stop thinking in groups amp starting thinking for themselves the illuminati has us convinced that we should be fighting eachother as in making war on other countries when it is the illuminati which operates through our banking systems amp governments whom we should be working to destroy

5321945 the result however has been the most amazing experience in the world being called daddy and dad by our loving daughter
5321946 all the realms involved with men are much more complex
5321947 for future generations knowing they can fall in love get married have a child absolutely that will become a way of life more than it is

5322012 i was looking for a good pitch and it was out there over the plate

5322030 demand for commodities will remain at a high level in countries like china and india if we see a serious worldwide recession then we will see the end of the commodities boom
5322031 commodities cant be completely immune to the fact that there is a global slowdown taking place
5322032 that doesnt mean we should abandon commodities for the next 5 years there are still very strong supply demand dynamics in place for the next few years

5322062 now if perhaps any of these women were living inside compounds as amy used to do with no way to speak to outsiders and no access to a computer that would be extreme but amy in fact left that way of life to live with and marry another former scientologist perhaps you might consider her an extreme in her desire to not return to scientology but if anything her family whom the producers didnt reach and who now refuse to see their newly pregnant daughter may be the ones with extreme belief

5322088 anyone who tries to do something of the kind will receive a powerful response and russia has the capabilities for this economic political and military
5322089 the act of aggression on the part of georgias authorities is unprecedented it goes beyond understanding when a country whose army has been equipped by another country uses its armed forces against civilians against peacekeepers
5322090 we have always been a peace loving nation the russian soviet state has never started a war but even the most peace loving state should have an effective army
5322091 in indonesia alone only 6 percent of the coral reefs remain in top condition
5322092 if we want to protect coral reefs and rehabilitate fisheries it is not by planting new corals it is by educating people and changing their mindsets

5322156 tent camp residents have little or no access to basic services cannot protect themselves against the elements or extreme weather and are located far away from medical care education and other services
5322157 these harsh conditions combined with a cultural aversion to living without familial privacy and personal dignity make tent camps a last resort for iraqi idps
5322158 families who were evicted from public buildings live in cramped tents and caravans with limited sanitation and drinking water
5322159 we have only two generators for the whole camp and sometimes we have to wait for days or weeks to get them repaired when they break down
5322160 also every five to 10 tents shares one toilet and that embarrasses families as they cant have privacy and that is why weve dug a pit in one corner of our tent

5322166 there was a desire on both sides to find a conclusion to this issue
5322167 this is a very important agreement this turns a new page in our relationship

5322172 at a time when students with disabilities in new york are succeeding and meeting the same rigorous regents requirements as their non disabled peers it would be nothing short of immoral to derail their progress by passing an election year gimmick that would only harm our public education system and fail to bring any meaningful tax relief to new yorkers
5322173 the special education services my son receives play an essential role in his education
5322174 a loss in the resources necessary to pay for these services would put him at an increased disadvantage and hurt his ability to perform he should have the same opportunity to succeed as every other child attending public school
5322175 we have seen firsthand that with the right resources including small classes we not only can raise the bar for children with disabilities but we can see them clear that bar
5322176 gov paterson and the state legislature should be acting to help even more students achieve rather than debating wrong headed policies that would only place additional obstacles in our childrens way
5322177 state lawmakers must not turn their backs on our most vulnerable students for the sake of political expedience
5322178 the legislature must keep its promise and ensure that our schools are provided the necessary funding and resources so that all of our children have the same chance to succeed
5322179 the implications are that tels tax and expenditure limits are most constraining on the ability of governments serving economically less prosperous and at risk populations to meet public service needs
5322180 tax limits systematically reduce the average quality of education majors as well as new public school teachers in states that have passed these limits
5322181 the average relative test scores of education majors in tax limit states declined by ten percent as compared to the relative test scores of education majors in states that did not pass limits
5322182 our children require specialists special needs teachers speech pathologists occupational and physical therapists and teaching assistants to help them stay in an inclusive classroom this requires a lot more money than regular curriculum the additional money that the state pays is not nearly enough in our district alone the number of children enrolled in special needs programs has doubled in the past two years my daughter has lost access to several regular classrooms she asked me if this is happening because i forgot to give her a good brain when i made her

5322193 it isnt an easy issue because it goes to the heart of our deepest questions about god after all the argument runs how could a loving and gracious god allow suffering to put it another way if god lets us suffer he must not love us and the proof is the suffering he allowed his son to endure on the cross so what then is the answer to this age old question
5322194 christian man who has been an invalid all his life one of those lonely and obscure people who live in constant pain who do not know what it means to be able to use their physical body in any way without pain and suffering
5322195 lonliness is not a thing of itself not an evil sent to rob us of the joys of life loneliness loss pain sorrow suffering these are disicplines gods gifts to drive us to his very heart to increase our capacity for him to sharpen our sensitivities and understanding to temper our spirtitual lives so that they may become channels of his mercy to others and to bear fruit for his kingdom but these disciplines must be seized upon and used not thwarted or opposed they must not be seen as excuses for living in the shadow of half lives but as messengers however painful to bring our souls into vital contact with the living god that our lives may be filled to overflowing with himself in ways that may perhaps be impossible who know less of lifes darkness
5322196 he who cant endure the bad will not live to see the good

5322207 this an article to show that adam and eve did not know the difference between good and evil before they ate the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil therefore could not understand the consequences of what they were doing
5322208 here is where people become accountable for knowing about the tree of knowledge of good and evil at this point they still do not know the difference between good and evil
5322209 eve is now introduced to her first experience with someone whose intent may be to decieve her and possibly manipulate her and she doesnt know the difference between good and evil
5322210 there was evidently no warning about the snake there are several default reasoning schemes that people commonly use and seem to present naturally it takes education and experience to be able to overcome these presumably since eve and adam were human uneducated and with no life experience to speak of they were susceptible to most if not all of these
5322211 people like stories and are willing to give the teller of the story the benefit of the doubt about the truth of it
5322212 people are more likely to believe a story if it comes from someone they like
5322213 people are more likely to believe a story if it fits with what they already believe or want to believe
5322214 people look for confirmation of what they already believe and disregard things that contradict
5322215 people are more likely to believe a story if it comes from an authority
5322216 eve gave the snake the benefit of the the doubt she evidently did not dislike him
5322217 and she undoubtedly took it to be authoritative about the tree
5322218 neither eve or adam had any wisdom or knowledge of good and evil at this point
5322219 she trusted the snake because she did not have any reason not to
5322220 there is no indication that they had any idea about lying
5322221 adam and eve both had built in cognitive biases that come into play here such as trusting what others say
5322222 desire was apparently built into eve as described in gen 3 6
5322223 they were following the natural cognitive processes that they were born with untempered by education
5322224 the snake could not have known the difference between good and evil unless it had acquired it from somewhere
5322225 in any case it was smarter than eve because it knew that she would not literally die
5322226 the desire was built into her and humans have or acquire cognitive biases that must be unlearned

5322237 the track looks amazing and the location is fantastic so i am really looking forward to this grand prix the team has worked hard to prepare for this race because it is a new track for all of us but from a drivers point of view the important thing is to drive it for the first time and then you can start to understand more about the circuit i enjoy going to new venues because they are a new challenge and there is always something to discover every race is unique and i like that even though this is a new track for us i know valencia pretty well from all the testing we have done at the other circuit there it is a lively city and there always seems to be something going on so it should be a fun weekend i am expecting a competitive weekend as well because at the moment we are looking quite strong scoring more points is our target and if we challenge for the podium again that would be great
5322238 im still smiling after hungary that was an incredible result and a fantastic feeling i hope it will be the first of many podiums in formula 1 the important thing was that we showed just how competitive we are at the moment and moved further ahead in fourth place in the constructors championship there is a great atmosphere in the team and we are all working hard together to move forward which is why it was so satisfying to get on the podium in hungary but valencia is a new race and we must start again i did plenty of street races when i was racing in champ cars and in that season almost all the tracks were new to me so i have learnt to adapt quickly it looks like an interesting circuit and its quite long so it should be a good show we will have plenty of work to do on friday to adjust the car to the track but we are in good form at the moment so i am optimistic for this weekend

5322321 chart music today is often so gloriously maximal that reproducing any of its thrills on limited means can seem an impossible task by paying attention to detail peter bjorn and johns bjorn yttling and lis prove that doesnt have to be the case but even more impressive is the way their intimate playful miniatures capture the daring and novelty of modern pop as well as its hooks

5322324 before you read it in some dumb article or online let me be the first to say it we broke up about two weeks ago i am not ready to be in a relationship at the moment ive been married once before and im not entirely sure i want to do it again
5322325 as far as the breakup goes there are no hard feelings and we are still friends i will always love him this is a hard time for both of us
5322326 and if nothing else its helped me slim down a breakup is always a great diet
5322327 he was talking about how they were friends for a long time but that they decided to call it off
5322328 what are they doing where are they going whats happening i dont get it any more they lost me i still appreciate what theyre doing or what theyre trying to do but i think theyre trying too hard not to be radiohead that seems a little ridiculous to me

5322335 newer evidence describes how curcumin interacts with certain proteins to generate anti cancer activity inside the body were focusing on the pathways that are most involved in cancer and trying to optimize for those properties
5322336 most of the interaction between our compound and the overactive protein comes from what are called hot spots on the proteins surface
5322337 for each spot we can design small chemical fragments and link them together to make a molecule this is what computer aided design and modeling can do
5322338 very small changes that may seem insignificant can have dramatic effects on these toxicity properties
5322339 but most of the compounds weve made have been more potent than curcumin against the cancer cells
5322340 to be able to develop a drug that in the future could have potential to treat 50 percent of these cancers would be a major contribution

5322347 we found that if a teacher has a high achieving group of students pushing them harder by giving them more homework could be beneficial
5322348 similarly if a teacher has a low ability class assigning more homework may help since they may not have been pushed hard enough but for the average achieving classes who may have been given too much homework in an attempt to equate them with the high achieving classes educators could be better served by using other methods to improve student achievement given these students abilities and time constraints learning by doing may be a more effective tool for improvement
5322349 there has been an extensive amount of research examining the influences of students achievement but it has been primarily focused on financial inputs such as class size or teachers credentials
5322350 our study examined the affect that additional homework has on test scores
5322351 this does not mean that homework is unimportant for average achievers
5322352 but it does mean that this population may also benefit from other activities such as sports art or music rather than additional hours of math homework
5322353 in my own personal experience i see that each semester requires a different approach
5322354 this is even true when i teach the same course twice in a semester different times of the day or lengths of classes require different methods just as different quality students require different approaches
5322355 teachers should consider quality over quantity when it comes to homework assignments
5322356 in the end it should be up to the individual teacher to decide how to motivate and educate their students

5322407 every man under my command owes me 100 nazi scalps and yall will git get me 100 nazi scalps taken from the heads of 100 dead nazis or die trying
5322408 it is not just the scalping or the carving of swastikas in foreheads or the shooting of a german officers testicles or the slow strangling scene all shown with tarantinos customary love of detail that is likely to upset the german nation and its critics
5322409 it is the whole idea of turning the second world war into a comic book adventure in which not a single german character has redeeming value
5322410 i dont want it to feel like a period film this is a modern in your face movie

5322414 having had personal experience eliminating arthritic problems in my life let me share with you what has worked for me please understand i am not a medical professional and would never pretend to diagnose treat prevent or cure any diseases in fact i dont believe that natural remedies cure anything i feel that if you give your body the right nutrients it will take care of you perfectly for a long time having said that i will tell you what gave me some relief but first a little background most of the cartilage in my right knee was removed 28 years ago so my right knee is basically bone on bone before i made dietary changes in my life a doctor told me i had the knee of a 72 year old man and shockingly i was only 39 at the time he said i would need a knee replacement in a few years well its been seven years and i just got back from a 3 hour 20 mile mountain bike ride over grueling terrain in the arizona desert and my right knee feels as strong as my other knee without any surgery or drugs other men my age cant understand how this is possible i can only say the difference is that i understand the need for alkaline foods as part of a diet that provides the highest quality nutrition for athletes

5322419 you dont just create an audience in this business you create a kind of community
5322420 and i need to be able to talk to this community about this and to try to assuage what i suspect will be frustration and anger at losing a voice that they felt spoke for them
5322421 until a decade ago gay people were seen as a security threat and as recently as two decades ago they were being witch hunted and sacked from the security services
5322422 it was part of the cold war mentality that saw security threats traitors and spies everywhere
5322423 gay people were regarded as vulnerable to blackmail even if they were open and out about their sexuality
5322424 my recent experience of them is that theyre not john le carre graham greene its not that sort of tableau anymore
5322425 as an intelligence officer at mi5 youll be faced with some of the most challenging issues affecting national security today
5322426 the decisions you make will play a major part in our efforts to counterterrorism espionage the spread of weapons of mass destruction and in protecting the u k s critical national infrastructure
5322427 theyre trying to portray themselves as an open inclusive organization thats working for the good of the community
5322428 it does need diverse members of society to be able to access the diverse members of society that they may have interest in
5322429 the service seeks to reflect the broad range of u k society which it serves
5322430 before the end of this year even if it means trading on a chalk board i told them they have to start dealing
5322431 i dont think the us has managed to damp foreign direct investment
5322432 has cooled an overheating economy in the first half of 2008 which helped reduce inflation rates contrary to what everyone thought
5322433 raising the price of diesel reduced inflationary expectations and everyone realized the market will stabilise

5322440 singura medalie de aur care imi lipseste din palmares este cea olimpica cu visul acesta m am reapucat in 2005 cand am revenit asupra deciziei de retragere de la atena am venit cu trei medalii nici una de aur acum sunt sigur ca una dintre acestea va fi galbena
5322441 am exercitii cu cele mai mari note de plecare si daca imi ies nu am adversar chiar si cu acest cod de punctaj si cu un pas mic la aterizare as avea un mic avantaj pentru ca am nota de plecare foarte mare sper sa am un pic de noroc sa nu am ghinioane cum am avut anul trecut cand m am intors de la competitiile majore fara medalie

5322461 but as you look further away you can start to pick out individual strands as well as features more akin to pasta shells that come from dwarfs that were on more elongated orbits
5322462 because the stream from one dwarf galaxy can wrap around the milky way and pass through streams of stars ripped from other dwarf galaxies

5322476 the old days of a page with three references and three phone numbers on it that you controlled are over
5322477 with these networking sites youve opened up your rolodex for the whole world to see
5322478 this sales person was on linkedin and he had a contact on there from one of our competitors since everyone knows everyone in this industry we contacted someone there directly
5322479 this opens the door for the prospective employer to request to speak to these references thinking that the relationship is professional in nature to validate claims made by the candidate during the interview process about their achievements and experiences
5322480 when they find that the reference is personal instead of professional a trust issue develops between the employer and prospective employee
5322481 some managers may have the feeling of freedom in cyberspace doing things from home when they dont feel the restraints of the office with the hr person looking over their shoulder
5322482 but we recommend they just give out name rank and serial number
5322483 the savvy gals guide to online networking or what would jane austen do
5322484 a lot of hiring managers are kind a lazy so if you give them a lot of good information odds are they will be less aggressive in finding things out on their own
5322485 at this juncture facebook is simply not a serious site for business at the level i place folks linkedin however is becoming increasingly more useful as a networking tool and in identifying candidates but any posted reference cant be taken seriously on any level
5322486 while some of the comments are certainly genuine with regard to service or capability to truly check references and be satisfied that we have a 360 degree view of the candidate we need to go beyond the obvious
5322487 and this means making phone calls and speaking directly to those who know the candidate including not only relying on provided reference information
5322488 i wont rule out someone whos not on facebook or linkedin but having recommendations and references up on networking sites can only help you
5322489 mom hat geweint meine schwester hat geweint ich habe geweint alles wovon ich getr umt habe ist wahr geworden

5322491 i just dont know about mixing those two environments in the same place
5322492 the idea that within a year theyll be profitable and people will be flocking to them is a fallacy
5322493 there remains an industry problem associated with broad awareness of the availability
5322494 but once you have a trial use by the consumer of this service there is very high customer satisfaction
5322495 we see clinics as an emerging industry and we expect to see continued changes and evolution in that space but i can tell you that we are excited about the strong interest that we are getting from hospitals and health care systems
5322496 the bottom line is that its difficult to first of all get this idea across and make people aware of where these locations are and then finally to feel comfortable to actually get their health care in a retail store
5322497 its a nice in between where you can actually get seen without having to wait a day or two or spending a couple of hundred dollars for an er co pay
5322498 we already have so many areas where theres i guess you could say a degraded level of health care
5322499 but balance on the board is something were taught on a daily basis im not too pleased
5322500 not so fast if you arent going to come and get me out im going to get myself out
5322501 theres not too much pressure im under the radar and hopefully i can go out there and shock myself and some other people
5322502 i put all the blood the sweat you name it all the time into competing working out now its time for me to go out there tuesday and shine
5322503 she studied sociology and criminal justice at university in nebraska
5322504 youve got to go out there thinking and believing you can do it so im hoping to go out there and break a personal best time for me if not go olympic time
5322505 anything can happen its a great track a fast track im going to go out there and break some records
5322506 i waited and waited donovan bailey and i were over there chatting and he said im a pretty confident guy i think youll get through so when he said that i was pretty convinced i would get through
5322507 being out there blind the whole race was tough but its the olympic games im blessed to be here if they made me run in the first row of the crowd i would have done that too
5322508 we all put in a pool that said whats bolts time going to be because we all knew he was going to win and literally no one predicted him to run that fast
5322509 and then seeing him run that fast by doing that slowing down at the finish was absolutely mind blowing honestly i think hes from another planet but i think theyll have to prove that after the olympics
5322510 she guessed 9 68 and we were all like tabia what are you talking about but hes an amazing athlete and its a privilege to race against him
5322511 i told them if im in the race you cant bet against me
5322512 i dont think it was serious but i didnt want to go and risk any more damage turn a strain into a pull because i felt a little discomfort coming around the corner there so i just eased up
5322513 so without doing a comparison with flash and flex despite the title of this post here are some of the things i do and dont like about silverlight
5322514 that there is insufficient evidence to justify the institution of criminal proceedings against the individual arrested by the force in connection with the disappearance of genette tate
5322515 the force is aware that the 30th anniversary is approaching and would ask any one with further information concerning this unsolved crime contact the force
5322516 sources tell me there will now be a conference between the investigation team senior officers and lawyers
5322517 a great deal of resources have gone into this reinvestigation considerable time and money
5322518 the view im getting from senior officers is that there is nowhere else to go and unless there is some significant new development that will effectively be the end of the case
5322519 will be joining weei com to provide an outsiders look at boston sports and its fans
5322520 we wanted to feature elements to reflect the movie concept while at the same time conceptualizing what would appeal to partygoers in a nightclub scenario
5322521 weve tried to pick the movies that have the most hype and are ones we can get creative with whether its through production a cast member hosting or a hot dj we can tie into the concept
5322522 it is as useless to try to sell a man something until you have first made him want to listen as it would be to command the earth to stop rotating

5322526 kyle is just so strong every time i win and he finishes second thats really a 20 point spread for us due to bonus points
5322527 so thats what we just have to keep doing is go out here and try to win the next three events and go into the chase on even ground
5322528 he is always strong hes been the guy that weve got to race on these mile and a half and two mile race tracks
5322529 hes been decent at other race tracks too but not as stout as he is at these and there are a lot of these in the chase
5322530 the replacement of systems does not automatically equate to new software market growth
5322531 software as a service cloud computing service oriented architecture web 2 0 and open source software are causing huge changes to the software market
5322532 many of these factors are impacting market growth as enterprises replace assets with per use services

5322541 in my 19 years in this business i have never seen anything like this
5322542 i have seen many buyers come in with a lot of cash money but never this much money in coins
5322543 he had dimes quarters half dollars silver and susan b anthony dollars it took me an hour and a half to count all of it
5322544 paper money will burn but it is hard to damage coins i bought four or five rolls of coins each month i dont know how long it took me to save this amount probably all my life spending some of it now in then
5322545 he gave me lunch money in coins and each time he ever gave me money it was in coins
5322546 i am amazed that we were able to talk him into buying a new truck because he is pretty tight with his money
5322547 he still wanted to fix up the old truck and keep driving it but i convinced him to give it up
5322548 he is in pretty good health now except he rambles a little when he talks

5322556 the new camaro well it accelerates like its being chased by the hounds of hell hey i can relate but enough about my love life
5322557 its a whole new kind of car for a whole new kind of people who really dig driving
5322558 its not how young you are its how old you arent
5322559 while the car shared a platform and many components with the 1969 camaro
5322560 no that is not the case the 1970 camaro is in fact the first of the second generation camaros there might be some parts interchangeability with the 69 camaro but a 1970 camaro has more in common with a 1981 camaro or a 1976 nova platform wise than it does with a 1969 camaro
5322561 the car shared a platform and many components with the 1969 camaro
5322562 your point seems to be that they are basically the same car and then you try to explain it away by saying that you meant that they were both f body cars
5322563 president bush is committed to a strong pakistan that continues its efforts to strengthen democracy and fight terror
5322564 president bush appreciates president musharrafs efforts in the democratic transition of pakistan as well as his commitment to fighting al qaeda and extremist groups
5322565 the law is very clear that each state will have its own police force with a dgp if you make these police forces efficient only a few crimes can be given to cbi the cbi is our fbi
5322566 you can give some offences to the cbi for probe which have to be investigated under the treaty obligation like terrorism money laundering as also drugs related offences for which we already have narcotics control bureau
5322567 we have ignored the police force for decades many reports on improvement of working conditions have not been implemented and the quality of police officers has not improved training programmes like this would help

5322576 great spirits have always encountered violent opposition from mediocre minds
5322577 an appeaser is one who feeds a crocodile hoping it will eat him last
5322578 affirmative action is something the good dont need and the bad dont deserve
5322579 the men who create power make an indispensable contribution to the nations greatness but the men who question power make a contribution just as indispensable especially when that questioning is disinterested for they determine whether we use power or power uses us
5322580 the problems of the world cannot possibly be solved by skeptics or cynics whose horizons are limited by the obvious realities we need men who can dream of things that never were
5322581 i love america more than any other country in this world and exactly for this reason i insist on the right to criticize her perpetually
5322582 hold fast to dreams for if dreams die life is but a broken winged bird that cannot fly
5322583 attitude is a little thing that makes a big difference
5322584 dreams are true while they last and do we not live in dreams
5322585 nothing in the world can take the place of persistence
5322586 never interrupt your enemy when he is making a mistake
5322587 for evil to triumph it is only necessary for good men to do nothing
5322588 war begins in the minds of men and it is in the minds of men that the defenses of peace must first be constructed
5322589 my kind of loyalty was loyalty to ones country not to its institutions or its officeholders the country is the real thing the substantial thing the eternal thing it is the thing to watch over and care for and be loyal to institutions are extraneous they are its mere clothing and clothing can wear out become ragged cease to be comfortable cease to protect the body from winter disease and death
5322590 patriotism is to support your country all the time and your government when it deserves it
5322591 the reasonable man adapts himself to the world the unreasonable man persists in trying to adapt the world to himself therefore all progress depends on the unreasonable man
5322592 the power of accurate observation is commonly called cynicism by those who have not got it
5322593 democracy is a system ensuring that the people are governed no better than they deserve
5322594 if we dont believe in freedom of expression for people we despise we dont believe in it at all

5322735 actually i dont agree with that assessment because when al qaeda was in afghanistan they had the partnership of a government
5322736 it now has many of the operational and organizational advantages it once enjoyed across the border in afghanistan albeit on a smaller and less secure scale
5322737 while a major focus of these groups is conducting attacks against nato led coalition forces in afghanistan they provide safe haven to al qaeda fighters collaborate on attacks inside of pakistan and support external operations including against the west
5322738 i know my pragmatic libertarianism seems heartless to soppy progressives
5322739 a willingness to step forward into audacious action even though one may have no idea of how one will either pull it off or where it will ultimately lead the only real knowing at the moment of applied chutzpah is an intuition that if some audacious action were not initiated nothing would get done

5322759 when we sit around here and talk about all these tax cuts and we say its our money your money and mine i think we ought to be honest with the american people in the first place its also our debt and its our childrens debt but secondly a tax cut isnt really a tax cut long term unless you reduce spending because then it becomes a tax increase on your children so were inflicting this awful bill not simply on ourselves but most importantly on our kids and it is that phenomenon that is very troublesome

5322774 the ndp have managed to improve support in the last two months but theres been no significant change in support for party leader john torys conservatives since the last election
5322775 for the liberals this just means they can stay the course and coast in the current environment its quite an easy time to be an ontario liberal

5322780 personally i dont think china should strive to win so many gold medals
5322781 coming in second or third place in gold medals is good enough im just worried that others may look at us as being cocky if we win too many
5322782 this was the most important medal of all for chinese people
5322783 its different from pingpong or diving in track and field you are competing against the whole world when liu won we felt on top of the world all the other medals are small compared to this one
5322784 behind the medals count everybodys excited to see chinas athletes in the lead as well as american swimmer michael phelps achievement of breaking world records and winning eight golds but were even happier to see the competitors from more countries and regions climb on top of the medals podium
5322785 its very misleading to see what the official media are presenting
5322786 people feel very strongly about winning when the games are over youll see a burst of patriotism
5322787 if we put up photos of all the medal winners there would be too many
5322788 a leader that god has blessed us with at this time
5322789 now you want to win and saying it doesnt make it so
5322790 it would be nice to think that after eight years of economic disaster after eight years of bungled foreign policy up until the next line i thought he was referring to the clinton years of being engaged in a war that should never have been authorized and should never have been waged that cost us a trillion dollars and thousands of lives that people would say lets toss the bums out toss the bums out were starting from scratch were starting over this is not working
5322791 so i understand why a lot of folks are saying this should just happen why are we having to run all these television commercials why do we have to raise all this money just read the papers these are the knuckleheads who have been in charge throw em out but american politics arent that simple
5322792 the fact of the matter is at a certain point when government has not been serving the people for this long people get cynical they tune out and they start saying to themselves a plague on both your houses they are willing to consume negative information more frequently than positive information for good reason theyve seen how promises havent been kept

5322804 it is my belief that the ebay brand and the perception of ebay by the public is a major factor in the struggles ebay management is currently facing

5322810 de wanden die vervangen zullen moeten worden moesten nog behandeld worden met een anti graffitilaag
5322811 we hadden niet gedacht dat het al zo snel nodig zou zijn

5322839 the purpose of the paper is to make clear just how dire the situation is and how rapidly things are getting worse
5322840 its a lot like the issue of climate change that we had ignored for so long if anything the situation in the oceans could be worse because we are so close to the precipice in many ways
5322841 the problems are complex because of the huge numbers of species and different kinds of perturbations involved the nonlinear dynamics of interactions among them and the infancy of the emerging theoretical framework required to interpret the results
5322842 all of the different kinds of data and methods of analysis point in the same direction of drastic and increasingly rapid degradation of marine ecosystems
5322843 the massive destruction of oyster reefs by dredging has permanently destroyed much of the formerly great habitat complexity of estuaries and coastal seas worldwide
5322844 nowhere are there any substantial signs of recovery despite belated conservation efforts except for nominal increases in some highly protected birds and mammals
5322845 an extraordinary biomass of diverse microbes and jellyfish that may constitute the only surviving commercial fishery
5322846 the iconic american example is the hypoxic dead zone that extends some 500 km west of the mississippi delta the area of the hypoxic zone has doubled in the past 20 years to 20 000 km2
5322847 analyses of the geochemistry and mineralogy of cores shows that hypoxic conditions were uncommon before the 1950s
5322848 just 15 years ago many coral reef scientists still referred to coral reefs as pristine
5322849 it is difficult to imagine how corals will be able to survive or reefs persist if the rise in co2 continues unabated
5322850 today many scientists believe that the cumulative forces of overfishing pollution and climate change are so great that coral reefs may virtually disappear within a few decades
5322851 just as we say that leatherback turtles are critically endangered i looked at entire ecosystems as if they were a species
5322852 these predictions will undoubtedly appear extreme but it is difficult to imagine how such changes will not come to pass without fundamental changes in human behavior
5322853 moreover as we have seen all of these trends have actually been measured to a limited degree in the past few decades some may say that it is irresponsible to make such predictions pending further detailed study to be sure of every point however we will never be certain about every detail and it would be irresponsible to remain silent in the face of what we already know
5322854 and the only way to deal with it is in segments the only way to keep ones sanity and try to achieve real success is to carve out sectors of the problem that can be addressed in effective terms and get on it as quickly as possible
5322855 halting and ultimately reversing these trends will require rapid and fundamental changes in fisheries agricultural practice and the emissions of greenhouse gases on a global scale
5322856 the challenges of bringing these threats under control are enormously complex and will require fundamental changes but very significant actions could begin right away without further scientific research or technological innovation
5322857 the only thing standing in the way of sustainable fisheries and aquaculture is the lack of political will and the greed of special interests
5322858 wild fisheries cannot possibly sustain increasing global demand regardless of how well they are managed
5322859 industrial scale aquaculture of species low on the food chain is the only viable alternative but this in turn will require strong new regulation to prevent harmful ecosystem consequences
5322860 the problems appear so overwhelming that many are ready to write off coral reefs and all of the other marine life that will be drastically affected
5322861 local conservation measures may help to buy time for marine ecosystems until we bring the rise of greenhouse gases under more effective control
5322862 anything involving ghorbanifar is always going to cost a lot of money
5322863 his usual first ploy is to try to set up an expensive front company allegedly to do business with iran that means you pay for the company and whatever is sold and ghorbanifar does the business keeps the books and uses the profits to fund his nonexistent group in iran in short himself some people always fall for it but nothing ever comes out of it
5322864 been used as agents of a foreign intelligence service to reach into and influence the highest levels of the u s government
5322865 defense department counterintelligence investigators suspected that iranian exiles who provided dubious intelligence on iraq and iran to a small group of pentagon officials might have been used as agents of a foreign intelligence service
5322866 the world must prevent iran from acquiring nuclear weapons that starts with tougher sanctions and aggressive principled and direct high level diplomacy without preconditions we will pursue this strengthened diplomacy alongside our european allies and with no illusions about the iranian regime

5322871 unable to decipher or understand complications or irregularities angered by what they considered betrayals in their own ranks the officials were forced to impose their simple formulas on fiction as they did on life just as they censored the colours and tones of reality to suit their black and white world they censored any form of interiority in fiction ironically for them as for their ideological opponents works of imagination that did not carry a political message were deemed dangerous thus in a writer such as austen for example whether they knew it or not they found a natural adversary
5322872 recently in zvezda magazine along with important and worthwhile works of soviet writers there have appeared many worthless ideologically harmful works
5322873 we needed to read fiction like the great gatsby because we needed to know about the immorality of american culture they felt we should read more revolutionary material but we should read books like this as well to understand the enemy
5322874 began to think that logos was the only means to truth and began to discount mythos as false and superstitious

5322919 if youre trying to save money you dont want to overdo colors typically the more fanciful the color the higher the price tag
5322920 for example yellow and red peppers are typically two to three times the price tag than a green pepper a regular red tomato is filled with vitamins and nutrients such as lycopene but when you go for the heirloom varieties the price can be as much as five times as much
5322921 the reason why you want to avoid precut fruits and vegetables is because youre paying for the added costs of labor or cutting and also the container its coming in
5322922 for example a small container of cut up cantaloupe might run you 3 99 instead you can buy the entire cantaloupe which is going to give you twice the amount and thats only going to be around 3 00
5322923 even if youre not a vegetarian i recommend to all my patients to at least try one night without meat or fish because you can really save

5323003 we still have confidence in him because he was gold medalist at the last olympic games and all chinese people adore him
5323004 as an ambassador for our company and our brand because his achievements both on and off the field will continue to inspire fans and consumers throughout china
5323005 we began supporting liu xiang before his athens triumph and we will continue supporting him through his recovery
5323006 we would have stayed longer if liu xiang had gone on to the final
5323007 well just go back home and watch it on tv
5323008 the faculty who received the cod award are master teachers who are using technology in amazing ways to reach students who might not otherwise have access to higher education

5323010 host maureen maher uncovers the facts surrounding some of the most disturbing crimes
5323011 we want something that says a body was discovered here or maybe if you were a serial torturer this is just the sort of place youd bring your victims nothing bloody you understand no corny stuff no bats or cobwebs just someplace youd definitely avoid after dark and maybe even during the day

5323019 we relocated the horticultural program and remodeled classroom space for technology
5323020 we intend to offer more dual credit opportunities for our students from west virginia northern community college and will also be open for adult learning opportunities for example someone at the coal mine who wants to work their way up in ranks to management will have the opportunity to take classes at john marshall high school as if they were at west virginia northern community college
5323021 we have a principals academy to provide them additional training and time to meet together to review procedures and polices
5323022 our excess levy expires at the end of this school year so the board will be setting the levy date in august
5323023 that will be critical to our county system the voters of brooke county have always supported the schools it will be very critical for us to pass our excess levy its our local operating money we do get state money but our county depends on operating money to provide free text books and to try to keep up to date with technologies supplies and instructional materials for students
5323024 we have done over the course of the summer a lot of building maintenance across the county as we usually do with upgrading and improving
5323025 we take pride in preparing not just in july and august its an ongoing process to keep the direction of the curriculum up to date we are excited and anticipating another great year for ohio county

5323029 all along we said that the model was dependent on getting their titles for distribution for christmas this year

5323031 siempre es especial jugar con brasil claro ellos querr n ganar porque nunca ganaron la medalla y nosotros porque queremos otra es cierto que ltimamente nos han ganado algunos partidos pero son circunstancias en este plantel todos hemos vencido a brasil en m s de una oportunidad
5323032 por historia y calidad de jugadores los dos equipos van a salir a buscar el partido desde el primer minuto
5323033 tanto los argentinos como nosotros tenemos jugadores de las mismas caracter sticas creativos por eso creo que se ver un buen espect culo
5323034 yo no creo que pueda compararse aquel partido con este todos los torneos son diferentes y m s un juego ol mpico que tiene otro ambiente es complejo de predecir pero no tomar a aquel juego como par metro
5323035 batista est haciendo un muy buen trabajo con este equipo tal como se ha visto a lo largo de este torneo quiz s la nica diferencia es que yo convivo adem s con el equipo mayor
5323036 la explicaci n es muy simple se trata de los dos equipos sudamericanos con mayor cantidad de t tulos mundiales y que habitualmente llegan a las instancias finales de los torneos m s importantes la rivalidad es hist rica y cada confrontaci n genera muchas expectativas esta claro est no es la excepci n
5323037 este equipo sabe que hemos tenido que enfrentar dificultades para llegar hasta aqu y por eso valora la instancia a la que hemos llegado el grupo est confiado y seguro sabe lo que quiere y eso es fundamental a la hora de luchar por el resultado deseado
5323038 friskoleetableringar inneb r att kommunerna st r kvar med f r stora och f r m nga lokaler det har funnits renoveringsbehov sedan l gkonjunkturen p 70 talet men framf r allt bottnar det i att skolan r mycket l gt prioriterad
5323039 som vanligt s r det unga och gamla som f r ta sm llarna i samh llet de som har de svagaste r sterna kan det vara en konsekvens n r de unga blir ldre s r de knappast motiverade att betala bra omsorg t de ldre efter sj lva ha f tt skit under sina ungdoms r v ra skolor borde vara hypermoderna med v ra st rsta t nkare smartaste individer och starkaste ledare som utbildare och motiverare f r v r nations framtid

5323041 i v rt innebandylag s spelar vi i en gymnastiksal som tillh r en skola och att barn ens f r vistas i s osanit ra lokaler r m rkligt att barn f rst r tycker jag r irrelevant f r att det skulle vara on digt att renovera det stora problemet r inte ytliga skador utan d remot m gel damm och d lig luft som ger allergier och okoncentrerade barn bidrar g rna med h gre skatt om det skulle beh vas f r att v ra barn ska f en dr glig vardag

5323048 the mere fact that rabbis would be openly invited to the kingdom a country where in principle jews are not permitted to visit would have constituted a turning point
5323049 this gives us a better picture of what countries discriminate against us based on religion
5323050 in light of this i am resigning from my post

5323056 s vezes a melhor ataque a defesa o nosso setor defensivo se mostrou muito consistente e isso facilitou o trabalho dos homens de frente o quarteto formado pelo evandro diego souza alex mineiro e kl ber foram quase perfeitos se mexeram ali na frente do jeito que eu pedi e tiveram in meras chances de gol o coritiba est de parab ns pois tem uma grande equipe mas s chegaram uma vez no nosso gol

5323070 en primer lugar dentro del campo somos como hermanos todos trabajan por el compa ero
5323071 luego nunca dejamos de atacar hasta ahora en este torneo hemos demostrado que sabemos atacar incluso despu s de recibir el primer gol contra italia presionamos todo el tiempo incomodando al rival
5323072 no va a ser sencillo pero en el ltimo partido conseguimos vencer a italia y cada vez tenemos m s confianza puede que los nigerianos sean buenos pero nosotros somos un equipo a tener en cuenta
5323073 el partido contra costa rica lo vamos a encarar con toda la seriedad sabemos del potencial de los costarricenses en su cancha pero eso no significa que no podamos sacarle un buen resultado
5323074 nuestra meta es seguir avanzando en la eliminatoria obviamente quisi ramos ganar todos los partidos pero estamos claros que el partido ante trinidad y tobago era una preparaci n para ver los puntos que tenemos que afinar antes de ir a costa rica a quien no le jugaremos igual que a trinidad y tobago queremos restarle puntos

5323084 they wrote that the key to a successful seeding trial is deception i would like to believe that many or most of the physician investigators were deceived as the alternative is that they knew it was wink wink nudge nudge pretense of a trial and the term co conspirator would apply

5323086 ich bin immer neugierig auf herausforderungen aber auch wenn ich eher ein einzelg nger bin in den dschungel geh ich nicht allein meine frau ramona soll mit
5323087 yet the progress that has been made is still fragile because we know that there are people who would like to go backward to an era where there wasnt much trade to an era of economic isolationism which we believe would be a big mistake

5323201 we had another improved quarter materially exceeding prior quarters results this was driven in part by our increased growth in our core subscription revenues and professional service revenues

5323203 look s only at properly joined and served defendants at the time of removal
5323204 in the limited situations such as the present case when a non forum state defendant removes a case also involving a forum defendant it is necessary to only consider properly served defendants so as to not allow a plaintiff to thwart removal rights of diverse non forum state defendants by not serving the forum state defendant

5323206 it is my honor to join the board of such an illustrious organization osteoporosis is a major health problem in the united states and is often preventable with some measures like weight bearing exercise and by getting the recommended daily allowance of calcium vitamin d and magnesium i am looking forward to working with the national osteoporosis foundation to help americans reduce the risk of osteoporosis
5323207 people perceive this as an old persons disease and it is not it is a disease that effects everyone and we need to make sure americans of all ages especially during youth are getting enough calcium each and every day so they do not suffer with osteoporosis later

5323215 for some time relative calm was maintained in south ossetia
5323216 cases of possible threats by russia directed at georgia with the intention of taking control over the baku ceyhan pipeline
5323217 russia actively tends to isolate the central asian region from direct access to world economy especially to energy supplies if georgia government is destabilized western access to baku caspian sea and further will be limited
5323218 ever since the continents started interacting politically some five hundred years ago eurasia has been the center of world power the key to controlling eurasia says brzezinski is controlling the central asian republics
5323219 brzezinski russias invasion of georgia is reminiscent of stalins attack on finland
5323220 the russians deliberately provoked the fighting in south ossetia and timed it for the olympics this is a long standing russian effort to get rid of president saakashvili
5323221 and i want to stress im not a warmonger and i dont want a new cold war any more than dimitri does the russians wish to re establish a historic area of hegemony that includes ukraine and it is no accident that the other former soviet republics are watching this and extraordinarily upset as putin progresses with an attempt to re create a kind of a hegemonic space
5323222 the unipolar world refers to a world in which there is one master one sovereign one center of authority one center of force one center of decision making at the end of the day this is pernicious not only for all those within this system but also for the sovereign itself because it destroys itself from within what is even more important is that the model itself is flawed because at its basis there is and can be no moral foundations for modern civilization
5323223 unilateral and frequently illegitimate actions have not resolved any problems moreover they have caused new human tragedies and created new centers of tension judge for yourselves wars as well as local and regional conflicts have not diminished more are dying than before significantly more significantly more today we are witnessing an almost uncontained hyper use of force military force in international relations force that is plunging the world into an abyss of permanent conflicts we are seeing a greater and greater disdain for the basic principles of international law and independent legal norms are as a matter of fact coming increasingly closer to one states legal system one state and of course first and foremost the united states has overstepped its national borders in every way this is visible in the economic political cultural and educational policies it imposes on other nations well who likes this who is happy about this in international relations we increasingly see the desire to resolve a given question according to so called issues of political expediency based on the current political climate and of course this is extremely dangerous it results in the fact that no one feels safe i want to emphasize this no one feels safe because no one can feel that international law is like a stone wall that will protect them of course such a policy stimulates an arms race i am convinced that we have reached that decisive moment when we must seriously think about the architecture of global security

5323285 what can come out of our meetings is that it is wrong not to try to deal with a problem but a real consensus an action plan containing points 1 2 and 3 the answer is no people are much too sensible to believe they can do that
5323286 there need to be places where these people can think about the main challenges ahead co ordinate where policies should be going and find out where there could be a consensus

5323307 general musharraf had become a liability for the nation because of his anti democratic credentials
5323308 the eight years of his rule have been fraught with gross constitutional violations and acts of political divisiveness which had not only put democracy at stake but had also created serious economic and security challenges for the country
5323309 president musharraf has been a friend to the united states and one of the worlds most committed partners in the war against terrorism and extremism

5323328 we are looking at a deficit from past reimbursements so our board took into consideration everything that the county does for the town and the town does for the county and came up with an offer

5323333 the iraqi security forces now have direct control and responsibility for the majority of iraqi territory and theyre taking over more of their country each and every day
5323334 i think its fair to say that while the conditions could still reverse and iraq remains a very dangerous place were getting to a point where i hope this fall general david petraeus will announce a return or redeployment of u s forces
5323335 i think there is a period of time to go yet but it certainly looks as though we can have a successful end to this conflict in the reasonably near future

5323339 theres complete disagreement amongst fingerprint examiners themselves as to what they need to find in order to declare a match
5323340 there isnt a single experiment thats ever been done literally
5323341 there are very few employers who will terminate an employee for not passing the test
5323342 virtually no crime laboratory requires that you be qualified to work in the lab even in the fbi lab
5323343 exposes a fingerprint examiner to a powerful unconscious bias the emotional nature of a murder case tends to make the scientist eager to get a killer off the streets and much more likely to declare a match
5323344 rather than blindly insisting there is zero error in fingerprint matching we should acknowledge the obvious study the errors openly and find constructive ways to prevent faulty evidence from being used to convict innocent people

5323371 since then you have been raised with christ set your hearts on things above where christ is seated at the right hand of god set your minds on things above not on earthly things for you died and your life is now hidden with christ in god

5323424 the bourgeoisie wherever it has got the upper hand has put an end to all feudal patriarchal idyllic relations
5323425 it has pitilessly torn asunder the motley fuedal ties that bound man to his natural superiors

5323513 it seems to be working too we literally have thousands of people with patches attributed to them in each release
5323514 the worst thing anybody can do is to study the kernel alone and try to learn things in private and then however many months later present all the established kernel developers with a big patch that just comes out of the blue
5323515 it may not sound exciting but quite frankly i dont think anybody who starts out believing that they want to rewrite some big piece of the kernel should even bother reality isnt that simple

5323636 once ubs reduces the write downs substantially it will be profitable again
5323637 the estimate is a moving number it was above 8 8 billion some weeks ago and it is still falling
5323638 even if it looks like it will never end it will
5323639 whistleblower complaints relating to working practices in the u s cross border business
5323640 what are they doing where are they going whats happening i dont get it any more they lost me
5323641 i still appreciate what theyre doing or what theyre trying to do but i think theyre trying too hard not to be radiohead that seems a little ridiculous to me
5323642 i like them as a rock band all the buttons and sequencing and stuff like that i dont really care for im a fan of rock music and what theyre doing now i dont think is very good
5323643 i love oasis i love them i think that what they do is earnest i think its honest
5323644 im not sure i can wait another eight years to play in another olympics though it took me 12 years to get here
5323645 its looking really good down at the snowies its gonna be sweet
5323646 he went over the lip it was pretty much vertical when he skied down
5323647 for just two people it was a massive area to search it was harrowing
5323648 we were probing madly and when we saw a few others who had been camping we screamed to them to come and help
5323649 he was in shock but he knew what to do in an avalanche he was probing in symmetrical lines and building up blocks of snow to show where he had been
5323650 tom was with us from kindergarten to year 12 and was involved in a wilderness education program with the school and through that a number of students became close to him so today is a tough time for many people

5323652 the latter group women who did not take maternity leave is significantly more likely to have been promoted by june 30 2007
5323653 the figures may also be distorted by the possibility that women having children are at a relatively more senior classification already and simply have less scope for promotion
5323654 having a child brings a great opportunity cost to their career
5323655 i think it is certainly concerning that women are being discriminated against because of their family situation
5323656 i know of three people who have died waiting to get a place in rehab
5323657 ive been lucky that at a time when things might have gone wild i was touring with a young family but ive seen it happen
5323658 a tragic chain of not one but several contributing events
5323659 the loop is the keystone of parramatta city councils integrated transport plan
5323660 as the economic capital of western sydney parramatta is in need of a quick reliable and low pollution city transport system
5323661 this need is even more urgent when we consider that parramatta will be offering up to 30 000 new jobs over the next 25 years
5323662 i was shopping at the loopy ewe and overheard sheri telling susan that they were going to be shorthanded since someone was leaving i would love to work here just flew out of my mouth
5323663 i was an innocent in store shopper first time shopper mind you and the next thing i knew i was wrapping 300 skeins of smooshy
5323664 several of the people who work here are neighbors and friends of mine so it gives us an opportunity to see each other more frequently the others are very fun to be around
5323665 driving to work today and seeing all of the kids going back for the first day of school made me realize that i am able to work without affecting my kids that much my family is the one reason i was always hesitant about working and the main reason i will always appreciate the loopy ewe
5323666 im a beginner im on ravelry as loopyme2 and have just a few scarves done sheri taught me how to knit and marianne just gave mary and i purling lessons the other night
5323667 the instructor was very nice and taught us the knit stitch we set to work as the instructor walked around the table she complimented my daughter and then she came to me and asked what are you doing i thought i was knittting i mean i had a product hanging off of the needles she very nicely told me she had never seen a stitch like mine i actually have not tried since that time
5323668 everyone who works here is a little loopy so that makes it fun
5323669 its a very sad situation without its mother at suckling age we are very concerned theres no guarantee another pod will have a lactating mother and no guarantee it will accept it
5323670 if theres a slender chance its mother is still out there then it may hear it further out to sea
5323671 there were people swimming with the mother and calf off coogee last week and it freaked them out
5323672 if people try to swim with whales theres a good chance they can distress the mother this is how they get abandoned
5323673 it might be a peaceful experience for people but its not for the whale
5323674 ive been a doctor for 35 years and this is the first time ive ever seen such a thing happen this is somewhat of a medical miracle
5323675 weve informed the health ministry and i guess theyll appoint a commission of inquiry the hospital will ask for an external investigation of the case
5323676 i amp squo ve been a doctor for 35 years and this is the first time i amp squo ve ever seen such a thing happen this is somewhat of a medical miracle

5323679 i know that the extent of the changes under the way forward reform strategies may cause some staff uncertainty as to their future within the department
5323680 no officer need lose his or her job but some will be required to relocate we will assist in any relocation
5323681 casualisation and privatisation will not solve the problems in the prisons
5323682 inmate numbers have increased by 40 per cent in just 10 years its a miracle weve managed to hold it together with the numbers we have
5323683 abolishing operational agreements and casualisation is a serious health and safety concern for corrective services staff and for inmates
5323684 in corrective services we need permanent skilled staff trained for the dangers and challenges of the job not backpackers looking for a quick buck
5323685 overtime costs have been a problem for years and the iemma government has done nothing
5323686 obviously there has to be reform we have an overtime culture and its been a strong culture
5323687 this is a good reminder that users of operating systems other than windows are not immune to malware or social engineering
5323688 weve found apple to be uncommunicative a couple months ago when we notified them that we were preparing a badware alert about apple software update they quietly changed the product at the 11th hour but never contacted us about it more recently weve tried to contact several senior executives there to initiate an informal low pressure conversation about their disclosure practices but our invitation has gone unanswered
5323689 i find it unbelievable with the price of gas and the economy in the shape it is in that you are not making exceptions to your two night minimum stay
5323690 in a day and age where traveling is getting harder and harder to do because of gas prices irrelevantly high priced hotel rooms just isnt part of the plan anymore
5323691 feedback from millions of visitors collected over the past year demonstrates a clear negative correlation between gas prices and customer satisfaction on automotive and travel web sites
5323692 as the price at the pump has spiked consumers are venting their frustrations online and it isnt just that satisfaction is hurting measurable business outcomes are falling as well in an environment like this its critical that marketers tune into changing consumer sentiment in order to pinpoint opportunities to make small changes that can positively impact customer satisfaction conversion and sales

5323700 i can say for certain when the new year will come but i cannot give an exact date for the withdrawal of our troops from the conflict area yet
5323701 i can only say that we will not be leaving as fast as we came
5323702 lets hope that this is a technical slowness in getting implemented lets see the russians begin to pull back thats what wed like to see but we havent seen it yet
5323703 they are destroying everything and then pulling out of these places
5323704 if they call this a pullout then i do not understand the meaning of the word
5323705 we are aware that the georgian side can undertake provocative actions at any moment against our troops as well as the civilians
5323706 we cant rule out the use of slavic looking people dressed like russian military for provocations and sabotage
5323707 i appeal to you that after your armed forces leave georgian territory to start serious thinking and discussions about further negotiations a further search for ways to conduct relations in order not to sow discord between our countries for good
5323708 they fled meanly like traitors from south ossetia just before the shooting started
5323709 we have no confidence in these international observers in these people who corrupt the truth
5323710 these are not the actions of curious individuals or even those who are sympathetic to terrorist objectives
5323711 they are the actions of people who pose a very real threat to our communities

5323776 im not sure why obama voluntarily sat down for a nationally televised conversation about his private religious faith with a relatively conservative christian leader as though thats a reasonable station of the cross so to speak for a major american presidential candidate
5323777 i was impressed by mccain he was much more at ease in this setting than i expected

5323839 so we teamed up with jon and our good friend stephen christy over at devils due to serialize the story and make it a comic series eventually stephen pitched the thing from memory to abc family and they liked it as much as we do and the rest is so on and so forth
5323840 the needs and demands of comic books arent always the same as the needs of television or film so im having fun addressing the concerns of both media at the same time i hope to reconcile the two well enough so that the tv show looks like the comic and the comic looks like the tv show

5323891 la victoria de hoy fue una superaci n para brasil
5323892 de un 1 90 m para jugadoras de 1 78
5323893 la verdad es que cuando volvimos del partido contra ghana en abril pasado en pek n con el que brasil se clasific para los jjoo ganando por 5 1 fue una tristeza muy grande porque entramos en el hotel y las chicas se acordaron de toda aquella circunstancia el mundial perdido en shanghai en 2007 y lloraron
5323894 ser a peor resultado si ellas no pudiesen llegar hasta aqu llevar una medalla y disputar una final
5323895 claro que tenemos el sentimiento de que podr amos haber sido campeonas del mundo el a o pasado pero aquello ya pas y no sirve de nada removerlo m s
5323896 aquello fue una cosa que ya pas y la actual campeona mundial es alemania aunque puede ser batida igual que estados unidos puede ser batida aunque sea la actual campeona ol mpica
5323897 hay que tener mucha confianza y entrar centradas desde el inicio del juego
5323898 nuestro equipo piensa en jugar y en superar a todos los equipos que se les pongan por delante
5323899 y nuestra intenci n es esa trabajar fuerte con intensidad y respeto por el adversario para poder superarlo

5323926 hizo una gran pelea es un excelente p gil que se mueve muy bien golpea con fuerza y adem s no es f cil entrarle en la guardia
5323927 creo que tambi n descuide mi guardia a partir del tercer asalto y eso le favoreci a que metiese golpes efectivos

5323930 el problema es que el jugador que ten a al frente era rafael nadal nuevo n mero uno del mundo con un saque que funcion con una regularidad desesperante que le permiti hacer muy poco al chileno

5323936 ive had my fair share of bad luck so its about time it happened to someone else
5323937 i have experienced in the past the great pressure that government officials exert on the athletes as well as the coach and that they demand a gold medal otherwise it is meaningless liu xiang is still a young boy and he has been put under a bit too much expectation
5323938 the chinese arent putting any more pressure on their stars than we are on radcliffe and co or the sailing girls put on themselves

5323961 as our company embarks on its next phase of growth we identified key areas that needed to be elevated because of their importance in how they will contribute to the success of the organization
5323962 dino pete and mark each bring a business sense industry knowledge and strong leadership skill set that has earned them a spot on our senior leadership team
5323963 it is increasingly important that companies consider their telephony partners in the broader context of a uc strategy companies should take this opportunity to consolidate their investments into a smaller number of vendors using ip telephony to deliver a consistent platform across the estate of users in preparation for integration with uc and collaboration platforms especially for branch small offices and customer service locations
5323964 we believe our position in gartners leaders quadrant affirms avayas strategy of building products that help organizations gracefully transition their existing infrastructure to ip telephony for real time always on business communications
5323965 powerful unified communications begins with a reliable scalable and survivable voice and video telephony platform and avaya will continue to lead in the evolution of this key area
5323966 one of the core values of our organization is recognizing and rewarding results
5323967 i look forward to acknowledging our top performing associates each year because they earn their spot on the wall of fame by demonstrating leadership teamwork and exceptional customer service their individual contributions combined with those of the teams they are a part of make our company the success that it is
5323968 from nut wielding squirrels naked pedestrians and aircraft it seems its not just other motorists that drivers should be watching out for

5323970 we are honored to be named to the prestigious orange county technology fast 50 and proud to be recognized as one of the leading technology companies in one of the most vibrant technology and economic communities in the country
5323971 over the past five years villageedocs has experienced a 50 compounded annual growth rate and we attribute our success to the technology driven suite of outsourced business information delivery services we provide to our more than 1 400 corporate clients making the fast 50 is a testament to the dedication and hard work of all of our employees who have helped make this achievement possible
5323972 almost everything that happens at sea depends on some level of hydrographic information one of the aims of the international hydrographic organization as the peak world body dealing with hydrograhic standardization and capacity building is to increase awareness of the fundamental value of hydrography and its related geospatial sciences we believe young geo professional magazine will help do that

5323975 the oems are becoming more deliberate of letting suppliers fail
5323976 many firms will be left to fail in this terrible downturn
5323977 we did that specifically because of the trauma in the industry

5323979 will come out of this but it will take some time
5323980 neighborhoods are becoming more and more a part of interactive search applications where location granularity matters
5323981 our relationship with skyhook wireless opens up a new ecosystem of interactive applications where location information is equal to social context
5323982 the integration of neighborhood boundary data from urban mapping into skyhooks positioning information will result in more neighborhood relevant information as part of the skyhook wireless loki service and myloki application for facebook and other social networking sites
5323983 additionally the urban mapping neighborhood data adds a richness and more context to social connections than just a city level message or plot on a map for example when our myloki service messages out that a user has changed locations we can say that the user has just checked into back bay in boston instead of just indicating that the user is in boston mass
5323984 with urban mappings robust database of neighborhood boundary data skyhook wireless can offer developers contextually relevant geocoding for the creation of location rich and enabling interactive applications
5323985 as a result were more able to meet an increasing marketplace demand for location accuracy and granularity thats driving the development of much deeper location rich interactive applications

5324002 the united states supported the transition to democratic government in pakistan and respects the results of the election

5324012 i feel good about what were doing from a repetition standpoint
5324013 theres still a lot of time left to make that assessment nothing to report on that
5324014 the legislature and the governor changed our marriage laws to please the well connected minority and force a social experiment into other states thats very offensive to a majority of the people at least the way the votes have been going
5324015 the fact that this happened the way it happened just adds to the sense of sleaziness and underhandedness of the whole process
5324016 ive learned that when it comes to equality for gay and lesbian people the struggle is never over because there are certain people that are just strongly opposed to any rights for gay people

5324019 the jig was up you could say people were like hes just another reality fighter but i went into that fight focused i came back to hawaii and started training at b j penn academy and just got focused
5324020 on top of being the world champ at 155 pounds hes also been my hero
5324021 hes a hawaii boy who made it and it put motivation in me if this guy from hilo can make it maybe i can so now i get to train with the guy just being around that guy you get focused because of his state of mind of fighting and also his dad mr penn he can get you ready for war my head got straightened out there i went into that fight with the utmost confidence i couldnt lose that night
5324022 at least six months i wasnt there due to training she definitely wants some time for her and im really looking forward to raising my baby girl
5324023 once my gym opens ill be training but not focused on myself as much i want to build my gym
5324024 i know february the regulatory license will pass for hawaii and we can hold a ufc in hawaii hopefully the ufc can come down here and hopefully that can be my first fight back
5324025 no theres been no decision as soon as we do ill offer it but right now we dont as soon as we watch the film grade it and our guys are getting more involved in chicago and well go from there no decisions nothing to announce
5324026 i have a better feel obviously with the two games that i had before this those games in preseason as ive said all along i think all three of them are capable of doing it i think he continues to do a good job he had a couple of opportunities where he couldve tried to make something out of nothing and he chose to and a time or two he did and it was good play it was the other times whether he scrambled just threw it away or whatever he did but i thought his decision making was very good on it with every game obviously you get a better feel for somebody i thought he played well
5324027 yeah and just to clarify the decision im talking about is just when somebody when youre competitive you want to win every down and thats a good thing but some downs you have a better chance than others so the decision im talking about is just when you as we already know a week ago he forced the ball and then made an acrobatic play on another one he didnt do any of those yesterday hes the kind of guy who corrects himself he does a very good job he does what he does right and wrong in the game its seldom that you offer information to him and he kind of goes oh i didnt know that ive never seen that look on his face he knows before mike martz corrects him what it was or even last week in the case of the game he and i spoke a little bit he knows whats going on
5324028 well i think anyone gets better with playing time i think thats fair to say i would like to believe whoever we name quarterback that that person you know you obviously want to get better when the season goes along i think that all of them can get better
5324029 i feel good about what were doing so far from a repetition stand point and time as well practice counts as well so i feel good about the time
5324030 not quite yet no because im just getting to looking at film on them were just putting closure to the game from yesterday but going forward well do more work tonight and tomorrow again mondays todays not a monday as you well know but mondays schedule typically youre putting closure to the prior game and thats about where we are
5324031 i thought he did a very good job last night again played well against the raiders played well last night the quarterbacks confidence in him is good thats a real key he is where hes supposed to be that chemistry between quarterback and receiver is good as you noticed alex went to him as well we wanted to get alex in there with him which we did and i think he threw to him i think two of alexs throws were two to him i know one of them was a completion really was a nice play by alex and josh where they timed up well and alex stepped up and threw it before josh was even out of his break which is what youre supposed to do usually guys until they trust one another they dont do it and that was good there was another play but i cant remember what happened on it but anyhow hes getting work with both guys and well see where that leads him
5324032 good question i cant even answer it to be honest with you i havent looked at it hes fully capable i know in practice he does a good job i dont see a weakness in that area but i cant say how he did in the game
5324033 well hes done a good job when the other guy comes back the better player is going to play so well see david baas started half the season last year at right guard tony has played in the past for us and done a good job if nothing else you have to feel good a little bit about the depth inside at guard kind of like at the receiver position with some of these young guys getting some opportunities to play it helps our depth
5324034 well see when he gets back the timetable for when he gets back i think hes a little ahead of schedule well know that for sure the day he gets back and if that happens maybe hell get some opportunities if he comes out and shines right away then there might be something to it but otherwise like i said i think its a good problem to have if you have two guys competing who can play when the season begins
5324035 takeo played eight plays he did not have the responsibility of the tight end on that play that was not his play at all he might have been able to bang the guy before he when up the field but by the formation that was not his
5324036 well theres like a banjo going over there first outside inside and vertical and the corner and the safety both should have picked it up as far as vision goes and the linebacker should have banged him so we had three guys that were sort of out of position if you want to say it was a nice fake it was a hell of a play to be honest with you tight end did a great job too when he came off the line of scrimmage most of the time they just try to head up field and try to run their route but he threw his eyes inside like he was going to make a crack back block and he took off for the corner of the end zone so it kind of froze a couple of the players they werent sure what he as up to nice play it was well designed
5324037 jonas jennings had a hand had a knuckle that got banged up they were checking it i dont know what the extent of it quite yet but they had to check it out to make sure there wasnt a break or something
5324038 i do not i do not because it wasnt told to me after the game i think it was something that he just came in this morning with
5324039 well with the job at fullback obviously both of those guys are competing pretty well and theyre both doing a good job theres been no decision on a fullback thus far but both guys have strengths and weaknesses
5324040 you know i cant be specific because im not sure i just know that we when we watch it in the meeting its more of we just talk about well the two and the three got split right here so we talk about it from a team standpoint and theres a couple of players who individually are trying to make the team in that area two weeks in a row weve given up i think it was a punt the week before was that correct the raiders was that a punt or a kickoff
5324041 yeah it does it builds some confidence more importantly it builds confidence in our players we have as everyone does in training camp you have good days and bad days but this offense as everyone in the league has witnessed is an extremely good offense and mike martz probably does as good a job as anybody in the league if not better so im confident its getting better all the time but i would agree with your assessment that success breeds success it breeds confidence that confidence is what becomes success so its a good thing but when you do it in a game its much better last week as i said after the game we did move the ball last week against the raiders i thought we did some real good things on offense but we also turned the ball over which is bad last night obviously we didnt turn the ball over but the one time and we did move the ball unlike a year ago and even in the past three years weve had a lot of flashes whether it be in training camp or the practice against the raiders or even in our two preseason games weve had a lot of like i said spurts and flashes of good stuff we just last night we just put it together more often than we had up to this point so im encouraged by that as we all would be
5324042 yeah weve done the same for two weeks weve done it well and weve done it well in practice we just keep building on that were all well aware that its preseason so we have to everything we evaluate we have to decide how were doing it what group were doing it against at no time do you want to sit back and say boy we got that fixed it is preseason so its an ongoing process to continue to stay on top of things during the season so we still have a lot of work to do but theres a lot of encouraging things that are happening its just we have to identify them correctly
5324043 may i suggest if there are five blokes to every girl we should find out where there are beauty disadvantaged women and ask them to proceed to mount isa
5324044 quite often you will see walking down the street a lass who is not so attractive with a wide smile on her face

5324069 if we define entropy in its strict sense it is used in physics to describe the lack of energy within a system the breakdown of complex forms to less organized forms leading to a state of utter disorganization and lack of energy the psychological equivalent of that would be the run down of fairly complex psychological states of existence into depression despair inertia melancholia etc i dont see my work reflecting that either on a physical or psychological level quite the opposite its a misreading to assume that because my work is populated by abandoned hotels drained swimming pools empty night clubs deserted airfields and the like that i am celebrating the rundown of a previous psychological and social order i am not what i am interested in doing is using these materials as the building blocks of a new order

5324110 yet despite the traditional prominence of psychotherapy in psychiatric practice and training there are indications of a recent decline in the provision of psychotherapy by u s psychiatrists a trend attributed to reimbursement policies favoring brief medication management visits rather than psychotherapy and the introduction of newer psychotropic medications with fewer adverse effects
5324111 this decline coincided with changes in reimbursement increases in managed care and growth in the prescription of medications
5324112 psychiatrists who provided psychotherapy to all of their patients relied more extensively on self pay patients had fewer managed care visits and prescribed medications in fewer of their visits compared with psychiatrists who provided psychotherapy less often
5324113 these trends highlight a gradual but important change in the content of outpatient psychiatric care in the united states and a continued shift toward medicalization of psychiatric practice
5324114 a key challenge facing the future generation of psychiatrists will likely involve maintaining their professional role as integrators of the biological and psychosocial perspectives while working within the constraints of the strong market forces of third party payers and managed care to implement advances in the diagnosis and treatment of mental disorders

5324119 our findings show ssws lives are dominated by an unrelenting cycle of selling sex buying drugs and then using them
5324120 this suggests they are unlikely to be able to just stop working even if the risks of punishment are increased street sex markets and the ssws poor health are the product of complex and interrelated factors and if anything these approaches will make ssws wary of contact with the police and push the women underground making them more vulnerable to violence and difficult for support services to reach
5324121 our research indicates that improvement of drug services would reduce the need to score and use drugs which is likely to reduce time spent working as well as contact with drug dealers and other users if this was linked to addressing accommodation needs and supporting contact with children then the majority of pressures forcing the women back into the cycle would also be addressed
5324122 this decision is extremely difficult but necessary as it will allow us to better focus on our strategic initiatives

5324124 we dont want to be in a situation where we are in some kind of frozen relationship with russia but until russia pulls its forces out of georgia and respects international norms of the 21st century we just cant go on with business as usual

5324194 i think its fair to say that bob has never been afraid to embrace controversial issues or positions and always had a knack for turning his actions into ink
5324195 the curse is that people view him as being this bombastic character who really is more thoughtful and has a greater degree of moderation
5324196 change the nature of the debate and raise the issue in the publics eye

5324229 we knew we could vastly improve the customer experience by deploying an online booking application to enhance our existing web site ibm came in and really pulled the project together in an amazingly short period of time five months compressing a development cycle that was slated to take 12 months
5324230 when customers book a tour the application is simultaneously booking reservations for hotels buses and so on
5324231 we needed our online system to extend the complexities built into our core business systems out to the web without making the process too complicated for our customers the websphere commerce solution did this without having to completely rewrite our back end systems
5324232 this project is a great example of how ibm is helping clients adapt to constantly changing conditions such as rising fuel costs and new terms of engagement between airlines and travel agencies

5324241 tal vez la presi n de tener la posibilidad de conseguir la primera medalla para mi pa s me gener algo m s de presi n pero no fue la causa de la derrota

5324254 someone has finally posted something on the internet about how to fix comics

5324264 if this industry dies any more im gonna need to buy some more shelving
5324265 torture the numbers long enough and theyll confess to anything
5324266 these numbers dont take into account amazon bookstores the direct market walgreens garage sales they dont actually say what you think they say theres nothing saying old men arent just buying five times more books than they were in 2000 this doesnt prove that comics stores arent still dying the mainstream superhero shared universe mass market comics west of the mississippi are still in trouble by odins beard there is a way to make this into bad news

5324364 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
5324365 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
5324366 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
5324367 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
5324368 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
5324369 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
5324370 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
5324371 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
5324372 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
5324373 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
5324374 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
5324375 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
5324376 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
5324377 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
5324378 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
5324379 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
5324380 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
5324381 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
5324382 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
5324383 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
5324384 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
5324385 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
5324386 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance

5324390 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
5324391 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
5324392 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
5324393 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military

5324407 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
5324408 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
5324409 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
5324410 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
5324411 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
5324412 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
5324413 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
5324414 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
5324415 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5324416 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5324417 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
5324418 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
5324419 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
5324420 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages

5324426 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5324427 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5324428 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
5324429 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
5324430 the put method requests that the enclosed entity be stored under the supplied request uri if the request uri refers to an already existing resource the enclosed entity should be considered as a modified version of the one residing on the origin server
5324431 the fundamental difference between the post and put requests is reflected in the different meaning of the request uri the uri in a post request identifies the resource that will handle the enclosed entity that resource might be a data accepting process a gateway to some other protocol or a separate entity that accepts annotations in contrast the uri in a put request identifies the entity enclosed with the request the user agent knows what uri is intended and the server must not attempt to apply the request to some other resource
5324432 i do have one question what does it mean to post to an employee
5324433 the old days of a page with three references and three phone numbers on it that you controlled are over
5324434 with these networking sites youve opened up your rolodex for the whole world to see
5324435 this sales person was on linkedin and he had a contact on there from one of our competitors since everyone knows everyone in this industry we contacted someone there directly
5324436 this opens the door for the prospective employer to request to speak to these references thinking that the relationship is professional in nature to validate claims made by the candidate during the interview process about their achievements and experiences
5324437 when they find that the reference is personal instead of professional a trust issue develops between the employer and prospective employee
5324438 some managers may have the feeling of freedom in cyberspace doing things from home when they dont feel the restraints of the office with the hr person looking over their shoulder

5324440 the savvy gals guide to online networking or what would jane austen do
5324441 a lot of hiring managers are kind a lazy so if you give them a lot of good information odds are they will be less aggressive in finding things out on their own
5324442 at this juncture facebook is simply not a serious site for business at the level i place folks linkedin however is becoming increasingly more useful as a networking tool and in identifying candidates but any posted reference cant be taken seriously on any level
5324443 while some of the comments are certainly genuine with regard to service or capability to truly check references and be satisfied that we have a 360 degree view of the candidate we need to go beyond the obvious
5324444 and this means making phone calls and speaking directly to those who know the candidate including not only relying on provided reference information
5324445 i wont rule out someone whos not on facebook or linkedin but having recommendations and references up on networking sites can only help you
5324446 amref has taught people on how to improve sanitation and one way is by using sanplats so the people now want to use these slabs we and the people we shall teach can also make some money
5324447 if we make the slabs as they have taught us then people will buy them and we can make some money to help our own lives
5324448 the people have been very enthusiastic and eager to participate both in theory and practical work and you could see that they are very anxious to go and start this in their parishes
5324449 i just dont know about mixing those two environments in the same place
5324450 the idea that within a year theyll be profitable and people will be flocking to them is a fallacy
5324451 there remains an industry problem associated with broad awareness of the availability
5324452 but once you have a trial use by the consumer of this service there is very high customer satisfaction
5324453 we see clinics as an emerging industry and we expect to see continued changes and evolution in that space but i can tell you that we are excited about the strong interest that we are getting from hospitals and health care systems
5324454 the bottom line is that its difficult to first of all get this idea across and make people aware of where these locations are and then finally to feel comfortable to actually get their health care in a retail store
5324455 its a nice in between where you can actually get seen without having to wait a day or two or spending a couple of hundred dollars for an er co pay
5324456 we already have so many areas where theres i guess you could say a degraded level of health care
5324457 we had casting calls in 25 markets earlier this year and some of them were really hilarious
5324458 one guy sent in a video of him reporting on the game in his bathrobe with the gillette logo in the background on his tv one guy flew all the way from japan to compete

5324466 monsieur sapin tait le ministre des finances dun gouvernement socialiste qui a conduit la france la r cession en 1993 si quelquun devrait rester silencieux aujourdhui cest bien celui qui porte la responsabilit dune crise sans pr c dent dans notre pays et ce au d but des ann es 90

5324474 during our first quarter for fiscal 2009 we reported tremendous revenue and earnings growth as such we reaffirm our fiscal 2009 guidance of revenue between 100 125 million and earnings of 7 9 million before one time expenses in addition we project revenue between 150 180 million for fiscal 2010 with earnings of 11 15 million before one time expenses
5324475 it is important to consider when reviewing our financial results on a quarterly basis that the infrastructure construction business in india is seasonal and the months between june and august represent our monsoon season as such revenues for our fiscal first and second quarters will be substantially lower than our fiscal third and fourth quarters each year for example the predecessor companies reported pro forma revenue for the first quarter of fiscal 2008 of approximately 3 3 million yet for the full fiscal year of 2008 the combined companies reported revenue of over 30 million

5324491 uncertainty continues to permeate the economists forecasts as they remain almost evenly split for the third month in a row on whether the u s is currently in a recession they expect the economy to slow to a crawl in the second half of this year registering just 0 6 growth at an annual rate in the fourth quarter at the same time the forecasts call for continued job losses and elevated inflation with oil prices above 100 a barrel well into next year though down from current levels
5324492 the financial market turmoil has meant that our funds rate reductions have led to less credit expansion to households and businesses than would typically be the case
5324493 the second half of 2008 will likely be extremely sluggish
5324494 well see some alleviation of the inflation pressures and having oil and other commodities come down so strongly helps

5324508 arsenal can confirm that togolese forward emmanuel adebayor has signed a new long term contract with the club
5324509 we have to get behind him and support him because he is a tremendous force and is of tremendous importance for the team you want your own fans to be behind him
5324510 we saw that bmw had a poor weekend and toyota had a good weekend but i dont believe the pecking order suddenly changes
5324511 there are certainly trends and at the moment we have a very distinct upward trend whereas bmw have a little bit of a downward trend and toyota seem to fluctuate
5324512 so i dont think that the race itself shows a change to the status quo but merely reinforces the trends which have been developing for a little while
5324513 i think it was probably our strongest result of the season
5324514 while nelson piquet s finishing position in germany was a better result on paper we were the first to acknowledge that luck played a major part in that result
5324515 in hungary things were very different as we had two cars racing competitively all the way racing against strong competitors and racing them on equal terms
5324516 its phenomenal on sunday i was pretty down after the first couple of rounds i was mainly disappointed because i didnt want to let these guys down i was on the back foot a bit because it was a tough day the day before
5324517 probably every other boat that had a chance of a medal wanted to attack us but we had a good run then got where we needed to be and did a great job holding down on the run

5324558 to ask the secretary of state for foreign and commonwealth affairs what information he has about how north korea was able to build a military grade plutonium production reactor outside international safeguards based on blueprints of the united kingdom military magnox plants at calder hall sellafield
5324559 a lthough the totem explosive yield was highly destructive they evidently confirmed that it was not good enough for military quality weapons because these results would have been shared with the us we can guess that the 1962 nevada test might have been conducted with plutonium closer to the low end 81 of the definition
5324560 the 1962 detonation involved plutonium of a quality below that of weapons grade
5324561 high irradiation level reactor grade plutonium can be used to make nuclear weapons
5324562 c ompared to data released about other nuclear detonations the information disclosed about the 1962 test has little substance
5324563 scorned the us government affirmation that it successfully exploded a weapon made with reactor grade plutonium
5324564 a lower yield would be suggestive of greater resistance to proliferant use no nation with other options would choose such material as the basis for a nuclear weapons program and none are known to have done so
5324565 the information disclosed about this test in 1977 represented a compromise between policy makers in the carter administration who wished to high light the proliferation risks of of civilian plutonium use and those responsible for protecting classified weapons design information
5324566 to our knowledge all u s nuclear weapons use weapon grade plutonium i e plutonium with an isotopic fraction of at least 93 5 percent pu 239 the same is probably true of the weapons in the arsenals of the other weapon states there are several reasons for this one of these is that the natural uranium metal fuel used in early production reactors had to be discharged after low u 235 burnup because of both reactivity and metallurgical fuel constraints such reactor operation naturally produces plutonium with a high pu 239 fraction it was also recognized that radiation exposure to workers fabricating plutonium weapons components in glove boxes would be minimized if the plutonium had a low fraction of the higher plutonium isotopes
5324567 however the most important factor in motivating the high pu 239 content plutonium in early nuclear weapons was the problem of pre initiation of the chain reaction
5324568 we are not arguing that a proliferator would not prefer weapon grade plutonium or highly enriched uranium to reactor grade uranium however the possible use of reactor grade plutonium cannot be discounted

5324579 there was some suggestion that we might be able to craft something that might meet constitutional muster with respect to caring for fetuses or children who were delivered in this fashion unfortunately this bill goes a little bit further and so this is probably not going to survive constitutional scrutiny number one whenever we define a pre viable fetus as a person that is protected by the equal protection clause or other elements in the constitution what were really saying is in fact that they are persons that are entitled to the kinds of protections that would be provided to a a child a nine month old child that was delivered to term that determination then essentially if it was accepted by a court would forbid abortions to take place i mean it it would essentially bar abortions because the equal protection clause does not allow somebody to kill a child and if this is a child then this would be an antiabortion statute
5324580 the words person human being child and individual include every infant member of the species homo sapiens who is born alive at any stage of development
5324581 as used in this section the term born alive with respect to a member of the species homo sapiens means the complete expulsion or extraction from its mother of that member at any stage of development who after that expulsion or extraction breathes or has a beating heart pulsation of the umbilical cord or definite movement of voluntary muscles regardless of whether the umbilical cord has been cut and regardless of whether the expulsion or extraction occurs as a result of natural or induced labor cesarean section or induced abortion
5324582 john mccain is a decrepit old windbag despised by his own party base so why is barack obama only leading by 3 points in ohio
5324583 could it be because obama grew up in a strange and exotic land called hawaii its hardly even part of america the natives run around in primitive clothing they call swimming suits and bathe in the sun all day how can you expect the hard working white people of ohio to connect with a so called hawaiian

5324648 we went with giovani dos santos instead because we thought his speed would worry middlesbrough but as middlesbrough tired we thought it would be the right moment to substitute him and bring on berbatov he was quoted as saying
5324649 i still have a lot of friends at tottenham and im not angry about ramos naming me as a substitute people say i looked unhappy but if i was laughing when i was on the bench they would say i was an idiot
5324650 to grant him his wish to be able to join united but levy is determined to make united pay 30 million pounds for the forward and will enjoy the thought that fergusons desperation will have grown with yesterdays august 17 result

5324668 if funding cuts impact market development lack of foreign investment will inhibit canadas ability to get films made and keep film industry creatives from leaving our country in pursuit of work
5324669 we are travelling to all the areas across the province to make sure and see first hand what we have and where we are deficient
5324670 we are meeting with stakeholders to address their requests and most of the requests are being dealt with
5324671 the public reaction out there youd think wed shut down the arts thats not the case
5324672 this was not about less money for the arts it about having government programs that are meeting their objectives were committed to cancelling programs that are boondoggles
5324673 the government has departed from its usual consultative process and cut these programs without warning
5324674 the opposition seems to be accusing us of having an agenda to see the arts is funded to a lesser extent on an ideological basis and i can say thats not the case because we are spending more on the arts than the liberal government
5324675 the promart and trade routes funding we received allowed us to host 400 international buyers and programmers at the festival to produce a book promoting the films we screen to take 40 canadian filmmakers to 32 countries for 400 screenings of canadian films for overseas buyers and to promote sprockets our childrens film festival to potential foreign programmers
5324676 they the conservatives dont believe in culture but the worst part of it is that they want to change the kind of society you want to live in and i dont like what i am seeing
5324677 like web oriented news consumers integrators are affluent and highly educated however they are older on average than those who consider the internet their main source of news
5324678 studio production has decreased in popularity and as a result cinevillage is very underutilized
5324679 in addition canwest owns and operates existing studio space that can be used for production of this nature
5324680 we are disappointed that canwest will not be renewing its lease for its television production facility in our heward campus
5324681 however this studio campus is extremely well liked by film and television personnel and we will now be able to offer more production space in addition to the new facilities at filmport
5324682 must more and more produce product with their own resources and at their own risk in the hope of finding sales if the show doesnt get the ratings it is cut loose and the freelance producer is the big loser
5324683 both mp3 players and satellite radio have unique advantages that leads us to believe both will co exist new satellite radio plans create a greater opportunity for synergies between the two
5324684 and im so proud that so many of my friends have done so who also believe in freedom and democracy
5324685 i have about five houses over there because im investing in property but the one thats our home is very special

5324687 every man under my command owes me 100 nazi scalps and yall will git get me 100 nazi scalps taken from the heads of 100 dead nazis or die trying
5324688 it is not just the scalping or the carving of swastikas in foreheads or the shooting of a german officers testicles or the slow strangling scene all shown with tarantinos customary love of detail that is likely to upset the german nation and its critics
5324689 it is the whole idea of turning the second world war into a comic book adventure in which not a single german character has redeeming value
5324690 i dont want it to feel like a period film this is a modern in your face movie
5324691 its really tiring and like spending time with the babies
5324692 but if i have to crawl across that finish line im going to crawl across that finish line its for the kids i keep telling myself that when im training im like this is for charity your kids are going to know about this dont embarrass the family really get it done lopez
5324693 the record industry is a very political place at the moment
5324694 lots of people have been fired or have taken redundancy laid off recently as the company emi was taken over
5324695 many of these people were people assigned to my projects and now i dont quite know whats going on
5324696 im sure everyone will find their feet soon enough and ill be able to put the album out soon
5324697 your evil spawn angelina jolie and her vacuous hubby brad pitt make about 40 million a year in violent psychopathic movies and give away three of it to starving children trying to look as if they give a crap about humanity as they spit out more dunces that will consume more than their fair share and wreck the earth even more
5324698 miss jolie says she likes john mccain too and hasnt decided who to endorse huh arent you supposed to be somewhat enlightened or do you not know that the african daughter you hold in every picture had parents who suffered and died because of the republican partys worldwide economic assault on africa over the last few decades since reagan
5324699 now go back to making your movies about women who love to handle big guns that shoot hundreds of people to death

5324710 she was very surprised that we do have a tradition of naming our boats after her movies and shes just really stoked to be part of a team
5324711 we didnt have to do what we did today but we were nice and relaxed and it ended up all right
5324712 i think i got about nine hours sleep my best sleep of the week
5324713 when the first boat went through the line and the gun went off we just looked at each other and thought weve just got to get through that line

5324715 theres certainly been some challenges over the past few years

5324904 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5324905 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

5324923 but then samantha came on to the scene and i was dropped
5324924 she met lindsay in the summer of 2006 at a party in malibu
5324925 from the start lindsay was very confused about her feelings for courtenay so did more and more drugs to stifle the sexual attraction she was experiencing
5324926 but eventually she just gave in and at every party theyd kiss and touch each other in the corner its a miracle nobody found out
5324927 both of them would do lines of cocaine in the toilets then head home and fall into bed together
5324928 courtenay would throw fits of rage writing her hundreds of angry e mails from another room in the house
5324929 the sexual attraction between them was electric though and theyd still kiss and make up
5324930 courtenay still cant understand how lindsay is now so open with samantha
5324931 every time she sees a picture of them together it kills her

5324976 the last barriers between china and the forces of globalisation
5324977 beijing not only endured lengthy negotiations and an ever expanding set of requirements in order to join the wto but also used the pro market rules of that institution to overcome resistance among die hards inside china itself

5324987 the games played a key role again by the presence of media people

5324999 it is important to say that our guides are not allowed to say anything while taking the tourists through block 45 in new belgrade we dont want to express any political opinions
5325000 i am a tourist worker and the sites are an attraction
5325001 it is sad that tourist packages celebrating the real great people of this country do not exist but we have a belgrade tour dedicated to radovan karadzic
5325002 on the surface this may seem like a smart business move but it actually shows the real depth of a moral and ethical crisis in our society everyone now talks about radovan karadzic aka dragan dabic but people in serbia still do not talk about srebrenica
5325003 a tour named following karadzics footsteps should actually be organised in bosnia and it should include all places where horrible war crimes were committed of which karadzic has been accused
5325004 the caucasus is the kind of place where when the guns start firing its hard to stop them that is the brutal reality of south ossetia

5325014 we have copied nature taking the elements and mechanisms found in plant life that have evolved over 3 billion years and recreated one of those processes in the laboratory
5325015 a manganese cluster is central to a plants ability to use water carbon dioxide and sunlight to make carbohydrates and oxygen man made mimics of this cluster were developed by professor charles dismukes some time ago and weve taken it a step further harnessing the ability of these molecules to convert water into its component elements oxygen and hydrogen
5325016 the breakthrough came when we coated a proton conductor called nafion onto an anode to form a polymer membrane just a few micrometres thick which acts as a host for the manganese clusters
5325017 normally insoluble in water when we bound the catalyst within the pores of the nafion membrane it was stabilised against decomposition and importantly water could reach the catalyst where it was oxidised on exposure to light
5325018 whilst man has been able to split water into hydrogen and oxygen for years we have been able to do the same thing for the first time using just sunlight an electrical potential of 1 2 volts and the very chemical that nature has selected for this purpose
5325019 we need to continue to learn from nature so that we can better master this process
5325020 hydrogen has long been considered the ideal clean green fuel energy rich and carbon neutral the production of hydrogen using nothing but water and sunlight offers the possibility of an abundant renewable green source of energy for the future for communities across the world

5325037 come on boys five more strokes and you guys are going to be olympic champions
5325038 you cross the finish line and youre completely exhausted completely tired but the thrill of victory erases the pain and suffering you endured during the race
5325039 we bond pretty tight because we spend so much time together we train three times a day six times a week we travel we room together and were really close
5325040 id say its a distant memory athens definitely hurt at the time when i think back to it but leading up to the race we didnt really think about it that much
5325041 we just recognized that we had a really excellent opportunity to perform and to seize gold and i guess having failed before and having worked that much longer for victory that makes reward that much more sweet

5325059 i have deep religious beliefs and values i had experiences in my life where i had to rely on god not to get me through another day or another hour but another minute
5325060 i also believe that talking too much about ones faith and religion in my view is something between me and god

5325077 triathlon is a passion and something ive wanted to put my heart and soul and every bit of energy into today is one of those days
5325078 in the third lap of the running i definitely thought of that
5325079 the club has accepted a significant payout the likes of which have never been seen in australian sport
5325080 we are pleased this chapter of the clubs history is in the archive and we can put a full stop on sonny bill williams
5325081 that was something that we were not prepared to negotiate on
5325082 they didnt want it to be put in there but there was no way we were going to budge on that
5325083 im shocked that this has actually happened to me but obviously this is a dream come true
5325084 its just something that all of us out here dream about as kids and to finally have it come to reality is just amazing
5325085 we really need to raise the profile of womens golf in australia i think the more aussies that do well the better the game will get down there at home and hopefully we get more players over and playing the lpga or whatever tour around the world
5325086 nowhere in my best dreams i can imagine something like what i did this year
5325087 i am playing an unbelievable season no doubt the feeling for sure is very happy for being no 1 but the feeling doesnt change too much because the last years i did very well too
5325088 we knew that we needed to win this race and more in order to close down valentinos advantage so this makes the championship very difficult for us
5325089 anything can happen in racing but 50 points is a big gap against such a strong and consistent competitor
5325090 anyway i never throw in the towel nor does anybody at ducati and we will keep fighting until the end
5325091 misano is a home race for the factory and there will be lots of ducatis there so my main thought now is to stay positive and bounce back with a good show for them in two weeks
5325092 obviously we are all disappointed with this result because our pace in practice was good everything went very well this morning and we felt we could push out in front
5325093 i was doing the same lap time over and over and i was quite happy with the pace i was running
5325094 the crash came out of the blue that corner was an easy one but i lost the front and it happened very quickly very suddenly and i didnt manage to save it
5325095 its a hard one to explain and we will look at the data but sometimes this kind of crash happens at this level of racing and it was my mistake
5325096 id carefully prepared for a difficult duel with stoner which the first laps of the race confirmed
5325097 but i have to say as well that my motorcycle was running perfectly and allowed me to ride very calmly towards victory
5325098 the 2007 8 listings build on the progress made over the last three years in ensuring australian trained and bred horses receive due recognition
5325099 in the previous three years makybe diva 124 in 2005 6 had been the only australian trained horse to achieve a rating higher than 120
5325100 it was disappointing i think in the first half we played pretty well our attacking play was very good
5325101 but in the second half we never looked like breaking them down we were the better team but we didnt make it count
5325102 i dont want to be sacked but maybe it is one line that chelsea will follow because at chelsea if you dont win it is bad
5325103 i have a contract for two years and i will try and stay two years but its true nobody remembers a loser
5325104 i was getting breakfast and thought ah i just dont want to talk to her today so i bumped it then two seconds later there was a message from nicole wishing us good luck
5325105 yes i ended up returning her call she was very happy
5325106 it does go a long way dont worry about that
5325107 she was very surprised that we do have a tradition of naming our boats after her movies and shes just really stoked to be part of a team
5325108 we didnt have to do what we did today but we were nice and relaxed and it ended up all right
5325109 i think i got about nine hours sleep my best sleep of the week
5325110 when the first boat went through the line and the gun went off we just looked at each other and thought weve just got to get through that line
5325111 we knew we had it but to actually come through the line with gold made the past four years worth it
5325112 theres certainly been some challenges over the past few years
5325113 i was really sick and there was no light at the end of the tunnel
5325114 i had some special bug that they couldnt find what it was but once i knew i was getting better
5325115 wer denkt er k nne ungestraft russische b rger t ten wird eine vernichtende antwort bekommen
5325116 ich kann sagen wann das neue jahr beginnt aber das genaue datum f r den abzug unserer truppen aus dem konfliktgebiet kann ich noch nicht sagen
5325117 wir m ssen nun erst einmal das umfangreiche datenmaterial auswerten
5325118 wir m ssen nun pr fen inwiefern hier m glicherweise ein zusammenhang besteht
5325119 this is the first time anyone has done really fundamental hands on quantum mechanics with an organic led
5325120 we can convert the spin information into a current and manipulate it and change it
5325121 we are manipulating this information and reading it out again we are writing it and reading it
5325122 even the smallest transistor today consists of hundreds of thousands of atoms
5325123 the ultimate goal of miniaturization is to implement electronics on the scale of atoms and electrons
5325124 just like a mass on a spring the pulse produces an oscillation of the spins of singlets and triplets in the organic led
5325125 we can confirm emmanuel has signed a new long term contract with the club
5325126 i can tell everyone that yes i will sign a contract
5325127 i have three years left on my contract and im putting two or three years more so im very happy being part of this family
5325128 he is a tremendous force and is of tremendous importance for the team you want your own fans to be behind him
5325129 the most important event so far of the 2008 campaign
5325130 answers sounded pretty stilted and canned like obviously recycled stump shtick
5325131 way of talking about what his faith means to him without having to define his theology directly
5325132 john mccain has had to make bigger more momentous decisions in his life than has barack obama
5325133 i f you want a president who knows the details of policy on the one hand and thinks the world is complicated on the other you would vote for
5325134 seriously underestimated how saturdays religious forum was made to order for mccain despite the perceptions that mccain rarely talks openly about his faith
5325135 obama may have had more authentic moments mccain was impressively on message
5325136 p residents are not religious leaders and anyone looking to them for spiritual guidance is simply looking in the wrong place

5325144 fondos para publicidad del estado se reparten de forma arbitraria con el fin de premiar coberturas favorables y castigar las cr ticas contratos de pago directo a periodistas o llamadas a editores de parte de funcionarios molestos por la difusi n de una noticia son pr cticas que limitan la libertad de expresi n y que se ejecutan tras bambalinas
5325145 el precio del silencio uso y abuso de la publicidad oficial y otras formas de censura indirecta en am rica latina
5325146 hasta hace unos a os predominaban las interferencias graves como la persecuci n la censura directa o el asesinato de periodistas ahora esas formas est n en retirada afortunadamente y afloran otras menos ostensibles pero igualmente da inas
5325147 los pa ses bajo estudio fueron elegidos en funci n del conocimiento previo sobre mecanismos de censura indirecta que enfrentaban all los periodistas y se procur adem s diversidad geogr fica y de mercados
5325148 el manejo discrecional de recursos para estos fines prospera gracias a un vac o legal

5325152 die erkenntnisse der letzten tage haben unsere schlimmsten bef rchtungen best tigt
5325153 i have had this blog for about five months now and have never had an issue with the sitemap i usually recd a google bot within minutes of posting a new entry or an update starting around the 1st of august i noticed that the google bots had stopped arriving so i resubmitted my sitemap thinking that there might have been a glitch since that time the submission has been in a pending state at first i resubmitted after 24 hours but no change at this point the sitemap has been pending for about three days last night at around 10 00pm i recd a google bot the problem i have is that the sitemap submission is still pending and none of the articles that ive posted since 2 august have been added to google does anyone know why my sitemap is pending it appears others are having a problem with their sitemap pending as well
5325154 no one in blogger forum is replying hope this issue solve soon else our blogs will be dead as you said webado that my site is loading slow i completly changed the site theme and made it using default blogger templates its superfast now but googlebot is super super slow still travelling all over internet to find our blog and not able to find
5325155 hi everyone i just wanted to mention that we have been looking into this as soon as i have more information ill let you know its great to see you all using sitemaps

5325159 that mccain may not have been in the cone of silence and may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama he seemed so well prepared
5325160 senator mccain was in a motorcade led by the united states secret service and held in a green room with no broadcast feed
5325161 may not have been in the cone of silence and may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama
5325162 the obama people must feel that he didnt do quite as well as they might have wanted to in that context because what they are putting out privately is that mccain may not have been in the cone of silence and may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama he seemed so well prepared
5325163 do i need this or have i used this in the last 12 months
5325164 nu er der nogle der samler lidt op p kort sigt er der stadig en del investortillid der skal bygges op men p den lange bane tror jeg det vil v re en af de f rende inden for sektoren p grund af sit teknologiske niveau samtidig handler aktien p nogle meget interessante n gletal nu
5325165 der kom nogle markedstal for det russiske marked der viste at markedet er steget med 3 pct r til dato s det underbygger forventningen om at carlsberg n r sine m l for 2008
5325166 all his bluster distortions and negative attacks notwithstanding it is hard to understand how senator mccain can at once proclaim his support for the sovereign government of iraq and then stubbornly defy their expressed support for a timeline to remove our combat brigades from their country the difference in this race is that john mccain is intent on spending 10 billion a month on an open ended war while barack obama thinks we should bring this war to a responsible end and invest in our pressing needs here at home
5325167 john mccain wants americans to spend 10 billion dollars a month to stay in iraq

5325199 whiny narcissistic self indulgent people who had everything handed to them
5325200 first of all i was never a swinger we did a lot for the country and the environment and were portrayed as hedonists
5325201 the millstone of boomer milestones enough with the 1968 nostalgia its time for boomers to stifle themselves
5325202 there is no political left or right only failed baby boomer leadership
5325203 whats new or whats developing is the convergence of an antipathy toward a generation with the negative stereotypes and attitudes toward aging
5325204 one of the primary motivations behind that i believe is that the baby boomers are associated not just with liberal politics rush limbaugh is a baby boomer but because they have advocated social policies that are anathema to conservatives
5325205 distaste for all things boomers its almost a stereotypical characteristic of generation x
5325206 they are more a conforming generation that kind of fell in lockstep with the g i generation values and they saw the boomers breaking from those traditions as kind of a violation of their views of the values that are important
5325207 we have a much more inclusive nation as a result of the baby boomers
5325208 we absolutely have to make it socially unacceptable to blanketly diminish a third of the u s adult population
5325209 in the back and forth between clinton and gingrich and in the elections of 2000 and 2004 i sometimes felt as if i were watching the psychodrama of the baby boom generation a tale rooted in old grudges and revenge plots hatched on a handful of college campuses long ago played out on the national stage
5325210 i do think that he has alienated some boomers by doing that
5325211 ive had two conversations with top obama adviser david axelrod about this and i had spoken to barack directly
5325212 i think theres a reasonably good chance obama is going to say he is a joneser
5325213 the fact that up to this point hes avoided a generational label would suggest that hes trying to be trans generational
5325214 whiny narcissistic self indulgent people who had everything handed to them
5325215 first of all i was never a swinger we did a lot for the country and the environment and were portrayed as hedonists
5325216 the millstone of boomer milestones enough with the 1968 nostalgia its time for boomers to stifle themselves
5325217 there is no political left or right only failed baby boomer leadership
5325218 whats new or whats developing is the convergence of an antipathy toward a generation with the negative stereotypes and attitudes toward aging

5325225 individuals taking antidepressants should be aware of the possible cognitive effects as they may affect performance in social academic and work settings as well as driving abilities
5325226 however it appears that mood is correlated with cognitive performance more so than medication use

5325228 the first mobile phone based on android which is software supported by google will debut this fall moe tanabian senior principal at ibb consulting who has seen the device has been able to give me a lot more details on its software
5325229 if you want to receive push e mail you ll have to use google s gmail it s unclear that the phone will support microsoft exchange
5325230 the phone will have access to upcoming t mobile app store which will be very similar to apple s store featuring third party iphone applications only t mobile will likely place fewer restrictions on software developers so that android phone users may have more games and productivity apps to choose from
5325231 the phone will come with google s advertising software pre installed customers who opt in to receive mobile ads from google may be offered to buy the phone for a lower price and may also pay lower monthly service fees the google platform will serve ads based on your interests and location provided by the phone
5325232 the android phone will hit stores around thanksgiving not in september october as some news outlets have reported
5325233 if indeed youll have to use gmail for push e mail thats troubling clearly lots of people use other services today and many businesses may be hesitant to abandon their current e mail systems
5325234 the gmail mandate also raises all those old hairy questions about just how much control google will exercise over the android project lots of the worlds best independent developers and software companies actually compete with google and if they sense that google is always getting the upper hand with android they will not back this phone end users will suffer as they wont have access to the best applications out there

5325249 i know that the extent of the changes under the way forward reform strategies may cause some staff uncertainty as to their future within the department
5325250 no officer need lose his or her job but some will be required to relocate we will assist in any relocation
5325251 casualisation and privatisation will not solve the problems in the prisons
5325252 inmate numbers have increased by 40 per cent in just 10 years its a miracle weve managed to hold it together with the numbers we have
5325253 abolishing operational agreements and casualisation is a serious health and safety concern for corrective services staff and for inmates
5325254 in corrective services we need permanent skilled staff trained for the dangers and challenges of the job not backpackers looking for a quick buck
5325255 overtime costs have been a problem for years and the iemma government has done nothing
5325256 obviously there has to be reform we have an overtime culture and its been a strong culture
5325257 but until the iphone and ipod touch we had not seen a device compelling enough
5325258 instead of having one or two sources for information students today have thousands of resources at their fingertips it is becoming our responsibility as educators to help them navigate the mountains of information and learn how to be selective
5325259 we are not merely providing cutting edge technology tools to our incoming students
5325260 we also are committed to continuing research about how technology can benefit learning and better prepare our students for the future for their sake its not good enough just to keep up we want to lead
5325261 young drinkers who have greater disposable incomes are much more likely to drink to excess
5325262 this shows the scale of the challenge were facing and highlights why urgent action is needed to tackle binge drinking
5325263 this epidemic of binge drinking is hurting our young people and were not going to stand on the sidelines and let that happen
5325264 as i have done nothing wrong in connection with any of the matters that are the subject of the inquiry i expect to be exonerated
5325265 in the near future i would love to have a talk about new challenges and opportunities in education and training and the provision of safe and fair workplaces in nsw

5325272 its possible that i may have found him but i didnt dig deep enough i felt a bit about it its hard to know
5325273 i first saw his ski at the cliff base and started digging i probed around and didnt find much
5325274 it was silent but huge slabs of ice and snow were barrelling down the cliff face
5325275 its possible that i may have found him but i didnt dig deep enough i felt a bit about it its hard to know
5325276 what the children who have been victims of violence and abuse will make of all of this in the future we cannot know
5325277 but they will surely wonder why a feminist of such fame as greer has come to the defence of those who destroyed their innocence and damaged their sense of self
5325278 we are not in the mood for failed leftist excuses for the rising levels of homicide femicide and suicide
5325279 dr greers panoply of protest slogans deployed as social theory was dismissed long ago by the research and policy community as incapable of explaining the present day levels of huge disparities in life expectancy morbidity and mortality rates and other socio economic indicators
5325280 while the burden of history is acknowledged in much of this work the everyday suffering in communities at risk is caused by a multiplicity of factors all more complicated than dr greer would have us understand
5325281 clearly there has been recent debate about the jury system here in queensland arising out of a couple of cases
5325282 while these amendments have not been designed with any particular case in mind they will apply to any case where an application is heard from the time that the amendments become law
5325283 intolerable prospect of retrials in situations where one intransigent juror had refused to do his or her duty in accordance with the law
5325284 reform of the justice system is needed but whether these proposals are the right reforms remains to be seen
5325285 if we are serious about reducing global greenhouse emissions the nuclear option is one we cannot ignore
5325286 the biggest gains in cutting greenhouse gas emissions from electricity generation in the shortest possible time and at the lowest cost and least economic risk will come from nuclear power
5325287 its a black and white answer or should i say black and yellow answer clean coal and yellowcake we must include nuclear in our future base load clean energy mix

5325293 its always stuck with me ive been at some bigger schools in the country but anybody who has been to fresno knows how important bulldog football is to those that are faithful
5325294 we have been all over the place with the goal to come back to fresno
5325295 this year with the anticipation level where it is its a good time to be back hopefully we can make it happen
5325296 the favorite part of my job is to see the guys come in as freshman wide eyed and bushy tailed and having no idea what college is about and then to see them grow and turn into men and turn into professionals
5325297 one reason why i picked this job is i get to be outside all day
5325298 i like to golf and go to the lake with some jet skiing
5325299 when one party is shameless the other cant afford to be spineless
5325300 while the congressman believes spending time with the delegates and the party faithful is productive he is focused on campaigning in his district and ensuring that we keep nevada red

5325304 mr suskind reports that the bush administration in its pursuit of war created and promoted forged documents about iraq
5325305 i am particularly troubled that the decision to disseminate this fabricated intelligence is alleged to have come from the highest reaches of the administration
5325306 there was a dozen ideas proffered about how to trigger a war
5325307 the one that interested me the most was why dont we build we in our shipyard build four or five boats that look like iranian pt boats put navy seals on them with a lot of arms and next time one of our boats goes to the straits of hormuz start a shoot up
5325308 when one party is shameless the other cant afford to be spineless

5325311 i think sunday wasnt as bad for matty as he probably thinks it was
5325312 were going to need him in september and i think hes going to be fine
5325313 you cant bring one of those guys up here and expect him to get those eighth inning outs
5325314 looks like it was a good toss to lose but i would have still batted if i had won the toss
5325315 first 45 minutes would always have been tough but if you have got through that period and got 225 runs on board it would have been a much tougher score to chase down on this
5325316 it was not easy wicket even when we were batting it was not easy with the new ball

5325337 it is a shame that matsuura san cannot make it but i will do my best to stand in her place

5325339 i am sorry for that disruption we cannot proceed with the meeting without matsuuras party we will continue with this meeting as soon as it is most convinient to all again i am deeply sorry

5325347 if you can be born a foreigner what nationality would you want and what kind of name
5325348 when there was a big sayu call during the singles complete concert did you get scared
5325349 he was where he wanted to be and doing what he wanted to do and thats the most important thing
5325350 he was just dedicated to his life he was dedicated to america he was dedicated to people
5325351 even though things had been quiet over there at least where he was he knew what his mission was
5325352 he knew the danger involved and he knew that every time he said good bye to us it very well could mean good bye
5325353 i guess if he had to die a soldier he died the way he wanted to
5325354 since 1980 the united states has given more than 40 billion in development assistance to sub saharan africa
5325355 as if they give a crap about humanity as they spit out more dunces that will consume more than their fair share and wreck the earth even more
5325356 mccain says heres my plan im going to drill here drill now which is something he only came up with two months ago when he started looking at polling
5325357 the same old folks that brought you george w bush the same team
5325358 respectfully im going to disagree with you on mccain and his service
5325359 hey i won and i didnt even play very well
5325360 i fell in love with a slit eyed lady by the light of an eastern moon
5325361 i am delighted that the football association and the england football team are supporting our it doesnt have to happen campaign warning youngsters about the severe consequences of knife crime
5325362 i want to reassure the public that we the government the police and local authorities are doing all we can to tackle knives and getting knives off our streets
5325363 the players are well aware of the positive impact they can have on those growing up and i am proud that they have taken the initiative to support this important programme
5325364 knife crime causes massive grief and pain to both victims families and their communities and that is why we have a duty both to the public to take a tough approach to those who carry knives without good reason
5325365 young people need to realise there is nothing glamorous about carrying a knife and we must send a clear message to offenders that knife carrying will not be tolerated in todays society we owe it to those who do not carry knives to be protected from those that do
5325366 recently we have seen the emergence of a worrying trend in relation to knife crime
5325367 we need to find other ways to channel youngsters to give them a sense of structure enhance their life skills through education and training getting involved in a sport is one way of doing this
5325368 we are out but you should try our chicken dish its very fresh it was made this morning
5325369 call me by my name or the champion anything other than the kangaroo whats more there are no kangaroos in panama
5325370 i didnt tell you that i wanted to see this show tonight because i wanted you to come out
5325371 um if this date is not going well im happy to leave
5325372 oh no i really think youre beautiful i just want to hang out tomorrow thats all theres a really cool band playing tonight
5325373 see i told you to stay away from models with full sleeve tattoos
5325374 now my main goal is to win the nba championship
5325375 well have to wait and see how things develop with germany in the years ahead
5325376 i dont want to make any concrete plans right now
5325377 but i knew when i came off the court tonight that it was the last time for a couple of years so from that point of view it was a wonderful feeling to go out on a high note
5325378 everythings still open but i think i need a break
5325379 shopping is no longer just about passive consumption its about actively solving problems
5325380 govern behaviour which is not licensable as it takes place outside
5325381 i imagine the licensing committee saw smoking outside as being inextricably linked with licensing activity so it felt it was fine to deal with the issue
5325382 although one licensing committees decision is not binding on another the fact that it has been publicised will undoubtedly lead to others doing the same sort of thing
5325383 this could well impact the pub trade further as people who would have previously popped in for a couple of pints and a few cigarettes might think twice
5325384 n o vamos nos esquecer que nessa mesma poca a ex prefeita tinha uma avalia o de governo de 29 estava em primeiro lugar nas pesquisas e perdeu as elei es n s temos 38 ndice de aprova o neste mesmo momento muita confian a nesse in cio de campanha e portanto temos todas as raz es para ter otimismo
5325385 todos sabem da rela o que eu tenho com o governador uma rela o muito boa do ponto de vista pessoal partid rio e pol tica todos sabem da afinidade que ele tem com a nossa gest o e do trabalho em conjunto que existe portanto eu tenho dito em todos os momentos que o governador saber encontrar o modelo da sua conduta nessas elei es
5325386 vou continuar em busca de votos de eleitores e mostrar que eu tenho a melhor proposta para a cidade
5325387 bvio que a divis o entre membros do partidos beneficia o pt
5325388 temos que lidar com essa situa o bvio que no segundo turno indo o kassab ou o alckmin todo mundo vai estar junto

5325390 there seemed to be so much interest in the past
5325391 from othello to jesse james the theater had run its course it was born when the city of conway was 37 years old it lasted 46 years and has been gone for 52 years
5325392 its so important because they get to bring their backpacks full of supplies and put them at their seats and then put away their scissors and their crayons in the appropriate places
5325393 so then when they come in on monday everything is in place and they know where to go
5325394 the kids get here on the first day of school and the first thing they do is look around and see if they know someone else in the room
5325395 and when they do see someone it instantly makes them more comfortable
5325396 now the moms can bring the video cameras and take their pictures then they can give them great big hugs and say their goodbyes and the kids are all ready to learn
5325397 my kids go to st joseph preschool and even though they are just going to the classroom next door they have to get used to doing things differently and the longer days and being able to come early helps
5325398 we know each step of the day and it definitely decreases anxiety for both me and the kids
5325399 they really do well with school and i think its because with them being so close in age each one is getting the next one ready
5325400 there are some technological challenges to the folks who want to put in disaster recovery
5325401 we have gotten training for our people because of budget reasons were doing a little at a time buying a little equipment

5325403 it was purchased several years ago as a temporary station until we could get a permanent one

5325408 you know hes got a longer track record than that
5325409 if you are not gay a man should not be wearing pink
5325410 saying pink is a form of red is the same as saying homosexual is a form of male
5325411 its the sort of stuff that gets said every day in the schoolyard
5325412 a lot of young people are quite impressionable and when they see celebrities saying stuff like that they think its ok to say it themselves
5325413 its always unacceptable to put people down based on their sexuality its just like putting down people because of their race judging people just because theyre a little bit different from you
5325414 i am excited to have another vegan friendly cafe in park slope and am doubly excited that the food is actually good which is a stab at
5325415 i like that bbb offers such a wide variety of burger choices from standard to kobe beef a shame because with different management they could easily become one of the neighborhoods most solid offerings
5325416 oh wait guess that place isnt brooklyn burger bar anymore
5325417 me oh my i could really go for a pint of yuengling and a quick restup on a tacky couch

5325424 este verano todo el mundo ha trabajado much simo para poder estar satisfechos con la plantilla
5325425 aunque la gente est muy ilusionada debemos mantener un mensaje de prudencia
5325426 it is not possible to simply do what the bible says
5325427 but its a different kind of center we want to embrace mystery rather than conquer it
5325428 i grew up thinking that weve figured out the bible
5325429 every person everywhere who has asked big questions of a big god
5325430 genetically modified foods or gmos genetically modified organisms commonly refer to crop plants created for human or animal consumption using molecular biology techniques these plants have been modified in a laboratory to enhance desired traits such as increased resistance to herbicides or improved nutritional content

5325439 any time i see something screech across the room and latch on to someones neck and the guy screams and tries to get it off i just have to laugh because what is that thing
5325440 its a great team effort everybody just has a great time getting ready for the fair they enjoy this part just as much as they do during the fair
5325441 hamburgers hotdogs 20 30 cases of that to get started we do prime rib sandwiches weve got about 100 cases of prime rib sandwiches coming in 20 bags of potatoes for our potatoes oreily
5325442 you always want the tradition because people come back for tradition everybody comes for the sausage sandwich everybody comes for the cup of milk everybody comes for the baked potato but you always want something new to bring a little more excitement
5325443 by tomorrow morning youll see thousands of people on the grounds and theyll have this fair up and running within three days from stands this size to the whole midway
5325444 pc enabled small businesses in the u s are interested in running bi on their consumer data to drive and monitor performance against the competition
5325445 the payoff is rapid innovation new marketing ads and new channels to boost their profit margins almost 80 percent of small businesses try to understand tco total cost of ownership before purchasing bi products services thats because they want these purchases to be a part of their overall it strategy
5325446 using a 3 000 degree assetaline torch in a forest of wood construction products is like using matches in a barn full of hay
5325447 and i hate to say that people are lying but heres a situation where folks are lying
5325448 was not the bill that was presented at the state level
5325449 whatever else history may say about me when im gone i hope it will record that i appealed to your best hopes not your worst fears to your confidence rather than your doubts my dream is that you will travel the road ahead with libertys lamp guiding your steps and opportunitys arm steadying your way
5325450 i leave you hoping that the lamp of liberty will burn in your bosoms until there shall no longer be a doubt that all men are created free and equal
5325451 its a very very fragile balance of powers right now
5325452 but the fact that commodities are declining is overall good for consumers and good for the market
5325453 until a decade ago gay people were seen as a security threat and as recently as two decades ago they were being witch hunted and sacked from the security services
5325454 it was part of the cold war mentality that saw security threats traitors and spies everywhere
5325455 gay people were regarded as vulnerable to blackmail even if they were open and out about their sexuality
5325456 my recent experience of them is that theyre not john le carre graham greene its not that sort of tableau anymore
5325457 as an intelligence officer at mi5 youll be faced with some of the most challenging issues affecting national security today
5325458 the decisions you make will play a major part in our efforts to counterterrorism espionage the spread of weapons of mass destruction and in protecting the u k s critical national infrastructure
5325459 theyre trying to portray themselves as an open inclusive organization thats working for the good of the community
5325460 it does need diverse members of society to be able to access the diverse members of society that they may have interest in
5325461 the service seeks to reflect the broad range of u k society which it serves

5325463 we do have a lot of sex for a 70 year old couple i had to close the door the other night she was screaming so loud she sings
5325464 you dont see many 70 year olds who are a size four uk size eight and have such a cute petite figure
5325465 it was the template for the establishment of spectrum markets throughout the world
5325466 i am told i am a legend in guatemala for example
5325467 i went down to the chicago university bookstore and bought everything i could on metabolism including the big thick textbooks and i started ploughing through all that stuff
5325468 we had to neglect a lot of advice from doctors
5325469 i was frustrated with the doctors we were having reactions day after day so i decided to start testing something was driving her blood sugars up so i started systematically eliminating foods that drove them up beans something as simple as beans sent her blood sugar sky high pasta was disastrous there was something wrong here this cant be the case youre shooting her blood sugar up like this
5325470 the stories give them the illusion of control they reinforce prejudices and biases and they all like to feel important
5325471 like lab rats a lab rat has a life expectancy three times that of a wild rat because it is protected from accidents or disasters but it doesnt live better
5325472 some of these starches as soon as they hit the saliva in your mouth become sugars pasta is a bowl of sugar briefly deferred
5325473 dont eat three square meals a day skip meals now and then work towards an extended overnight period of no eating this means eat sometime before you sleep and dont be in a hurry to eat breakfast do not fear hunger nothing but good will come of it but it must be episodic not chronic
5325474 first everybody over trains dont do it dont trudge away on a treadmill count sets or repetitions or work out according to a top down soviet model you will hate it and it does not produce results you must let it happen you must have a playful intermittent form of exercise and you must exercise the benefits are profound make it fun intense according to your own fitness and goals and brief the goal of an exercise session is to promote growth hormone release to build muscle and to elevate insulin sensitivity brevity and intensity are keys intensity means a little burn in the muscle not heaving and straining brevity means you do not release stress hormones so you are favourably altering your hormone profile
5325475 four thin pork chops well trimmed and browned in a bit of oil with rosemary and pieces of fresh apple some canteloupe melon with it
5325476 on food and cooking the science and lore of the kitchen
5325477 plenty of meat such as ribs steak bacon pork loin i will say that when i do limit my carb intake my acne goes away and so does my depression and im calmer and less moody
5325478 as for reagan democrats how clinton was treated is not their issue
5325479 most working and middle class white americans dont feel that they have been particularly privileged by their race their experience is the immigrant experience as far as theyre concerned no ones handed them anything they ve built it from scratch theyve worked hard all their lives many times only to see their jobs shipped overseas or their pension dumped after a lifetime of labor they are anxious about their futures and feel their dreams slipping away in an era of stagnant wages and global competition opportunity comes to be seen as a zero sum game in which your dreams come at my expense so when they are told to bus their children to a school across town when they hear that an african american is getting an advantage in landing a good job or a spot in a good college because of an injustice that they themselves never committed when theyre told that their fears about crime in urban neighborhoods are somehow prejudiced resentment builds over time like the anger within the black community these resentments arent always expressed in polite company but they have helped shape the political landscape for at least a generation anger over welfare and affirmative action helped forge the reagan coalition politicians routinely exploited fears of crime for their own electoral ends talk show hosts and conservative commentators built entire careers unmasking bogus claims of racism while dismissing legitimate discussions of racial injustice and inequality as mere political correctness or reverse racism just as black anger often proved counterproductive so have these white resentments distracted attention from the real culprits of the middle class squeeze a corporate culture rife with inside dealing questionable accounting practices and short term greed a washington dominated by lobbyists and special interests economic policies that favor the few over the many and yet to wish away the resentments of white americans to label them as misguided or even racist without recognizing they are grounded in legitimate concerns this too widens the racial divide and blocks the path to understanding
5325480 they dont identify with someone who has gone to columbia and harvard law school and is married to a princeton harvard law graduate
5325481 over two weeks ago we saw the people of iowa proclaim that our time for change has come but there were those who doubted this countrys desire for something new who said iowa was a fluke not to be repeated again well tonight the cynics who believed that what began in the snows of iowa was just an illusion were told a different story by the good people of south carolina
5325482 there is peculiar bit of jujitsu that white public figures have employed recently whenever theyre called to account for saying something stupid about black people
5325483 racism has tangible costs for blacks and whites deciding your president on something as stupid as race could mean for instance that you have less access to health care that your children work in a stagnating economy that your neighbors kids will die in a stupid war or maybe not maybe the white guy is completely right but if youre a racist you will never know let me be utterly candid her and speak for myself i grew up in de facto segregation i didnt have a white classmate until i was in high school i didnt have any deep relationships with anyone who wasnt black until i was in my early 20s i also had some very retrograde views about gays im probably most ashamed of that when i started working in washington i had some truly beautiful colleagues many of whom im friends with today but when i started the gig i wouldnt hang out with them after work i thought something might happen if i got drunk around them that didnt change until my job hired another brother and he informed me of how ignorant i was a short time later i moved to new york and was shocked to live in a place where the black white dichotomy didnt really exist i mean its here but not in the same way my point is this its quite likely that had i not been shaken out of my ignorance had i not let go of my prejudice you wouldnt be reading this right now it was not simply ethical for me to become a more open person it was to my advantage i know that the math isnt the same for white people but the point i think still stands let me end with a nod to americas greatest past time the boston red sox were the last team in pro baseball to integrate and for their belief in the grand purity of the great white race they sacrificed a shot at jackie robinson willie mays and probably a world series or two white racism rewarded them with decades of heartbreak not saying racism was the only factor but it didnt help
5325484 they believe he is telling them that their time has passed
5325485 do you want to pay for all the entitlements that white baby boomers voted for themselves
5325486 reagan democrats are not upset with obama because hes black theyre upset because they dont expect to be treated fairly because theyre white its not racism that is driving them its racial resentment and that is enforced because they dont believe he understands them and their problems what theyre waiting for is assurance that an obama administration wont leave them behind
5325487 a similar anger exists within segments of the white community most working and middle class white americans dont feel that they have been particularly privileged by their race their experience is the immigrant experience as far as theyre concerned no ones handed them anything theyve built it from scratch theyve worked hard all their lives many times only to see their jobs shipped overseas or their pension dumped after a lifetime of labor they are anxious about their futures and feel their dreams slipping away in an era of stagnant wages and global competition opportunity comes to be seen as a zero sum game in which your dreams come at my expense so when they are told to bus their children to a school across town when they hear that an african american is getting an advantage in landing a good job or a spot in a good college because of an injustice that they themselves never committed when theyre told that their fears about crime in urban neighborhoods are somehow prejudiced resentment builds over time like the anger within the black community these resentments arent always expressed in polite company but they have helped shape the political landscape for at least a generation anger over welfare and affirmative action helped forge the reagan coalition politicians routinely exploited fears of crime for their own electoral ends talk show hosts and conservative commentators built entire careers unmasking bogus claims of racism while dismissing legitimate discussions of racial injustice and inequality as mere political correctness or reverse racism just as black anger often proved counterproductive so have these white resentments distracted attention from the real culprits of the middle class squeeze a corporate culture rife with inside dealing questionable accounting practices and short term greed a washington dominated by lobbyists and special interests economic policies that favor the few over the many and yet to wish away the resentments of white americans to label them as misguided or even racist without recognizing they are grounded in legitimate concerns this too widens the racial divide and blocks the path to understanding this is where we are right now its a racial stalemate weve been stuck in for years but i have asserted a firm conviction a conviction rooted in my faith in god and my faith in the american people that working together we can move beyond some of our old racial wounds and that in fact we have no choice is we are to continue on the path of a more perfect union
5325488 who does a guy have to lynch around here to get called a racist
5325489 i believe obamas big challenge this fall will be to assuage the economic anxieties of working class whites lest they fall yet again to the siren call of gop cultural fear mongering
5325490 if obama was a white man he would not be in this position and if he was a woman he would not be in this position he happens to be very lucky to be who he is and the country is caught up in the concept
5325491 i really think theyre attacking me because im white hows that
5325492 what theyre waiting for is assurance that an obama administration wont leave them behind
5325493 im not a racist but im not going to have a nigger in the white house
5325494 well you know how the canaille hates people of color
5325495 if obama were white he wouldnt be in this position
5325496 if he were some older uncharasmastic white guy hed be laughed out of the room
5325497 obamaists really underestimate the depth at which older wiser baby boomers scoff at your enthusiasm for most of us it is here we go again

5325500 most working and middle class white americans dont feel that they have been particularly privileged by their race their experience is the immigrant experience as far as theyre concerned no ones handed them anything theyve built it from scratch theyve worked hard all their lives many times only to see their jobs shipped overseas or their pension dumped after a lifetime of labor they are anxious about their futures and feel their dreams slipping away in an era of stagnant wages and global competition opportunity comes to be seen as a zero sum game in which your dreams come at my expense so when they are told to bus their children to a school across town when they hear that an african american is getting an advantage in landing a good job or a spot in a good college because of an injustice that they themselves never committed when theyre told that their fears about crime in urban neighborhoods are somehow prejudiced resentment builds over time

5325590 juventus have asked for the player but there has been no contact and branislav has chosen milan
5325591 therefore he will probably be playing for milan next season a deal will be done partly because the player is unhappy
5325592 the problem at the moment is that chelsea want four starters in his position and he is the fourth
5325593 it is difficult to find an arrangement that works for both sides but there is a game to be played and it can be completed
5325594 chelsea firstly told us yes then no we are looking for a central defender and should we be able to find a name which suits us we will sign him

5325645 for many the misery of flooding was added to by the lack of response from the government departments with increasingly poor and wet weather ongoing over the last few weeks it should not have been difficult to make effective contingency plans to meet any emergency of the sort faced by many residents over the weekend
5325646 both the water and roads agencies failed in their responsibilities to meet the flooding emergency this was particularly so in getting a response from the emergency numbers i tried without success to get beyond an engaged tone with the water service the roads service was even worse i received a telephone call from a frustrated resident in the hightown area of glengormley around teatime she had been constantly getting an engaged tone from the roads service for around three hours i received the engaged tone for nearly forty minutes when i did manage to get a response it was an automated response leaving me holding without response for another forty minutes in the end i had to give up as it was clear that there were insufficient resources to answer the telephone an email i sent has not even had an acknowledgement

5325746 are the tories as badly off as labour in 1984
5325747 labour was in a truly appalling state unless it had dealt with its problems it would never have formed a government again even so it was nowhere near as bad as the conservative party today
5325748 back then there were still large groups of people who could not do without the existence of the labour party the poor the unemployed and the ethnic communities not to mention the trade unions
5325749 all sections of the community are now represented by the labour party tony blair has created a broad tent and whereas mrs thatchers attitude was if youre not for us youre against us blairs attitude is those who are not against us may one day be with us
5325750 the present tory party doesnt understand this country as churchill macmillan and thatcher did they are no longer in the broad stream of society
5325751 the tories are in nothing like such a bad position as we were in 1984 when like them we had been out of power for five years
5325752 at that point we were in total disarray there was blood all over the place we were fighting the trotskyites and the leadership was running scared
5325753 the tories of today have seen nothing like that they are in a calm sea compared to the one we were in then if you look at their situation they are agreed on europe and on the need for modernisation and theyre not like we were blaming the electorate for the fact that we had lost twice
5325754 i also think iain duncan smith is more easily seen as a prime minister than mrs thatcher when she first became leader of the opposition after her first year in that job the informed opinion in westminster fell about laughing at the idea that she could ever be in downing street
5325755 the tories always pride themselves on having the qualities of statecraft but the first of those qualities is a sense of history and at the moment they have lost their sense of history

5325773 al a o 2025 las energ as renovables y la eficiencia podr an entregar 30 m s de electricidad al sic y juntas aportar an 7 600 mw al sistema
5325774 nosotros no decimos c mo debe ser el abastecimiento lo que es efectivo es que los resultados permiten prever que podemos dejar de construir algunas centrales porque lo que aportan las fuentes no convencionales es significativo
5325775 que siempre ha sido vista como soluci n de emergencia pero despu s de este estudio pasa a ser una fuente de energ a m s que hay que considerar
5325776 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo
5325777 los supermercados deben mejorar sus sistemas de iluminaci n y refrigeraci n e incorporar equipos nuevos no decimos que hay que botarlos de un d a para otro pero a medida que crezcan econ micamente deben agregar tecnolog a m s eficiente
5325778 debe existir una regulaci n que diga concretamente en chile no se puede importar equipos que tengan eficiencias menores a tanto y eso cambiar a el panorama
5325779 s lo la geot rmica como en todas partes del mundo requiere una ayuda estatal en las primeras exploraciones
5325780 todas las investigaciones actuales muestran que los f siles tienden a subir de precio en forma estable tanto el petr leo como el gas natural el carb n y el recurso de embalse se est agotando las tecnolog as de las nuevas fuentes en cambio est n madurando y muchas de ellas ya tienden a la baja y se van a hacer cada vez m s competitivas lo que impulsar el desarrollo de las fuentes no convencionales
5325781 esperamos que las autoridades de gobierno se abstengan de seguir interviniendo a favor del citado proyecto para que pueda ser evaluado correctamente
5325782 el que traicion a su gente una vez lo volver a hacer una y mil veces ha llegado judas a la c mara de diputados se dice que la juventud de su partido no lo quiere que la disidencia no lo quiere y ahora entra por la ventana a este congreso con la supuesta misi n de ser un gendarme de los diputados de su partido

5325792 referente a los derechos humanos suiza es la capitalde la cruz roja suiza nunca tuvo colonias a nivel estatal
5325793 nuestra vinculacion con la pelicula est en que el empresario domenico panciotto viene de suiza y la realizadora fausta quattrini es suiza
5325794 los pueblos indigenas me han cambiado la forma de ver e l derecho
5325795 los funcionarios del estado aparecen en el documental ridiculos y sin comprender ciertas cosas
5325796 el secretario de derechos humanos de neuqun ve a la pelicula como muy pol tica y la criticaba por eso
5325797 el inciso 17 se introdujo por cansancio el convenio 169 se ratifico sin leerlo porque si lo leian bien no lo hacian
5325798 roca hizo una ciudadan a de escritorio nos homogeneiz es importante que los pueblos originarios llamen a revertir eso
5325799 los pueblos originarios nos son negocio pol tico porque est n aislados por eso se los invisibiliza hay que salir de la invisibilidad reconociendo la realidad y fortaleciendo su lucha
5325800 un consejo a los abogados no se disfracen de originarios son abogados de la v citma no la v ctima asi se cumple mejor la funci n
5325801 ser a bueno por ejemplo que el colegio de abogados organice una comiison de derecho indigena propuso zaffaroni ganandose el aplauso de la concurrencia tambien hacer un congreso de derecho indigena
5325802 jos huenchunao exige ser trasladado de inmediato desde la c rcel de angol a un centro de eduaci n y trabajo lugar en el que pueda desarrollar trabajo agr colas y permanecer en condiciones de dignidad inherentes a su condici n de preso pol tico comunero mapuche
5325803 jos huenchunao tiene pendiente una acci n contra el estado chileno ante la comisi n interamericana de derechos humanos por haber sido condenado por la ley antiterrorista mediante una sentencia dictada con infracci n al debido proceso esencialmente racista y verdadero postulado ideol gico en contra de las leg timas acciones de recuperaci n de derechos por parte del pueblo mapuche
5325804 que nuevamente el estado de chile a trav s de su pol tica de represi n hace caso omiso de los derechos y garant as carcelarias justamente ganadas por nuestros weichafe en su categor a de presos pol ticos quienes han liderado importantes procesos de lucha de nuestro pueblo y que hoy en d a se encuentran injustamente encarcelados

5325811 all por la cordillera como en todos los caminos hay apellidos muy finos pero con una historia muy fiera cuando a los indios mataban para quitarle la tierra
5325812 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
5325813 los sistemas penales no deben inventar ning n m todo pues todos los que utilizan ya se construyeron en democracia para perseguir a las clases peligrosas
5325814 estamos aqu en la uac levantando nuestra voz el arma m s poderosa que tenemos
5325815 la mina alumbrera consume el 50 del agua que consume la provincia pero adem s consume el 78 de la energ a de catamarca lo interesante es que los problemas de agua y energ a pasan a ser de la comunidad los medios lo instalan as no consuma luz o agua
5325816 modelo de saqueo que se basa en la destrucci n de los medios de vida
5325817 tenemos que luchar por instalar los bienes comunes como palabra y le ponemos el cuerpo a todo esto sin perder de vista el problema del modelo sabiendo que la alumbrera es un punto m s dentro de este modelo de desarrollo de explotaci n y saqueo
5325818 como asamblea esto es un desaf o ya se hicieron acciones hacia la comunidad como para producir un impacto de que se est diciendo algo porque hay que decir ya que si algo qued muy fuerte ac es la marcha del silencio pero en catamarca necesitamos volver a decir
5325819 entender que somos un pa s colonial cuesta en esta poca en que aqu no son necesarios los soldados porque ya formaron los universitarios los profesionales los pol ticos para manejar esto el rol colonizado de la universidad corre paralelo con la colonizaci n de la secretar a de agricultura y del senasa que aprueban lo que las corporaciones necesitan el inta que trabaja para las empresas abiertamente mediante el impulso de polos biotecnol gicos que trabajan para implantar el modelo de nidera cargill monsanto y bunge la miner a los eucaliptos la soja el engorde a corral los grandes criaderos de aves esto es parte de una escala macro en la que operan las empresas pero este fen meno que nos parec a tan lejano el que se pueda vincular en la sociedad todos estos modelos se ha dado con una materialidad sorprendente gracias al gran desarrollo de la conciencia ambiental
5325820 cada vez que nosotros nos movemos y damos un paso vemos c mo se expresa el iirsa integraci n de la infraestructura regional suramericana y as se entiende por qu el tratado binacional que entrega la cordillera de los andes fue orquestado casi diez a os antes de que lo firmara carlos menem vemos c mo se fue desarrollando y pensando el saqueo la hidrov a hecha para que los barcos de gran porte se lleven todo tambi n fue pensada hace mucho tiempo porque saben que la mejor manera de llevarse los bienes comunes es la l nea recta poco costo y rapidez y ah tambi n est gioja que ha regalado todo para que el paso de aguas negras salga hacia el pac fico con un corredor bioc anico y para todo esto es necesario tambi n energ a y r pida para eso las centrales nucleares cuatro centrales que impulsa kirchner y no hablemos de la cantidad de compa eros confundid simos que toman como bandera la energ a nuclear porque es una tecnolog a de punta o porque estamos en crisis energ tica c mo no vamos a estar en crisis una sola empresa minera consume el 10 de la energ a del pa s qu pasar cuando empiecen a funcionar agua rica y pascua lama cu nta energ a se necesitar y ah entra el cuento de la crisis energ tica por eso para luchar y estar seguros de c mo afrontar los debates tenemos que saber y conocer
5325821 no contundente a los agronegocios porque producen destrucci n de montes y bosques nativos expulsa comunidades campesinas criminaliza la protesta social contamina tierras y aguas produce la destrucci n de la biodiversidad apropiaci n de las semillas por parte de las empresas manipulaci n gen tica trabajo en negro explotaci n infantil concentraci n de la tierra en pocas manos p rdida de fuentes de trabajo destrucci n de las econom as regionales atenta contra la salud y vida de los pueblos tanto por el consumo de transg nicos como por las fumigaciones
5325822 las propuestas de cambio son dif ciles de encarar pero algunas ya tienen su materializaci n concretamente como la del mocase y la idea de soberan a alimentaria son una manifestaci n concreta de que se puede encarar las cosas de otra manera pero c mo se resuelve la producci n del conjunto del sistema agropecuario argentino eso es algo a seguir profundizando
5325823 la uac es la expresi n de una necesidad que tenemos todas las asambleas fundamentalmente ambientales de intercambiar nuestras experiencias y vivencias respecto a esta lucha en eso se ha progresado much simo por la inclusi n de m s organizaciones y por la profundizaci n de los temas que cada asamblea toca
5325824 indagar qu es lo que contamina en el rea en donde existe la asamblea o el grupo
5325825 trascender el aspecto puntual para llegar a los problemas de fondo
5325826 la lucha que se viene se presenta en dos grandes ramas la miner a del oro por un lado y la del uranio por otro
5325827 en el resto de las provincias hemos dado pasos importantes hemos logrado leyes contra la mega miner a metal fera contaminante en patagonia mendoza tucum n la rioja y hay presentaciones para prohibirla en san luis y en c rdoba tambi n
5325828 lo que impulsa la c mara minera junto al gobierno nacional y las provincias es zonificar generando espacios donde s se podr hacer la miner a con el m todo contaminante justamente en sitios donde no est n de pie y luchando las comunidades
5325829 el uranio surge de golpe cuando su precio se dispara ante la acci n de los pa ses del primer mundo que buscan combatir el precio del petr leo con fuentes alternativas de energ a dentro de la cnea hay quienes quieren poner en licitaci n los grandes yacimientos otros quieren hacer canje con otros pa ses para el desarrollo local de la energ a nuclear y otros consideran que esos minerales tienen que ser utilizados s lo en lo dom stico mediante centrales nucleares por eso en argentina se relanza un plan nuclear de cuatro centrales en lo inmediato
5325830 con esta iniciativa se busca realizar una masiva tarea de concientizaci n en la poblaci n a fin de que se comprenda sobre las herramientas que desde el gobierno se otorga a las mineras para que se instalen destruyan saqueen y contaminen
5325831 los ciudadanos del territorio argentino decimos no a la miner a qu mica con la modalidad a

5325881 we knew we could vastly improve the customer experience by deploying an online booking application to enhance our existing web site ibm came in and really pulled the project together in an amazingly short period of time five months compressing a development cycle that was slated to take 12 months
5325882 when customers book a tour the application is simultaneously booking reservations for hotels buses and so on
5325883 we needed our online system to extend the complexities built into our core business systems out to the web without making the process too complicated for our customers the websphere commerce solution did this without having to completely rewrite our back end systems
5325884 this project is a great example of how ibm is helping clients adapt to constantly changing conditions such as rising fuel costs and new terms of engagement between airlines and travel agencies
5325885 using ibm software and soa companies like vantage can make it easier and less expensive for consumers to book vacations while reducing the time and money it takes to manage a complex business and web site like this

5325966 but in my view your face is not everything real beauty lies inside a person not outside
5325967 because beauty is all about faces and beautiful girls and skin
5325968 help us bring back a smile to the face of these survivors
5325969 they say that when we come to a beauty salon we come with the expectation that were going to be relaxed in a different frame of mind
5325970 if we come here and we see someone who has gone through so much pain and misery so automatically that gives us that low feeling also they have a point
5325971 at the same time there are clients who take pride in asking these girls to give them a blow dry or getting a manicure or pedicure taken from them
5325972 once we had a wedding in the family i went there and all the girls were getting dressed and putting on makeup so that time i felt a pain in my heart
5325973 but i dont want to weaken myself with these thoughts
5325974 the peace of mind i have now i never had before i suffered much more mental anguish in my married life
5325975 i feel that her hands call me again and again

5325984 the longer the mpc waits before cutting rates the bigger the danger the situation will deteriorate
5325985 while a market slowdown in activity is likely over the next 18 months even if interest rates are cut when inflation peaks the correct policy decisions are still needed to ward off the threats of a serious and prolonged recession
5325986 over the next two or three quarters we expect growth to be slightly negative or zero
5325987 thereafter we expect a shallow recovery but the period of weak below trend growth is likely to be prolonged lasting until the final months of 2009 or early in 2010
5325988 our view is that the threats to growth are more serious and more immediate than the risks of higher inflation the uk economy urgently needs an interest rate cut to counter threats of recession
5325989 todav a estoy presa pero siento que de alguna manera se est abriendo la justicia y espero que se cumpla lo que tiene que ser lo real la libertad tiene que llegar porque aqu no hay nada que tenga que ver con esos asaltos y la verdad sigo pensando que hay todo un sistema extra o que todav a no logro entender

5326069 el pueblo chiquitano ejerci su derecho ciudadano y fue a votar masivamente en el refer ndum ahora tenemos como un desaf o grande la aprobaci n y puesta en vigencia de la nueva constituci n pol tica del estado donde se reconocen varias de nuestras demandas y que de una vez se respeten nuestros derechos como pueblos ind genas
5326070 este domingo 10 de agosto durante el refer ndum revocatorio en el cant n de santa rosa de la roca municipio de san ignacio de velasco nuestros hermanos y hermanas que asistieron a votar y participar como delegados para vigilar la transparencia de la consulta fueron insultados y expulsados del lugar de votaci n por los miembros del comit c vico
5326071 un grupo de c vicos que apoyan al prefecto de santa cruz comenzaron a amedrentar a nuestros compa eros y compa eras ind genas para que voten a favor del prefecto e incluso los amenazaron para que muestren la papeleta de votaci n para saber por qui n votaban
5326072 vamos a denunciar este hecho a todo el pa s y ante la organizaci n estados americanos oea para que sepan que en la chiquitania cada vez hay menos democracia pues por pensar diferente o defender los derechos empiezan a perseguir y amenazar a nuestros hermanos ind genas

5326285 if we carefully read the decision in the krajisnik case it seems that judge orie agreed with serb experts and witnesses who claimed that what happened in bosnia was just a civil war unplanned and impossible to control which was also the view taken by the tadic defence
5326286 what worries me most is that judge ories take on the events in bosnia as outlined in the krajisnik judgement could influence his judgement in the karadzic case
5326287 dusko tadic was a soldier of the army whose superior commander was karadzic being the defence lawyer of that soldier and then being a judge in a case against his commander is to put it mildly very problematic from the point of view of justice
5326288 i think it is up to judge orie to recognise the importance of karadzic case and step down because too many people believe he might have some prejudice in this trial
5326289 momcilo krajisnik was a member of the bosnian serb leadership together with karadzic
5326290 reading the krajisnik judgement one notices numerous highly incriminating findings concerning karadzic
5326291 basically it appears that by considering karadzic as a member of this joint criminal enterprise the trial chamber convicted not only krajisnik but karadzic as well
5326292 the competing history of events that was raised in tadics defence might raise the spectre of conflict of interests especially if that same general evidence were tendered against karadzic
5326293 that said its entirely up to the parties to make an objection on this issue else the discussion is just theoretical
5326294 a judge may not sit on a trial or appeal in any case in which the judge has or has had any association which might affect his or her impartiality the judge shall in any such circumstance withdraw and the president shall assign another judge to the case
5326295 advocates and judges are expected to act objectively and dispassionately on the basis of instructions given by a defendant if defending as an advocate or on the basis of evidence if making decisions as a judge
5326296 his having already made a factual decision as a judge in another case that there was a joint criminal enterprise involving karadzic of the same kind as charged in this indictment should create no technical difficulty as a judge should be able to put out of her or his mind the evidence received and decisions made in an earlier trial
5326297 it might be thought to be asking the impossible of a judge to decide the issue of karadzics participation in a joint criminal enterprise on the evidence in this trial without regard to the finding made in the previous trial where karadzic was not present to argue his position
5326298 this could found an argument to have orie recuse disqualify himself from the karadzic trial
5326299 of course if the prosecution is able to get the previous conviction of krajisnik and the previous finding of a joint criminal enterprise involving karadzic into evidence within the tribunals rules then the problem could be overcome
5326300 but the decisions about admitting that conviction on that basis would rest with orie and his fellow judges so the same or similar problems of prejudice or pre judgement would arise
5326301 like all other judges judge ories post was approved by the un general assembly
5326302 he is one of the most experienced and well respected judges of this

5326318 the best scientific evidence published indicates that among adult women who have an unplanned pregnancy the relative risk of mental health problems is no greater if they have a single elective first trimester abortion or deliver that pregnancy
5326319 young adult women who undergo induced abortion may be at increased risk for subsequent depression
5326320 more likely to score above the cut off point for depression
5326321 for mental disorders and for risk factors that may be associated with its subsequent development
5326322 consent cannot be informed without the provision of adequate and appropriate information regarding the possible risks and benefits to physical and mental health
5326323 it would be very difficult to pull this information together
5326324 one of her grad students replied on her behalf with the additional summary statistics we had requested within 48 hours
5326325 so it clearly wasnt at all difficult for her team to access the data plus with modern electronic data bases and multiple backup procedures in place at universities like hers it is nearly impossible to lose such data
5326326 i know of a number of experts in the field who have requested the data even within the last six months but she simply doesnt respond to their calls emails or letters
5326327 how can we trust the objectivity of a report prepared by a task force composed exclusively of pro choice psychologists especially when the chair and lead author has a history of withholding data and findings which may undermine her ideological preferences
5326328 it is undeniable that significant numbers of women are injured by abortion and should not be ignored by the medical profession and that significant numbers of women suffer serious physical mental or psychological trauma as a result of abortion
5326329 it is considered too sexy for us its not good for viewers in malaysia we dont want our people our teenagers influenced by their performance we want clean artists artists that are good role models

5326340 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
5326341 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
5326342 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
5326343 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
5326344 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
5326345 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
5326346 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
5326347 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
5326348 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
5326349 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
5326350 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
5326351 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
5326352 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
5326353 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
5326354 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
5326355 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
5326356 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline

5326359 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
5326360 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
5326361 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
5326362 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
5326363 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
5326364 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
5326365 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
5326366 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
5326367 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
5326368 with the addition of these two large full service hotels davidson now has a portfolio which includes five upscale hotels in florida
5326369 we are attracted to the strong demographics in both orlando and miami and following the implementation of our proprietary marketing and management systems we believe these hotels will quickly gain strong market share and substantially increased value for ownership

5326374 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
5326375 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
5326376 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
5326377 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
5326378 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
5326379 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
5326380 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
5326381 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
5326382 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
5326383 yes dragon age origins will be coming to consoles in the near future yes
5326384 so did you do any cloud computing over the weekend
5326385 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
5326386 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
5326387 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
5326388 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
5326389 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
5326390 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
5326391 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base

5326395 people say 40 is the new 18 i think whats exciting about being a woman and being 40 is that very often you have a kind of confidence that took all those years to get but youre still young enough to be excited and to be vital about the future without having to worry about your identity am i a mother
5326396 two women came in and said weve got to get rid of this drongo i said id be happy to help
5326397 the town is desperately short of women we just havent got women here hes highlighted the problem and the way hes said it hes got national publicity
5326398 hes just letting people know its good fun to be a woman in mount isa if hes got to take a few brickbats on the head that wont bother molony
5326399 we are all rednecks up here we dont carry it around as a badge of shame we carry it around as a badge of honour
5326400 id suggest cr molony go off to school somewhere and get educated about what responsibility he holds on behalf of the community etiquette school perhaps
5326401 what do these sorts of statements say about our community its horrifying that in this day and age a public figure would say such things what era is he living in
5326402 but hes correct in saying there is a gender imbalance there are a lot of young men in town who would love to have families and would love to have a partner
5326403 mount isa has a lot more going for it than just its male versus female population ratio
5326404 it is one of queenslands great regional cities and individuals and families continue to move there for employment and lifestyle opportunities
5326405 and if they fall in love while theyre there good luck to them
5326406 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
5326407 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
5326408 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
5326409 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
5326410 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
5326411 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
5326412 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
5326413 who are open to doing something on the production side
5326414 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
5326415 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
5326416 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
5326417 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
5326418 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
5326419 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
5326420 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
5326421 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
5326422 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
5326423 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
5326424 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
5326425 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
5326426 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
5326427 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
5326428 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
5326429 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
5326430 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
5326431 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
5326432 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
5326433 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
5326434 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
5326435 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
5326436 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
5326437 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
5326438 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
5326439 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
5326440 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
5326441 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
5326442 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
5326443 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
5326444 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas

5326447 to have people believing we have one of the best teams in the nation going into this thing its exciting for us
5326448 i dont think anything is guaranteed but we certainly have put ourselves in position where at least the college football world thinks were pretty good
5326449 i think it motivates the guys to prepare well but the big thing is if you think about a championship way back in january that can wear you down
5326450 its our responsibility as coaches to help these guys break it down to one day at a time one workout at a times one practice at a time just prepare to be in position for the challenge
5326451 we take it one step at a time all we can do is focus on the smaller picture
5326452 we cant let ourselves get overwhelmed it takes away from playing hard and playing smart
5326453 were all kind of growing together with matt this year we ought to see a better performance by him not only because hes better but because the guys around have improved also
5326454 nobody is going to beat them no way its just not going to happen
5326455 we feel like were playing very well right now but you have to keep in mind its single elimination
5326456 going against greece and going against spain it was really easy to get up for
5326457 and we could have easily came in and had one of those games where we make excuses but we didnt take a step backwards today and that was good it was really good
5326458 as i have done nothing wrong in connection with any of the matters that are the subject of the inquiry i expect to be exonerated
5326459 in the near future i would love to have a talk about new challenges and opportunities in education and training and the provision of safe and fair workplaces in nsw
5326460 i hope the nation and the people will forgive my mistakes
5326461 today the shadow of dictatorship that has prevailed for long over this country that chapter has been closed
5326462 it is very pleasing to know that musharraf is no more
5326463 he even tried to deceive the nation in his last address he was boasting about economic progress when life for people like us has become a hell
5326464 i pray the government stops this downward slide and takes the country out of this crisis
5326465 the crimes of musharraf against the nation against the judiciary against democracy and against rule of law in the country cannot be forgiven by any party or individual
5326466 that is a decision that has to be taken by the democratic leadership
5326467 pakistan and the united states have a joint interest in fighting terror
5326468 thats what were concentrating on that and helping pakistan to sustain its economy to build its schools its health we have a broad pakistan policy
5326469 i researched why they worked and why they failed and i knew which ones were sold and bought and by whom
5326470 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve

5326479 there was clearly an agenda behind making the programme designed to make christians look obsessed with peoples sex lives and intent on imposing christian behaviour on everyone else
5326480 christian behaviour is only possible after a spiritual transformation we were encouraged to take part on the understanding that we were dealing with a group of people who genuinely wanted to embrace christianity but that was clearly not the case
5326481 we didnt set out to be negative about christianity its unfair to say that the series is obsessed with sex because it also looks at other big issues such as abortion respecting women and forgiveness if theres conflict along the way thats because some of these issues are difficult
5326482 the ebook is dead interview with aaron wall of seobook
5326483 one thing that im absolutely convinced of is that there is a moral and ethical element to this issue and so i think anyone who tries to deny the moral difficulties and gravity of the abortion issue is not paying attention
5326484 i am pro choice i believe in roe v wade and i come to that conclusion not because i am pro abortion but because ultimately i dont think women make these decisions casually they struggle with these decisions profoundly

5326492 surrounding yourself with photos can trigger positive emotions reduce stress and improve your state of mind
5326493 even people who cant sing well can benefit hugely from doing so
5326494 think how wonderful it would feel to use your voice freely to relax your jaw express what has not been expressed overcome your fears and release frustrations that may have been building up for hours weeks or years
5326495 dancing can inspire awareness and body appreciation which is valuable to overall health and well being
5326496 since our minds and bodies are interdependent movement expression offers insight into feelings and behaviors
5326497 the actual process of making art can alleviate emotional stress and anxiety by creating a physiological response of relaxation
5326498 when we practice anything on our own we tend to stay with what we know
5326499 a leader can suggest ways of working with ourselves and nature that bring us out of our usual habits
5326500 would not take any move to save the poor market
5326501 the larger concern over slowing growth in the economy will continue to weigh
5326502 so far the burden has all been on companies because theres so much overcapacity no one has any room to pass on the costs
5326503 we are starting to see companies going out of business after six to 12 months the survivors will have less competition and be able to raise prices more but its a very slow gradual process
5326504 all of the indicators this year have been within expectations the economy has slowed down to prevent inflation
5326505 the spending numbers have been quite good recently but it could be because of the olympics there seems to be a lot of related spending
5326506 theres been so much excitement generated it seems hard to me to say that we wont see some sort of short term hangover at least
5326507 we never said to the competitors to use a uav i think we are seeing here at the challenge the next generation of vehicles
5326508 if we find what we need for urban operations we will drive it through to deployment
5326509 because humans are more inclined to notice whats wrong in a situation we are much more aware when theres a problem
5326510 it takes hard work and discipline to notice when children are doing things right such as not whining or not interrupting
5326511 it catches kids doing the right thing and inspires them to think of themselves as considerate and capable people the rationale being what you notice you get more of
5326512 my four year old twins responded almost instantly to descriptive praise
5326513 id say i see youre not hitting your sister even when my son was just sitting on the floor doing nothing sometimes i feel insane saying stuff like youre not whining and crying or youre not sucking your thumb but hey it works the positive changes in their behavior have been enormous
5326514 reflective listening is when a parent mirrors what the child is feeling it helps to deal with the emotion thats dominating the child and helps to get it resolved
5326515 i went into her room and asked her to tell me about it
5326516 instead of responding with dont worry it was just a dream go back to sleep i said youre so frightened nightmares can sure be scary cant they she stopped crying thought about it for a second and replied they sure can after that she nodded right back off to sleep
5326517 but when you use reflective listening over time it will teach your child a vocabulary for expressing her feelings so that she doesnt bottle them up inside and act on them inappropriately
5326518 this is how parents can follow through with the rules theyve established with their kids
5326519 its simply asking the child to do things again but this time the right way
5326520 whenever she starts to eat her food with her fingers instead of her fork i say lets do that again show me how youre supposed to be eating your food once she uses her fork i give her descriptive praise like see you knew just what to do and then everybodys smiling again its nice to be able to avoid arguments that may have otherwise erupted
5326521 plus doing an action replay will boost your childs self esteem

5326524 in the last few years the market for personal loans has been extremely competitive as lenders and borrowers alike cashed in on the availability of cheap credit increased competition pushed prices down and lenders continually undercut each other in order to top best buy tables
5326525 this is extremely bad news for consumers who may be considering consolidating existing debts to try to drive down their monthly expenditure

5326544 the pnp and armed forces are doing our best to secure other areas in lanao as well as other provinces affected by these movements by milf personnel
5326545 they left the area that is the report from our ground troops
5326546 they cant stay there too long they also felt the pressure from the military
5326547 as of now wala na as of now theres no more
5326548 but clearing operations are still ongoing in kolambugan because we have received reports that some rebels have disguised themselves as civilians

5326581 some vendors those who were a bit too zealous regarding their expectations on volume and buy in time lines have ratcheted down the noise and focus on soa
5326582 meanwhile other vendors those who remain committed are becoming a bit more realistic and mature about the pace and extent soa will advance now they are better articulating how it can fit into overall it strategies
5326583 some vendors who promoted composite applications have just changed terminology to promote the same concepts under the banner of mashups
5326584 while this gains some additional attention in some cases it may stall interest from those enterprises looking for greater stability to road map vision and messaging from their vendors
5326585 they may appear to some businesses as more dispensable initiatives at this particular point in time
5326586 reuse is easier to measure than strategic business benefits especially in the early days but the potential financial benefits of reuse are limited to cutting a percentage of your development budget whereas the value of strategic business benefits is virtually unlimited
5326587 so reuse is a nice benefit and easy to quantify but it is not the largest potential for soa by any measure
5326588 soa is marketed and sold totally different outside the u s
5326589 here its all about reuse in south america south africa the middle east and asia pacific its about business processes i have faith that the u s will eventually catch up
5326590 our current research finds approximately 50 percent of survey respondents most of whom work for large companies reporting that they have already deployed either soa or web services
5326591 although the two design choices are technically very different my experience has been that there is a lot of confusion among consumers as to which is which and how the two are different so the 50 percent figure could be high based on that confusion
5326592 this is a nontrivial exercise especially for those vendors with extensive legacy code sets it is working but it is slow and expensive
5326593 absolutely even before the current downturn vendors were experimenting with new pricing models to better match customers longer ramp up for soa
5326594 this is particularly true in the design time governance space where vendors are trying things like pricing based on the number of governed services or developers and i expect well see this trend continue in other areas as well
5326595 also this incremental adoption reality makes it very attractive for vendors to get a toe in the door increasing the likelihood that you will come back for more down the road so customers have a lot of leverage at this early stage
5326596 you might not have to buy as much to make soa happen for you
5326597 tcs is not facing pricing pressure for services related to assessment consulting and architecture definition services
5326598 however some of the operational level soa initiatives have reduced annual budget and hence extended the program but there is no pricing pressure
5326599 in case of enterprises that are convinced about the value that soa will bring to them in terms of adaptability efficiency and agility there is no slowdown and most of these enterprises have a top down implementation of service oriented architecture

5326645 democrats have aggressively put three republican seats in miami into play for the first time in years but none of the races involve primaries the party is targeting at least six seats in florida republicans are hoping to take mahoneys seat away from the majority party and retain the seat now held by retiring republican rep dave weldon
5326646 in orlando five democrats are running in the primary for the chance to challenge republican rep ric keller a top democratic target they include businessman charlie stuart who lost to keller in the general election in 2006 attorney mike smith and alan grayson who lost to stuart in the democratic primary in 2006
5326647 on the space coast republicans and democrats are in primaries to succeed outgoing republican rep dave weldon whose retirement created the only open seat in the state republican state sen bill posey who has two opponents in the primary has been considered the favorite to win the republican leaning seat but democrats are enthusiastic about the candidacy of paul rancatore an air force reserve officer he faces physician stephen blythe in the primary

5326661 bill to lower gas prices by increasing production of american energy promoting more conservation and efficiency and encouraging the use of more alternative and renewable fuels
5326662 it doesnt allow drilling of california or the eastern coast of florida the democrat staff said
5326663 discussions over the package are continuing the draft proposal includes several measures that republicans have already blocked in congress
5326664 if speaker pelosi and her democratic colleagues were truly serious about increasing production of american energy and lowering the price of gasoline they would call congress back into session immediately to vote on our all of the above energy plan rather than taking a five week break away from washington while the speaker now claims to embrace a comprehensive energy plan that includes more conservation more innovation and more american energy production the fact is her new effort appears to be just another flawed plan that will do little to lower gas prices
5326665 america can achieve true greatness when we work together to make certain that every voice in america is a voice that will be heard
5326666 pelosi is definitely hearing voices mostly from panicked dems looking at the poll numbers on drilling but will that lead to a vote

5326684 yet despite the traditional prominence of psychotherapy in psychiatric practice and training there are indications of a recent decline in the provision of psychotherapy by u s psychiatrists a trend attributed to reimbursement policies favoring brief medication management visits rather than psychotherapy and the introduction of newer psychotropic medications with fewer adverse effects
5326685 this decline coincided with changes in reimbursement increases in managed care and growth in the prescription of medications
5326686 psychiatrists who provided psychotherapy to all of their patients relied more extensively on self pay patients had fewer managed care visits and prescribed medications in fewer of their visits compared with psychiatrists who provided psychotherapy less often
5326687 these trends highlight a gradual but important change in the content of outpatient psychiatric care in the united states and a continued shift toward medicalization of psychiatric practice
5326688 a key challenge facing the future generation of psychiatrists will likely involve maintaining their professional role as integrators of the biological and psychosocial perspectives while working within the constraints of the strong market forces of third party payers and managed care to implement advances in the diagnosis and treatment of mental disorders

5326714 china remains a key driver of global commodity consumption through its position as a net importer of raw materials
5326715 demand for metals relate to domestic economy and infrastructure and as we see more people in china migrating from the countryside to the cities there will be a greater need for materials for construction and power stations
5326716 in other words china might be smaller than the united states in gdp terms but it grows at twice the rate

5326746 the horse hasnt been here since march so weve been calling ourselves the white post
5326747 as the landlord i get to hear all the stories of where the horse came from apparently it started life at the great white horse hotel in ipswich

5326759 the terrorists showed that they are vigorously against the freedom of the afghan people and cannot bear to see the celebration of independence and the happiness of the afghan people
5326760 these reports indicate that the enemies of the people of afghanistan intend to attack civilian military and government targets during afghan independence celebrations
5326761 we recommend to all afghans to be vigilant at large public events and other locations where crowds gather and report suspicious behaviour to security forces afghan or coalition and government representatives
5326762 let us shun tribal linguistic and regional issues and wage jihad against the enemies of this country and its religion and their mercenaries so we can mark the independence anniversary in its actual form

5326773 sinti en su boca el suave olor de la fiebre y lo aspiro como si quisiera llenarse de las intimidades de su cuerpo y en ese momento se imagin que ya llevaba muchos a os en su casa y que se estaba muriendo de pronto tuvo la clara sensaci n que no podr a sobrevivir a la muerte de ella se acostar a a su lado y querr a morir con ella conmovido por esa imagen hundi en ese momento la cara en la almohada junto a la cabeza de ella y permaneci as durante mucho tiempo y le dio pena que en una situaci n como aquella en la que un hombre de verdad ser a capaz de tomar inmediatamente una decisi n l dudase privando as de su significado al momento mas hermoso que hab a vivido jam s estaba arrodillado junto a su cama y pensaba que no podr a sobrevivir a su muerte se enfad consigo mismo pero luego se le ocurri que en realidad era bastante natural que no supiera que quer a el hombre nunca puede saber que debe querer porque vive solo una vida y no tiene modo de compararla con sus vidas precedentes ni de enmendarla en sus vidas posteriores no existe posibilidad alguna de comprobar cual de las decisiones es la mejor porque no existe comparaci n alguna el hombre lo vive todo a la primera y sin preparaci n como si un actor representase su obra sin ning n tipo de ensayo pero que valor puede tener la vida si el primer ensayo para vivir es ya la vida misma por eso la vida parece un boceto pero ni un boceto es la palabra precisa porque un boceto es siempre un borrador de algo la preparaci n para un cuadro mientras que el boceto que es nuestra vida es un boceto para nada un borrador sin cuadro si cada uno de los instantes de nuestra vida se va a repetir infinitas veces estamos clavados a la eternidad como jesucristo a la cruz la imagen es terrible en el mundo del eterno retorno descansa sobre cada gesto el peso de una insoportable responsabilidad ese es el motivo por el cual nietzsche llam a la idea del eterno retorno la carga m s pesada pero si el eterno retorno es la carga m s pesada entonces nuestras vidas pueden aparecer sobre ese tel n de fondo en toda su maravillosa levedad la carga m s pesada nos destroza somos derribados por ella nos aplasta contra la tierra pero en la poes a amatoria de todas las pocas la mujer desea cargar con el peso del cuerpo del hombre la carga m s pesada es por lo tanto a la vez la imagen de la m s intensa plenitud de la vida cuanto m s pesada sea la carga m s a ras de tierra estar nuestra vida m s real y verdadera ser por el contrario la ausencia absoluta de carga hace que el hombre se vuelva m s ligero que el aire vuele hacia lo alto se distancie de la tierra de su ser terreno que sea real s lo a medias y sus movimientos sean tan libres como insignificantes

5326846 we knew we could vastly improve the customer experience by deploying an online booking application to enhance our existing web site ibm came in and really pulled the project together in an amazingly short period of time five months compressing a development cycle that was slated to take 12 months
5326847 when customers book a tour the application is simultaneously booking reservations for hotels buses and so on
5326848 we needed our online system to extend the complexities built into our core business systems out to the web without making the process too complicated for our customers the websphere commerce solution did this without having to completely rewrite our back end systems

5326887 at first i was not happy about chris playing for germany but im ok with it now
5326888 not many kids get to be in the olympics so im proud of him i havent talked to him but he sent us a text message today
5326889 i just wish the u s team asked him to try out before he and people in germany did all the legwork they did to make it happen
5326890 they did ask him to try out after he went through all of that but it was too late he told them he had already given his word to the german team

5326893 you cant compare something as prestigious and great as the olympics or rugby and cricket to football its the national sport its what every young kid wants to do and therefore it takes on another level

5326971 there were yankees fans everywhere it was the same thing when boston was here it seems like theyve got more fans here than we do it was pretty loud
5326972 mickey hatcher our hitting coach told me before that at bat if casey kotchman got on to bunt him over if theres two outs hit a home run
5326973 it was a dream come true it was just wow to do it against the yankees and get an opportunity to come in at the end of the ballgame trying to do something it was awesome
5326974 i just went like that and he threw me out of the game but whatever in real time no way the swing wasnt close you look at any swing in slow motion and its close in real time theres no way that was a swing no way
5326975 its never a good feeling when you have a game and youve got to watch it on tv but its easier watching a win than a loss
5326976 what an amazing blessing for the first hit my dad got to see it it was perfect especially with the win i said before the game that now that im in my first start i really want to contribute in some way to help us win a game so to come back and win like that it was just a perfect night
5326977 in my experience i like to see guys get their first base hit on their first or second at bats because i know the pressure can mount up so to see him hit a home run in that first at bat for his first base hit i think its something hes going to remember for a long time
5326978 we really didnt pitch very well against them we got better as the series went on and better as this game went on but we had problems getting the ball into some zones we needed to theyre a good offensive lineup if you let them get command of the count they did it too often on us and we paid a price
5326979 i dont know if theres a better back end of the bullpen right now
5326980 these guys have been incredible the last couple of years and theyve been on the money this year
5326981 i feel good having my team behind me with their support im ready to play the championship game and whatever happens happens
5326982 ultimately the plan was from when we left santo domingo to just win straight out win
5326983 shes very driven very positive shes just got it in her blood to go and fight for what she wants and she really wants to win
5326984 this years going to be special because were dealing with a new group of girls
5326985 last year you had the talent this year its 50 50 we lost 13 players last year because of age they were here the last four years and they aged out that group was special because i had them for a long time
5326986 pitching great defense their speed matches up with our speed that makes it tough theyre a good hitting team they stay upbeat they cheer all the time its going to be a great matchup
5326987 hes back to where he was before theres going to be a little adjustment there always is coming into the major leagues but hes been great as far as his finger hes running well hes playing good defense and hes ready
5326988 i cant worry about what happened back then ive just got to come back in and try to continue to pick up where i left off i think if i just play hard and do what i need to do out there make the routine plays and try to put together good at bats i think ill be all right
5326989 i think id have been happy without regard to who was coming back in town
5326990 the biggest thing was being back on the field and playing thats the ultimate goal to be out there every day playing every day and trying to win every day regardless of which team it is
5326991 obviously the intensity is a little higher when youre playing the yankees its more like a playoff atmosphere but im just going to try to go out here and do it every day like i was doing it before
5326992 i think thats a trait you need to acquire if youre going to be in the major leagues for a long time theres a huge level of interest in what major league players do on the field and how they perform you have to be able to talk about that
5326993 i think as ervin gets maybe his confidence back and hes more settled and very fluent in english hopefully hell feel more comfortable expressing himself
5326994 you know i cant complain it was my first games
5326995 if youre not even keeled extra emotion takes a lot of energy
5326996 she was where she was supposed to be in the water and were hoping in this lap or next on the hill shes going to try to lead the group

5327034 were going to do deals right now in financial services that will fuel earnings for years
5327035 if youve got some cash if you have a strong balance sheet this is as good of a time youre going to see in the next decade
5327036 since ive never considered selling it i shouldnt get credit for keeping it
5327037 after consultations with my legal advisers and close political friends for the country and the nation today i am deciding to resign from my office i am leaving with the satisfaction that whatever i did for this country and the population i did with honesty and commitment
5327038 but i am also a human being i might have made some mistakes but i have hope that this nation and the population will tolerate those mistakes with the belief that my intentions were always clear and to the benefit of this country
5327039 we were focused on getting that first goal on getting one at a time
5327040 we were never nervous it felt like we were getting opportunities and we were going to get a chance to come back
5327041 i had a bit of cramp at the beginning of the race now i just hope to get a good drawn in the semi finals
5327042 at this point theres nothing standing in our way of continuing to do what we said were going to do
5327043 all those things result in lots of other mechanical parts and bits and pieces that have nothing to do with electrical energy
5327044 such that the vehicle is not just a battery on wheels
5327045 itll have a similar set of visual cues and some of the features that were on the concept car
5327046 the program has all of those same things built in were just doing them faster because we have to
5327047 its an entirely different technology its an entirely different powertrain layout its a huge step forward
5327048 this and the other vehicles that are coming out in plug in form are for all intents and purposes because of some timing they are in a lot of ways prototype vehicles being put on the market to test
5327049 theres no doubt that general motors realized the importance of positive media coverage with the prius
5327050 its an opportunity to change the way we consume energy without significantly changing our lifestyle
5327051 dyfed powys is a very high performing force and want im keen to do is build upon the solid foundations that already exist here
5327052 clearly ive got some areas i want to concentrate on one in particular is to make sure that we concentrate on the minor crimes as well as the more serious crimes
5327053 im sending some very very clear messages to our staff about the levels of service dress and presentation that i expect from them at all times
5327054 im particularly keen to use technology to minimise some of the problems of geography that is a major issue for us such a large area limited resources managing that to public expectations is a constant challenge
5327055 also through proper communications we can make sure we can send cars to where they are required
5327056 we want to increase the visibility of our staff and perhaps the main thing we can do in that area is make sure they are sent to the right incidents
5327057 our police community support officers pcsos are vital to improving visibility across the force area and we want to make sure they are out nearly all of their time
5327058 if at all possible we will seek to increase their numbers in forthcoming years
5327059 in my first three months here there have been three murders and some very very serious offences and ive been very pleased to see we have the staff with the skills and the expertise to deal with those issues
5327060 one of the core issues for us at the moment is 60 of the people passing through our custody suites have a form of drug problem or certainly have drugs in their system at the time of arrest
5327061 at the moment we have not got access to treatment or support services for those individuals
5327062 i think what needs to happen is politicians and the government need to rise above party politics so people can be supported and helped
5327063 otherwise we will just be arresting people releasing them and seeing the same people come through custody time and time again
5327064 i cheated a little bit i looked at this idea ahead of time and i think it is a great idea

5327072 no question about it in our county gang members pose an ever present problem that is yet to be resolved
5327073 and if theres undocumented gang members what can we do to get ahead of that in any way that we think is appropriate
5327074 the american dream means as much for an innocent person wrongly accused of gang membership or a lawfully present person wrongly deported as it does for you and me
5327075 if we have any indication that a person is not born in the united states then that is who were looking at
5327076 it has been a very valuable partnership for us in southern california
5327077 the critical role of the sheriffs department is to identify individuals in jail who are potentially deportable
5327078 any time we can clear jail beds and possibly deport someone and not have them back in the jail bed that keeps it open for a local criminal

5327219 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
5327220 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
5327221 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
5327222 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
5327223 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
5327224 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
5327225 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
5327226 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
5327227 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
5327228 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
5327229 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
5327230 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
5327231 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
5327232 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
5327233 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
5327234 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
5327235 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
5327236 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
5327237 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
5327238 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
5327239 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
5327240 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
5327241 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
5327242 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
5327243 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
5327244 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
5327245 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
5327246 this is a planning took where all things are going

5327248 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
5327249 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
5327250 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
5327251 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
5327252 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
5327253 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
5327254 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
5327255 this is an unusual theft and its quite likely that the thief has either dumped the display or taken it indoors somewhere to keep it as a souvenir or as a trophy
5327256 a leader that god has blessed us with at this time
5327257 who cares about that class get a good enough job and you can afford to eat out every night and have other people do your mending and cleaning
5327258 oh andrea i cant tell you how happy it makes my heart that you left this comment
5327259 i had a hard time justifying my desire to stay home even before i had kids
5327260 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
5327261 i came to the birds nest to lay a golden egg and thats what i did
5327262 i am surprised we havent won more gold but you know what i hope this sets a trend
5327263 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
5327264 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
5327265 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
5327266 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
5327267 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
5327268 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
5327269 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
5327270 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
5327271 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
5327272 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
5327273 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
5327274 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
5327275 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
5327276 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
5327277 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
5327278 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
5327279 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
5327280 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
5327281 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
5327282 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
5327283 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
5327284 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection
5327285 we had one that we used in a sting for school zones
5327286 hopefully well have the new one by the time school starts again
5327287 it was a pain that hit my heart that has not gone away
5327288 theres no way that my daughter would have done that to herself she loved life she had dreams and hopes and plans she loved her family
5327289 it was like her death all over again to know that my sweet baby was laying somewhere with no one to help her being murdered and then set on fire it was the worst most horrific thing i have ever heard
5327290 we were making plans to be together and she was making plans to do things with her family
5327291 on her 20th birthday i was looking at my daughter in a box
5327292 we should have been celebrating her life but it was stolen from her

5327299 a broad coalition of wall street firms from banks and insurers to hedge funds and private equity firms are pushing lawmakers to let them buy and manage so called frozen corporate pension plans which no longer accept new members but must continue to cover current ones of the 2 3 trillion in u s corporate pension fund assets some 500 billion sits in frozen plans including those of big companies such as ibm hewlett packard verizon and alcoa
5327300 jpmorgans newest property bear stearns was among the first to lobby congress and regulators it started last year just as two of its hedge funds were imploding
5327301 mckinsey amp co predicts that the assets in frozen plans will more than triple to 1 7 trillion by 2012 by taking over frozen plans wall street firms could charge fees based on the total assets perhaps in line with the standard 1 to 2 levied by many money managers

5327333 you know a lot of folks have done a lot of great things over the years to bring us to where we are today and this is a combination of that so thank you
5327334 i think what we can see as we look around tonight is a county that is in transition in change
5327335 i think we are entering a period now where the change and transition is becoming much more apparent
5327336 all of those things are coming together and they are having an impact on economic development
5327337 we have to refocus our economic development strategy to promote not just growth but a better quality of life for our citizens
5327338 with the many new citizens we expect to be moving into the county we need a housing stock that will accommodate variety
5327339 we need to keep our people and our industry here in the county and having a way to train them locally for a good career is one way we do that
5327340 we continue to look for companies that are going to upgrade the wage scales locally

5327356 were talking about pulling our troops away to the borders of south ossetia they will not be on georgia territory
5327357 we were all set and then the georgians came up with a bunch of new requirements with no time for us to act so the time to exchange prisoners was interrupted
5327358 russian forces continue to consolidate their enclaves in south ossetia and abkhazia
5327359 mounting evidence that russian and georgian military used armed force unlawfully during the south ossetian conflict

5327375 theyre doing well its no different than what it was last week they are executing the offense sometimes theyll make mistakes but for the most part
5327376 i think this is first out of the seven championships because im dealing with nine new players that are playing with me for the first time
5327377 thats a big difference i think its a big complement to being the winner this year
5327378 shes been red hot for the whole tournament on defense and offense she knows shes aging out and she wanted the championship just as bad as i want it
5327379 it just all went our way we just stayed up and united as a front and it happened that we won
5327380 were so close were like family we just wanted to go all out because this is probably our last game together as a unit so you just go all out for your family and thats what happened
5327381 what we have instructed mostly is the unity and the team and even though youre losing you have to keep that up
5327382 next year well come back more experienced and more prepared now that we know the rules and regulations a lot better were definitely coming back next year
5327383 i enjoy the title win for 30 days and then i start working around the first of october
5327384 i dont dream like that i go year per year a year at a time i take a game at a time day by day tomorrows different but right now im on a high cloud im real proud of the girls
5327385 we were basically stuck up the canyon without our rafts
5327386 we had no supplies no food and very little water we lost everything
5327387 thats all it took just a few days of very heavy thunderstorms

5327391 with this blog were opening up a two way discussion about how we are making windows 7 we strongly believe that success for windows 7 includes an open honest and two way discussion about how we balance all of these interests and deliver software on the scale of windows we promise and will deliver such a dialogue with this blog
5327392 one of our chief goals with this release is to be deliberative thoughtful and considerate with what we disclose
5327393 when we disclose information we want to make sure it is accurate and truthful steven and jon would like to start the conversation about windows 7 and they will continue to provide information at various milestones in the development process
5327394 this reflects the fact they are hoping to get window 7 out by 2010 and there will be some things in it of interest to software developers to get those developers they need to start corralling them now this is sort of a starting gun for that push
5327395 there were vista blogs before vista shipped theres an ie8 blog and blogs are a standard way of communicating with developers and others
5327396 if microsoft really wants to open a dialogue in time to get any real feedback they cannot wait much longer in the dev cycle plus they need to have enough information out so that developers can support windows 7 as soon as possible once its released
5327397 not to set expectations around the release that end up disappointing you features that dont make it claims that dont stick or support we dont provide
5327398 it would be a good thing for him to do for windows 7 what he did with office they will benefit from a fairly conservative release delivered on time windows 7 could come out onto the market with less of the early pain vista had to face
5327399 the saudi market remains a huge for the most part untapped opportunity as the market sees growth and development in every business sector not only oil and gas but also education healthcare and construction its a market that demands focus investment and insight which is why hitachi data systems has chosen to partner with two very powerful players in the industry who have not only a long standing presence in the saudi market but also the resources and capabilities to work with customers to establish world class storage infrastructures
5327400 we serve chief organisations in the saudi government financial oil and gas and telecommunication sectors working with the top technology vendors there is a clear potential for success in this partnership with s technology with our market know how and customer base
5327401 saudi businesses are experiencing tremendous growth and need reliable data storage and management infrastructure to serve increasing demands for scalability and security this is a market where oil revenues are predicted to hit 16 6 trillion by 2030 this scale of economic growth will be the foundation of a business environment that is of global standards and technology requirement for the best in the market were excited about partnering up with hds for the saudi market and to kick off a solid roadmap for strengthening the presence of solutions
5327402 today according to the peace plan the withdrawal of russian peacekeepers and reinforcements has begun
5327403 i think the russians will pull out but will damage georgia strongly
5327404 georgia will survive but russia has lost its credibility in the eyes of the world
5327405 if someone thinks that our citizens can be killed soldiers and officers who are peacekeepers killed with impunity we will never permit that
5327406 anyone who tries to do so will face a crushing response
5327407 the city is a cold place now people are fearful
5327408 we are at the early stages of a softening trend
5327409 there are also early signs that the pace of growth in non mortgage consumer credit is slowing overall consumer credit is now expanding by just over 10 per cent on a year over year basis look for this figure to trend lower in the coming six months
5327410 anything such as that or any other military equipment that was moved in would be in violation of the ceasefire and should be removed immediately
5327411 we dont want to destroy the nato russia council but russias actions have called into question the premise of the nato russia relationship
5327412 one of the central errors westerners are constantly assaulted with is the use of this term jihad
5327413 the central jihad for all of us is to constantly improve and be the best we can be and try to adhere to some very pure ideals
5327414 islam values life above anything we are taught in the quran that mans right to life exceeds even gods rights on man
5327415 the book is important because in this country in the sound bite generation stereotypes pretty much prevail
5327416 when americans in general think of muslims really the radical islam aspect of it comes to mind where we think this book is really important is that is humanizes muslims and builds bridges between the two cultures
5327417 you see so very few articulate moderate voices coming out where are the movies where is the music where is the poetry where are the books to counteract some of this violent ideology

5327443 they are the actions of people who pose a very real threat to our communities
5327444 there was less blood loss with this procedure than with conventional surgery and there is the potential for a faster recovery
5327445 the results were outstanding and suggest the robot assisted surgery is an attractive option for fistulas that would normally require abdominal surgery
5327446 robot assisted surgery has promise to bridge the limitations of laparoscopic surgery and allow more women with fistulas urinary incontinence or prolapsed pelvic organs to benefit from a minimally invasive approach
5327447 they also have a user thats a little older and a little more sophisticated
5327448 cerebral malaria is lethal 20 percent of the time in the best of hands and here weve shown that something as simple as aspirin because of its affect on platelets might be able to improve the outcomes of those who contract this deadly form of the disease
5327449 the take home lesson is that platelets by releasing pf4 are playing an early role in the wind up phase of cerebral malaria
5327450 our mouse studies show that timing is critical with the mice we know when we infected them and controlled when we treated them a big challenge in translating this to humans is that people dont know when they get infected
5327451 platelets dont get any respect but theyre the second most abundant cell in the blood after red blood cells and packed full of factors that rally the immune system to action by taking what we know about platelets and their activation and applying it to malaria we have found a driver of cerebral malaria
5327452 basically what we found is that things are more complicated than previously thought
5327453 our study shows that there is a large genetic component to caste determination but that there is also a very strong environmental component
5327454 flexibility in caste determination is essential as it allows the colony to respond to changes in need or environmental fluctuations
5327455 differences in the nutrition that an individual assimilated during larval growth are strong predictors of caste
5327456 but there are still haves and have nots in the colony those genetic variants who have a reproductive advantage and those that dont

5327461 the iranian development and testing of rockets is troubling and raises further questions about their intentions
5327462 iran still has a long way to go as far as satellites are concerned and it deliberately exaggerates its air and space successes in order to dissuade israel or the united states from attacking its nuclear sites
5327463 iranian experts can put the national satellite into orbit in the not too distant future

5327510 why is it so hard to stimulate innovation inside big corporations while at the same time vcs are awash in innovative business plans and people
5327511 there are two main obstacles to innovation within the enterprise the first is fear if i try something new and fail will i lose my job companies need to send a clear message that it is far better to try and fail than fail to try the second obstacle is the companys own internal structure or processes the typical middle manager will always give you 10 reasons why they cant take advantage of a great idea in 9 cases out of 10 the issues are internal and not at all relevant to the business problem they are trying to solve all they can see is that implementing the idea will make their job harder

5327531 the global economy has remained resilient in the face of significant structural weaknesses in developed economies the continuing massive industrialisation in china is providing solid support to the global economy
5327532 emerging market economies have contributed more than their industrial counterparts to global growth since the year 2000
5327533 in particular china remains a key driver of global commodity consumption through its position as a net importer of raw materials
5327534 we continue to expect that commodity prices will be driven by long run marginal cost of supply
5327535 the effects of current weaknesses in the developed economies on demand for our commodities should be minimal driven by ongoing strong demand from the emerging economies meanwhile supply side pressures remain high this has led to overestimation of the supply side response and thus price outcomes regularly being underestimated by industry observers in the short term we expect prices to remain high relative to historical levels albeit with higher volatility

5327546 he is the vision guy im more of the detail guy
5327547 i dont know how we would have managed without him stepping up for that role
5327548 it was asking a lot of him to be in that position
5327549 nathan received so much input constantly about decisions that he could have comfortably made on his own it required an extra degree of dedication for the project

5327571 when you violate the condition the licence disappears meaning youre simply a copyright infringer

5327588 a key aspect of the debate both during the public consultation on and parliamentary debate about the code of practice for voluntary retention of data and also during the debate about the directive within the european council and the european parliament has been the impact or potential impact that retention of communications data has on individuals human rights

5327655 it is what every young kid wants to do you cant even compare something as prestigious as the olympics or rugby or cricket
5327656 that is not to take anything away from the fantastic achievements of our olympians they have been brilliant and inspire us all

5327680 we bend over backward we try to be accommodating but these issues really the universitys hands are tied we must have the medical forms we must have the housing registration we dont know that you want to live on campus unless you tell us
5327681 several customers have been worried that their esx systems had been compromised by an attack and that this was the cause for not booting
5327682 the problem that surfaced today is not related to exploitation of a security issue on esx
5327683 cryptography is notoriously hard to get right and if improperly used can create serious security holes
5327684 keyczars key versioning system makes it easy to rotate and revoke keys without worrying about backward compatibility or making any changes to source code
5327685 keyczar is essentially a library and doesnt actually serve keys or certificates
5327686 as the number of mainframes in businesses grow customers are looking for easier ways to manage the environments particularly because mainframe operating skills are scarce
5327687 the mainframe is undergoing a major renaissance as it decision makers recognise how its cost effective and energy efficient scalability reliability and security make it the ideal platform to satisfy intensive business requirements
5327688 our latest enhancements demonstrate that ca continues to deliver the solutions necessary to exploit the mainframes full economic potential
5327689 there doesnt appear to be much of a requirement to ensure that the public knows who the subs are theres just no political will to do it
5327690 we dont usually post about problems like this on our blog but we wanted to make an exception in this case since so many people were impacted
5327691 spammers are going back to straightforward spam not image spam or attachments
5327692 the cyber criminals seem to have more success with social engineering and blended attacks
5327693 the threats challenging us today are becoming a blended variety that challenge both email and web security
5327694 without integrated and correlated protection between the two the ability to stay ahead of these threats will become increasingly difficult
5327695 hampen har et meget lavt indhold af det euforiserende stof thc

5327697 its time for some truth about who john mccain really is and what a mccain presidency would mean for americas workers

5327699 here is some info but according to what we have heard from several sources this is much more than just an emotional relationship according to staff and former staff members they claim that todd is a pathological liar the board privately has said that todd has been lying to them all along we are praying for those around todd to demand for him to get the help he needs before thrusting him back into ministry like they did 2 5 years ago when he had an affair with a different staff member we are praying for todd his family along with others that have been impacted through this

5327715 i think its pretty funny i like when kimbo swings
5327716 fay looks like it will be far removed from major oil producing areas but until its better defined we should still see some volatility in the market
5327717 i didnt even know they were back together i also didnt
5327718 i think its pretty funny i like when kimbo swings
5327719 its a very very fragile balance of powers right now

5327722 so who are using these services a high ranking amazon executive told me there are 60 000 different customers across the various amazon web services and most of them are not the startups that are normally associated with on demand computing rather the biggest customers in both number and amount of computing resources consumed are divisions of banks pharmaceuticals companies and other large corporations who try aws once for a temporary project and then get hooked
5327723 all of us in new york hollywood and across the country should be concerned about how this failure to reach an agreement is impacting our members
5327724 they have already suffered significantly as a result of the wga strike and now they are experiencing an additional loss of work made worse when they can find a job by having to work without a contract under old terms and conditions there are some who feel we have all the time in the world to make this deal we on the n y board do not

5327733 not at all there is nothing like disappointment in my vocabulary
5327734 the iranian development and testing of rockets is troubling and raises further questions about their intentions
5327735 this action and dual use possibilities for their ballistic missile programme have been a subject of iaea discussions and are inconsistent with their un security council obligations
5327736 iran still has a long way to go as far as satellites are concerned and it deliberately exaggerates its air and space successes in order to dissuade israel or the united states from attacking its nuclear sites
5327737 it is clear that for years iran has had shihab 3 ballistic missiles which put israel within its reach but the threat posed by iran comes from its nuclear programme and not from its satellites or ballistic missiles
5327738 iranian experts can put the national satellite into orbit in the not too distant future

5327794 your evil spawn angelina jolie and her vacuous hubby brad pitt make about 40 million a year in violent psychopathic movies and give away three of it to starving children trying to look as if they give a crap about humanity as they spit out more dunces that will consume more than their fair share and wreck the earth even more
5327795 miss jolie says she likes john mccain too and hasnt decided who to endorse huh
5327796 arent you supposed to be somewhat enlightened or do you not know that the african daughter you hold in every picture had parents who suffered and died because of the republican partys worldwide economic assault on africa over the last few decades since reagan it might be good for your asian and african childrens self esteem to know you support barack obama for the leader of the free world

5327804 we want every every floridian and guest to be a survivor
5327805 i know its only a tropical storm but we take it seriously

5327816 john mccain all he wants to do is talk about me
5327817 a leader god has blessed us with at this time
5327818 the fact of the matter is at a certain point when government has not been serving the people for this long people get cynical they tune out
5327819 and they start saying to themselves a plague on both your houses they are willing to consume negative information more frequently than positive information for good reason theyve seen how promises havent been kept
5327820 with less than three months to go before the election a lot of people are still trying to square sen obamas varying positions on the surge in iraq first he opposed the surge and confidently predicted that it would fail then he tried to prevent funding for the troops who carried out the surge
5327821 not content to merely predict failure in iraq my opponent tried to legislate failure
5327822 even in retrospect he would choose the path of retreat and failure for america over the path of success and victory
5327823 in short both candidates in this election pledge to end this war and bring our troops home
5327824 the great difference is that i intend to win it first
5327825 it is hard to understand how sen mccain can at once proclaim his support for the sovereign government of iraq and then stubbornly defy their expressed support for a timeline to remove our combat brigades from their country john mccain is intent on spending 10 billion a month on an open ended war while barack obama thinks we should bring this war to a responsible end and invest in our pressing needs here at home
5327826 i think that would be up to first of all to john to decide whether he wants a pro choice running mate then we would have to see how the republican party would rally around it at the end of the day i think the republican party will be comfortable with whatever choice john makes

5327836 we take a hard line on security throughout the region in assuring peace and stability in south ossetia
5327837 we will do whatever is necessary and no one should have any illusion
5327838 compensate for its own mediocrity by way of destroying an entire people
5327839 a leader that god has blessed us with at this time
5327840 now you want to win and saying it doesnt make it so
5327841 it would be nice to think that after eight years of economic disaster after eight years of bungled foreign policy up until the next line i thought he was referring to the clinton years of being engaged in a war that should never have been authorized and should never have been waged that cost us a trillion dollars and thousands of lives that people would say lets toss the bums out toss the bums out were starting from scratch were starting over this is not working
5327842 so i understand why a lot of folks are saying this should just happen why are we having to run all these television commercials why do we have to raise all this money just read the papers these are the knuckleheads who have been in charge throw em out but american politics arent that simple
5327843 the fact of the matter is at a certain point when government has not been serving the people for this long people get cynical they tune out and they start saying to themselves a plague on both your houses they are willing to consume negative information more frequently than positive information for good reason theyve seen how promises havent been kept
5327844 well sometimes we just learn bad habits no one teaches us the importance of being on time

5327852 fays only going to be a cat 1 when it hits florida
5327853 the practical and emotional support offered by womens aid is a lifeline for many people who live with domestic abuse
5327854 the work which is being carried out in caithness and sutherland to support women and children is invaluable if a parent is unable to seek help children can access this support in their own right
5327855 by its nature the services offered are carried out very discreetly and no one need be afraid of getting in touch the level of support will depend on what the young people themselves want and staff will listen can offer advice on rights and will be there for anyone needing urgent help
5327856 sure kid we need someone in left field knock yourself out

5327874 pc enabled small businesses in the u s are interested in running bi on their consumer data to drive and monitor performance against the competition
5327875 the payoff is rapid innovation new marketing ads and new channels to boost their profit margins almost 80 percent of small businesses try to understand tco total cost of ownership before purchasing bi products services thats because they want these purchases to be a part of their overall it strategy
5327876 three or four years ago the buyers were not that sophisticated
5327877 they were trying to escape it and procurement so there was no provision for price escalation now theyre coming up for renewal and getting surprises with price increases and adding more people

5327880 less than 10 percent of centers surveyed have the capability to measure lifetime value and only 18 percent of centers use customer profitability as a metric
5327881 id bet that the survey is skewed toward low wage countries thats important because i expect a lot of bad management habits are causing the problems the survey surfaces
5327882 rigid time management rather than working on providing customer solutions call centers are focusing on and measuring time time in queue time on the call nothing wrong with that but in addition you have to solve a problem no solution and all your metrics turn to sand
5327883 abandon rate is the most commonly used target with 90 1 percent of participating centers using it as a key metric while only 63 4 percent of centers use first call resolution as a performance target
5327884 crm is failing because call centers arent really implementing crm instead they are using crm as a defensive shield to fend off customers

5327896 es en primer lugar un mensaje muy positivo para los libros y los peri dicos pues explica que el canal no cambia el mensaje
5327897 las formas tradicionales de transmitir sensaciones como el cine o un libro tienen mucha fuerza para activar emociones reales en el cerebro
5327898 las personas que tienen una mayor capacidad de fantas a son los que reciben de manera m s fuerte las emociones
5327899 sabemos que el placer corporal tiene unos mecanismos de activaci n muy similares
5327900 con otros est mulos como la temperatura o la percepci n del ambiente
5327901 esta es la primera observaci n que establece realmente que tit n tiene un lago lleno de l quido
5327902 la detecci n de etano l quido confirma la idea de que en tit n hay lagos y mares llenos de metano y etano
5327903 no siempre es recomendable poner en pr ctica una fantas a porque la realidad es compleja y hay una serie de olores sabores o problemas derivados de las situaciones que pueden perjudicar nuestra vida individual o de pareja pero no cabe duda que montar fantas as ya sea en solitario o en compa a es una actividad de lo m s sana si no se convierte en obsesi n o parafilia
5327904 la fantas a no debe convertirse en una enemiga sino en un complemento que enriquezca nuestra vida sexual yo no dir a que la persona que tiene fantas as est enferma sino m s bien todo lo contrario no tener fantas a er tica alguna puede ser un s ntoma de carencias sexuales de estr s o de exceso de trabajo
5327905 esta fantas a femenina tremendamente com n deriva de que muchas veces a la mujer le cuesta aceptar que le gusta el sexo sin amor
5327906 la mujer de hoy sobrecargada de responsabilidades a veces necesita que en el sexo o al menos en sus fantas as un hombre fuerte y poderoso coja el tim n y tome las decisiones por ella en una palabra que la domine
5327907 una de mis fantas as favoritas es imaginarme que estoy en la pista de una discoteca y todos los hombres me tocan me acarician y luego sacan sus penes y me follan todos a la vez
5327908 es el placer del anonimato del sexo sin compromiso que durante siglos ha estado tan mal visto en la mujer
5327909 acostarme con t os heteros sobre todo amigos creo que es la fantas a m s habitual en nuestro colectivo que por lo dem s usa mucho la sauna y el video porno para aliviarse
5327910 en ning n caso esto significa que este hombre vaya a poner en pr ctica su fantas a todo el mundo ha pensado alguna vez en matar a su jefe y sin embargo no hay indicios de un crecimiento en el n mero de asesinatos de altos cargos de empresas
5327911 en algunos casos puede ser un s ntoma de falta de autoestima pero en general no es m s que un af n de reconocimiento social y popular disfrazado de pulsi n er tica
5327912 me enamor un poco de ella cuando ten a ocho a os y la vi en un v deo en el que se abr a un abrigo y debajo s lo llevaba un bikini
5327913 seriously im sitting here watching the u s basketball team destroy spain when i could have been watching the first person in history beak the 9 7 second mark nbc has been dropping the ball all week on what they have been showing they think that just because we are in america all we want to watch are americans
5327914 i know nothing will you teach me so that i can know something
5327915 america doesnt give a crap about what the world thinks and the world doesnt vote so why are you over there
5327916 i used to tell him akhil that you have the potential to achieve big from the ring but he never believed me he used to say i am just trying to motivate him but he is a gem and he has worked hard throughout
5327917 from then on children in bhiwani started looking up to these boxers it brought them recognition and there were many who took up to boxing during that period
5327918 we acts as resellers of the services the move is likely to lower the tariffs by 50 per cent which will encourage more people to use the service
5327919 me salgo de la vaina para tratar de hablar explicar discutir con personas que dicen cosas que son mentiras tengo muchas ganas de expresarme

5327922 tomando en cuenta razones estrictamente humanitarias y porque somos respetuosos de los derechos humanos le hemos dado esa acogida y se encuentra hospitalizada en nicaragua para sacarle los charneles esquirlas y atenderla de una enfermedad que la ha atacado desde hace varios a os
5327923 porque somos respetuosos de los derechos humanos damos protecci n a las personas independientemente de qu pa s sean
5327924 comience a inventar hechos sobre estos hechos que son eminentemente humanitarios
5327925 estar inventando e incluso cometiendo delitos porque utiliz s mbolos de la cruz roja en la famosa operaci n que organizaron
5327926 and we desire each one of you to show the same earnestness to have the full assurance of hope until the end so that you may not be sluggish but imitators of those who through faith and patience inherit the promises
5327927 if we discover a desire within us that nothing in this world can satisfy also we should begin to wonder if perhaps we were created for another world
5327928 deep down inside you long for a cold hearted republican to lower taxes brutalize criminals and rule you like a king
5327929 the nine most terrifying words in the english language are im from the government and im here to help
5327930 why you should read kafka before you waste your life
5327931 to read more than a line of two of casanova
5327932 what was dirty immoral seemed to have no attraction for him
5327933 if police officers no longer see themselves as engaged in protecting their communities from criminals and instead as domestic intelligence agents working on behalf of the cia they will be encouraged to collect more information it turns police officers into spies on behalf of the federal government
5327934 with its actions in recent days russia has damaged its credibility and its relations with the nations of the free world bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the twenty first century
5327935 today we start a new chapter of paraguayan history whose authorities will be relentless against the thieves in their communities
5327936 all the oil paraguay needs in this century venezuela has and venezuela guarantees to supply paraguay right to the last drop for the development of paraguays people industry and agriculture
5327937 for the past four years in partnership with southwest airlines we have helped to make the dream of a higher education possible for students by decreasing the barrier of distance
5327938 southwest airlines understands the difficulties hispanic students face away from home away from their families we want to be the bridge between their aspirations and the realization of those dreams keeping the families connected and in touch is an important factor for success in higher education
5327939 all of the applicants are already winners not just for taking the first steps but for the endurance of staying in the race

5327945 rezultatele aferente primului semestru din 2008 indica o piata a asigurarilor stabila si in continua dezvoltare fapt care in opinia mea reflecta inclusiv o incredere din ce in ce mai mare a consumatorilor de produse de asigurare
5327946 consumul pentru perioada aprilie septembrie scade cu aproximativ 50 in raport cu perioada octombrie martie aceasta scadere a consumului nu influenteaza achizitiile de gaze avand in vedere faptul ca in aceasta perioada inmagazinam un volum important de gaze naturale destinat perioadei de toamna
5327947 this program is very different from the countless self help books that are out there in the world which tend to collect dust after being read
5327948 with a dvd and two exercise packed workbooks this is much more hands on even before people sign up for the program i encourage them to answer 43 free questions under the ask yourself tab on our website http www theultimatelearningprogram com through this warm up exercise they become actively engaged in understanding where they are in life in terms of achievements happiness goals etc this provides a little taste of the ultimate learning programs highly interactive proactive process of learning and understanding
5327949 when you decide to unveil the power of optimum learning and success all that you already need to know is within you
5327950 the question becomes how do i remove self imposed limitations or self destructive behaviors by becoming a person who believes in your own capabilities and understands how every decision we make today shapes ones life and future
5327951 the ultimate learning program is successful for anyone who practices the lessons learns the method and embraces challenges within their own ways and beliefs
5327952 i wonder if his corporate sponsors pick up the tab i heard that if he gets gold medal no
5327953 when i saw the nbc story following him around to all his favorite restaurants i had the same thought those bills must be insane
5327954 als je wel honderd manieren bedenkt om te verbergen dat je intellegent bent kom je uiteindelijk tot de conclusie dat je bij die 1 van de wereldbevolking hoort
5327955 it started off hey cutie where you from and then it turned into oh no what have i done this song rocks thanks aidan save a prayer duran duran
5327956 that other radio show booking is conveniently appeared i believe
5327957 whats the most gut wrenching decision youve ever had to make
5327958 people accuse us old liberals of smarmy self righteousness and god knows they are right
5327959 for example if your total credit limits equal 20 000 7 or lower than that would be 1400 or less
5327960 were going to have a nice buffet with lots of food we plan on getting fat and as far as another olympics go well have to wait and see
5327961 today we were pretty relaxed and we were joking around
5327962 we saw all the boats behind us and we thought we might as well win our only olympic medal race
5327963 phelps in breaststroke that would be the last thing id like to see
5327964 his achievements are just beyond description and the whole world recognises his ability
5327965 i dont know if anybody understands what the hell is going on
5327966 i tied in my olympic games but i guess they dont want it now
5327967 i knew i didnt have my best routine but when i saw we got the same score and my name was second it was weird
5327968 i felt coming first was normal it was within my expectations
5327969 if i tell you i wasnt nervous thats impossible to tell you the truth i couldnt sleep well and i felt like i was collapsing i was going to bed at three and getting up at five
5327970 we are dedicated to creating a happy atmosphere at the closing ceremony the message is to say goodbye and promise to meet again in four years
5327971 organisers may have to cut or readjust part of the show should there be rain on august 24 but it should not spoil the show on the whole the olympic closing ceremony will present the world with a grand ecstatic party
5327972 essentially chris has been doing the job successfully for a three month period i decided it was time to make him permanent safety services manager and chief of police
5327973 opened 40 clinics in beijings 18 districts and counties to offer free hiv tests and aids counseling
5327974 rape is prevalent these militants do anything they like and when there is conflict the military move in and they too will commit rape
5327975 dotted with oil and gas activities and commercial sex workers follow the camps
5327976 we are finding a rising hiv prevalence in rural farming and fishing communities we have communities with very high unemployment rates
5327977 crisis situation means that you dont have time to listen to hiv aids messages youre thinking of your immediate survival
5327978 we suspect there definitely will be a problem of drug resistance
5327979 very challenging because we are in a situation of a widespread epidemic with very high prevalence across the state even the interior
5327980 we must ensure that prevention and treatment services continue to help those most in need
5327981 spread of the disease seemed quixotic particularly on a continent where only about 50 000 of the 30 million
5327982 five years and 15 billion 1 7 million people are receiving treatment
5327983 spent more of their own money to combat hiv aids
5327984 the disease still ravages millions of africans but it is no longer an automatic death sentence
5327985 unfortunately key congressional subcommittees have approved funding at levels below those set in the bill the budget for foreign aid is insufficient and there are many worthy programs
5327986 co sponsored the bill but has been less vocal about his support
5327987 wonder whether the government should shift resources to fight the disease domestically
5327988 government has underestimated u s hiv aids infections by 40 per year for the past decade
5327989 disturbing trends that need to be addressed but not at the expense of progress overseas
5327990 helping to treat aids patients in poor countries earns the united states considerable goodwill abroad
5327991 biomedical interventions to prevent hiv infection evidence challenges and way forward
5327992 d ifficulties with product adherence and the possibility of sexual disinhibition are important concerns
5327993 will need to be part of an integrative package that includes biomedical behavioral and structural interventions
5327994 a ssesment of such multicomponent approaches with moderate effects is difficult issues to be considered include the nature of control groups and the effect of adherence on the true effectiveness of the intervention
5327995 as msnbc adds coveted young viewers who are overwhelmingly democratic it becomes less likely to ever seek say a conservative counterweight to olbermann or a barking pseudo populist curmudgeon like lou dobbs it would no more do such things than mtv would and the temptation to become the winning cable network of the obama years will be too great for msnbc to ever truly balance its present leftward political tilt
5327996 as i have done nothing wrong in connection with any of the matters that are the subject of the inquiry i expect to be exonerated
5327997 in the near future i would love to have a talk about new challenges and opportunities in education and training and the provision of safe and fair workplaces in nsw
5327998 can i get help with the costs of childcare if im working
5327999 the childcare element is worth up to 80p in tax credit for every 1 a week you spend on approved childcare

5328010 it could have formed like pluto in the belt of icy debris beyond neptune then been kicked to large distance by a gravitational encounter with neptune or uranus
5328011 however we think it is more probable that sq372 comes from the inner edge of the oort cloud
5328012 the existence of an inner oort cloud has been theoretically predicted for many years but sq372 and perhaps sedna are the first objects we have found that seem to originate there its exciting that we are beginning to verify these predictions
5328013 there are bound to be many more objects like this waiting to be discovered by the next generation of surveys which will search to fainter levels and cover more area
5328014 in a decade we should know a lot more about this population than we do now
5328015 is to understand the origin of comets which are among the most spectacular celestial events but the deeper goal is to look back into the early history of our solar system and piece together what was happening when the planets formed

5328017 retailers have been very cautious a bump with stimulus checks seems to have worn through
5328018 back to school shopping appears to be below expectations for a number of retailers were seeing very cautious spending patterns even by teens who tend to be aggressive spenders
5328019 the holiday shopping season will probably be the slowest since 2002 which fits with a stagflation economy

5328023 the loop is the keystone of parramatta city councils integrated transport plan
5328024 as the economic capital of western sydney parramatta is in need of a quick reliable and low pollution city transport system

5328028 its a very sad situation without its mother at suckling age we are very concerned theres no guarantee another pod will have a lactating mother and no guarantee it will accept it
5328029 if theres a slender chance its mother is still out there then it may hear it further out to sea
5328030 there were people swimming with the mother and calf off coogee last week and it freaked them out
5328031 if people try to swim with whales theres a good chance they can distress the mother this is how they get abandoned
5328032 it might be a peaceful experience for people but its not for the whale
5328033 i know that the extent of the changes under the way forward reform strategies may cause some staff uncertainty as to their future within the department
5328034 no officer need lose his or her job but some will be required to relocate we will assist in any relocation
5328035 casualisation and privatisation will not solve the problems in the prisons
5328036 inmate numbers have increased by 40 per cent in just 10 years its a miracle weve managed to hold it together with the numbers we have
5328037 abolishing operational agreements and casualisation is a serious health and safety concern for corrective services staff and for inmates
5328038 in corrective services we need permanent skilled staff trained for the dangers and challenges of the job not backpackers looking for a quick buck
5328039 overtime costs have been a problem for years and the iemma government has done nothing
5328040 obviously there has to be reform we have an overtime culture and its been a strong culture

5328074 scientists must seek the most effective robust and valid methods available to answer questions about the brain historically understanding some aspects of brain function has necessitated invasive methods in human and non human primates because of a lack of alternative methods but current neuroimaging techniques such as magnetoencephalography meg and functional magnetic resonance imaging fmri funded by the lord dowding fund for humane research now offer significant opportunities to replace non human primate experimentation in behavioural neuroscience increasing evidence to the efficacy of these alternative non invasive techniques for human based studies is important and it is timely that this issue is to be debated at the european parliament
5328075 last september more than half of all european politicians backed a campaign to end experiments on monkeys across the eu the written directive sponsored by conservative mep john bowis called for the revision of directive 86 609 to give priority to ending the use of apes and wild caught monkeys in scientific trials and establish a timetable for alternatives

5328168 nursing homes are well known for abuses such as overmedication bedsores depression abandonment and neglect
5328169 it could be the type of person attracted to farming are those that want to work in isolation theyre introverted a whole heap of things that might be correlated with depression so theyre vulnerable
5328170 we could also hypothesise that theres less help seeking services in rural areas
5328171 its a beginning a signal that its time to begin a journey toward restoring balance and health and wholeness
5328172 the fundamental issue is how you are going to approach that imbalance
5328173 if you dont deal with your emotions youre likely to be stuck with them
5328174 if you just give people pills theyre never going to deal with the underlying issues
5328175 its a process that i think is worth investing time energy and money in because it will save you so much down the road
5328176 physical exercise with the exception of talking with another sympathetic intelligent trained human being is the single best treatment for depression
5328177 its important to acknowledge that these times exist were a society thats made very nervous by despair
5328178 suicide particularly among young people is increasing we have to acknowledge that one in five young people have thought seriously about killing themselves and one in 10 has made an attempt
5328179 this chapter really helps put people back in touch with the possibilities of love the benefits of prayer and the importance of forgiveness
5328180 as you move on this journey through and beyond depression its not necessarily that where you are changes but even more importantly the way you look at and experience where you are and what you do changes
5328181 my father was out of work so i was eligible i was single and i was out of school and all and unemployed
5328182 it was good physical work good hard work but we were well fed and well cared for
5328183 young professionals across the nation conservation professionals park professionals have really stepped forward to honor the guys
5328184 at the time during the depression it was tough and my father was working for a company in waterbury and he was only working a couple days a week
5328185 so we needed food on the table there were seven of us besides mother and father nine people ate a lot of food
5328186 they need it today it would be wonderful today if they had it and got the kids off the street and into a camp like that work hard and earn money and learn what life is all about
5328187 you should talk about stuff rather than keep it inside
5328188 we hope this makes a difference in other kids lives

5328190 this is a major public health concern that should be given serious consideration in future urban development transportation planning and environmental policies
5328191 health risk can be mitigated through proper urban planning but that doesnt erase the immediate risk to school age children attending schools that are too close to highways right now
5328192 existing schools should be retrofitted with air filtration systems that will reduce students exposure to traffic pollutants
5328193 for many years our focus has been on homes when it comes to air pollution school attendance may result in a large dose of inhaled traffic pollutants that until now have been completely overlooked
5328194 major roads play an important role in the economy but we need to strike a balance between economic and health considerations as we break ground on new areas
5328195 policymakers need to develop new effective strategies that would encourage urban planners to reconsider our current infrastructure particularly when it comes to building new schools and maintaining existing ones
5328196 you dont just create an audience in this business you create a kind of community
5328197 and i need to be able to talk to this community about this and to try to assuage what i suspect will be frustration and anger at losing a voice that they felt spoke for them
5328198 i became interested in the stiffness and all these crazy angles their dead bodies had

5328202 such sharp price declines including a 52 drop for gannett an 82 dive for mcclatchy and a 94 loss for rural suburban publisher gatehouse coupled with what may be perceived as currently cheap valuation ratios could be tempting to value minded investors but we say look out below
5328203 we think the stocks have further room to fall as declining revenues and negative operating leverage combine to create a downward spiral for this moribund industry
5328204 we dont anticipate these trends to reverse and consider the newspaper industry unattractive as a whole
5328205 mcclatchy doubled down its bet on the future of newspapers with the 4 6 billion acquisition of knight ridder in 2006
5328206 the 2 5 billion in extra debt assumed in the deal only exacerbated mcclatchys shaky financial footing barely a year passed before mcclatchy had to write down 3 billion of the acquisitions purchase price another problem in the current environment is mcclatchys outsize exposure to california and florida with their floundering housing markets we expect mcclatchy to see 4 7 annual revenue declines over the next five years and only irregular profitability

5328224 until a decade ago gay people were seen as a security threat and as recently as two decades ago they were being witch hunted and sacked from the security services

5328294 to ask the secretary of state for foreign and commonwealth affairs what information he has about how north korea was able to build a military grade plutonium production reactor outside international safeguards based on blueprints of the united kingdom military magnox plants at calder hall sellafield
5328295 technical information about the magnox reactors at calder hall sellafield has been in the public domain for over 25 years
5328296 a lthough the totem explosive yield was highly destructive they evidently confirmed that it was not good enough for military quality weapons because these results would have been shared with the us we can guess that the 1962 nevada test might have been conducted with plutonium closer to the low end 81 of the definition
5328297 the 1962 detonation involved plutonium of a quality below that of weapons grade
5328298 high irradiation level reactor grade plutonium can be used to make nuclear weapons
5328299 c ompared to data released about other nuclear detonations the information disclosed about the 1962 test has little substance
5328300 scorned the us government affirmation that it successfully exploded a weapon made with reactor grade plutonium
5328301 a lower yield would be suggestive of greater resistance to proliferant use no nation with other options would choose such material as the basis for a nuclear weapons program and none are known to have done so
5328302 the information disclosed about this test in 1977 represented a compromise between policy makers in the carter administration who wished to high light the proliferation risks of of civilian plutonium use and those responsible for protecting classified weapons design information
5328303 to our knowledge all u s nuclear weapons use weapon grade plutonium i e plutonium with an isotopic fraction of at least 93 5 percent pu 239 the same is probably true of the weapons in the arsenals of the other weapon states there are several reasons for this one of these is that the natural uranium metal fuel used in early production reactors had to be discharged after low u 235 burnup because of both reactivity and metallurgical fuel constraints such reactor operation naturally produces plutonium with a high pu 239 fraction it was also recognized that radiation exposure to workers fabricating plutonium weapons components in glove boxes would be minimized if the plutonium had a low fraction of the higher plutonium isotopes
5328304 however the most important factor in motivating the high pu 239 content plutonium in early nuclear weapons was the problem of pre initiation of the chain reaction
5328305 we are not arguing that a proliferator would not prefer weapon grade plutonium or highly enriched uranium to reactor grade uranium however the possible use of reactor grade plutonium cannot be discounted

5328308 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
5328309 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
5328310 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5328311 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5328312 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5328313 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5328314 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
5328315 there could have been some people still inside so we got there quickly and tried to act as fast as possible
5328316 they said the truck was in about 10 feet of water and maybe 2 feet sticking out
5328317 it was quite a complex incident and certainly had a lot of demands
5328318 theres only one other time that a tractor trailer busted through the guardrail about 15 years ago but just the cab was hanging over the edge
5328319 other than that i dont think a vehicle has ever actually made it into the water
5328320 the unique nature of this incident and its aftermath have posed challenges for us all
5328321 but i want to commend the response of our state and local agencies and first responders for their quick and decisive action when they arrived on the scene
5328322 we had no problems talking to firefighters on the bridge the divers in the water or the officers in the air
5328323 from our perspective all the partners worked well and there was no communication breakdown
5328324 overall it was a pretty coordinated activity for such a complex operation
5328325 this incident has always been considered one of the bridges worst case scenarios
5328326 if you feel something in the middle of the night itll be me gnawing off your ankle
5328327 when the federal government started making schools gun free zones thats when all of these shootings started why would you put it out there that a group of people cant defend themselves thats like saying sic em to a dog
5328328 the naysayers think a shooting wont happen here if something were to happen here id much rather be calling a parent to tell them that their child is ok because we were able to protect them
5328329 geez im sure glad didnt have a gun handy that day
5328330 dont shoot im a in other words there are so many things wrong with this idea on so many levels that all i can say is that the good folks in this particular town who are responsible for this idea really must not be thinking straight

5328335 die leute sollten respekt gewinnen und sehen dass ich ein mensch bin der etwas gutes tun will
5328336 we dont come in here as much because theres nothing here anymore
5328337 we live not too far from here if we can come here get the grocery shopping done gas done wife get her hair done all those things youre going to shop in that area
5328338 a leader god has blessed us with at this time
5328339 the fact of the matter is at a certain point when government has not been serving the people for this long people get cynical they tune out
5328340 and they start saying to themselves a plague on both your houses they are willing to consume negative information more frequently than positive information for good reason theyve seen how promises havent been kept
5328341 with less than three months to go before the election a lot of people are still trying to square sen obama s varying positions on the surge in iraq first he opposed the surge and confidently predicted that it would fail then he tried to prevent funding for the troops who carried out the surge
5328342 not content to merely predict failure in iraq my opponent tried to legislate failure
5328343 even in retrospect he would choose the path of retreat and failure for america over the path of success and victory
5328344 in short both candidates in this election pledge to end this war and bring our troops home
5328345 the great difference is that i intend to win it first
5328346 it is hard to understand how can at once proclaim his support for the sovereign government of iraq and then stubbornly defy their expressed support for a timeline to remove our john mccain is intent on spending 10 billion a month on an open ended war while thinks we should bring this war to a responsible end and invest in our pressing needs here at home
5328347 i think that would be up to first of all to john to decide whether he wants a pro choice republican party would rally around it at the end of the day i think the republican party will be comfortable with whatever choice john makes
5328348 people always wonder why librarians enjoy their jobs we sit around all day and wait to find answers to questions we know nothing about
5328349 we are programmed for scarcity and cant dial back when something is abundant in other words coming across what dr biederman calls new and richly interpretable information triggers a chemical reaction that makes us feel good which in turn causes us to seek out even more of it the reverse is true as well we want to avoid not getting those hits because for one we are so averse to boredom

5328359 we are excited to renew our affiliation agreement with the colorado avalanche they are one of the best organizations in the nhl they have a history of developing players and winning championships
5328360 last season i feel the affiliation was beneficial to both parties we received quality players and people who in turn had an opportunity to develop and gain experience to further their hockey careers and help the avalanche organization for example jd corbin and rob drummond spent a significant amount of time in johnstown last season they were exciting players for our fans to watch this year they will be playing for the lake erie monsters i am looking forward to another outstanding season working with the avalanche and monsters
5328361 we feel that johnstown and the echl is the right environment for them
5328362 we look forward to continuing our relationship with the chiefs
5328363 it was a positive first season in 2007 08 and we are excited for the upcoming campaign
5328364 net newsers web users under 35 who read more political blogs than watch national news coverage rely heavily on web based news during the day and have a strong interest in technology and technology news
5328365 canadas data centre infrastructure is fragmented and the key urban centres now lack capacity
5328366 even in a time when the economy appears to be in a slump data hosting and storage services do not appear to be slowing down
5328367 increased reliance on the internet is growing demand for hosting and storage at a rapid rate
5328368 we remain bullish on the industry fundamentals for the co location and dedicated server sector where capacity constraints at a time of strong demand is giving the incumbents strong pricing leverage and volume growth
5328369 that would provide capacity for future growth of the companys canadian co location and dedicated server segments which are growing at 27 6 per cent and 17 9 per cent year over year respectively as of fiscal q3 08 ended march 31
5328370 beyond the valuation merits acquiring peer 1 would bring additional exposure to the growth data segment while it would provide a strong platform points of presence traffic peering client list for entering the u s market
5328371 with a shortage of canadian data centre capacity we expect that q9 could eventually fill this unused capacity whether the company attracts new customers through its sales force directly or through its wholesale partner ibm
5328372 since power costs represent approximately 50 per cent of the recurring expenses of operating a data centre and because iweb has access to the third cheapest source of power in north america due to its location we believe it could gain a competitive advantage over other web hosting service vendors
5328373 we used the term re engineered it was re implemented from standards but on the backend its a very very different beast as best as we can tell without seeing the source to the linden lab server the structure internally is radically different partly due to our desire to keep things usable for non sl style worlds
5328374 the microsoft developer community should get a mention as being the newcomers of note
5328375 they have been contributing code and have set up their own grid
5328376 soon everything from energy management to product life cycle management and city planning will occur in collaborative programmable 3d space the power of opensim is that its open source modular design allows it to be used in a lot of different applications open and distributed will win
5328377 linden lab has to invest an enormous amount of energy into maintaining their current grid and this could be an obstacle re keeping up with the future they have seeded

5328381 her independence of thought and self evident sense of mission immediately made her a favorite
5328382 shes whats happening knowledgeable and too cute to be staying indoors blogging
5328383 a leader that god has blessed us with at this time
5328384 now you want to win and saying it doesnt make it so
5328385 it would be nice to think that after eight years of economic disaster after eight years of bungled foreign policy of being engaged in a war that should never have been authorized and should never have been waged that cost us a trillion dollars and thousands of lives that people would say lets toss the bums out toss the bums out were starting from scratch were starting over this is not working
5328386 so i understand why a lot of folks are saying this should just happen why are we having to run all these television commercials why do we have to raise all this money just read the papers these are the knuckleheads who have been in charge throw em out but american politics arent that simple
5328387 later speaking to a dinner crowd of about 350 obama sought to reassure democrats whom he said typically
5328388 its hard enough obama its a funny name and who knows what theyre the republicans going to do
5328389 aside from producing green obama t shirts earlier this year the obama campaign has not yet displayed the rhetoric or resources necessary to win its share of the irish american vote
5328390 barack obama needs the huge irish american vote in closely fought pennsylvania battlegrounds like pittsburgh and the philadelphia suburbs there are similar pockets of irish american swing votes in other key states
5328391 to ignore this irish dimension serves to the advantage of the implicit republican appeal on racial issues like affirmative action and religious issues like abortion
5328392 one cannot imagine hillary clinton avoiding such a trip surely an aspiring world leader would want to acquaint himself in greater detail with an apparent success story in the resolution of conflict
5328393 a more likely explanation might well be the unimportance his campaign strategists attach to the irish vote in america
5328394 now you and i both know that theres a homophobia problem in the black community
5328395 blacks appear to be more likely than whites both to see homosexuality as wrong and to favor gay rights laws
5328396 with no close second the most supportive group for gays and lesbians
5328397 making up your mind questions to consider before the next election
5328398 heres what i want you to do between now and election
5328399 dont just look at issues look at character issues are important but you also have to look at character
5328400 theyre saying im totally self sufficient in myself and nobodys self sufficient enough to be president its too big a job
5328401 rick warren is at the forefront of a kind of younger generation of evangelical protestant leaders who want to have a christian public presence in the culture but who are less tied to the republican politics of their predecessors
5328402 theyre values oriented guys but less convinced that either their own principles or the best politics lies in a total commitment to the republican party
5328403 we are one of those people that make over 250 000 a year and i dont agree that that makes us rich
5328404 even with that kind of income we struggle to pay everything we have gotten ourselves into
5328405 im pretty much a dyed in the wool republican and i was a marine what he went through for five years you gotta hand that to him
5328406 i mean come on whoever buys into that they gotta have a screw loose
5328407 just stay in the senate stay busy learn more foreign policy and come back in ten years obama and i betcha id vote for you
5328408 hes as genuine as can be its just hes a green apple hanging on the tree and mccain is a ripe red apple ready to be picked obama just needs to ripen some more
5328409 barack obama is going to get the same percentage of the religious vote that john kerry and al gore got
5328410 thats christian identity politics and im sure it has some influence but i dont think at the end of the day its the deciding factor
5328411 jimmy carter could have come in here and sounded much more comfortable with his faith but people having seen a jimmy carter presidency would not vote for him just because theyre likely to see him in heaven
5328412 study all the different candidates at every different level you need to register to vote and then you need to vote
5328413 when i hear people say i dont like either of the candidates im just not going to vote i want to say to them well then you need to move to another country because people died for that vote
5328414 loved everything from the salmon and spring rolls to the grilled avocado sandwich everything is fresh and from scratch the owner chef is always
5328415 we want young chinese girls or boys to get such an impression from this place that 20 years from now theyll want to work for johnson amp johnson
5328416 thats an all time high for optical scan usage in this nation
5328417 electronic system usage will go down in 2008 for the first time since we started collecting data in 1980
5328418 we studied these systems and all the systems in use in ohio and the most vulnerable to risk are the touch screen voting machines
5328419 there have been no votes lost just votes that are missed and hours later or days later recovered
5328420 we are in fact in compliance with the terms of the contracts
5328421 if theres a machine failure or a power outage or some kind of misprogramming with the machines it will enable people to keep voting
5328422 what has happened since florida 2000 is weve taken a problem that was a disaster for that election and made it exponentially worse
5328423 these machines cannot be trusted for the counting and recording of our votes
5328424 computer scientists around the country have demonstrated that in less than 60 seconds one of these machines can be broken into and can infect the entire system on which people are voting
5328425 touch screen voting machines have proven to be accurate reliable and secure time and time again
5328426 it is important to note that successful elections necessitate people processes and the technology all working together
5328427 anytime there has been a change in voting equipment there have been some some doubts and concerns which lessen over time due to familiarity with the new equipment
5328428 if all you have is the electronic memory you can reprint that electronic memory as many times as you want its going to say exactly the same thing and you wont know whether its right
5328429 more than a third of the voters in this country will be voting in an unverifiable way
5328430 without an audit without the ability to audit it will be unreliable and without paper record you cant really audit
5328431 this is the central act of democracy it is the basis for the all the legitimacy of our government and its actions we believe or at least want to believe that people are put in office by the will of the voters thats what you need to be able to verify
5328432 they threw out the playbook and re invented themselves in a way that not only addresses the market realities but delivers an outstanding product
5328433 earl maucker their editor put it best intelligent but un conventional
5328434 we cant put out a quality paper and deal with the economics at the same time
5328435 i just want to be able to get a good nights sleep and to live in my home without these monstrosities hovering over me
5328436 is it worth destroying families pitting neighbor against neighbor father against son
5328437 it hurts my heart to say it but weve removed jerrell from our roster
5328438 he hasnt done what he needed to do to be on our team he didnt hold up his end of the bargain
5328439 to second guess the mind set of a young man in the heat of battle four years later and to put the question in a civilian court system that cant even remotely comprehend the battlefield is shameful for this government
5328440 while not acknowledging that any part of the governments case is true the fact is the military sent these people out to do a job and kill everything that moved in a city where there were no good guys left
5328441 the case is about what happens on the field of battle and how to deal with the rules of engagement
5328442 it presents a new paradigm because military matters are normally tried in a military setting by people who have some sensitivity to the kinds of events and circumstances that occur in war civilians who dont have any of that experience arent equipped with that kind of insight
5328443 the truth is the truth and thats how the president will testify
5328444 if a man wants his dreams to come true he must wake up
5328445 i cant understand why there arent rings of young people blocking bulldozers and preventing them from constructing coal fired power plants
5328446 the gap between the carbon price and the cost of ccs
5328447 i hope that the strengthening of carbon markets will bring forward a sufficiently good price for carbon that it will provide some of the financial incentive for ccs will it be enough i do not know
5328448 as a fig leaf to give unabated coal fired power stations an appearance of environmental acceptability

5328450 john mccain is going to own the george bush economy around his neck in this election he was central to its architecture he was one of its fiercest defenders in america florida has lost more jobs over the last year than any other state in the country
5328451 it doesnt take much if our supporters are turning out at a rate of 74 percent 75 percent 78 percent and mccains are turning out at 68 70 72 that doesnt seem like a big deal but it is the whole ball game
5328452 bush had an advantage over kerry because of their intensity we think mccain is going to have trouble replicating bush in 2004
5328453 we dont take florida for granted but we do have a good history here even though were outnumbered in this state our voter turnout effort has been extremely good in florida
5328454 florida once again is the epicenter of the political universe were very confident that florida continues to trend as republican going back to jeb bush mel martinez charlie crist of course the president bush elections weve got a good mature organization on the ground
5328455 id have to say that monckton won the debate he came across as more prepared and had answers at his fingertips whereas richard appeared to verbally stumble on occasion
5328456 i got the impression that littlemore was engaging in the debate totally unprepared
5328457 oh my this is very confusing no wonder the government says its too early to take action
5328458 supports privatization tax cuts and government spending cuts and opposes laws that limit spending by non party organizations during election campaigns
5328459 in order to attract votes the harper government has combined tax cuts with big spending the effect being to suck the treasury dry
5328460 he would have his dignity in his calm in the stillness
5328461 if id just had a mother so i could say mother mother
5328462 he heard people singing behind him across vast distances of space and time from the place he had left he thought he heard music too
5328463 i hope shell be a the best thing a girl can be in this world a beautiful little fool
5328464 exposition is a mode of thought a method of learning and a means of expression
5328465 if every reader has not always wanted it shorter no reader has ever wanted longer
5328466 small voice for preservation and reuse a place where old things were valued
5328467 raising self esteem in young people would reduce crime teen pregnancy drug abuse school underachievement and pollution
5328468 when we point out illiterate mistakes we are often aggressively instructed to get a life by people who display no evidence of having lives themselves
5328469 each singing what belongs to him or her and to none else the day what belongs to the day at night the party of young fellows robust friendly
5328470 hog butcher for the world tool maker stacker of wheat
5328471 to go into solitude a man needs to retire as much from his chamber as from society
5328472 friendship marks a life even more deeply than love love risks degenerating into obsession friendship is never anything but sharing
5328473 his last word had been my name he had called out to me and i had not answered
5328474 but wherever truth may be the water comes ashore and the people look at the sea
5328475 it was leslie who had taken him from the cow pasture into terabithia and turned him into a king
5328476 he might have seemed the gliding great demon of the seas of life
5328477 in starry flake and pellicle all day the hoary meteor fell and when the second morning shone we looked upon a world unknown on nothing we could call our own
5328478 mark hoffman is one of the icons of the software industry and hes the right person to take enquisite to the next level of market penetration
5328479 his stellar track record in growing businesses makes him the perfect fit for enquisite as we embark on our next growth phase
5328480 there was some literature put out by the national right to life committee
5328481 and theyre basically saying they felt like you misrepresented your position on that bill
5328482 and i hate to say that people are lying but heres a situation where folks are lying
5328483 laban lang pero mas maganda kung ma improve ang record ko ill fight but ill be happy to break my own record
5328484 if the design savvy retailer target opened a hotel this is what it would look like
5328485 they both did fantastically well the only question he knew i gave them the first question and i was changing the questions within an hour before the forum began i talked to both of them a week before the debate and told them all the themes i talked personally to john mccain and i talked personally to barack obama i said well talk about leadership talk about the roles of government i said id probably have a question about climate change probably a question on the courts i didnt say im going to ask which supreme court justice would you not nominate they were clearly not prepared for that
5328486 the obama people must feel that he didnt do quite as well as they might have wanted to in that context because that what theyre putting out privately is that mccain may not have been in the cone of silence and may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama
5328487 the second case refers to a payment processor known as zippypayments com and a seizure of funds from this processors bank accounts in nevada the article falsely implies but notably does not go as far as to state that 9 9 million seized from zippayments nevada bank accounts were funds on account for bodog this is simply false
5328488 when does a baby get human rights in your view

5328490 youve accepted jesus as your lord and savior bob tell him what hes won
5328491 i know that my redeemer lives and hes up in heaven getting me the goods
5328492 i know that my obama is in the white house getting me change i can believe in
5328493 well have muslim and christian refugees too so we hope the community will welcome everyone
5328494 most anybody when they leave their country their first choice would be to go back home if they could
5328495 if you look at these groups coming here theyre among the most unlikely to go back and those having the most trouble
5328496 because we have the arabic speaking community and new jersey has a lot of diversity we do get them here
5328497 in new jersey the rent is very high and the jobs pay minimum wage
5328498 mostly we try to get them a job because we dont want to put them on public assistance
5328499 this is possibly our most biblical program in the sense of welcoming the stranger
5328500 my job is to get the patients voice into the mix where decisions are made no matter how psychotic that voice is still worthy of being heard i have not had the person who is so out of it that they cant communicate what they want
5328501 i dont know if they are doing people a service when they assert the right of mentally ill individuals to remain psychotic
5328502 none of this would have happened if i had been medicated
5328503 ich wollte den rekord f r die zuschauer und meinen trainer er hat zu mir vorher gesagt wir haben so hart gearbeitet jetzt mach es ich dachte mir er hat recht
5328504 preserved the inviolability of its territory what was left of it and the right to live privately in a non totalitarian society
5328505 its been incredible to watch and it has made a lot of teams sit up and take notice
5328506 even with half the budget they would still get the same results
5328507 weve kind of just been preparing for this all this year chris as well he knew he was going for three
5328508 i suppose you do get greedy in a way but its not wrong to be greedy when it comes to sport all along the focus has been three gold medals so if we came away with one each wed probably be a bit disappointed
5328509 i want to apologise to all the thai people especially my father i know this will be my last chance of getting a olympic medal
5328510 im a better boxer than the scoreline suggests if i wasnt a good boxer i wouldnt have beaten a world champion in the last round
5328511 it pains my heart but today was just not my day but i can take it if i can feel happy to take a win i have the heart to take a loss
5328512 its not an honest decision its all to favour the chinese because he wouldnt get through against ouatah is that boxing
5328513 he was boxing six people his opponent and five judges the world is the witness
5328514 i was knocked down but i knew my family were watching back home so i tried to come back from hell
5328515 al qaeda central is often the critical element in turning the hotheads into an actual capable cell
5328516 they have had a darwinian education in what can give them away and their tradecraft has improved as we have eliminated some of the less careful members of their organization
5328517 theyre hiding in a sea of people who are very xenophobic of outsiders so its a very very tough nut to crack
5328518 a key statistical procedure on which many past epidemiological studies had relied was flawed
5328519 emissions of smog producing pollutants decreased both nationally and regionally between 1990 and 2000
5328520 both decreased substantially nationally and regionally with statistically significant downward trends nationally no levels in 2005 were about 50 lower than in 1991 and no2 about 30 lower
5328521 one million to die from smog related illnesses in the next two years
5328522 the most problematic aspect of the cmas research is the assumption that air pollution kills
5328523 if this helps anyone out there who is in their middle aged years and has put off what they wanted to do because they thought they were too old or because they have a child and that they cant balance what they want to do with being a parent then thats great what ive done is show them that they can do it
5328524 it was thought that if youre getting to 16 17 or 18 youre getting to the end of your career dara has done a fantastic job in proving that you can continue to improve and that women can have children and get back into the sport she has gotten rid of a mythology in swimming that has been there for so long
5328525 we love the american people its the policies of your government we dont like
5328526 the prophets endure and can only be ignored at the risk of our own despair
5328527 its really the story of humanitys struggle to exist in an environment undergoing severe changes
5328528 the larger the island of knowledge the longer the shoreline of wonder
5328529 since man lives by the permission of physical geography it is his fate to be divided by mountains rivers and seas into groups that develop in semi isolation their diverging languages and creeds their climatically conditioned features customs and dress
5328530 every four years you usually get to look at these guys try to go native think of president bush in his brush clearing outfit
5328531 but if youre president the day job does involve a suit and it can be awkward when youre not in work clothes
5328532 everyone knows how fast a picture can go from local novelty to worldwide laughingstock
5328533 it shows hes not trying to be like everyone else its part of the visual message that hes crafting in an odd little way it adds to the not pandering in a conservative middle america suit like a 50 year old tax lawyer wears
5328534 it would be inappropriate if mccain looked as stylish as obama he has a different physique hes a different age and hes much more conservative
5328535 he does have occasional fun with a wider flashy tie
5328536 not all senators can wear that but it looks right on him
5328537 you could put baracks head on johns body and say hes gained a little weight but you wouldnt notice he was in different clothes
5328538 the democrats talk of tolerance but in reality the only tolerance they ever exhibit is for their own intellectual arrogance and they dont have tolerance for my culture
5328539 they think were a bunch of hillbilly heathens who go out and burn crosses and do crazy bullshit
5328540 they dont give a f if were with them or not because it doesnt matter the f ing republicans have stolen the individual liberties thing and thats why the gun thing is such a big deal
5328541 i got a call from them right after johnny got out i never heard back
5328542 sometimes they remind me of another bunch from chicago the blues brothers they seem to think theyre on a mission from god
5328543 if thats how he runs his campaign he is going to lose id rather bet on those who voted before when he stands up and says that im gonna get 30 per cent more black voters im gonna get 30 per cent more of my people to turn out for me what is joe six pack thinking
5328544 he should say im a black guy im not gonna take the michael jackson treatment but the problems of south side chicago are the same problems of the appalachian mountains big sonsofabitches are kicking the little sonsofabitches in the ass now im one of the little sonsofabitches so im pissed off inside every rural republican is a rural democrat begging to get out but we always trip over our johnsons
5328545 think this election will be won on the internet but here at 5 30 in the afternoon they dont go on the goddamn internet they go watch the andy griffith show a 1960s sitcom
5328546 white people in the south and throughout the appalachians love black culture i mean southern style cooking is black food everything i eat is fried your swing vote in the appalachians comes down to common sense thinking people who have strong faith and what barack obama needs to do is embrace his culture because we like his culture but nobody knows anything about him over 10 per cent of the rednecks out here and im a redneck think hes a muslim cause nobodys ever told em any different
5328547 im pretty sure i aint a queer and ive never had queer thoughts
5328548 but god loves them queers every bit that he loves the republicans
5328549 its their mouth they can use it to haul coal if they want to
5328550 the gallant kids from around here who lost their lives
5328551 it is the same exact people its the same f ing bunch of fight sing drink pray people who are over there who are over here in these mountains
5328552 youre damn right theyre on hadrians side of the wall is where they are and they want the scots irish vote well its true its f ing genes its who we are as a people well say f you to bush longshanks or maggie thatcher f any of em
5328553 bitterly clinging to their religion guns and antithapy towards others
5328554 im here to advocate for sen obama that we get a democrat into the wh
5328555 if you want rape to be legal then dont vote

5328576 we are at the early stages of a softening trend
5328577 once thats done we as the army should be vacating those premises and sending them back for uses yet to be determined but outside of the armys purview
5328578 kodi attacked the d end just like he was supposed to and pitched me the ball
5328579 i went down the sideline and cut back across the field and just outran everybody else
5328580 it was a nice run it was a good playcall by coach franklin
5328581 i was supposed to be on a comeback but kodi told me to run a stutter go so i did that
5328582 kodi laid it on me pretty good and i ended up getting a touchdown
5328583 pierre louis is not a big target but the quarterbacks have a lot of confidence in him and confidence that he can make plays afterwards
5328584 hes going to be exciting to watch hell make you look bad in 1 on 1 its good we see somebody like that in open field
5328585 hes going to make a lot of people do tackling drills the next week if he stays healthy
5328586 he was in a coverage where he had to split the one and two receivers if theyre going vertical
5328587 he had to play them both i dont know who the quarterback was he was trying to hit that inside receiver and harry just jumped on it immediately thats what youre supposed to do
5328588 he got the pick and we all got excited it was good for him
5328589 it was pretty much missed tackles and some assignment issues
5328590 they said we had 26 missed tackles in the last scrimmage i hope we didnt have that many because if we did we have a lot of running to do tomorrow
5328591 marks just got some kind of strain he could have played he didnt practice yesterday so we held him out
5328592 he should be back next week the doctor said its nothing serious
5328593 weve got to give you something to talk about the next couple of weeks since were not fighting anymore
5328594 of course he was excited and i think the players were as excited as he is in terms of getting a scholarship because they know what these guys go through that are not on scholarship
5328595 its pretty tough were proud hes with us and hell play some this year
5328596 i had to call him in to tell him to relax
5328597 all of a sudden youre the guy with the ball in your hands and you see these other guys with more experience in the system
5328598 they make it look so much easier than you do you get frustrated because you know you have a ton of ability and you know youre smart and it looks so easy for them why isnt it easy for me because its not
5328599 actually hes at the stage now where hes starting to push past that
5328600 at this stage right now there is a wide separation between evan and dayne
5328601 evan is closer to jimmy than he is to dayne
5328602 i think he could come in and finish a game for us if he needed to which he might just do
5328603 could we have had less sacks than we had absolutely
5328604 there are a lot of things you could do if you wanted to throw in the towel but i have a tough time with that
5328605 there were times that there were things that he didnt understand
5328606 but there are so many different factors that lead to a total some of them are physical some are mental on his part and some are mental on other peoples part then some of them are the play calls
5328607 clausen might have known what to do but lets say a tight end doesnt sight adjust or hot depending upon whether its a six man protection or a seven man protection
5328608 hes looking to throw it to him and the guy doesnt see it and the quarterback ends up getting hit
5328609 now people will say why didnt he throw the ball away
5328610 so its the cumulative effect of all those things added together clausen was certainly part of the problem but he wasnt the only problem
5328611 id rather turn him loose he has a chance of being something pretty special
5328612 i think he was sending the trainers out for ex lax all i know is he came in the next day and he was 217
5328613 its amazing since he changed numbers hes been catching the ball much better
5328614 maybe he realized hes a wide receiver and not an offensive lineman

5328616 if you tell me i cant do something that just pushes me harder because it comes from deep down i can make those nonbelievers believers by being the best back on and off the field
5328617 im excited about his development and think he is doing a great job so far
5328618 one thing i have noticed is its not too big for him
5328619 a lot of times you get guys running with the first team and its too big for them and they cant handle the pressure but not mike
5328620 hes not trying to pity paddy you he is trying to hit you and i like that about him
5328621 he is compact and gets under guys pads he got off to a good start
5328622 in high school they said i was undersized to be linebacker and i made all america at college they said i was undersized to be a fullback and now they say im undersized to play in the nfl
5328623 growing up in a one parent house ive been the underdog all my life im going to bust my tail harder than anyone else
5328624 i wouldnt imagine they would put me on it based on the running ive been doing and the cutting ive been doing i can feel some changes but whether or not i can do it to the ability i need to is the question it looks ok but the way it feels is the problem
5328625 if he thinks we need a day off he gives it to us there are a lot of veterans on this team that could use the break and there are a lot of young guys who need to play its a good situation
5328626 he needs to start a game and go play he made some plays for us he hasnt played that many snaps in a row in a long time
5328627 there are a lot of guys that probably played the most theyve played in an nfl game to this point
5328628 das spiel steht jetzt unter dem zeichen dass einige spieler eine chance bekommen die hinten dranstehen

5328636 preparations to protect life and property should be rushed into completion
5328637 there has been a lot of shifting in this track and there is still a lot of uncertainty

5328639 during the current crisis the government says it until further notice will not conduct military manoeuvres with russia or visit russian military units
5328640 cease with activities that destabilize georgia by for instance destroying infrastructure or blocking important roads
5328641 our objective is to work together with russia but thats got to be based on russia respecting the independence sovereignty and territorial integrity of its neighbours and not using its military force to impose its will on those countries
5328642 we are not seeking to freeze or break off the nrc but neither can we have business as usual with russian forces on the ground

5328646 the cold war is over the soviet empire is gone and neither one is missed
5328647 least of all is that empire missed by the once captive nations of estonia latvia lithuania poland ukraine and georgia
5328648 these brave young nations have joined the free world and they are not going back
5328649 should be able to count on the free world for support and solidarity
5328650 if i am elected president they will have that support
5328651 it was a moment when political self interest and the national interest parted ways
5328652 for my part with so much in the balance it was an easy call as i said at the time i would rather lose an election than lose a war
5328653 if someone thinks they can kill our citizens kill soldiers and officers fulfilling the role of peacekeepers we will never allow this

5328657 this is the largest financing of its kind ever completed and the fact that a landmark transaction of this size and complexity has been completed in challenging credit markets is a testament to the strength of the business and the confidence of the financial markets in baa and its airports

5328684 democrat barack obama has had about a 3 to 1 advantage over republican john mccain in post page 1 stories since obama became his partys presumptive nominee june 4
5328685 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
5328686 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
5328687 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
5328688 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
5328689 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
5328690 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
5328691 echo barack obamas call for a new economy with new energy
5328692 according to an analysis of campaign contributions by the nonpartisan center for responsive politics democrat barack obama has received nearly six times as much money from troops deployed overseas at the time of their contributions than has republican john mccain and the fiercely anti war ron paul though he suspended his campaign for the republican nomination months ago has received more than four times mccains haul despite mccains status as a decorated veteran and a historically republican bent among the military members of the armed services overall whether stationed overseas or at home are also favoring obama with their campaign contributions in 2008 by a 55 000 margin although 59 percent of federal contributions by military personnel has gone to republicans this cycle of money from the military to the presumed presidential nominees 57 percent has gone to obama
5328693 no big surprise being that most white evangelicals are prejudiced at least and outright racist at worst
5328694 three times as many evangelicals 12 percent are undecided this year as in june 2004 in 2000 that number was only 5 percent
5328695 sunday morning has been known and still is as the most segregated hour of the week
5328696 this isnt about what evangelicals think its about what theyll be told to do if they thought for themselves they wouldnt be evangelicals
5328697 evangelicals who are politically or socially active especially conservatives seem to be increasingly upwardly mobile suburban highly educated and with above average incomes contrary to many popular stereotypes
5328698 many in the christian right tend to get their information
5328699 someone who can combine the toughness they are used to with the negotiating adeptness they believe a woman would bring to the office
5328700 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
5328701 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
5328702 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
5328703 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
5328704 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
5328705 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
5328706 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
5328707 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
5328708 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
5328709 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
5328710 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
5328711 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt
5328712 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
5328713 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
5328714 these are sophisticated buyers they have they know full well that they were going to saturate the florida market
5328715 both hillary and gore are suberb smart caring politicians both let their essential soul to be sucked dry by consulting morons
5328716 if hrcs handlers allowed to be hillary clinton and not some concoction of a phony thatcher or whomever she might have had a chance that she allowed those highly paid fakes to make her into a fake is what disqualified her
5328717 i have had the feeling for a while now since the bereaved are taking the loss so hard that they fell in love with her as first lady like women do with a movie star
5328718 see that guy over there in that cell its his turn to go home first bring it on baby im staying at the hanoi hiltion
5328719 clinton s campaign acknowledged that it s not possible to buy 49 state coverage
5328720 start an audience responsive riff what is it going to take to get it done experience
5328721 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
5328722 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
5328723 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
5328724 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
5328725 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
5328726 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
5328727 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
5328728 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
5328729 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks
5328730 i believe we would have won iowa and clinton today would therefore have been the nominee

5328735 i also have no doubt that a lot of republicans and independents are going to be attracted to his call for a new era of non ideological bipartisan decision making
5328736 fay looks like it will be far removed from major oil producing areas but until its better defined we should still see some volatility in the market
5328737 the continuing massive industrialization in china is providing solid support to the global economy
5328738 it will never contribute more than a fraction of our needs
5328739 efforts to build and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change
5328740 to go from a small town like taunton and go to america and do all the research he does especially this as part of the nobel peace prize is a great achievement
5328741 lots of shows not just news are recording all time lows because of the continued fragmentation of viewing choices and in some cases due to dvr time shifting
5328742 i invented the whole thing and ive never seen a dime from it
5328743 if a musician records a song does he not get royalties for every purchase if an author writes a book does he not see royalties too if a barely eighteen year old girl stars in a porno does she not receive money im just asking for what i rightfully deserve
5328744 its not as if someone can just cut gore a huge check
5328745 hes going to have to track down each individual that ever bought sold or profited off the internet in the last three decades the amount of time and money to do this could potentially be even more than the money gore could possibly collect
5328746 he was a genuine american original and he will be missed by his friends which has to be about a million people
5328747 and by the time they left they were best friends
5328748 once jack starts to tell a story its hard to get him to stop
5328749 the purpose of denver stories is to honor those individuals who have done the most for denver and i cant imagine anyone more interesting or exciting than jack
5328750 he was one of a kind a fellow hoosier and lived a life full and amazing
5328751 theres plenty of theater made by young people at the fringe most of it receives less attention than it deserves and some of it obviously aims to educate the performers as much as delight
5328752 heres a school show though from the denver school of the arts in colorado that pulls off the rare achievement of bringing 40 young people aged 14 17 on stage showing off some impressive performing skills and offering the audience a truly substantial and moving glimpse into the mind of the generation now trembling on the cusp of adulthood
5328753 over a brisk 70 minutes director shawn hanns young cast move through sketches based on
5328754 on top of that they have to deal with all the normal pains of adolescence from broken friendships to unrequited love their three minute
5328755 the content is terrific the staging excellent and the quality of performance truly moving and if these magnificent funny angry humble self aware kids speak for the whole of their generation then theres some hope for the future after all
5328756 i think what were looking at is a tycoon team if you will people with the resources and vision for a new energy economy
5328757 its time for the wealthiest of the country to lead in solving the carbon crisis
5328758 if they can come together on climate change and pool their intellectual resources their financial resources and their own teams of people they have managing their empires what a critical mass that would be and what a voice it would be
5328759 this is a combination of a symposium and a renewable energy street fair and multimedia presentation

5328821 there is an urgency for youth to get involved with these things now more than ever to get involved and dedicate themselves to world issues to try to change the world
5328822 everyone brought welcome knowledge that was overwhelmingly encouraging and very informative
5328823 by yourself i find its hard to change but in a group you can come together and make one great event
5328824 endorse and join in the anti bush anti right wing sentiments that are driving so many people to activism
5328825 the communist party usa views the 2008 elections as a tremendous opportunity to defeat the policies of the right wing republicans and to move our country in a new progressive direction
5328826 we will work with others to defeat the republican nominee and to end right wing control of the new congress
5328827 what we are looking at is going a step further with what were already doing around hoons
5328828 we see the potential for that footage being able to further extend what already takes place
5328829 we dont want people putting themselves at risk and that would be my concern in this situation
5328830 i get concerned about people driving in motor vehicles when theyre using their mobile phones
5328831 you might have that vigilante kind of thing we dont want our community to put themselves at risk

5328834 we are seeing all the diseases and risk factors you see in adults high blood pressure lipid disorders pre diabetes type 2 diabetes liver disease pressure on joints physical disability and the psychological burden
5328835 we have to respect the fact that these really ill children deserve treatment and consideration of treatment

5328840 at lunchtime right in the middle of the shopping centre and hes going whack whack whack
5328841 people were dashing everywhere trying to get out of their way it was really ugly
5328842 we havent enough police in werribee so i think there is no one to tell nixon about the kids and drugs

5328852 im very happy to be driving at home for a second time its always a special feeling to race in front of my countrymen and im really looking forward to it
5328853 in barcelona we were having a strong race when i had to retire but i hope this time i can get a good result as the circuit will be new for all the drivers

5328857 i dont know but im certainly happy to have scored points in hungary
5328858 it was important for the team and for me and overall it was a very positive weekend
5328859 the car worked well i did a lot of laps during free practice on friday and saturday morning and i was on the pace all weekend and felt comfortable
5328860 its always nice to have that sort of weekend and i hope to continue like this for the rest of the season
5328861 we all hoped that after hockenheim he would have renewed confidence which proved to be the case
5328862 he was calm he was confident and he went into qualifying believing that he would get through to q3

5328873 so far as responsibility for the outbreak of the war is concerned the role of the president the government and of parliament is indisputable and clearly fatal
5328874 i am horrified by what has happened in georgia and also the way things have been seized upon and interpreted at the political and media level
5328875 but it is not possible to build a lasting solution to this problem based on a lie however much that might suit us or our allies from the point of view of long term strategic or geopolitical interests or that of the current interests of power
5328876 that did not work in iraq in the balkans and in other places of conflict it is not only hypocritical but also very dangerous
5328877 with the separation of kosovo russia obtained a strong justification for its action
5328878 i feel that for a long time to come we will be fighting the consequences of this precedent and not only in the caucasus
5328879 let me know when youre ready for that foot rub
5328880 is that the foot rub that comes with a side of chocolate sundae

5328890 people have several months to go before they have to make up their minds
5328891 its too early in my opinion to have any concerns at this point
5328892 with the time left who knows what that number is going to be
5328893 significant increase in the diversity of the business means the business is far broader based and so we remain very optimistic about the growth prospects
5328894 our sales results for the quarter while better than our forecast reflect the realities of the continuing macro economic pressures on our industry
5328895 this is not zee it is someone that just thank
5328896 shifting positions on the troop escalation or surge in iraq and charged that when his rival voted against funding the troops in a single vote in 2007 he had tried to
5328897 this was back when supporting americas efforts in iraq entailed serious political risk mr
5328898 it was a clarifying moment it was a moment when political self interest and the national interest parted ways
5328899 instead senator obama commits the greater error of insisting that even in hindsight he would oppose the surge
5328900 behind all of these claims and positions by senator obama lies the ambition to be president mr
5328901 whats less apparent is the judgment to be commander in chief and in matters of national security good judgment will be at a premium in the term of the next president as we were all reminded ten days ago by events in the nation of georgia
5328902 in cooperation with our friends and allies in europe we will make it clear to russias rulers that acts of violence and intimidation come at a heavy cost mr
5328903 there will be no place among g 8 nations or in the w t o for a modern russia that acts at times like the old soviet union the cold war is over the soviet empire is gone and neither one is missed
5328904 mccain undermines national security by playing model un and sending pretend ambassadors to georgia

5328906 i know people are going to love the ease of use brought by proximity sync just having your phone in the same room as your mac from time to time is all you need to do to keep in sync
5328907 its quite unbelievable that a man of 61 knowingly and deliberately set out to have sex with a female under 16
5328908 in some cases we are seeing a decrease in some of our police service areas but its about a 1 8 per cent reduction in assaults that we are starting to see
5328909 weve certainly seen within the city itself quite dramatic crime reductions 5 per cent in region one
5328910 in 2003 04 we put into place a family violence strategy that was about having people report family violence so that accounts for a proportion of the increase
5328911 victoria police has a 2 billion budget and if there were more police there would be less teachers perhaps or less of something else
5328912 between 250 and 500 kilometres 150 and 300 miles above the earth
5328913 the iranian development and testing of rockets is troubling and raises further questions about their intentions
5328914 iran still has a long way to go as far as satellites are concerned and it deliberately exaggerates its air and space successes in order to dissuade israel or the united states from attacking its nuclear sites
5328915 iranian experts can put the national satellite into orbit in the not too distant future
5328916 estamos convencidos que a trav s de esa adici n de infraestructura carretera se va a poder lograr un m xico m s competitivo y con mejores condiciones de funcionamiento

5328918 el presidente bush est comprometido con un pakist n fuerte que contin a sus esfuerzos para fortalecer la democracia y el combate contra el terrorismo
5328919 hemos dejado claro que apoyamos medidas que promuevan instituciones democr ticas fuertes que generen una mayor estabilidad y democracia
5328920 durante el mandato del presidente musharraf hemos visto una profundizaci n de las relaciones entre gran breta a y pakist n
5328921 esperamos que la dimisi n del presidente musharraf refuerce la democracia y el gobierno civil de pakist n
5328922 afganist n apoya el principio de un pakist n estable y democr tico fundado sobre la soberan a de la ley
5328923 no espero ning n cambio significativo por ahora en la guerra con el terrorismo y la situaci n en afganist n

5328925 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
5328926 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
5328927 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5328928 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5328929 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5328930 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5328931 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
5328932 een buitengewoon evenement dat aan china wordt toegekend verdient een buitengewoon waardige herdenking
5328933 i guess the fact the lsu continues to schedule the pac 10 for out of conference games home and home with asu au and washington and osu 3
5328934 look at the candidate and say does he live with integrity service with humility share with generosity or not
5328935 jesus christ is the kindest bravest warmest most wonderful human being ive ever known in my life
5328936 do you believe in modern immunology which requires that you first accept evolution
5328937 a bayh pick would have the feel of bill clintons 1992 successful choice of al gore
5328938 if there lives a member of congress who knows more about the environment he or she isnt talking much less writing
5328939 so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh
5328940 im all about biden for many reasons the first being hes the most qualified
5328941 he has excellent experience he has been in the senate since 1985 and he serves on the armed services committee
5328942 in late june polls conducted by the wall street journal nbc and fox opinion dynamics using entirely different samples both showed sen clinton giving sen obama a 3 bump pushing him over 51 for the first time when the two of them were paired against sen mccain and gov romney
5328943 most recently in nationwide polling on july 22 23 a fox opinion dynamics poll showed a more dramatic bump of 8 with sen clinton as sen obamas vice presidential running mate in a head on match it was sen obama 41 to sen mccains 40 this was before the intense media coverage of his european trip but with exactly the same sample when all voters were presented with the choice of an obama clinton ticket vs mccain romney the results were obama clinton 48 7 and mccain romney 39 1
5328944 according to the july 22 23 fox opinion dynamics poll in an obama mccain head on match up sen
5328945 so what about independents an obama clinton ticket appears to gain some strength in this critical swing voter group with an obama mccain head on contest independents are evenly divided 32 30 with sen obama over sen mccain but with an obama clinton ticket vs a mccain romney ticket the independents favor obama clinton 38 30 a statistically significant 6 increase in a crucial voter group
5328946 i too think senator kerry is a brilliant man who clearly beat bush in the debates by miles but he does not inspire much respect in the general population which is incredibly unfair
5328947 senator clintons poorly run campaign her inability to concede error and the irresponsible behavior of bill make me think she would not be a good president should she need to step in
5328948 but why did hillary give up we dont do that here this we do not understand if obama picks her as a partner he will be considered weak by much of the world
5328949 it is a scary story made more scary by the fact that most people in america dont understand what the problems are
5328950 we have the tunes we have dance we have humor we have love we have all those things that i think are the ingredients you want in a musical
5328951 the advantage is people know the characters and the disadvantage the flipside is the same
5328952 some people who know the characters may think they know the characters better than anybody else
5328953 we are only in previews its still an enigma what will happen afterwards
5328954 the great thing about the twin cities is the very sophisticated audience
5328955 its a great theatre town and often times the creative team and you learn so much once you add an audience
5328956 i would love to see the show go on a nice healthy american tour before it goes anywhere near new york
5328957 ive starting using the egg trick and ive been able to lower my commuting fuel costs by more than 10 per cent
5328958 americans overwhelmingly believe there is an urgent national need to find new sources of energy and this need is more important than reducing energy usage according to a new national telephone survey
5328959 see development of new energy sources as an urgent priority only 9 disagree
5328960 for nearly two thirds 65 finding new sources of energy is more important than reducing the amount of energy americans now consume twenty eight 28 think reducing current usage is more important
5328961 my guess is that the first big shock will come just after the election on november 4 shortly thereafter israel with the blessing of the white house will attack irans nuclear facilities in order to destroy or at least delay its program to develop weapons
5328962 people can relate to other people that they know or people in a similar circumstance they are therefore more inclined to take a chance and do something different
5328963 green marketing is totally an increased buzzword the average person doesnt check to see if the word holds any weight with the business
5328964 people should look at what companies are actually doing to be sustainable
5328965 everyday i would take an industrial sized trash bag and at least fill it to the brim with paper and cardboard despite the fact that there were recycling bins available on campus
5328966 the only real trash that we had was coffee grinds and those are biodegradable
5328967 she and other investors stand to gain a substantial return on their investment if gasoline prices stay high and municipal state and even the federal governments start using natural gas as their primary fuel source
5328968 its like magical thinking with no one bothering to scratch the surface
5328969 full on pander mode flailing around looking for anything that has traction in polls
5328970 saying that we can drill our way out of it this idea that every little bit helps is denying reality
5328971 it may not be good politics but its not fair to the electorate to let them think that a few little tweaks are going to fix the problem
5328972 if we want to enable the technologies of tomorrow like plug in electric cars we need electricity to plug into
5328973 state capitalism with direct intervention in a large sector of the economy
5328974 if wall street sees 4 8 plants built with important federal support over the next seven years on cost and on schedule i think youre going to see robust support from the financial sector
5328975 thats just not a feasible or responsible thing to say
5328976 if were going to cut down on greenhouse gases we have to find a way to sequester them and emissions in general
5328977 i have been an oil man my whole life but this is one emergency we cannot drill our way out of
5328978 on this issue i think that americans are ahead of the candidates of both parties
5328979 our energy economy is undergoing a transformation and were just in the early stages
5328980 wir waren in ungarn gut dabei das auto hat sich gut angef hlt und wir haben gezeigt dass wir uns noch immer weiterentwickeln
5328981 wir werden hart k mpfen um in der konstrukteurswertung vierter zu werden es war vor allem wichtig f r uns noch vor der sommerpause ein gutes resultat einzufahren das tut der stimmung im team gut und das hei t dass wir motiviert nach valencia gehen k nnen
5328982 es ist immer etwas besonderes f r mich wenn ich vor meinen landsleuten fahren darf ich freue mich wirklich darauf in barcelona hatten wir ein starkes rennen bis zu dem moment wo ich aufgeben musste aber ich hoffe dass ich diesmal ein gutes resultat einfahren kann denn die strecke ist f r alle neu

5328988 a leader that god has blessed us with at this time
5328989 now you want to win and saying it doesnt make it so
5328990 it would be nice to think that after eight years of economic disaster after eight years of bungled foreign policy of being engaged in a war that should never have been authorized and should never have been waged that cost us a trillion dollars and thousands of lives that people would say lets toss the bums out toss the bums out were starting from scratch were starting over this is not working
5328991 so i understand why a lot of folks are saying this should just happen why are we having to run all these television commercials why do we have to raise all this money just read the papers these are the knuckleheads who have been in charge throw em out but american politics arent that simple
5328992 the fact of the matter is at a certain point when government has not been serving the people for this long people get cynical they tune out and they start saying to themselves a plague on both your houses they are willing to consume negative information more frequently than positive information for good reason theyve seen how promises havent been kept
5328993 i thank god that i was blessed to see this
5328994 i have been crucified with christ and i no longer live but christ lives in me the life i live in the body i live by faith in the son of god who loved me and gave himself for me
5328995 blessed is the man who does not walk in the counsel of the wicked or stand in the way of sinners or sit in the seat of mockers but his delight is in the law of the lord and on his law he meditates day and night he is like a tree planted by streams of water which yields its fruit in season and whose leaf does not wither whatever he does prospers
5328996 the righteous will flourish like a palm tree they will grow like a cedar of lebanon planted in the house of the lord they will flourish in the courts of our god

5329082 two women came in and said weve got to get rid of this drongo i said id be happy to help
5329083 the town is desperately short of women we just havent got women here hes highlighted the problem and the way hes said it hes got national publicity
5329084 hes just letting people know its good fun to be a woman in mount isa if hes got to take a few brickbats on the head that wont bother molony
5329085 we are all rednecks up here we dont carry it around as a badge of shame we carry it around as a badge of honour
5329086 id suggest cr molony go off to school somewhere and get educated about what responsibility he holds on behalf of the community etiquette school perhaps
5329087 what do these sorts of statements say about our community its horrifying that in this day and age a public figure would say such things what era is he living in
5329088 but hes correct in saying there is a gender imbalance there are a lot of young men in town who would love to have families and would love to have a partner
5329089 mount isa has a lot more going for it than just its male versus female population ratio

5329098 both obama and mccain need to make their running mate choices very carefully because after all the influence that cheney and gore developed people are going to analyze their choices very carefully
5329099 we will never go back to the days when the vice presidency held little influence the national government is involved in too many things for a president not to have a strong partner standing at his side
5329100 even selecting himself as the running mate something that has never been done in history
5329101 theres something healthy in the vice presidency becoming a separate entity
5329102 in the next month one man either the democratic presidential nominee or the republican presidential nominee will choose the next vice president of the united states
5329103 their choice will be ratified by their party conventions and we the people will accept it but the idea that one person will select somebody who has a one in three chance of becoming president of the united states is to my mind very problematic
5329104 presidential candidates usually get vetted for a couple of years but the vice president just gets picked by one guy
5329105 its kind of weird process if you stop and think about it
5329106 it ought to be a more competitive process at the early stages
5329107 maybe people should run for vice president i dont know but we should be talking about it because the process now is fundamentally unhealthy it is not democratic for one man or woman to be able to pick the next president of the united states

5329194 travis never touched the security guard at all lisaraye then walked through the guard house into the property of her home travis was behind her and i was sitting in the truck on the passenger side i then got behind the drivers seat and backed the truck up

5329272 since evo appoints the new prefect not that much damage was done
5329273 we dont want to leave the russians in the cold but we want to make it clear to moscow that its no longer business as usual
5329274 it is simply not credible for britain and nato to make confetti commitments to protect every nation
5329275 were going to take our time and assess what further consequences there should be to the relationship
5329276 there is no deed to rush into everything we dont want to do it unilaterally i think there needs to be a strong unified response to send the message that this kind of behavior characteristic of the soviet period has not place in the 21st century

5329291 the zimbabwean issue is far from resolved and so the continent as a whole has a responsibility to continue to engage with us in finding solutions
5329292 part of it is actually a process of trying to unlock the deadlocks that have emerged in the negotiations
5329293 unless tsvangirai signs on the dotted line the crisis continues not only simply because the billions of foreign aid does not become available but also because he does represent a significant majority of the zimbabwean population
5329294 bashir was invited to the summit as an african country leader and there is no arrest warrant against him at his moment if there are any requests we will evaluate them then
5329295 the turkish government should reject efforts by sudans president omar bashir to secure a suspension of the international criminal courts investigation against him
5329296 turkey should also convey a clear message that khartoum must not respond to the investigation with retaliation against civilians peacekeepers or humanitarian workers

5329641 the mayor is lucky hes not negotiating with the taxpayers
5329642 we talked to some informal focus groups and they all thought we should be no 2 in the state for pay
5329643 mayor chris coleman is punishing the police federation for not endorsing him but the result is suburbs will be able to hire st paul cops and get their training and experience for free
5329644 the city has made a fair and generous offer to the police federation of a nearly 10 percent salary increase over three years when all forms of compensation are taken into account i e sick leave vacation severance etc our officers rank in the top 10

5329647 for them to actually make that announcement was huge i thought that was one of the biggest statements that ea has made in years and it just went over peoples heads
5329648 its a whole different world you enter when you get into free to play its like the industry that weve all been missing and the second thing weve been missing is the idea of letting people pay what they want
5329649 ive made so many games and we never ever had the idea that people would pay more than the price of the game for the game no one would pay over 60 if its a 60 game on our 2moons game youve got people that spend 3 000 happily and if we had more stuff for them to buy they would buy it

5329652 deliberately and courageously exposed himself to enemy fire in order to prevent the enemy from assaulting through the kill zone and overwhelming his convoy
5329653 his selfless actions prevented the enemy from turning the tide of the battle and undoubtedly saved the lives of his soldiers
5329654 when you first get into the music business youre excited to be there you want to make records that everybodys loving but after youve got years in the game you wanna give people the real side of you show people some character
5329655 life is good theres yachts theres nice cars theres movie roles we overcame but in the middle of all that you cant forget about the ones that didnt make it with us life is good but that still doesnt erase all the horror out here
5329656 unvaried by cactus or tree unstirred by lizard or coyote undimpled by even a shadow
5329657 the baby was restless he was a contrary one you could tell and as soon as she wanted to rest he started practicing his moves it was like he was training for some sort of dance off in there some sort of cross country runningish thing and as soon as she was awake he was as still as the dead
5329658 shed never fainted in her life god the whole thing had been so pregnant of her
5329659 to the amateur like susannah a desert is an abstraction a metaphor a hollywood soundstage for hatchet faced cowpokes and horses in symbolic colors a cartoon involving a parched rider on a knobby kneed horse and palm treed mirages that rise shimmering from the sand but here at the thunder lodge there was a different kind of desperateness the earth wore a colorless skin of dust rashy with outcroppings of low lying dead looking shrubs
5329660 hey aaron can i go upstairs to grab a magazine and book to read
5329661 for those of who accept the bible as gods word there are five issues that are non negotiable
5329662 to me theyre not even debatable because gods word is clear on these issues
5329663 there can be multiple opinions among bible believing christians when it comes to debatable issues such as the economy social programs social security and the war in
5329664 i think it was for this very moment that we had the last election
5329665 its the reason i jumped in and mobilized you know our network because its all about the court
5329666 and i think for all of the reasons already mentioned harriets a great choice i mean shes a great person shes a great woman shes a great christian shes a great thinker and i just throw my support behind her

5329674 id ask them to tell me personal recollections once they started rolling i wouldnt interrupt

5329676 we have apologised and they the group have told me they accept the apology
5329677 because of protests from some in the serbian muslim community
5329678 when i learned only a few days ago that my book was being published in serbia i was impressed beobook a small publishing house in a country that had seen much strife was more courageous it seemed than random house one of the biggest publishers in the world
5329679 i was saddened on august 16 to hear that beobook publisher aleksandar jasic had halted publication of the jewel of medina because of protests from some in the serbian muslim community and to be honest i was confused did these muslims after reading my book really think i had degraded muhammad and aisha id thought i was doing the opposite my intentions were to celebrate these great historical figures while dispelling misunderstandings about islam

5329691 lewiss driver was cleaning the wing mirrors when two men ran up to the open boot hed just finished loading and pinched a rucksack and a leather hold all
5329692 the one thief carrying the rucksack dropped it as the bodyguards pursued him but the other guy with the smaller piece of luggage kept hold of his
5329693 i overheard one of the security men saying it had lewiss ipod inside it with all his music on
5329694 in an independent survey conducted in may 2008 by probe research inc canadians said they are not choosing bottled water over municipal tap water

5329701 the evidence showed khan was a committed and active supporter of al qaida ideology he had extensive amounts of the sort of information that a terrorist would need and use and the international contacts to pass it on
5329702 the prosecution case was that aabid khan was the link between sultan muhammed and hammaad khan police found the three had computer files and discs books documents and videos as the tools of their trade terrorism
5329703 there were not only items of propaganda but practical guides on making explosives and poisons and a particularly chilling step by step video guide of how to make a suicide vest
5329704 aabid khan was very much the mr fix it of the group
5329705 when looking at the evidence against hammaad munshi i was satisfied there was enough for a case to go to court and that it was in the public interest despite his young age
5329706 the prosecution told the jury of his dedication to the cause of al qaida and of discussions with aabid khan which included how he could travel abroad and smuggle a sword with him
5329707 while a marked slowdown in activity is likely over the next 18 months even if interest rates are cut when inflation peaks the correct policy decisions are still needed to ward off the threats of a serious and prolonged recession
5329708 the longer the mpc waits before cutting rates the bigger the danger that the economic situation would deteriorate
5329709 our view is that the threats to growth are more serious and more immediate than the risks of higher inflation
5329710 our central scenario envisages that the uk bank rate would be cut to 4
5329711 a lot has been printed and said over recent days about the online business activities of the two victims however we must not lose sight of the fact that they are just that victims
5329712 this young couple were killed at the home they shared in newcastle thousands of miles from their families and the country of their birth
5329713 they leave behind distraught families and uncomprehending friends and no amount of speculation concerning their online activities should be allowed to obscure the fact that this was a happy young couple who had their futures snatched away from them
5329714 so important that people get involved and believe that things can change
5329715 the tragic deaths of conor james black in manchester and nilanthan murddi in croydon show why the work of the action programme is so important
5329716 if you carry a knife you are now more likely to get caught more likely to be prosecuted and more likely to go to prison if found guilty
5329717 knife crime is a complex issue which we all need to work together to solve enforcement action is only one part of the solution i am pleased that later today the england football team will be supporting our marketing campaign it doesnt have to happen urging young people not to carry knives
5329718 i want to reinforce our commitment to tackling knives and getting them off our streets working with the police local authorities the health service and partners like the fa well do all we can to protect young people their families and communities from the fear and grief of knife crime
5329719 its been the most hostile environment that ive been in in my life
5329720 three separate principals asked this coach to leave their schools
5329721 the doe is currently working with several harlem schools to find a home for a football team in the community
5329722 the men and women who have joined our council are seasoned experts from around the state and across the nation facing deteriorating economic times and declining revenues now more than ever we need creative ideas and solutions i can think of no better collective group to help steer us back to fiscal health and i look forward to hearing their recommendations

5329727 the short version of the story is they didnt want to quit their partying
5329728 if you put this in the class of wedding receptions gone bad i guess this would take the cake
5329729 andy got angry and started yelling what are you doing
5329730 the crowd was trying to hold back the groom from mouthing off more but finally he broke free and they had to take him down
5329731 he was heading for the officers then the bride moved in and tried to interfere
5329732 imagine the kids and grandma seeing the bride and groom getting tasered on the floor
5329733 over geologic time the eruptions have clearly moved up and down the lengths of the tiger stripes
5329734 as i have done nothing wrong in connection with any of the matters that are the subject of the inquiry i expect to be exonerated

5329736 there has been a lot of speculation i want to say categorically we are not pursuing hummer
5329737 i believe that if sen mccain chooses a pro abortion running mate he will give the election to sen obama
5329738 its not an issue of whether most evangelicals are going to vote for john mccain its an issue of intensity
5329739 i think the selection of an unabashed pro life pro family candidate is going to be critical
5329740 there comes a time when we cant really just cooperate
5329741 what the georgian authorities did exceeded human understanding their actions cannot be explained and moreover must not go unpunished
5329742 we take a hard line on security throughout the region in assuring peace and stability in south ossetia

5329745 what the georgian authorities did exceeded human understanding their actions cannot be explained and moreover must not go unpunished
5329746 we take a hard line on security throughout the region in assuring peace and stability in south ossetia
5329747 if police officers no longer see themselves as engaged in protecting their communities from criminals and instead as domestic intelligence agents working on behalf of the cia they will be encouraged to collect more information it turns police officers into spies on behalf of the federal government
5329748 my friends we have reached a crisis the first probably serious crisis internationally since the end of the cold war this is an act of aggression
5329749 with its actions in recent days russia has damaged its credibility and its relations with the nations of the free world bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the twenty first century

5329761 this project seeks to flood 5 910 hectares affecting conservation tourism interests and aysens regional development strategy in order to transport this energy the company needs to install a power transmission line 2 300 kilometers long which would cross over the country with 6 000 pylons that would demand the clearing of a 70 meters broad strip
5329762 the project has been designed minimizing its effects on the environment and incorporating mitigation from the beginning
5329763 many consumer products contain phthalates among these products are vinyl flooring adhesives detergents lubricating oils solvents automotive plastics plastic clothing such as raincoats and personal care products such as soap shampoo deodorants fragrances hair spray nail polish and some medical pharmaceuticals phthalates are widely used in flexible polyvinyl chloride plastics such as plastic bags garden hoses inflatable recreational toys blood storage bags intravenous medical tubing and childrens toys
5329764 generally phthalates are metabolized and excreted quickly and do not metabolize in the body
5329765 phthalates have been found in indoor air and dust and in human blood urine and breast milk levels are highest in woman and children ages 6 11 african americans have been shown to have higher phthalate levels than whites

5329771 we are honored that lilly ledbetter will address the democratic convention
5329772 the fact that women are paid less than their male coworkers for doing the same job is unacceptable in the 21st century and counter to both the progress weve made and our shared values as americans lilly ledbetters case before the supreme court has once again awakened the nation to this discrimination and its time we join together to right this wrong and pay women equal pay for equal work
5329773 ninety years after survivors encountered the 1918 pandemic influenza virus we collected antibody producing b cells from them and successfully isolated b cells that produce antibodies that block the viral infection
5329774 the antibodies produced by these cells demonstrated remarkable power to block 1918 flu virus infection in mice proving that even nine decades after infection with this virus survivors retain protection from it
5329775 our findings show that survivors of the pandemic have highly effective virus neutralising antibodies to this powerful virus and humans can sustain circulating b memory cells to viruses for up to nine decades after exposure
5329776 it will make it such a heightened experience for the audience and for us to cast a real life soldier a veteran and bring him into our created drama

5329788 its phenomenal on sunday i was pretty down after the first couple of rounds i was mainly disappointed because i didnt want to let these guys down i was on the back foot a bit because it was a tough day the day before
5329789 so far it hasnt been a distraction because its been through a process
5329790 its a chance to listen to haroon lorgat about what the situation is so all the players a fully informed knowing that the board are then going to meet on tuesday and make a decision on whether were going or not
5329791 we want to listen to what haroon has to say the key being that if an england team is going there its got to be safe for them to go otherwise were not going to go
5329792 if you ever have any slight discoloration please go to your dermatologist or your doctor and get it checked out as soon as possible
5329793 youll want to do it monthly less frequent ly and youll forget to do it
5329794 have a good mirror or a good friend or partner able to check your back
5329795 look for any skin blemish that is not normal for you
5329796 use your first three fingers and go in a circular motion from the nipple around it doesnt matter how you do it just be consistent
5329797 you can also do up and down and up and down then look in the mirror sometimes the nipple might retract or you could see dimpling theres one cancer inflammatory breast cancer that can show up like a rash check under armpits with the pads of your fingers for lymph checks
5329798 thats an uncomfortable thing to do those self exams youre just starting to know your body but a good place is the shower and probably monthly to make the habit pain is rarely a symptom its usually just a lump
5329799 unless we view screening in the context of prevention and diet and exercise then the screening opens a conversation when screening results are viewed in context of the big picture its more helpful
5329800 see a doctor for blood testing so youll get ideas about what to do with the results
5329801 but we are happy with the way we played each game and our performance on the field
5329802 we worked hard to make sure we were in the olympics
5329803 our goal was to be on the podium but we missed out on points to make that happen
5329804 its disappointing and frustrating but we are going to come out no matter what position we are fighting for and we are going to play our hardest
5329805 whatever comes of all that ill continue to have peace
5329806 we know that all things work together for good to them that love god to them that are called according to his purpose
5329807 as you know the proposal for a state of the art veterans facility at fitzsimons was a centerpiece of the vas capital construction plan under the capital asset realignment for enhanced services cares process
5329808 in april 2008 the va proposed a new plan that would considerably alter the original project objective
5329809 we have concluded that the best way forward is to continue with a modified version of the original comprehensive stand alone hospital concept as outlined by the va through the cares process
5329810 in the vas own internal planning documents several cost saving measures are proposed for the cares recommended stand alone hospital concept
5329811 with gas near 4 00 a gallon diesel at 5 00 a gallon and a stagnant economy we have to get beyond the gridlock in washington take emergency action to bring gas prices under control and deliver real solutions that help us reduce our dependence on foreign oil
5329812 to help ease the supply pinch at this critical moment for our economy i renew my call for the president to immediately release 70 million barrels of oil from the strategic petroleum reserve presidents have done this in similar times of crisis and it has proven to be an effective tool in addition we need to take regulatory and legislative action to curb excess speculation in the oil markets which experts say is contributing to a significant portion of todays high oil prices and encourage simple conservation measures
5329813 i have supported and continue to support responsible development of our domestic oil and gas supplies including offshore but the truth is that a drill only approach wont bring down gas prices wont break our dependence on foreign oil and is incomplete
5329814 i am hopeful that the efforts of the gang of 10 will help us get beyond this gridlock by offering a chance to build on a bipartisan proposal that can help expand production including in areas of the gulf of mexico build our clean energy economy and give consumers the choices they should have at the filling station
5329815 there are ways to strengthen this bill including through the addition of the renewable energy tax incentives that we have been fighting so hard to pass in the senate
5329816 you gotta understand that for most of its existence atlantic city largely had a monopoly on east coast casinos in that earlier era you did not have to work particularly hard to operate at close to capacity the customers were there because they really couldnt go anywhere else
5329817 if it aint broken dont fix it when we came in we just knew there could be more
5329818 i know for a fact that were hurting atlantic city because a lot of their high rollers are coming here and they love it here because theyre minutes away

5329822 each year the u s treasury departments office of foreign assets control collects millions of dollars in penalties from american corporations who have violated these sanctions from oil companies banks food and beverage companies and entertainment companies
5329823 no executive of any such corporation has faced criminal charges individuals businesses and organizations that have openly defied the sanctions have faced only fines criminal prosecutions have only been made against muslims and people of middle eastern origin accused of violating these economic sanctions and unlike those corporations there was no profit motive in dr dhafirs case
5329824 every person charged with a crime in the us deserves and is entitled to fair and equal treatment under the law
5329825 i think whoever gets the nod the boys will get right behind him
5329826 whether they are leading us from the front there are five or six leaders in the team there are captains all over the pitch
5329827 theres not much to choose between those two terry and ferdinand steven gerrard frank lampard gareth barry ashley cole there are players there who have captained sides
5329828 weve got a great team spirit and were building on every trip
5329829 i think its important that players motivate themselves these days

5329841 jen will never kiss and tell but its she who ended the relationship
5329842 mayers childish behavior only confirms she was right to dump him now hes acting like a spoiled child expect jen to behave like a lady
5329843 i ended a relationship to be alone because i dont want to waste somebodys time if somethings not right
5329844 he tips them off he loves the attention jen didnt want to believe it was happening but it was and she has no tolerance for that
5329845 cobwebs come flying out of mayers wallet when he opens it john liked living like a movie star when he was with her jen would never say anything but you could tell it irritated her

5329849 wants a much tougher punishment for musharraf which the pakistan peoples party is trying to avoid
5329850 there is also continuing disagreement over the war on terror and how to pursue it especially with the militant factions expanding in pakistan
5329851 so the first dispute is going to be between the coalition partners the second dispute is really going to be between the army and the civilian government
5329852 the army will want to have a say in all these issues thirdly it will be very important to see that the public demand that the government become more effective is met by the government how the government manages to achieve that we dont yet know
5329853 now the american pressure on the civilian government to get tough with the taliban and with terrorists is going to be much harsher much sharper
5329854 and the american government is going to expect that its support to the civilian government in getting rid of musharraf is now rewarded by a more firm policy by the civilian government toward the extremists and that the army and the civilian government work much more closely together but there is serious doubt if that is really going to be achievable in the short term
5329855 afghanistan is also an area where both the army and the civilian government dont see eye to eye
5329856 the army is very defensive of the isi while the civilian government is very critical of the isi so again on both these fronts its going to be a very long haul before the army and the civilian government really come together and work together

5329861 we have now spoken to several witnesses and built up a good description of the suspect
5329862 i would urge local people to read it carefully and think about anyone they know who fits the description given that the suspect returned approximately 30 minutes after the exchange of words at the traffic lights it is highly likely he lives locally

5329866 it is with great sorrow that we must announce this brave soldiers death as we offer our sympathies to this soldiers loved ones
5329867 we have the utmost respect and admiration for the isaf troops who operate in this challenging environment
5329868 with less than three months to go before the election a lot of people are still trying to square sen obamas varying positions on the surge in iraq first he opposed the surge and confidently predicted that it would fail then he tried to prevent funding for the troops who carried out the surge
5329869 not content to merely predict failure in iraq my opponent tried to legislate failure
5329870 it is hard to understand how sen mccain can at once proclaim his support for the sovereign government of iraq and then stubbornly defy their expressed support for a timeline to remove our combat brigades from their country
5329871 john mccain is intent on spending 10 billion a month on an open ended war while barack obama thinks we should bring this war to a responsible end and invest in our pressing needs here at home
5329872 the lasting advantage of a peaceful and democratic ally in the heart of the middle east could still be squandered by hasty withdrawal and arbitrary timelines and this is one of many problems in the shifting positions of my opponent sen obama
5329873 even in retrospect he would choose the path of retreat and failure for america over the path of success and victory
5329874 in short both candidates in this election pledge to end this war and bring our troops home
5329875 the great difference is that i intend to win it first
5329876 we will continue to work with the pakistani government and political leaders and urge them to redouble their focus on pakistans future and its most urgent needs including stemming the growth of extremism addressing food and energy shortages and improving economic stability
5329877 the united states will help with these efforts to see pakistan reach its goal of becoming a stable prosperous democratic modern muslim nation
5329878 the united states supported the transition to democratic government in pakistan and respects the results of the election we believe that respect for the democratic and constitutional processes in that country is fundamental to pakistans future and its fight against terrorism
5329879 i dont want to be the vice president i am not going to be the nominee
5329880 the last time i checked the vice president is not an independent voice he echoes the position of the president of the united states
5329881 if youre unwilling or unable to do that then i think you should defer to someone else
5329882 i hate to disappoint you but nothing to report today
5329883 i dont have anything for you on the vice presidential front

5329885 by rolling out up to date interactive crime maps we can better inform people about crime problems in their area and enable them to have much more of a say in what their local police focus on this will help increase public confidence in the police and make communities safer

5329887 one of the worlds most committed partners in the war against terrorism and extremism
5329888 i hope he intends to honor the pledge this time
5329889 the word of the russian president needs to be upheld by his forces or people are going to begin to wonder if russia can be trusted
5329890 my own view is that the russians will probably stall and perhaps take more time than anybody would like i think we just need to keep the pressure and ensure that they abide by the agreement that theyve signed and do so in a timely way
5329891 the answer would be as soon as we have guarantees for peace and security there
5329892 i would say that its very much still on the table
5329893 russia will pay a price we will look seriously with our allies and bilaterally at the consequences of this russian action for russian integration

5329917 yes dan radcliffe does have dyspraxia this is something he has never hidden thankfully his condition is very mild and at worst manifests itself in an inability to ties his shoe laces and bad handwriting
5329918 im a big fan of the whole harry potter series and i am surprised daniel radcliffe suffers from dyspraxia in the majority of children and young people with dyspraxia we cannot find the cause so the basic treatment is occupational therapy teaching them to make a plan for their actions and rehearse their movements he clearly suffers from a mild form but the fact he shows no sign of it at all is a great tribute to his acting skills and makes him a role model for other people with this condition
5329919 my business partner terry fraley and i are house flippers with too much time on our hands lately we are big
5329920 ive gotten a lot of questions the last few weeks asking if obama is the antichrist
5329921 i tell everyone that i dont think the antichrist will come out of politics especially american politics
5329922 i can see by the language he uses why people think he could be the antichrist
5329923 but from my reading of scripture he doesnt meet the criteria there is no indication in the bible that the antichrist will be an american
5329924 if even the people who created the character nicolae carpathia dont see the comparisons as warranted then perhaps this is overblown

5329968 it is very pleasing to know that musharraf is no more
5329969 he even tried to deceive the nation in his last address he was boasting about economic progress when life for people like us has become a hell
5329970 i pray the government stops this downward slide and takes the country out of this crisis
5329971 the crimes of musharraf against the nation against the judiciary against democracy and against rule of law in the country cannot be forgiven by any party or individual

5329978 georgia will survive but russia has lost its credibility in the eyes of the world
5329979 i think there needs to be a strong unified response to russia to send the message that this kind of behavior characteristic of the soviet period has no place in the 21st century
5329980 it has been only 10 days since you faced a cowardly aggression
