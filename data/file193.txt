1930005 and when aaron and his sons have finished covering the sanctuary and all the furnishings of the sanctuary as the camp sets out after that the sons of kohath shall come to carry these but they must not touch the holy things lest they die these are the things of the tent of meeting that the sons of kohath are to carry
1930006 the lord spoke to moses and aaron saying let not the tribe of the clans of the kohathites be destroyed from among the levites but deal thus with them that they may live and not die when they come near to the most holy things aaron and his sons shall go in and appoint them each to his task and to his burden but they shall not go in to look on the holy things even for a moment lest they die
1930007 and the lord spoke to moses saying speak to the people of israel and say to them when either a man or a woman makes a special vow the vow of a nazirite
1930008 you shall not make idols for yourselves or erect an image or pillar and you shall not set up a figured stone in your land to bow down to it for i am the lord your god you shall keep my sabbaths and reverence my sanctuary i am the lord if you walk in my statutes and observe my commandments and do them then i will give you your rains in their season and the land shall yield its increase and the trees of the field shall yield their fruit your threshing shall last to the time of the grape harvest and the grape harvest shall last to the time for sowing and you shall eat your bread to the full and dwell in your land securely i will give peace in the land and you shall lie down and none shall make you afraid and i will remove harmful beasts from the land and the sword shall not go through your land you shall chase your enemies and they shall fall before you by the sword five of you shall chase a hundred and a hundred of you shall chase ten thousand and your enemies shall fall before you by the sword i will turn to you and make you fruitful and multiply you and will confirm my covenant with you you shall eat old store long kept and you shall clear out the old to make way for the new i will make my dwelling among you and my soul shall not abhor you and i will walk among you and will be your god and you shall be my people i am the lord your god who brought you out of the land of egypt that you should not be their slaves and i have broken the bars of your yoke and made you walk erect
1930009 and if by this discipline you are not turned to me but walk contrary to me then i also will walk contrary to you and i myself will strike you sevenfold for your sins
1930010 but if they confess their iniquity and the iniquity of their fathers in their treachery that they committed against me and also in walking contrary to me so that i walked contrary to them and brought them into the land of their enemies if then their uncircumcised heart is humbled and they make amends for their iniquity then i will remember my covenant with jacob and i will remember my covenant with isaac and my covenant with abraham and i will remember the land
1930011 and moses said this is the thing that the lord commanded you to do that the glory of the lord may appear to you
1930012 among those who are near me i will be sanctified and before all the people i will be glorified
1930013 and the lord spoke to aaron saying drink no wine or strong drink you or your sons with you when you go into the tent of meeting lest you die it shall be a statute forever throughout your generations
1930014 you are to distinguish between the holy and the common and between the unclean and the clean and you are to teach the people of israel all the statutes that the lord has spoken to them by moses
1930015 this is the law about beast and bird and every living creature that moves through the waters and every creature that swarms on the ground to make a distinction between the unclean and the clean and between the living creature that may be eaten and the living creature that may not be eaten
1930016 the lord spoke to moses saying speak to the people of israel saying
1930017 the leprous person who has the disease shall wear torn clothes and let the hair of his head hang loose and he shall cover his upper lip and cry out unclean unclean he shall remain unclean as long as he has the disease he is unclean he shall live alone his dwelling shall be outside the camp
1930018 this is the law for any case of leprous disease for an itch for leprous disease in a garment or in a house and for a swelling or an eruption or a spot to show when it is unclean and when it is clean this is the law for leprous disease
1930019 make sure you wear your scarf are you warm enough
1930020 the lord spoke to moses saying if anyone sins and commits a breach of faith against the lord by deceiving his neighbor in a matter of deposit or security or through robbery or if he has oppressed his neighbor or has found something lost and lied about it swearing falsely in any of all the things that people do and sin thereby if he has sinned and has realized his guilt and will restore what he took by robbery or what he got by oppression or the deposit that was committed to him or the lost thing that he found or anything about which he has sworn falsely he shall restore it in full and shall add a fifth to it and give it to him to whom it belongs on the day he realizes his guilt
1930021 the grain offering is a thing most holy like the sin offering and the guilt offering every male among the children of aaron may eat of it as decreed forever throughout your generations from the lords food offerings whatever touches them shall become holy
1930022 as has been done today the lord has commanded to be done to make atonement for you at the entrance of the tent of meeting you shall remain day and night for seven days performing what the lord has charged so that you do not die for so i have been commanded and aaron and his sons did all the things that the lord commanded by moses
1930023 aaron and his sons laid their hands on the head
1930024 now the whole earth had one language and the same words
1930025 now the lord said to abram go from your country and your kindred and your fathers house to the land that i will show you and i will make of you a great nation and i will bless you and make your name great so that you will be a blessing i will bless those who bless you and him who dishonors you i will curse and in you all the families of the earth shall be blessed so abram went as the lord had told him
1930026 say you are my sister that it may go well with me because of you and that my life may be spared for your sake
1930027 but the lord afflicted pharaoh and his house with great plagues because of sarai abrams wife
1930028 then you shall take the anointing oil and anoint the tabernacle and all that is in it and consecrate it and all its furniture so that it may become holy you shall also anoint the altar of burnt offering and all its utensils and consecrate the altar so that the altar may become most holy
1930029 then the cloud covered the tent of meeting and the glory of the lord filled the tabernacle
1930030 if his offering is a burnt offering from the herd he shall offer a male without blemish he shall bring it to the entrance of the tent of meeting that he may be accepted before the lord he shall lay his hand on the head of the burnt offering and it shall be accepted for him to make atonement for him
1930031 but the rest of the grain offering shall be for aaron and his sons it is a most holy part of the lords food offerings

1930039 if anyone of the common people sins unintentionally in doing any one of the things that by the lords commandments ought not to be done and realizes his guilt or the sin which he has committed is made known to him he shall bring for his offering a goat a female without blemish for his sin which he has committed
1930040 if anyone sins doing any of the things that by the lords commandments ought not to be done though he did not know it then realizes his guilt he shall bear his iniquity he shall bring to the priest a ram without blemish out of the flock or its equivalent for a guilt offering and the priest shall make atonement for him for the mistake that he made unintentionally and he shall be forgiven it is a guilt offering he has indeed incurred guilt before the lord
1930041 if anyone sins in that he hears a public adjuration to testify and though he is a witness whether he has seen or come to know the matter yet does not speak he shall bear his iniquity
1930042 if anyone touches an unclean thing and it is hidden from him
1930043 if anyone utters with his lips a rash oath to do evil or to do good any sort of rash oath that people swear
1930044 when he realizes his guilt in any of these and confesses the sin he has committed he shall bring to the lord as his compensation for the sin that he has committed a female from the flock a lamb or a goat for a sin offering and the priest shall make atonement for him for his sin

1930084 in tegenstelling tot voor de invoering van het rookverbod marcheren rokers zes zeven keer per dag naar buiten hierdoor zijn medewerkers nauwelijks nog te controleren op het meenemen van goederen uit het bedrijf
1930085 voorheen volstond de visitatiecontrole bij vertrek na werktijd maar nu er veel vaker heen en weer wordt gelopen moeten bedrijven bij extra beveiligingspersoneel inhuren om bij de uitgangen het personeel goed te kunnen controleren in de praktijk doen bedrijven dat niet omdat ze met het inzetten van extra mensen op kosten worden gejaagd

1930145 shes italian and shes got a very sexy voice rather bell like
1930146 hey barbara i didnt know you were here what uh what are you doing here
1930147 so she has a sexy voice i didnt realize you had noticed
1930148 besides you have nothing to worry about he still loves you right bruce
1930149 so when will you and gwen meet this miss della scalla
1930150 ill be there perhaps i will allow henderson take a day off tomorrow and i might as well act as sous chef for the lunch crowd while im at it
1930151 dont any of you find it strange that this woman pops up to take over dewolfe manns job just five days after his death
1930152 thank goodness someone is thinking around here i mean cmon people this woman suddenly pops up to replace mann and she also takes over the story about the golden horn
1930153 i thought that jason dean was against the idea of a story on the golden horn and that it was phoebe halliwell who convinced him to convince him now that there is a new writer aboard why is he willing to continue with the story why not kill it
1930154 perhaps jason is more open to the idea granted he and livy had a messy breakup but im certain that he has put the past behind him now that hes dating phoebe
1930155 so what are you saying dad that is della scalla woman is trouble i mean i dont see how considering it was jason who probably hired her
1930156 maybe im imagining things its just something doesnt feel right about this whole matter
1930157 i heartily agree maybe you shouldnt do this interview bruce or maybe you should let your mother take care of it
1930158 this is getting ridiculous all i did was comment on her voice and youre acting like a jealous shrew stop it will you
1930159 wolfie dewolfe mann jason has hired someone to take his place some italian lady named portia something
1930160 and both jason and okeefe hired her right on the spot
1930161 yeah but i spent most of the day working on that column because you guys had to keep the previous owner safe
1930162 thats when elise realized i was right for the job jason and okeefe had hired this woman not long after meeting her
1930163 and thats your reason for being suspicious phoebe for all you know this woman probably has a reputation for being a top food critic or do you know who the top food critics are
1930164 he was at the office today with wolfies sister deborah mann
1930165 well they were there to clean out wolfies personal belongings and they also met this portia woman needless to say cole is very suspicious he wants me to keep an eye on her
1930166 id say that was a good reason to keep an eye on this portia
1930167 precisely maybe ill ask around the other newspapers in the city find out if anyone has ever heard of her
1930168 hi i uh i dropped by to uh i was hoping
1930169 hoping to see you i meant to call earlier but ive been busy
1930170 and i was also wondering if you were available for dinner tomorrow night at the golden horn
1930171 ill see what i can do about that coffee as for dinner
1930172 you remember paul dont you cole he only dropped by for some coffee what are
1930173 oh oh god i forgot we were supposed to do exercises this evening
1930174 she has two telekinesis and pyrokinesis a fire power the latter carries quite a punch
1930175 its not a demonic power if thats what you think but it is quite strong very strong and since it involves fire i need coles help in teaching me how to control it better
1930176 oh well i guess since it involves fire a demon would be the best person to help you control it
1930177 especially since he would have much experience dealing with fire
1930178 really i knew at least three daemons with the same power
1930179 could i get a rain check on the practice session perhaps we could meet on wednesday
1930180 ill be having dinner with a client on wednesday evening how about tomorrow
1930181 well so much for that as for that practice im sure that we can postpone until next monday
1930182 ill be out of town that day next monday will be fine
1930183 did you know that the bay mirror had hired someone to replace dewolfe mann
1930184 what i mean no no i didnt know when did you find out
1930185 this morning i was at their office with deborah mann to help her collect her brothers belongings
1930186 well i thought we would be practicing this evening especially since i have been busy all day with a job
1930187 and i suppose youve never heard of that wonderful little invention called the telephone
1930188 you know what never mind i dont suppose you know the name of this newcomer

1930190 i dont know who am i to judge i hardly know the man
1930191 dont try to use the other machines they all belong to the same union

1930209 he will not be in the general population hell have his own cell and no direct contact with other inmates
1930210 its not serious to him that hes a criminal defendant this court should be outraged
1930211 ive been living in an incredible state of pressure and scrutiny
1930212 we got the deal back on track it wasnt a spur of the moment willy nilly i can frolic in canada
1930213 i think its the most extreme measure he can take
1930214 judge giles treated this defendant as any other defendant would have been treated
1930215 because of the separate legal process under way before the governor the governor will not offer any reaction to ongoing criminal matters involving the mayor
1930216 we strongly believe societies which allow the free expression of ideas tend to be the most prosperous and the most peaceful
1930217 we firmly oppose any words or acts that interfere in other countries internal affairs using human rights and religion and other issues
1930218 chinese citizens have freedom of religion these are indisputable facts

1930228 if there is not an explanation thats satisfactory acceptable and meets high moral standards the answer is no he would not be a prime candidate to make a major address to the convention

1930232 consider how liberal government authorities like mayor gavin newsom have corrupted the men in blue by stipulating that police not prosecute public nudity and indecency at homosexual festivals
1930233 what honor can there be in protecting the public practice of heinous perversions and nudity in the citys streets the shame of pandering politicians is transferred to the cops who were intended to be guardians of the law and public order

1930252 that which is beyond never rises before the mind of a thoughtless child deluded by the folly of riches this world exists the other does not thinking thus they come again and again under my power to understand this truth is very difficult many even hearing it continually do not understand it for the speaker must be wonderful so must be the hearer the teacher must be wonderful so must be the taught neither is the mind to be disturbed by vain arguments for it is no more a question of argument it is a question of fact

1930262 defendants also presented evidence at trial suggesting gaillard exaggerated his injuries falsified income tax returns and otherwise fabricated his lost income to inflate his damages
1930263 when gaillard presented evidence to suggest he suffered a loss of income he opened the door for defendants to produce evidence to it then cited to one of its previous rulings in which it had found that tax returns may be treated as the eighth circuit then concluded that
1930264 the district court properly found the tax returns were admissible as impeachment evidence under
1930265 specific instances of the conduct of a witness for the purpose of attacking or supporting the witness character for truthfulness may not be proved by extrinsic evidence they may however in the discretion of the court if probative of truthfulness or untruthfulness be inquired into on cross examination of the witness 1 concerning the witness character for truthfulness or untruthfulness or 2 concerning the character for truthfulness or untruthfulness of another witness as to which character the witness being cross examined has testified
1930266 if i were to meet a priest and an angel i should salute the priest before i saluted the angel the latter is the friend of god but the priest holds his place when people wish to destroy religion they begin by attacking the priest
1930267 let all then who would live in christ flock to their priests by them they will be supplied with the comforts and food of the spiritual life from them they will procure the medicine of salvation assuring their cure and happy recovery from the fatal sickness of their sins the priest finally will bless their homes consecrate their families and help them as they breathe their last across the threshold of eternal happiness

1930278 i have one question for mr karzai if this was your little girl what would you do
1930279 these criminals are never brought to justice because police and government authorities are either involved or they cant handle the crimes
1930280 with criminals and warlords in the political scene we cannot expect justice to be served
1930281 in many cases of violence against children there is a sense of impunity people continue to violate childrens rights without any sense of feeling that they will be held accountable
1930282 i cant think of any country in the world in which children suffer more than in afghanistan
1930283 in all our meetings with children it takes a lot of time to make them smile that to me shows that there is not happiness in their hearts
1930284 we would seek that all athletes make no effort to demonstrate or use any form of propaganda particularly on the podium and certainly in the village

1930298 they had even intensively questioned his adopted children andrew and amanda now both 24 with the authorities telling his son that he might be able to collect the 2
1930299 as the investigation wore on some colleagues thought the fbis methods were increasingly coercive as the agency tried to turn army scientists against one another and reinterviewed family members
1930300 one former colleague dr w russell byrne said the agents pressed dr ivins daughter repeatedly to acknowledge that her father was involved in the attacks
1930301 there is concern that they could be used in places where detainees are enclosed in extremely hot conditions
1930302 typically prisoners are isolated for no more than 12 hours
1930303 someone in a segregation box is actually observed more than those anywhere else
1930304 since the abuses at abu ghraib the us has improved conditions for the 20 000 detainees it holds
1930305 the us hopes to continue releasing prisoners recently some 20 foreign fighters were sent back to egypt and saudi arabia and thousands of iraqis have been set free
1930306 we are able to capture threats to the iraqi government and the population detain them rehabilitate them and 99 times out of 100 release them
1930307 economic activity expanded in the second quarter partly reflecting growth in consumer spending and exports
1930308 if the now deceased ivins really was the culprit behind the attacks
1930309 then that means that the anthrax came from a u s government lab sent by a top u s army scientist at ft detrick without resort to any speculation or inferences at all it is hard to overstate the significance of that fact from the beginning there was a clear intent on the part of the anthrax attacker to create a link between the anthrax attacks and both islamic radicals and the 9 11 attacks
1930310 much more important than the general attempt to link the anthrax to islamic terrorists there was a specific intent indispensably aided by abc news to link the anthrax attacks to iraq and saddam hussein
1930311 that means that abc news four well placed and separate sources fed them information that was completely false
1930312 the same government lab where the anthrax attacks themselves came from was the same place where the false reports originated that blamed those attacks on iraq surely the question of who generated those false iraq anthrax reports is one of the most significant and explosive stories of the last decade
1930313 it has been more than a year since the housing market went on a tumultuous skid yet the hangover from bad lending practices and tighter credit has housings two primary sponsors fannie mae and freddie mac still unable to step in and fully provide support
1930314 given the likelihood of a prolonged housing slump and the uncertainty of government support investors should remain extremely cautious of lenders like freddie mac or fannie mae
1930315 while we expect continued housing and economic weakness will affect our overall performance this year we continue to maintain a surplus over all regulatory capital requirements
1930316 we remain committed to raising 5 5 billion dollars of new capital and will evaluate raising capital beyond this amount depending on our needs and as market conditions mandate
1930317 in the absence to a positive response to the generous offer that we provided for our incentives package we think that the allies will have no choice but to take further measures that would be punitive given that we dont have a decent and responsive statement from the iranians
1930318 i think that the iranians have long stalled on responding to the allies so i think the most important thing we can do is let the political directors have their conference call and decide on their next step
1930319 the phone talks today will be to decide on a common reponse there is the possibility of trying to send the matter back to the security council but there is always the problem of persuading china and russia
1930320 if we are not going to receive a clear response a clear message from them we are going to have no choice but to pursue additional measures
1930321 say there will be a response but that clarification is needed on certain points of the offer
1930322 theyve hit the ball back we must analyse whether its just another way to gain time or if its serious
1930323 the message delivered today is not irans response to the six countries
1930324 if we are not going to receive a clear response a clear message from them we are going to have no choice but to pursue additional measures
1930325 given the equipment our armed forces have an indefinite blockade of the strait of hormuz would be very easy
1930326 many of the techniques used would be intolerable in a democratic society even if all of the targets had been involved in violent activity but cointelpro went far beyond that
1930327 the bureau conducted a sophisticated vigilante operation aimed squarely at preventing the exercise of first amendment rights of speech and association on the theory that preventing the growth of dangerous groups and the propagation of dangerous ideas would protect the national security and deter violence
1930328 o ur time our energy should be spent in educating agitating organizing our fellow citizens in the workplace in the neighborhood in the schools our objective should be to build painstakingly patiently but energetically a movement that when it reaches a certain critical mass would shake whoever is in the white house in congress into changing national policy on matters of war and social justice
1930329 true religion will not let us fall asleep in the comfort of our freedom love thy neighbor is not a piece of advice its a command god my friends is with the poor and god is with us if we are with them this is not a burden this is an adventure

1930340 whatever the proper resolution of the extraordinarily important questions presented the public interest clearly favors further consideration of issues before defendants are required to take actions that may forever alter the constitutional balance of separation of powers
1930341 this continuing contempt of congress is another example of the lengths to which this administration will go and how it uses government lawyers to protect its actions from scrutiny and increase its power rather than respect the rule of law
1930342 senate judiciary committee chairman patrick leahy d vt said white house lawyer fred fielding sent him a letter saying the administration would not let bolten testify until the appeals process is finished
1930343 the congressional research service issued a report in july that confirmed congress

1930364 we live in a world where what wed like to do is blame the boss
1930365 you havent figured out how the two of you click
1930366 im a great believer that a person being given a task should take notes and make sure to feedback to the boss what your understanding was that gives clarity and confidence that this is what happened at that time
1930367 its a large problem if you clash with your boss on your first job you need that reference
1930368 so do your best to grin and bear it until you can escape then be classy about it look as good going away as you did coming in
1930369 you might also be learning a great deal despite that awful boss
1930370 you can just become tougher by noticing that your boss yells at everybody not just you

1930385 we have never come to blows as brothers but in order to portray realism in the mv we really had to do a real fight
1930386 if there is an economic slowdown no one bothered to tell the mobile device buying public
1930387 in particular consumers in emerging markets in asia the middle east africa and south america shrugged off inflation fears to sign up as mobile phone users these healthy gains in net subscriber additions are stimulating replacement and upgrade sales in developed markets handset purchases tended to be flat but those consumers who did purchase dug deeper and paid out more for coveted higher end handsets and smart phones
1930388 there is admittedly turmoil in the global economy but the mass markets fascination with getting the latest and greatest handset shows no sign of abating
1930389 we have however decided to exempt the judiciary and police along with the district magistrate and the sub divisional officers
1930390 in the next phase we will ask the taxis to join us in our movement
1930391 the entire hills are our supporter and people here are actively taking part in our movement this is why we will not force anyone to sport the plates against his her wishes as this might lead to a confrontation let them do it on their own
1930392 it is our non cooperation movement the law enforcers might take action but we will carry on
1930393 if they do we will have to seize the vehicles and put them in garage but we will have to make alternative arrangements for our officers

1930405 do not stay on the same bus on the same train on the same plane in the same buildings or any place the chinese are
1930406 i think what theyre doing is theyre trying to capitalize on the buildup to the games
1930407 and the apparent opportunity tip believes the olympic games presents in terms of targeting and striking a blow to china that the threat is credible and should be taken seriously
1930408 is indicative of an orchestrated campaign designed to fulfill jihadists belief that they should provide warning before launching a significant attack
1930409 i think the actual olympics themselves the venues the guests the athletes are going to be safe
1930410 theres obviously significant numbers of uighurs with some sort of cause who have a grudge against chinese authority and are prepared to use violence to seek whatever objectives theyre seeking
1930411 the people of all ethnic groups in kashi will remember you forever
1930412 we need someone with good language skills and most uighurs cant speak chinese well we also have high standards for cleaning the rooms and uighurs just cant meet those standards
1930413 i dont like the chinese because they dont like uighurs we are muslims and they dislike islam we have different values were two different people

1930427 i noticed my two dead dogs lying in pools of their own blood

1930432 the special operations team that supported us made a decision about the necessity of entry at the point of being on the scene
1930433 weve done these similar kinds of operations over and over again to the tune of removing billions of dollars of drugs from the community and without people or animals being harmed
1930434 we dont want any of our operations to result in the injury or loss of anybody and certainly not animals
1930435 i would say that the dogs presented a threat i would imagine to the special operations situation
1930436 she said if the police shot your dogs dead and did this to you how can i trust them

1930492 combine this with low interest rates and a healthy supply of homes to choose from and you have yourself the perfect buyers market
1930493 but i think too that buyers might be trying to time the market wait for the low point so they dont buy now and find out three months later that prices have since dropped

1930616 setiap hadits yang diriwayatkan pada sanadnya tidak ada periwayat yang tertuduh sebagai pendusta hadits tersebut tidak sy dzdz janggal bertentangan dengan riwayat yang kuat dan diriwayatkan lebih dari satu jalur seperti itu ia lah yang menurut kami dinamakan dengan had ts hasan
1930617 khabar al ah d yang diriwayatkan oleh seorang yang adil memiliki daya ingat hafalan sanadnya bersambung tidak terdapat illat dan tidak sy dzdz maka inilah yang dinamakan shah h li dz tih shahih secara independen jika daya ingat hafalan nya kurang maka ia disebut hasan li dz tih hasan secara independen
1930618 menurut saya seakan hadits hasan menurut ibn hajar adalah hadits shah h yang kurang pada daya ingat hafalan periwayatnya alias kurang mantap daya ingat hafalannya ini adalah definisi yang paling baik untuk hasan sedangkan definisi al khathth by banyak sekali kritikan terhadapnya sementara yang didefinisikan at turmudzy hanyalah definisi salah satu dari dua bagian dari hadits hasan yaitu hasan li ghairih hasan karena adanya riwayat lain yang mendukungnya sepatutnya beliau mendefinisikan hasan li dz tih sebab hasan li ghairih pada dasarnya adalah hadits lemah dla f yang meningkat kepada posisi hasan karena tertolong oleh banyaknya jalur jalur periwayatannya
1930619 hadits yang bersambung sanadnya diriwayatkan oleh periwayat yang adil yang kurang daya ingat hafalannya dari periwayat semisalnya hingga ke jalur terakhirnya mata rantai terakhir tidak terdapat kejanggalan syudz dz ataupun illat di dalamnya

1930657 the people that build our homes have no permanent home of their own in fact they dont really have much of a space in the city at all
1930658 up to 15 million children grow up on construction sites in india 100 000 in mumbai alone they can rarely enjoy their childhood and with increasing development all over their numbers are growing

1930849 so all is fair in love and war no somethings are harder for some then they are for others for example getting your point across i have a problem and you would think after reading my blogs that i had no problem with that not true in fact it seems the only time i do get my point across is in these blogs and partly for the reason that the person s im infatically blasting will never read it i dont say things for the reaction i say them because i need to get it out because i rarely do a live and in person attack its not in my nature but apparently someone does read these and not everything i have said has been so kind someone is always listening sometimes things arent as clear as you thought they were lines are blurred time is wasted hearts are broken but i am a believer that it aint over until the fat lady sings and im so terribly terribly horribly sentimental on so many levels because i really do believe that love does conquer all which i just found out makes me more seceptable to a man who will abuse me mentally verbally and physically something i can agree to for all of the above but i am unchanging i cant be cynical i am sentiment i am a believer in last stands i think its terribly incredibly magnanimously important to make a last stand to have the last word if its worth it to you and its worth it to me even if you dont get the big reward at the end sometimes its just important to say how you feel and dont hold back god even in my last stand i had too much to loose and not my pride or dignity my heart even if ive said every last word in your mind if you leave that one thing in your heart out it makes no difference that you care for and most importantly love someone so much that when they hurt you hurt that you pray for them everyday that you hope they are happy and never sad that they do good things for others and use their power for good not evil even though you know they will because they are so sweet and kind and generous and thats why you love them so much risking everything is something weve all got to do the results could be better than you know we all do things for different reasons because you can or you want to because something hurts so bad or feels so good or that youre too in love to let it go thats most definitely me

1930925 it is our non cooperation movement the law enforcers might take action but we will carry on
1930926 if they do we will have to seize the vehicles and put them in garage but we will have to make alternative arrangements for our officers

1930942 but jesus answered them my father worketh hitherto and i work therefore the jews sought the more to kill him because he not only had broken the sabbath but said also that god was his father making himself equal with god
1930943 let this mind be in you which was also in christ jesus who being in the form of god thought it not robbery to be equal with god
1930944 jesus saith unto him have i been so long time with you and yet hast thou not known me philip he that hath seen me hath seen the father and how sayest thou then shew us the father believest thou not that i am in the father and the father in me the words that i speak unto you i speak not of myself but the father that dwelleth in me he doeth the works believe me that i am in the father and the father in me or else believe me for the very works sake verily verily i say unto you he that believeth on me the works that i do shall he do also and greater works than these shall he do because i go unto my father and whatsoever ye shall ask in my name that will i do that the father may be glorified in the son if ye shall ask any thing in my name i will do it if ye love me keep my commandments

1930952 given the unconscionably bad environmental state of the area in and around the site of the 2008 summer games we cannot in good conscience allow chinese athletes to compete in china
1930953 we deeply apologize to china for the bitter disappointment they will feel at not being represented in these games however we place the blame squarely on china for their failure to prepare a suitable venue for international competition
1930954 frankly it seems to me that in terms of air quality water purity and general contamination beijing is barely even capable of supporting human life let alone strenuous activities such as team sports swimming and long distance running
1930955 we can only hope our refusal to compete in this city will result in real change for its long suffering residents
1930956 chinas olympic athletic community should be deeply ashamed of itself
1930957 when factories have to be shut down for a month beforehand just to clear the air when automobile traffic is artificially thinned to reduce smog when thousands of uniformed men have to dredge the river mere days before the regatta in a city that is supposed to be the pride of a nation and the athletic center of the world for two weeks disgusting is not too strong a word
1930958 i was very much looking forward to making china proud
1930959 but if i am honest china should be ashamed of itself
1930960 i shall regret this for the rest of my life but i think the current conditions beijing are currently worse than the ones i encounter in my polluted petroleum fume choked home town
1930961 which is beijing things have gotten even worse since i moved
1930962 it brings me great sorrow to say this as i had hoped that chinese athletes would return from beijing triumphant having demonstrated our nations greatness on a global stage
1930963 however chinas blatant disregard for its responsibility to the basic health welfare and safety of its olympic participants has forced us to withdraw chinas athletes for their own protection and i urge the olympic teams of all other nations to do the same

1930969 it is doubtful to say that gandhis efforts would have succeeded except he was appealing to the consciences of a christianized people

1930978 if he had done so it would have raised the hackles of thousands of hindus in india and abroad
1930979 in parts 2 and 3 he seeks to disintegrate hinduism and by part 3 he tells his audience how they should approach an indian to convert him
1930980 why are westerners so fond of hinduism but no he seeks to establish that hinduism found root in western society because christians have been made to feel guilty
1930981 the idea was that all souls progress from the lowest species to divinity which is evolution
1930982 christianity is an exclusive religion with a fundamental missionary imperative
1930983 for i am not ashamed of the gospel of christ for it is the power of god unto salvation to every one that believeth to the jew first and also to the greek for therein is the righteousness of god revealed from faith to faith as it is written the just shall live by faith for the wrath of god is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men who hold the truth in unrighteousness because that which may be known of god is manifest in them for god hath shewed it unto them for the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen being understood by the things that are made even his eternal power and godhead so that they are without excuse because that when they knew god they glorified him not as god neither were thankful but became vain in their imaginations and their foolish heart was darkened professing themselves to be wise they became fools and changed the glory of the uncorruptible god into an image made like to corruptible man and to birds and fourfooted beasts and creeping things wherefore god also gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts of their own hearts to dishonour their own bodies between themselves who changed the truth of god into a lie and worshipped and served the creature more than the creator who is blessed for ever amen for this cause god gave them up unto vile affections for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature and likewise also the men leaving the natural use of the woman burned in their lust one toward another men with men working that which is unseemly and receiving in themselves that recompence of their error which was meet and even as they did not like to retain god in their knowledge god gave them over to a reprobate mind to do those things which are not convenient being filled with all unrighteousness fornication wickedness covetousness maliciousness full of envy murder debate deceit malignity whisperers backbiters haters of god despiteful proud boasters inventors of evil things disobedient to parents without understanding covenantbreakers without natural affection implacable unmerciful who knowing the judgment of god that they which commit such things are worthy of death not only do the same but have pleasure in them that do them

1931290 ncos have the opportunity now to volunteer and establish a career path of their own choosing
1931291 last year volunteers f illed 62 percent of career field shortages and we hope to eclipse that percentage this year
1931292 afpc is making personnel services as easy as online banking
1931293 the air force will take additional steps if necessary to fill these shortage career fields but would prefer to fill them wit h volunteers
1931294 ultimately twelve of the best entries will be incorporated into aafes marketing efforts throughout 2009
1931295 each of the twelve winners will receive a 500 aafes shopping spree and stand an excellent chance of hearing their song next time they visit the bx or px
1931296 with the old system we offload fuel from commercial vehicles through the expeditionary receiving point located just off base
1931297 the fuel is offloaded here using an r 22 which is an expeditionary fuel pump from this location fuel is sent to a 3 8 million gallon storage facility on base known as bertha from bertha another r 22 is used to push the fuel through a 2 7 mile pipeline to another storage area from this storage area r 11 vehicles offload the fuel and refuel the aircraft on the flightline
1931298 the new system is much better for a lot of reasons
1931299 it reduces the time required to refuel aircraft by about 50 percent and requires a lot fewer people because fuel can be pumped directly from os 1 or bs 1 instead of being transported one vehicle at a time with limited capacity
1931300 the group performs quality maintenance for the wings assigned aircraft and supports multiple u s and coalition flying units that operate an additional seven or more aircraft to accomplish this the group merges aircraft people and equipment into a single cohesive team
1931301 we moved our cirf from ramstein air base germany around january of 2006
1931302 since then weve been able to save 2 6 million in retrograde transportation costs and about 1 1 million in annual per diem costs previously it cost us 70 000 to ship a c 130 hercules propeller back to germany for repairs now we have the capability to fix them here that saves shipping costs and decreases our turn around time
1931303 our airmen provide unprecedented power and precision through every wrench turned bomb loaded aircraft marshaled and part provided theaterwide
1931304 every u s and french airman who took part in this deployment is better for the experience
1931305 training with the french air force provided us the invaluable opportunity to learn from each others operational experience improve our combat skills and strengthen the bond of friendship between our great air forces and our great countries
1931306 the french visit provided an excellent opportunity to strengthen our social relationship and enhance future relations
1931307 there should be as many combined operations as possible before there are lessons learned in combat
1931308 the cooperation between france and the u s goes all the way back to world war i
1931309 this was an extraordinary opportunity for both the french and u s to learn from each other and we look forward to strengthening that relationship
1931310 we exceeded all expectations we had for this exercise and humanitarian mission
1931311 i couldnt have asked for a better team to have worked with
1931312 it was overwhelming to have such a great honor given to me
1931313 one of our biggest challenges has been developing a more efficient aircraft spares support program with the goal of reducing mission capable requirements
1931314 in other words we have to make sure we have the right parts stocked to support the mission
1931315 because of the high priority assigned to our mission here the fill rate for our kits is typically more than 95 percent which means we have most of the parts on the shelf when an aircraft break occurs
1931316 this puts the parts where theyre needed at maintainers fingertips
1931317 during operation desert storm airmen deployed with up to seven bags each
1931318 prepositioning the weapons reduces the amount of luggage each person carries when he deploys
1931319 by having equipment ready for airmen and aircraft when they deploy we can free up valuable cargo lift capacity for other missions
1931320 and the more we can streamline the deployment process the more airmen can focus on winning the war on terrorism
1931321 forward operating bases currently use mep 12 generators to supply electricity
1931322 the system could also be implemented at domestic military bases
1931323 before the furnace can burn solid waste it is preheated with a beckett fuel burner using either diesel or jp 8 fuel at a rate of around five gallons per hour
1931324 this type of burner is commonly used to heat buildings and for industrial processes after 30 minutes of pre heating the burner is removed and its port is sealed no more liquid fuel is required
1931325 the transportable waste to energy system will reduce costs and lessen the environmental impact associated with the generation of electricity by reducing the amount of fossil fuels required at military installations
1931326 by consuming combustible waste it will also reduce the need for outside contractors to dispose of waste created at those locations and help the air force comply with important environmental goals and standards
1931327 i think the u s is still going in as the favorites which is good for us we have always been the underdog that is the way we like it we are just a great group of people that work well as a team

1931355 we raided the bol factory at dodabetta near coonoor yesterday around 26 000kg of adulterated tea was loaded in containers about to be sent to tuticorin port for export to afghanistan
1931356 we also found 10 000 15 000kg of tea waste and a dark coloured chemical
1931357 the tea waste had been soaked in lime water and mixed with sugar and the chemical
1931358 equal quantities of tealeaves and this material had been mixed to get the final product
1931359 we found 168 bags of adulterated tea each weighing 20kg at the factory
1931360 we suspect that tea waste produced during processing which should ideally be incinerated has been mixed with normal ctc
1931361 we suspect foul play by some competitors the allegation of recovering adulterated tea is baseless the tea waste and other material that the board claims to have seized were in the factory for some other purposes
1931362 not only the government vehicles but also the private school and tea garden vehicles will bear the gl number plates from tomorrow

1931454 i want to thank the individuals who explained the emotional and spiritual pain my possession of the eucharist caused them to experience
1931455 they have demonstrated that the use of reason is more effective than the use of force
1931456 when i received the eucharist my intention was to bring it back to my seat to show him
1931457 i took about three steps from the woman distributing the eucharist and someone grabbed the inside of my elbow and blocked the path in front of me at that point i put it in my mouth so theyd leave me alone and i went back to my seat and i removed it from my mouth
1931458 she came up behind me grabbed my wrist with her right hand with her left hand grabbed my fingers and was trying to pry them open to get the eucharist out of my hand

1931575 he was delivered over to death for our sins and was raised to life for our justification
1931576 therefore since we have been justified through faith we have peace with god through our lord jesus christ
1931577 through him we have gained access by faith into this grace in which we now stand
1931578 and we rejoice in the hope of the glory of god
1931579 and hope does not disappoint us because god has poured out his love into our hearts by the holy spirit whom he has given us
1931580 since we have now been justified by his blood how much more shall we be saved from gods wrath through him
1931581 those who receive gods abundant provision of grace and of the gift of righteousness reign in life through the one man jesus christ
1931582 just as christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the father we too may live a new life
1931583 you have been set free from sin and become slaves to righteousness
1931584 for the wages of sin is death but the gift of god is eternal life in christ jesus our lord
1931585 therefore there is now no condemnation for those who are in christ jesus
1931586 and if the spirit of him who raised christ from the dead is living in you he who raised christ from the dead will also give life to your mortal bones through his spirit who lives in you
1931587 the spirit himself testifies with our spirit that we are gods children
1931588 we are heirs heirs of god and co heirs with christ
1931589 he who did not spare his own son but gave him up for us all how will he not also along with him graciously give us all things
1931590 we are more than conquerors through him who loved us
1931591 for i am convinced that neither death nor life neither angels nor demons neither the present nor the future nor any powers neither height nor depth nor anything else in all creation will be able to separate us from the love of god that is in christ jesus our lord

1931626 to me it is remarkable that we want to say athletes should shut up and just play in everyday context they are good enough to tell us what cereals to eat what shoes to wear about anti obesity or whatever but when it comes to a fundamental tenet of human rights somehow they are not good enough if we want them to be holistic role models then lets let them be holistic role models
1931627 the legacy of most elite athletes is to be completely vanilla i played basketball for many years and the idea that my legacy to this world is putting a ball in a hole is unsatisfactory to me if people are satisfied they can play a great forehand volley or make a birdie from a bunker if thats enough for them then i cannot comment but it is not enough of a legacy when the opportunity to change the world is in your grasp

1931630 blade 2 puts blade wesley snipes hot on the trail of some vampires who are hiding his mentor whistler kris kristofferson somewhere and keeping him alive to suffer as a vampire
1931631 blade 2 basically takes everything that was great about the first film and improves upon it

1931649 traditional clothes dryers are very energy intensive so called condensation models without an exhaust tube use even more energy consider drying the natural way i e on a clothes line outdoors if practical this will save you 3 4 kwh washing cycle
1931650 if line drying is not an option first make sure that your washing machine can spin at 1600 or even 1800 rpm this will almost halve the energy needed for drying drying through spinning is 20 times less energy intensive than with heat there are two clothes drying technologies that use far less energy the gas fired clothes dryer and the dryer with an electric heat pump the gas fired dryer is the best alternative especially for more intensive use it uses 60 percent less energy including the gas and dries 40 percent faster if gas is not available consider a dryer with a heat pump a heat pump dryer will use half the electricity of a traditional dryer however heat pumps can be rather expensive

1931686 every single book ive written goes through terrible periods of stuckness i wake up from a nap at my appointed time to write and find myself in some emotional bog or scary dream residue that feels like the exact opposite of creativity we must create out of those places too oh the fantasy that we awaken in some beautiful setting exercise eat something light and nourishing someone kisses us the birds begin to twitter and we settle happily into our creative routine and work happily for hours at a time so much of life is the mundane the annoying the unsettling or confusing our personality selves are busy judging rehearsing complaining or protecting we must do it anyway the anyway will lead us to richness the richness of our actual experience and the gifts of our own real creativity we are each keepers of our own truths sharing these truths opens dorrs for healing and intimacy with others still we withhold the truth fearing loss or conflict or judgement we dance with deceptions and half truths and hope we can evade having to tell the truth if we live in truth we can be closer to our actual experience and therefore open to mroe joy and more of our own essence the truth is our ally and our revealer if we let ourselves be truly seen then we can be truly loved the truth hurts and heals hurts when we fear and resist it heals when we allow it to speak and change how we see i wish we would all have more clear truthful jealous outbursts we all feel jealousy i feel it often about both odd and common things we are afraid that it is too ugly to be seen or not kind or some sign that we are greedy and inferior if jealousy is shared consciously when felt its power disappears if jealousy is not expressed it shows up in all kinds of ways passive aggressive questions or thinly disguised fake statements like im really happy for you speeches

1931805 yas itu aku lakukan karena ku bukan orang yang egois aku sadar bagaimana menderitanya seorang gadis tinggal serumah dengan pria yang mencintainya yang memuliakan dia dengan harta dan kedudukan tinggi namun hati gadis itu hanya untuk lelaki lain tanpa suaminya mengetahui betapa hebat derita batinnya

1931851 but thats not answering the question scott why the make up tests
1931852 always said if i were to do it id do it big
1931853 heres one for you lets say theres a sick person over here and you can cure him you can do it would you help him would you try
1931854 but why not say that youd help a sick and maimed person if you could most of us would if we could but god doesnt
1931855 he doesnt does he my brother was a christian who died of cancer even though he prayed to jesus to heal him how is this jesus good hmmm can you answer that one
1931856 thats right god made satan didnt he tell me son is there evil in this world
1931857 evils everywhere isnt it and god did make everything correct
1931858 if god created everything then god created evil since evil exists and according to the principle that our works define who we are then god is evil
1931859 is there sickness immorality hatred ugliness all these terrible things do they exist in this world
1931860 science says you have five senses you use to identify and observe the world around you have you ever seen jesus
1931861 have you ever felt your jesus tasted your jesus or smelt your jesus have you ever had any sensory perception of jesus christ or god for that matter
1931862 according to the rules of empirical testable demonstrable protocol science says your god doesnt exist what do you say to that son
1931863 and that is the problem science has with god there is no evidence only faith
1931864 you can have lots of heat even more heat super heat mega heat unlimited heat white heat a little heat or no heat but we dont have anything called cold we can hit up to 458 degrees below zero which is no heat but we cant go any further after that there is no such thing as cold otherwise we would be able to go colder than the lowest 458 degrees
1931865 every body or object is susceptible to study when it has or transmits energy and heat is what makes a body or matter have or transmit energy absolute zero 458 f is the total absence of heat you see sir cold is only a word we use to describe the absence of heat we cannot measure cold heat we can measure in thermal units because heat is energy cold is not the opposite of heat sir just the absence of it
1931866 what about darkness professor is there such a thing as darkness
1931867 youre wrong again sir darkness is not something it is the absence of something you can have low light normal light bright light flashing light but if you have no light constantly you have nothing and its called darkness isnt it thats the meaning we use to define the word
1931868 in reality darkness isnt if it were you would be able to make darkness darker wouldnt you
1931869 yes professor my point is your philosophical premise is flawed to start with and so your conclusion must also be flawed
1931870 you argue that there is life and then theres death a good god and a bad god you are viewing the concept of god as something finite something we can measure sir science cant even explain a thought
1931871 it uses electricity and magnetism but has never seen much less fully understood either one to view death as the opposite of life is to be ignorant of the fact that death cannot exist as a substantive thing death is not the opposite of life just the absence of it
1931872 now tell me professor do you teach your students that they evolved from a monkey
1931873 if you are referring to the natural evolutionary process young man yes of course i do
1931874 have you ever observed evolution with your own eyes sir
1931875 since no one has ever observed the process of evolution at work and cannot even prove that this process is an on going endeavor are you not teaching your opinion sir are you now not a scientist but a preacher
1931876 to continue the point you were making earlier to the other student let me give you an example of what i mean
1931877 is there anyone in the class who has ever seen the professors brain
1931878 is there anyone here who has ever heard the professors brain felt the professors brain touched or smelt the professors brain no one appears to have done so so according to the established rules of empirical stable demonstrable protocol science says that you have no brain with all due respect sir
1931879 so if science says you have no brain how can we trust your lectures sir
1931880 now you accept that there is faith and in fact faith exists with life
1931881 of course there is we see it everyday it is in the daily example of mans inhumanity to man it is in the multitude of crime and violence everywhere in the world these manifestations are nothing else but evil
1931882 evil does not exist sir or at least it does not exist unto itself evil is simply the absence of god it is just like darkness and cold a word that man has created to describe the absence of god god did not create evil evil is the result of what happens when man does not have gods love present in his heart its like the cold that comes when there is no heat or the darkness that comes when there is no light
1931883 dont take offense or anything but can i ask you a question
1931884 we sometimes catch a window a glimpse of whats beyond was it just imagination stringing us along more things than ive dreamed about unseen and unexplained we suspend our disbelief and we are entertained

1931969 mi pap siempre pens escribe faciolince y yo le creo y lo imito que mimar a los hijos es el mejor sistema educativo
1931970 ahora pienso que la nica receta para poder soportar lo dura que es la vida al cabo de los a os es haber recibido en la infancia mucho amor de los padres sin ese amor exagerado que me dio mi pap yo hubiera sido mucho menos feliz
1931971 rase una vez una peque a y dulce muchachita que en cuanto se la ve a se la amaba pero sobre todo la quer a su abuela que no sab a qu darle a la ni a un buen d a le regal una caperucita de terciopelo rojo y como le sentaba muy bien y no quer a llevar otra cosa la llamaron caperucita roja

1931973 the policy is to cut down on public displays of affection its not an isolated incident latitude leads to spotty enforcement of the policy
1931974 there are kisses and there are kisses there are hugs and there are hugs if its pelvis to pelvis and it looks like theres some grinding going on thats just not appropriate in school
1931975 it was a simple arm over the shoulder thing it wasnt even bodies pressing
1931976 i knew there was a policy on public displays of affection but i didnt know you could get into trouble for something as little as a hug i didnt think it was serious
1931977 displays of affection should not occur on the school campus at any time
1931978 so then i went and hugged katie and he said megan ive already given you one detention
1931979 she came through the door and said mom youre not going to believe this
1931980 i thought there was something else that happened that maybe she didnt tell me about
1931981 the policy is to cut down on public displays of affection its not an isolated incident other students have been disciplined in the past
1931982 we want everybody to know up front what the rules are
1931983 my personal opinion is that school is for education and hugging its great off school time
1931984 there are hugs and there are hugs if its pelvis to pelvis and it looks like theres some grinding going on thats just not appropriate in school
1931985 many of our rules remain vague because i want the ability to interpret them
1931986 ive got kids who hug each other all the time and i dont think anything is meant by it its just a need to show affection
1931987 i always see people hugging so i never thought i could get in so much trouble
1931988 even today in school i told people dont do that
1931989 and a man will choose any wickedness but the wickedness of a woman sin began with a woman and thanks to her we all must die
1931990 do not lie with a man as one lies with a woman that is detestable
1931991 if a man lies with a man as one lies with a woman both of them have done what is detestable they must be put to death their blood will be on their own heads
1931992 because of this god gave them over to shameful lusts even their women exchanged natural relations for unnatural ones in the same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another men committed indecent acts with other men and received in themselves the due penalty for their perversion
1931993 do you not know that the wicked will not inherit the kingdom of god do not be deceived neither the sexually immoral nor idolaters nor adulterers nor male prostitutes nor homosexual offenders nor thieves nor the greedy nor drunkards nor slanderers nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of god
1931994 when i hear levittown what rings in my mind is when the salesman said its not me you see but the owners of this development have not as yet decided whether theyre going to sell these homes to negroes
1931995 the feeling of rejection on that long ride back to harlem
1931996 its something wed like to forget rather than celebrate its a black mark on the island or maybe i should say a white mark
1931997 be used or occupied by any person other than members of the caucasian race
1931998 its certainly not a melting pot but it is a community in transition
1931999 ethnically its changing every day and in 25 years it wont look like it does today
1932000 nassau county is the most segregated suburban county in the united states
1932001 there is a sensitivity to it because the community has for many years tried to overcome that image
1932002 some people moved in very unaware of the caucasian clause and were disturbed when they found out
1932003 an asian family moved in and some people moved out because of them its so silly they were good quiet decent people
1932004 in those years even liberal people like ourselves tended to take residential segregation for granted without approving it none of us went out into the street to change it
1932005 because levittown promised affordable housing with no down payment it offered hope to the african american working class when no other community did but that hope was quashed
1932006 after the war blacks thought things had changed but they hadnt and levittown became a microcosm of that frustration
1932007 the negroes in america are trying to do in 400 years what the jews in the world have not wholly accomplished in 600 years
1932008 as a jew i have no room in my mind or heart for racial prejudice but i have come to know that if we sell one house to a negro family then 90 or 95 percent of our white customers will not buy into the community this is their attitude not ours as a company our position is simply this we can solve a housing problem or we can try to solve a racial problem but we cannot combine the two
1932009 to paint levitt as a villain would be unfair the whole system was villainous
1932010 to single levittown out on racial covenants as if it werent going on everywhere else is unfair
1932011 there was such a demand for houses they had people waiting on lines that even if they had said there will be some blacks living there white people would still have moved in
1932012 first theres fear then theres somebody who makes friends with the new family and says theyre very human they keep nice houses
1932013 he said john shes black i said yeah he said shes a terrific tenant if i had mentioned it at first there might have been a problem
1932014 after we moved in we didnt actually have any trouble i never felt excluded
1932015 theyre absolutely great neighbors there are no rednecks here and never any cross burnings i can tell you that and i go back almost to the year one here
1932016 i dont have any problem at all its been an absolute pleasure
1932017 i cant tell you the bad words that were scrawled on the walls
1932018 the black families i know here have not had a bad experience
1932019 the thing is ive watched the children they really get along in a most fantastic way
1932020 thats when we knew what he had eaten and that things were pretty bad

1932022 if a child ingests them the glue turns into a toxic substance and its very serious

1932031 because you have done this you are cursed more than all cattle and more than every beast of the field on your belly you shall go and you shall eat dust all the days of your life 15 and i will put enmity between you and the woman and between your seed and her seed he shall bruise your head and you shall bruise his heel

1932034 it is not good that the man should be alone i will make him a helper comparable to him
1932035 it is not good that the man should be alone i will make him a bride suitable for him
1932036 let us make man in our image according to our likeness let them have dominion over the fish of the sea over the birds of the air and over the cattle over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth
1932037 it was only gods mercy that kept him from simply starting over when adam and eve fell into sin
1932038 there are only two days on my calendar today and that day
1932039 thats good there are all kinds of things you guys could be talking about women or sports or tv or whatever but youre talking about god thats good
1932040 i believe in god and jesus and the holy spirit i believe im not god and i didnt create the universe
1932041 i praise god i praise jesus i praise the holy spirit and i try to praise him every minute of every day some lady in california asked me what i wanted and i said i want to go to heaven and she said what are you going to do there and i said praise god
1932042 so what are you doing here or do i need to ask that
1932043 the holy spirit led me in here and i came in to talk to you because you guys are talking about god like i said theres a plethora of things you could be talking about but youre talking about god
1932044 well were meeting because were all in fraternity houses and we wanted to try to encourage each other in our faith in our houses
1932045 so are you in a whole house full of god fearing men or are you the scattered lambs of the father
1932046 well im proud of you and god is very pleased with you
1932047 well we try but its hard to hold on to the faith in our houses or at least to stay out of sin
1932048 let me tell you something wherever you go in the world whether its in your house or in your job or in school or with your wife or your fianc e there will always be gossiping and hating going on there will always be righteous people and hateful people
1932049 you know you only have so much time every time you wake up in the morning you need to thank god for that chance to do good and do good every moment all the time people talk about what theyre going to do next week or in 2 years or in 10 years ridiculous all you have is the next moment god gives you your next breath of fresh air and your heart keeps pumping so you have that moment
1932050 people dont realize how little time they have thats why im not afraid to talk about heaven and hell sometimes people dont like talking about heaven and hell but thats too bad because someday theyre going to have to face it theyre going to have to face heaven and hell and a final judgment so i tell people look at the stars look at the trees look at the oceans look at all the other animals and creatures living on earth you know theres two kinds of water fresh and salty and mountains and sky are you god did you create the earth did you create the elephant
1932051 so do good in the moment you have in making eye contact with somebody in a handshake in bringing a flower to a girl whos having a bad day you dont even have to say anything just one single flower can do something you dont know what that persons doing they could have just been raped they could have just been molested they could just have had the most devastating experience of their lives and you could do good to them
1932052 thats all gentlemen my work is done peace to you
1932053 there are only two days on my calendar today and that day
1932054 paint a highly questionable picture of a virtually faceless and nameless dominionist christian mass
1932055 and they overcame him satan by the blood of the lamb and by the word of their testimony and they did not love their lives to the death
1932056 is anticipated to have a broad range of impacts on the health of americans
1932057 we generally dont speculate and comment on anything until it is the final product
1932058 whether they line up well with the national priorities of the administration
1932059 should immediately release dr gerberdings full uncut statement because the public has a right to know all the facts about the serious threats posed by global warming
1932060 what needed to be said as far were concerned was said
1932061 she certainly communicated with the committee everything she felt was critical to help them appreciate and understand all the issues surrounding climate change and its potential impact on public health
1932062 in some of these areas its not a question of if its a question of who what how and when
1932063 there are only two days on my calendar today and that day
1932064 lord teach us to pray as john also taught his disciples
1932065 and when you pray you shall not be like the hypocrites
1932066 therefore do not be like them for your father knows the things you have need of before you ask him
1932067 holy holy holy lord god almighty who was and is and is to come
1932068 did not our heart burn within us while he talked with us on the road and while he opened the scriptures to us
1932069 you must understand the servant of the lord was a man possessed by god
1932070 the holy ghost appeared to me and i knew him to be the one who had spoken to me the day before and shown me that place of splendor and glory into which natural eyes can never look it never dawned on me before that the holy ghost was a person exactly like the savior and that he must come and dwell in flesh and blood in fact the church knows more about the savior who was only on the earth thirty three years than about the holy ghost who has been here two thousand years i had only thought of him as an influence coming on meetings and that was what most of us in the revival thought i had never seen that he must live in bodies as the savior lived in his on earth
1932071 i saw him as a person apart from flesh and blood and he said to me as the savior had a body so i dwell in the cleansed temple of the believer
1932072 he made it very plain that he would never share my life i saw the honor he gave me in offering to indwell me but there were many things very dear to me and i knew he wouldnt keep one of them the change he would make was very clear it meant every bit of my fallen nature was to go to the cross and he would bring in his own life and his own nature
1932073 i had received a sentence of death as really as a prisoner in the dock
1932074 i intended to do it but oh the cost i wept for days i lost seven pounds in weight just because i saw what he was offering me how i wished i had never seen it one thing he reminded of was that he had only come to take what i had already promised the savior not in part but the whole
1932075 and seeing him i saw my own corrupt nature it wasnt sins that i saw but nature touched by the fall i was corrupt to the core i knew i had to be cleansed i saw there was as much difference between the holy ghost and myself as between light and darkness
1932076 nothing is more real to me than the process i went through for that whole week
1932077 the holy spirit went on dealing with me exposing the root of my nature which was self and you can only get out of a thing what is in its root sin was canceled and it wasnt sin he was dealing with it was self that thing which came from the fall
1932078 quer saber onde ficam os homens que acreditam em si mesmos eu sei sei de homens que acreditam em si mesmos com uma confian a mais colossal do que a de napole o ou c sar sei onde arde a estrela fixa da certeza e do sucesso posso conduzi lo aos tronos dos super homens os homens que realmente acreditam em si mesmos est o todos em asilos de lun ticos

1932084 walk in christs light daily through fidelity to personal and liturgical prayer nourished by meditation on the inspired word of god
1932085 in this holy year why dont we also hold an international meeting of youth
1932086 therefore it is very important that each one of you young people should be able to reflect on this principal agent of salvation history namely the holy spirit or the spirit of jesus especially as you rediscover that the holy spirit is the
1932087 faith is born and is strengthened within us through the sacraments particularly those of christian initiation baptism confirmation and the eucharist
1932088 once again i repeat that only christ can fulfil the most intimate aspirations that are in the heart of each person only christ can humanize humanity and lead it to its divinization
1932089 young people gathered around the vicar of christ will participate in the sacred functions and above all have recourse to the sacraments of reconciliation and the eucharist
1932090 roman catholic leaders in australia sought the help of other faiths to help house an army of foreign pilgrims arriving for the world youth day events this week sydneys muslim community responded with an offer to accommodate young visitors in islamic schools

1932096 the pope announced that world youth day would next be held in madrid in 2011

1932099 sharon was attacked by someone in the community who supposedly represents a higher degree of human decency
1932100 victoria osteen never attacked her never tried to get in the cockpit
1932101 the aggressor and the person who was out of control who flipped out was ms brown

1932122 when an insurer is going to pay the small amounts we dont feel financially able to assume the risk
1932123 i have come to the realization that the winters are too hard on the animals and i am hoping people will care as much as i do about them
1932124 i know there are people out there who think i am completely nuts for doing this
1932125 i mean who in their right mind keeps a blind sheep who thinks it is normal for a pig to sleep next to the washing machine
1932126 i want this to be a place for these animals to live out their lives free to roam around they arent penned up and they get good wholesome food these animals have suffered often at the hands of humans they have the right to be cared for now
1932127 gus came to us with a shattered leg his owners said he was kicked by a horse
1932128 but the most disturbing thing is that they left him with a broken leg for four days before they brought him here he spent hours in surgery and now the vet said he cant believe how well our little gus is doing
1932129 i make the soap and write the stories and give the tours to show that these animals have so much left to give they have so much to teach us about animals and about who we are as people

1932142 as has been noted the alicia keys concert ranks among the best so far this year her performance was worth every centavo of the already reasonably priced tickets props to mtv philippines for bringing her back to manila and the good news is that she promised to return anew
1932143 as booblanco pointed out however the smx convention center was cramped
1932144 nonetheless im glad the concert was held at the smx for one thing it boasted of excellent acoustics and it may just be because we were situated near the stage heck the sound quality was in my opinion even better than those of concerts ive watched at the araneta coliseum

1932149 volgens mij kan dat niet waar zijn omdat wij de exclusieve rechten hebben op uitvoering van deze musical in de periode rond 2008
1932150 volgens mij hoef je alleen rechten te betalen als je een musical letterlijk overneemt wij brengen een eigen versie het script wijkt op veel punten af om het sinterklaasverhaal op de planken te brengen hoef je toch ook niet te betalen ik denk dat wij binnen de wet blijven en als dat niet zo is nou laat ze dan maar komen

1932154 my initial system will be relatively simple just controlling one home theater ultimately though i plan on expanding it to at least include video audio routing and very possibly lighting and hvac controls i realize that to scale it that much will likely require a near complete re write of any code i have but i want to at least be able to re use as much hardware as possible
1932155 presiden menjelaskan putusan mahkamah konstitusi diambil berdasar pada kewenangan mahkamah pemerintah dan dpr akan mengambil langkah sesegera mungkin untuk membuat aturan teknis
1932156 bulan januari 2008 mudah mudahan bisa diterapkan sesuai dengan harapan masyarakat dan putusan konstitusional mk saya menerima banyak surat dari kpud yang akan menjalankan pemilihan kepala daerah ini menunjukkan betapa seriusnya permasalahan calon independen
1932157 revisi ini juga untuk menghapus kesan partai politik berupaya menghalangi calon independen paling lambat lima bulan terakhir atau sampai bulan desember 2007 sudah rampung jadi awal tahun 2008 bisa dilaksanakan
1932158 jadi calon independen tidak sekadar aksesori demokrasi tetapi merupakan kebutuhan
1932159 ini kan bisa menjadi ukuran popularitas akseptabilitas dan kapasitas figur bersangkutan sehingga yang tampil nanti bukan calon independen yang asal asalan yang cuma mengandalkan kapital
1932160 pemerintah harus menjalankan keputusan itu jangan sampai mengingkarinya mau pakai perppu atau yang lain terserah lebih cepat lebih baik

1932162 kita dorong agar pemerintah mengeluarkan perppu kalau aturannya tidak segera keluar bisa jadi kontroversi

1932165 nicht syrien nicht iran nicht nordkorea keiner der blichen verd chtigen hat seine grenzen berschritten und die seiner nachbarn verletzt es ist israel
1932166 ein westlicher diplomat bemerkte neulich israel glaube immer noch anspruch auf die sympathien des kleinen david mit der steinschleuder zu haben und merke nicht dass es l ngst als aggressiver goliath wahrgenommen wird wer sagt es herrn olmert
1932167 nach israels verlassen des libanon 2000 dauerte es nicht lange bis die hisbollah bei uns und allen anderen ortschaften das sagen hatte als erfolgreiche widerstandsk mpfer begr t legten sie auch bei uns raketenlager in bunkern an die sozialarbeit der partei gottes bestand darin auf diesen bunkern eine schule und im anderen fall ein wohnhaus zu bauen ein lokaler scheich erkl rte mir lachend dass die juden in jedem fall verlieren entweder weil die raketen auf sie geschossen werden oder wenn sie die lager angriffen weil sie von der welt ffentlichkeit verurteilt werden ob der dann zivilen toten ich wusste dass ich meine familie vor solchen wohltaten in sicherheit bringen musste
1932168 israel wird sich nicht der erpressung beugen und wird nicht mit terroristen ber das leben von israelischen soldaten verhandeln
1932169 oh as human as ever amidst all the hurt pain anger and sadness happiness and joy seems to stand a good chance of winning
1932170 yes i am taking decisions you know so are sanjay and rahul the ultimate salvation however is still a distant dream
1932171 what matters however is that everyone else also understands isnt it i dont think everyone is thinking the way we are or even the way you would its just a few of us holding it all together
1932172 too politically correct are you on a speaker phone are there others in the room
1932173 i am now on speaker phone and no one else is in the room and it is as sound proof as it gets
1932174 ok i heard about your new toy from javed anyways i thought youd have a better answer than that
1932175 you and a couple of others think so well yet are so lacking in expression i wonder how you do your consultant reports
1932176 no point in expressing if no one is going to listen or change behaviour
1932177 thats not the purpose of expressing an analytical thought thats what differentiates a philosopher and a radical better to have thoughts that allow others to reflect on what they do
1932178 i agree because you are saying it but i didnt understand what you just said
1932179 lets see the purpose of getting your thoughts out is not to transform how people work when you express your thought you offer them a perspective offer a perspective that they cant have or may not ever have
1932180 the objective of the expression is not a deterministic goal like bringing about change in people the expression is the objective itself that is the purpose
1932181 nope i am saving that time for when i am with you guys
1932182 hope you are coming back soon fun is long pending and behind schedule
1932183 schiitische milizion re feuerten unterdessen mehrere katjuscha raketen auf israel ab
1932184 israel sollte sich vonseiner europ ischen und kolonialistischen zionistischen v lkischen und rassistischen blut und boden ideologie trennen und endlich den weg frei machen f r einen gemeinsamen staat aller in pal stina ans ssigen gruppen
1932185 den krieg hat ja wohl israel angefangen ganz abgesehen davon dass es ja an der tagesordnung f r israel ist fremdes gebiet zu besetzen
1932186 its an amazing drive i could have just kept driving for hours and hours together
1932187 youd have to stop somewhere to at least fill up your tank
1932188 green all over its just amazing driving through the country
1932189 and we even work towards making our hopes come true
1932190 right now its fear which is keeping us alive and ticking fear the strongest emotion of all it is stronger than any other human emotion
1932191 i agree about the fear part but i think both hope and fear play an equal role they allow us to balance the positive and negative of life
1932192 in any human emotion there is fear embedded think about it in love there is fear of losing love in hope there is fear of a dream not coming true in every emotion there is fear in some form or the other just hope is nothing if it doesnt have its feet on ground its a wish nothing else most will succumb to fear the others will however use fear as a survival tactic and stay alive in bad times
1932193 whats going on what are you two guys so excited about
1932194 you are showing signs of not coming to office today
1932195 i wonder why you would say that i will there in an hour
1932196 there has been a barrage of instructions from you to everybody here i guessed you were taking the day off
1932197 normally all these would have hit us after you came in
1932198 i am getting used to the fact of working from my skyscraper
1932199 yeah no need to remind us always that you are now not going to be around
1932200 around is a factor of the mind not the body
1932201 the only confidence i have to take up this assignment is because of you guys if it was some other team here i would have just asked for a salary hike and continued doing what i do now if we really want to be successful with this kind of growth well have to manage it would you rather put your destiny in someone elses hands
1932202 no i know that very well and in fact i am very happy that you are taking up this assignment
1932203 even when you became consulting partner i always believed this firm would benefit more if you did different things in fact this has been a key discussion point when i talk with sanjay and raghu
1932204 then why do you all seem so sad depressed and confused
1932205 the only confusion is that we need an authority figure who will take firm and final decisions which seems to be missing now you know it we are all very stubborn and we might not bend if you know what i mean there were many instances when you took decisions that were against us but they were fine because you were the authority
1932206 good then time for you to learn then maybe an authority will evolve maybe you all will learn to take decisions by consensus consensus can be a good possibility though i personally dont prefer it maybe you all will just call me when you cant take a decision
1932207 but we wasted a lot of time in that we hardly ever reached a conclusion when we went the consensus way
1932208 now it is real you will have to learn to take decisions that is the only reason why some of you are not growing in a company where everybody has the possibility of growing every quarter weve had a year of stagnation now whether you like it or not you will take decisions right or wrong you will none of you made any mistakes in the last year which proves that you guys did not take any decisions at all
1932209 of course you guys took decisions i am talking about the decisions that you look up to an authority for if you guys are so sure that you did take decisions then why does my absence bother you so much
1932210 no again we come back to the point where your absence bothers i already told you my views on that there is a probably a vacuum created by your shift and we are trying to fill it and i am very sure it will get filled i will just miss the avinash sarkar effect that always used to be there
1932211 you will get used to it thats how life is we all get used to change only we dont know it when the change occurs god has given us an amazing power of forgetting
1932212 this change will not be to forget we all know that you have a big hand in running the show and its going to be a new challenge for us to keep the show running
1932213 did you get any response from k2 i need to get my team moving
1932214 three voice messages to all of them go check their answering machines if you dont believe me
1932215 oh i believe you you wouldnt lie to me you have no reason to
1932216 either you come in or you go out dont pass on all your stress to the spring that makes the door close by itself leave the poor done alone it hasnt done you any harm
1932217 its too early you worked only nine hours are you taking the rest of the day off
1932218 well say that on friday av is taking all consultants out for dinner
1932219 thats nice at least av seems to be doing things right and why only consultants why not us
1932220 but its not entirely your fault i guess age catches up with everyone
1932221 and yes please do take av out of the office any more time here and he will grow roots at his seat lets all go out for a weekend maybe that will stop fruit sprouting out of avs ears
1932222 sure we are always available fun is our middle name avinash what about you
1932223 no you guys are boredom incarnate you see me as boring because your entire view towards life is boring i havent changed a bit you set the weekend i bet no one will show up
1932224 you cant plan these things you know this has to be impromptu one day before just announce it and go
1932225 not anymore you see javed and i gave up this a long time ago
1932226 ugh why would men want to wear skirts thats just strange
1932227 no woman wants to see a man in a skirt
1932228 they made me during catholic school so again i so feminine about pantyhose
1932229 only men do this only women do that it just is
1932230 im sorry that i did xy or z but i didnt mean to
1932231 i will consume them with fireballs from my eyes and lighting from my arse
1932232 the question you gotta ask yourself is do i feel lucky
1932233 the best and the worst thing that has ever happened to me
1932234 we are talking about several people and a very significant and drastic step it might also cause a shower of law suits from various groups and individuals in europe against various israeli officials
1932235 some elements with very clear motives and intentions use these lawsuits as a weapon against israel the combat between israel and terrorists continues on different scenes and the legal scene is just one of them
1932236 i dont think the decision of the spanish court indicates a crisis in israel eu relations but it seems that these elements exploit the law in these countries to act against the state of israel
1932237 we believe that these persons are criminals and that they committed horrible crimes against humanity a one ton bomb was thrown at a civilian neighborhood in gaza and 15 people died
1932238 god himself was once as we are now and is an exalted man and sits enthroned in yonder heavens we have imagined that god was god from all eternity i will refute that idea and take away the veil so that you may see
1932239 he saved us not on the basis of deeds which we have done in righteousness but according to his mercy
1932240 for we know that is is by grace that we are saved after all that we can do
1932241 however powerful the saving grace of christ it brings exaltation to no man who does not comply with the works of the gospel
1932242 each command we obey sends us another rung up the ladder to perfected manhood and toward godhood and every law disobeyed is a sliding toward the bottom where man merges into the brute world
1932243 living all the commandments guarantees total forgiveness of sins and assures one of exaltation trying is not sufficient nor is repentence when one merely tries to abandon sin
1932244 jesus kept the commandments of his father and thereby worked out his own salvation and also set an example as to the way and the means whereby all men may be saved
1932245 i dont care if i live or die in the shoot out all i want to do is kill and injure as many of you p as i can
1932246 tomorrow is not a promise where will you spend eternity
1932247 eternity is not just looking to the future and our place with god in heaven but it is looking at our eternity if it were only moments away
1932248 i just feel that there are going to be so many chances for you to witness to people and they are coming up soon be ready for them they are not far be ready
1932249 this will be my last year lord i have gotten what i can thank you
1932250 he had a dream about rachels eyes that he had seen a stream of tears flowing from them and he asked if it meant anything to us
1932251 i was absolutely stunned when i turned to the last page of the diary
1932252 there were 13 tears falling from her eyes and she drew it 30 minutes before she died 13 victims were killed from the guns of those two boys
1932253 he gave his life for me i will give my life for him
1932254 ps honestly i want to live completely for god its hard and scary but totally worth it
1932255 all jocks stand up were going to kill every one of you
1932256 it was like they were having the time of their life
1932257 oh my god look at this black kids brains awesome man
1932258 all of us should live life so as to be able to face eternity at any time
1932259 we have focused more on the healing process and trying to bring something good out of columbine we dont want the tragedy to have the final say we want good to triumph over the evil of that day
1932260 the courage to stand for godly truth in a time and place where you feel you may be standing alone can best be drawn from my daughters words penned in her journal just a few days before her death
1932261 you can start a chain reaction by acts of kindness
1932262 i want to lay a challenge before each and everyone of you young people here today the torch has fallen from rachels hand who will pick it up again who will pick up the torch again
1932263 young people here today hear me i want to issue a challenge to each and everyone of you dont despair of life dont despair of what has happened to you rachel carried a torch the torch of truth the torch of compassion the torch of love the torch of the good news of jesus christ her saviour and lord who she was not ashamed of even in her hour of death i want to lay a challenge before each and everyone of you young people here today the torch has fallen from rachels hand who will pick it up again who will pick up the torch again
1932264 woke up to reality and found the future not so bright i dreamt the impossible that maybe things could work out right
1932265 if you ever go to the practice hall of the skiffle minstrels you might notice a couple interesting things 1 there is a shrine to hank williams in the corner complete with offerings of booze and cigarettes 2 the huge bible from which accordionist ronny k reads random passages in a tone he must have picked up from a fire and brimstone southern preacher skiffle is not so much a genre as it is a way to play popular or folk music in non traditional ways like with washboards accordions and fiddles these hillbilly honky tonkin bill monroe lovers are known to frequent stillwater grill sportsmens tavern and allen street hardware
1932266 i drink scotch and two kinds of beer free and budweiser
1932267 i will not bring home something that i cant wash off
1932268 call 911 a woman has fallen out on the sidewalk
1932269 so glad to hear from you ive been by your house a couple times and wondered how you were thanks for the lovely gift when i got home and found it it really lifted my day lets have tea or lunch lets stay in touch
1932270 soy contains the scientifically documented carcinogenic and dna damaging and chromosome damaging natural chemicals genistein and daidzein
1932271 the production of herbicide resistant soybean leads to environmental problems such as deforestation soil degradation and pesticide and genetic contamination
1932272 a sensible coordination of all political and military elements of the afghan theater of operations does not exist
1932273 there is no single military headquarters tactically commanding all u s forces
1932274 many of these troops and their leaders through general officer level are on their 4th or more combat deployments since 9 11
1932275 we have suffered 36 000 u s killed and wounded their families are getting tired the country is not at war the armed forces and the cia are at war we are at the point of breaking faith with our troops
1932276 simple fact is that our armed forces are not set up to fight a long term war of any size at all with an all volunteer force
1932277 that isnt what the all volunteer force was designed or expected to do it was supposed to be a stop gap until mobilization back in the bad old days of the soviet hordes pouring though fulda so the administration after 9 11 sent the populace shopping and threw the old regulars on the frontier to stop the sioux and then decided that invading canada would be a peachy idea but only using the troops on hand
1932278 hes a man of solid judgment hes just back from afghanistan so theres a certain ring of credibility to his observations unfortunately i think we have to tough it out in afghanistan until we find bin laden but then my personal recommendation would be to find a good way to extricate ourselves and reduce our presence to a minimum
1932279 primary exposition is telling and showing to the audience the time and place of the story the names and relationships of the characters and the nature of the conflict
1932280 within the first pages of a screenplay a reader can judge the relative skill of the writer simply by noting how he handles exposition
1932281 be careful there is a trail of broken relationships behind him
1932282 i know there is a good person in there wanting to come out
1932283 the memories of my father could be put on the back of a postage stamp
1932284 what do you do with a girl when youre through with her
1932285 are you something else im going to have to live through
1932286 what you do not smell is called iocane powder it is odorless tasteless dissolves instantly in liquid and is among the more deadlier poisons known to man
1932287 perfect the pipe is laid the audience knows the name of the poison its properties and how it works more important the audience knows how this scene is going to work one of the men will die from ingesting the poison
1932288 dad was a yankees fan then so of course i rooted for brooklyn but in 58 the dodgers moved away so we had to find other things to fight about
1932289 but you have to be careful that your characters are not talking only in order to get information out if you need to give the audience a bit of information make sure to give the character his own reason to tell us about it thats called making the dialogue
1932290 always ask yourself would the character actually say this or is he only saying it because you need the audience to know some fact or detail if the answer is the latter youre writing exposition and not dialogue thats not good
1932291 we can easily forgive a child who is afraid of the dark the real tragedy of life is when men are afraid of the light
1932292 conquest is not in our principles it is inconsistent with our government
1932293 two of its borders have never been fixed its border with afghanistan was drawn by the british more than a 100 years ago and has never been accepted by afghans its border with india in kashmir has never been accepted by either
1932294 if you want pakistan to provide a secure border you first of all have to have a border that everyone has agreed to
1932295 we need to avoid loose talk about larger military options the notion of moving nato forces into the fata is crazy the notion for us to secure pakistans nuclear arms is even more crazy
1932296 the evidence that is available in the unclassified arena is not conclusive by any means
1932297 india has been quite active in afghanistan it has been one of the major donors of economic assistance to the karzai government given its own economic serious poverty problems at home it is remarkable actually that india has been willing to put in to helping to try to rebuild afghanistan it has also been politically very active in afghanistan it is no secret that president karzais sympathies are much more with india
1932298 an isolated computer is quite never really disconnected from the outside
1932299 im just looking at it as one race at a time i would love to be in the top four the last night but its not something im pressuring myself to do im putting more pressure on myself to be as clean as i can
1932300 when we started i drove three new horses with one broke horse at every show so we got a bunch of nice new horses going when we got around to high river right before calgary i sorted through them and decided this is the crew i wanted for calgary
1932301 theyre not clicking as outfits in the barrels because theyre just a bunch of horses thrown together and you dont have the smoothness in the barrels but theyve got a ton of run and a ton of finish
1932302 theyve passed or caught pretty near everybody ive been hooked with and thats kind of nice
1932303 you get in them good heats turn slower and run behind those outfits that are really running youre out of the traffic and you should be able to stay clean easier

1932320 two and a half years after their arrival the ipkf a large number of their troops died an equal number was injured the indian government spent around 1050 billion us dollars we have to accept these the ipkf came here to disarm young sri lankan militants but what they did was to give back their weapons to them before leaving sri lanka the occurrence of clashes between the ltte and the eprlf is a result of the indian armys presence in fact we can say that the indian army made a mess of it instead of taking back the surrendered weapons with them they gave them to people here

1932355 what is gods plan to make believeable the claim that he is good for people who only know the darkness of slavery and oppression the biblical answer is surprising us and there is no other plan
1932356 jesus didnt come to make us safe he came to make us brave
1932357 we must follow god beyond what we can control and past the limits of our intelligence and strengths and gifts and we will find god does that god wont use our intelligence and strengths and gifts no he will challenge them to a more demanding climb following up an illustration of a mountain hike to heights where we actually need him in order to make it
1932358 problems can slow us down temporarily but they dont have the ability to stop us only we have that power

1932380 it has been given me by the creator this horrible vision that in the times to come the balance which we have so carefully maintained will be rebuked greed will rule the day and the small creatures shall be made to fear the large and the large will likewise fear the small for it will be in the minds of each of your children that surely such a peace and balance can never be maintained they will say such things are not to last and will on that day destroy our balance this is the vision given me and it is the dream i shall bestow upon all of you that you may take heed and warn your children of such things as these

1932382 the words of tobias are too strong i do not believe that naomi wishes to reign over us but i believe that for this destruction of which she speaks that she should be cast out from us thus perhaps this destruction of which she speaks would be appeased
1932383 let not this naomi be cast out nor let her be feared for the words which she speaks are true for i myself have had the same vision thus if you do this unto her i shall surely go where not of you or your seed can reach
1932384 for this that you have done unto me and for the cruelty ye have shown me today let these curses reign forever over your seed that they may forever remember the cruelty of their fathers unto the seed of tobias of the bears i charge that they will be as fierce as the words that tobias spake against me they will be feared because of the fear they have of losing that which they own they shall be as scavengers in the wilderness taking what they can no matter how petty or great and unto the seed of am ram of the wolves i charge that they will walk the wilderness in solitude coming only unto their kindred and coming only when summoned the shall call to the creator when the moon is high for the cruelty of their father and for the loneliness which they feel but shall not be appeased
1932385 xer xes of the eagles do you go to the high places that you may look down upon the troubles that are to befall these poor creatures for you have found grace in the sight of the creator get thee up that ye may not be touched by the troubles of these creatures

1932583 you want to create good tempo you want to be balanced mixing up the run and pass be efficient eliminate the negative plays no stupid penalties and i think we did all those things
1932584 at the end of the day the three different offenses scored 24 points brunell said
1932585 for a preseason opener i dont think thats too bad
1932586 when youre comfortable and you know what youre doing the game slows down a little bit
1932587 he looked smooth in the pocket and his footwork was good i was impressed with his overall play
1932588 its big for us to hopefully keep on a good run here because were far from out of it right now burnett said
1932589 thats the team attitude we want to keep winning ballgames and make it interesting
1932590 i like to hear it come from myself rather than tell the pitching coach to go out and do that gaston said
1932591 when he goes out there hes going to say what he needs to say when i go out there im going to say what i need to say i thought that was the time to go out there and tell him his rhythm wasnt quite good but he picked it up and pitched better
1932592 maybe in the past id get a little frustrated and i could have really put fuel on the fire but ive learned a lot to try and deal with things that happen out there and go as far as i can to try and keep this team in line for a w

1932597 weve got to keep fighting through it until they do
1932598 nascar must obey the law and should focus its full attention on improving the discriminatory and hostile work environment to which employees are subject
1932599 clearly these revelations show that there are always at least two sides to every story nascar said in a statement to the ap
1932600 we are confident that over the course of this process even more facts will come to light and justice will be served
1932601 she has made many threats on my life and job
1932602 she has been spotted in front of my home on several occasions she has contacted all of my family and friends attempting to make threats and slander my name she has also contacted my current girlfriend and i feel she is in jeopardy as well
1932603 despite this apparent smear campaign against mauricia grant nascar has not refuted one single claim ms
1932604 instead nascar suspended two officials in the course of its interminable internal investigation and had previously fired an employee later named in the suit for an undisclosed reason
1932605 i got a little bit nervous and he played well on those points he went for big shots and they worked for him i got a little bit tired
1932606 it took awhile for me to get into the match my legs were heavy he served very well and i wasnt moving well
1932607 he played well but i dont think i played the way i wanted to play said young who lost the final three games of the match
1932608 i had my best win and i couldnt play at the same level
1932609 thats something i have to change i dont think its a matter of the shots or the strategy i think its the mental part of it playing at the same level playing consistently
1932610 its always hard playing an american when youre in the usa so i just tried to focus on the whole match i like the atmosphere here and the people

1932646 instead of helping the rest of the chicago theatre community it hurts it
1932647 i just want you to know before you go that the show is a lot different from jersey boys we definitely are a much smaller production the show does have some laughs but is a lot more cerebral and much more of a drama
1932648 you liked wicked great go see this show at chicago shakespeare now see this smaller show with porchlight at theatre building next see this house theatre show on the chopin mainstage next see this smaller more cerebral show with remy bumppo at vg whatever theyre calling it now finally try this cool new piece at this little venue up in rogers park

1932656 i am so happy that zutano is providing this wonderful farmers market to us employees because i know that my produce is grown locally and is the freshest it can be
1932657 toadstool farm grows many varieties of produce that ive never had before so its fun to try something new
1932658 it is such a nice benefit that the company cares so much about our well being as well as supporting the local farm business
1932659 personally i only care about liu xiang because i feel liu xiang winning the gold medal is tantamount to barack obama winning the presidency in the united states because its about more than sports its about shattering stereotypes that asians are intrinsically not good at track and field

1932667 we believe that our revered paigambar prophet mohammed went to sri lanka through the ram sethu there is also a mausoleum dedicated to him in sri lanka both hindus and muslims should work together to save it ram setu
1932668 my attention was especially drawn to the chapter about the bridge between india and sri lanka the bridge which is hidden in the depths of the sea although invisible in our eyes but not to
1932669 i therefore support the proposal that ram setu should be protected from devastation and put on the unesco world heritage list
1932670 i will use this opportunity to thank you once again for vising zagreh and for the seminars and devoted efforts to spread peace tolerance understanding and conscience about the preservation of planet earth
1932671 sincerely the president of the republic of croatia stjepan mesic
1932672 the gulf of mannar gom which has been declared as the worlds rarest bio diversity reserve by unesco will be destroyed by this action the project envisages the demolition of adams bridge which will result in the mixing up of the waters of the gulf of mannar and palk bay
1932673 the salinity temperature acidity nutrients productivity and bio diversity differ in gulf of mannar and palk bay the moment the waters get mixed up the entire ecology will be disturbed and thats the end of it
1932674 many endangered species like sea turtles sea cow and sea horse could be found only in the gom the palk bay has more than117 species of sea grass it is the sea grass which protect the tamil nadu coast and provide shelter to sea cows
1932675 it is the naturally formed reef barriers which keep the waters of gom and palk bay separated once we demolish this structure the two water regimes will get mixed and the fragile ecology of the entire area would be impaired
1932676 this will destroy the valuable corals of the region there is no way you can save the corals once you start the dredging though the sea is full of energy it is equally sensitive
1932677 the consultants in the detailed project report dpr have taken channel length as 152km for calculation of savings in time charters whereas the actual channel length is 167 22km these difference in channel length and savings in distance will have some impact on the savings of ships
1932678 as regards the comments made on the approach and assumptions adopted in the dpr the main argument against the dpr rests on the distance that will be saved by ships that are coming from europe america africa as they need not come to cape comorin for going around sri lanka
1932679 this observation is valid as the ships coming from europe america africa etc need not come to cape comorin for going around sri lanka to that extent the savings in distance particularly for non coastal cargo will be less
1932680 as a mariner it was good to see the committee admit that the channel is 15 nautical miles longer than what they said and that ships will not be able to travel at eight nautical miles in such a shallow channel
1932681 when the draft available to them is only a couple of meters ships cannot run their propellers because they may run aground
1932682 the numbers of savings are being deliberately vague and it is hard to even make estimated calculations of savings
1932683 it is time for fresh numbers fresh estimates and real estimates that are rooted in real financial analysis
1932684 projects like the sethusamudram could bring in more security problems
1932685 we have just given our word not to talk about it the government will tell us know when it is okay to talk
1932686 it could come from the ltte itself all it needs to do is to scuttle one of the ships transiting the canal at a vulnerable point through sabotage or mine attack a suicide boat can carry out a rocket attack
1932687 so it need not be a major threat but choking and blocking the traffic on the canal
1932688 it is one of the most important strategic choke points a single attack can cause havoc with energy supply in the world
1932689 terrorists want to attack ships plying through narrow straits something that can close the channel down for months since the sethu samudram channel project is creating another narrow channel through the palk strait it can be a potential target and is bound to interest terrorist organizations
1932690 no major scientific study based on threat matrix is available to discourage the construction of the channel
1932691 its thirst for natural resources makes it more important to secure the sea lanes
1932692 it seems the navy and coast guard were simply bypassed while approving this project
1932693 the feasibility of underwater drilling and controlled blasting in the channel
1932694 right now their monitoring is mainly research students following a dredging boat with an environment monitoring machine that measures things like temperature and turbidity when you are dredging the ocean that is not enough
1932695 to do this they must be independent bodies with the right equipment
1932696 this biosphere reserve was established for attempting an integrated approach to resolving the adverse impacts of human activities on the rich biodiversity of this ecologically fragile area
1932697 this whole thing is a big hoax these are not independent bodies and students are doing purely environmental monitoring
1932698 we have asked for photos or videos for the channel but we have not received any new data
1932699 uneconomical and threatens the socio economic status of thousands of fishermen
1932700 the dredging now being carried out will not be of any use since the pit will get easily refilled with silts as both sides of the alignment are occupied by loose sand
1932701 the calculation has been made without any regard for sediment dynamics
1932702 the committee has further concluded that the sethusamudram ship channel will be helpful to the coastal communities by reducing the wave energy of future tsunamis originating from sumatra indonesia and andaman and nicobar regions
1932703 there is no significant influence on physical chemical and biological parameters due dredging in palk strait and adams bridge and that these investigations have indicated the normal productivity and bio diversity in the area
1932704 my own glorious intellect is reflected in its conventional solemnities and what we pirates reck a great deal worse ponderous levities yet i ken not its opaque theme its sine qua nonce

1932710 wenn das nicht mal die schlechteste seereise ist auf der ich je war auf dem deck ist glatteis wenn ich auf dem ausguck bin schneidet der wind wie ein messer durch meine jacke jedes mal wie ich das segel raffe friere ich mir beinahe meine finger ab und alles was ich daf r kriege sind f nf schilling im monat
1932711 ich kann nachts wegen der k lte nicht schlafen die damen auf diesem schiff kriegen nicht so viele decken wie die m nner das ist nicht gerecht
1932712 chingado ich nur kriege halb viel lohn von englisch seemann wir brauchen viel essen um warm zu halten uns in diesem klima und ich kriege nicht anteil der englische kriegt mehr und das schlimmste dass ich kriege nur befehl in englisch und nicht spanisch
1932713 ich habe mehr gr nde mich zu beschweren als andere
1932714 h tten die bleichgesichter nicht das land meiner vorfahren geraubt w rde ich nichtmal auf diesem schiff sein hier bei eisbergen und arktischen winden ich w rde einfach nur mit dem kanu auf einem netten ruhigen see paddeln ich verdiene wiedergutmachung der kapit n sollte mich zumindestens ein w rfelspiel machen lassen damit ich etwas geld verdienen kann
1932715 gestern nannte mich der erste maat ein fr chtchen nur weil ich schw nze lutsche ich habe das recht schw nze zu lutschen ohne solche namen daf r zu kriegen
1932716 es sind nicht nur menschen die auf diesem schiff schlecht behandelt werden
1932717 deshalb weil ich letzte woche den zweiten maat sah wie er den schiffshund zweimal trat
1932718 dies alles ist schrecklich es ist unmoralisch es ist rassismus sexismus speziesmus homophobie und ausbeutung der arbeiterklasse es ist diskriminierung wir m ssen soziale gerechtigkeit walten lassen wiedergutmachun f r die indianer genausoviel decken f r die frauen ein gew hrleistetes recht auf sexuelle selbstbestimmung und das gebot keine hunde mehr zu treten
1932719 hem ihr habt alle gute gr nde euch zu beschweren aber es sieht f r mich so aus dass das was wir wirklich tun sollten ist das schiff herumzudrehen und zur ck nach s den zu segeln denn w rden wir weiter nach norden fahren w rden wir fr her oder sp ter auflaufen und dann ist euer lohn sind eure decken und eure schwulenrechte f r nichts mehr gut weil wir alle ertrunken sind
1932720 wir offiziere m ssen zugeben dass ein paar unentschuldbare dinge auf diesem schiff passiert sind wir haben nicht erkannt wie schlecht die situation war bis wir die beschwerden vernahmen wir sind m nner mit gutem willen und wollen euch gerechtes tun aber nun ja der kapit n ist ein wenig konservativ und eingestellt auf seine methoden und muss etwas angestubst werden bevor er ein paar dauerhafte nderungen durchsetzt meine pers nliche meinung ist dass ihr falls ihr leidenschaftlich aber immer friedvoll und ohne die schiffsregeln zu verletzen protestiertet den kapit t aus seiner tr gheit sch tteln und ihn dazu zwingen k nntet sich um die probleme zu k mmern ber die ihr euch beschwert
1932721 sechs schilling im monat sind ein hungerlohn und ich friere mir immernoch meine finger ab wenn ich das segel raffe
1932722 ich kriege wieder nicht so viel lohn wie die englischsprachigen oder genug essen f r dieses klima
1932723 wir frauen haben immernoch nicht genug decken um uns warm zu halten
1932724 es ist wirklich schrecklich dass der hund getreten wird wenn er etwas brot aus der kaj te stiehlt und dass frauen nicht gleich viele decken haben und dass der f hige seemann seine finger abfriert und ich wei nicht wieso der bootsmann nicht schwul sein kann wenn er will aber seht euch an wie nahe die eisberge nun sind und wie der wind h rter und h rter weht wir m ssen das schiff zur ck nach s den bringen denn wenn wir dabei bleiben nach norden zu segeln werden wir auflaufen und ertrinken
1932725 es ist so schrecklich dass wir weiter nach norden segeln aber wieso soll ich im schrank schw nze lutschen wieso sollte ich fr chtchen genannt werden bin ich nicht genauso gut wie jeder andere
1932726 aber siehst du es nicht das ist genau der grund warum frauen mehr decken brauchen um sich warm zu halten ich fordere gleichviele decken f r frauen jetzt
1932727 dass das segeln gen norden uns gro e m hsal auferlegt aber den kurs gen s den zu ndern w re unrealistisch man kann die zeit nicht zur ckdrehen wir m ssen einen reifen weg finden mit der situation umzugehen
1932728 wenn wir die vier wahnsinnigen oben auf dem hinterdeck ihre ideen durchsetzen lassen werden wir alle ertrinken falls wir das schiff je au erhalb der gefahr bringen k nnen wir uns ber die arbeitsbedingungen und ber die decken f r frauen beschweren und eine schwulenbewegung gr nden aber zuerst m ssen wir das schiff umdrehen wenn ein paar von uns sich zusamment ten um einen plan zu machen und etwas mut zu zeigen k nnten wir uns selbst erretten es w rde nicht viele brauchen sechs oder acht w rden es tun wir k nnten das achterdeck st rmen die wahnsinnigen ber bord schmei en und das schiff gen s den f hren
1932729 ich glaube der kapit n muss wieder wachger ttelt werden es w rde helfen wenn ihr alle noch einmal protestiert solang es gewaltlos bleibt
1932730 seht ihr nicht was der kapit n und die matrosen tun sie besch ftigen euch mit euren trivialen beschwerden ber decken und l hne und dass der hund getreten wird sodass ihr nicht dar ber nachdenkt was mit diesem schiff wirklich nicht stimmt dass es weiter und weiter in den norden kommt und wir alle ertrinken werden wenn nur ein paar von euch zur vernunft kommen w rden zusammenkommen w rden und das achterdeck st rmten k nnten wir das schiff umdrehen und uns retten aber alles was ihr tut ist euch ber kleine probleme wie arbeitsbedingungen und schwulenrechte aufzuregen
1932731 denkst du dass es angemessen ist dass ich nur 3 4 des lohns vom englischsprachigen segler kriege ist das kleinlich
1932732 weisst du nicht wie erniedrigend es ist fr chtchen genannt zu werden
1932733 diese probleme sind alle nicht kleinlich und trivial den hund zu treten ist grausam und brutal und es ist erniedigend fr chtchen genannt zu werden aber im vergleich zu unserem wirklichen problem im vergleich zu der tatsache dass das schiff immernoch nach norden segelt sind eure missst nde winzig und trivial denn wenn wir dieses schiff nicht bald umdrehen werden wir alle ertrinken

1932751 and then you throw the pass rush in and it kind of threw them off theres a lot of good stuff for the film to be studied
1932752 if we can compete and be consistent while moving the ball against our own defense it should make things a lot easier when we play against other teams that are less familiar with our offense
1932753 when you can beat your own defense which knows your plays and beat them every day then we can beat anybody in the country thats where we need to get to beat these guys every day
1932754 it gives us a little leeway with our initial plan
1932755 we got better from the first to the second day
1932756 we had new plays in the third so well be better
1932757 weve got a good defense were always going to get a good look from them its good for us to go against them theyre going to be one of the better defenses we face this season

1932852 there are places where there are no markers at least not easily found
1932853 theres no line painted in the sand or anything like that
1932854 were working with the mexican government to make sure that this doesnt happen again this cant be happening
1932855 it seems that there are dissimilar versions of what happened and both countries are trying to clarify it together

1932868 they have all their front end loaders excavators and backhoes and have pretty much moved that debris off

1932870 i started at 4 30 this morning and i got up here about 2 30 they kept telling us four hours four hours and now its about eight hours but theres nothing you can do

1932878 i dont want people to feel like that i just want them to be proud of our police and proud to live in prince georges county
1932879 you could argue that nobody is ever ready to be president i mean i certainly learned a lot about the job in the first year
1932880 the constitution sets qualifications for the president and then the people decide who they think would be the better president i think we have two choices i think he should win and i think he will win

1932890 i am really focused and enjoying being back in the senate and working on behalf of my new york constituents this is sen obamas decision and his alone and i am going to respect the privacy of that process by not discussing it

1933044 the findings indicated that online and store purchasers are less likely to adhere to healthy eye care practices as recommended by their eye doctors
1933045 those who bought contact lenses at their doctors office followed a number of fda recommendations more so than those who bought contact lenses elsewhere
1933046 although buying contacts online can be more cost effective and convenient we strongly urge patients to understand that there are risks involved to wearing contact lenses
1933047 because of this its necessary that patients visit their eye doctor on a regular basis and communicate any recent visual changes and discomfort experienced as a result of contact lens wear

1933058 the tamil tigers in sri lanka became a non muslim and non middle eastern early adopter in 1987
1933059 alternatively the ltte especially at the outset conceptualized suicide attacks very differently they used suicide bombing more as a substitute for military operations they could not complete with conventional means making them asymmetric but closer to the traditional military sense of the term the tamils thought about suicide bombing more for hard targets and assassinations not necessarily targeting civilians though civilians often died in their attacks

1933160 in some cases in addition to the mission there is the sense of mission that is a feeling that the group has banded together to create something new and exciting this is common in new organizations
1933161 goals or objectives state what is to be achieved and when results are to be accomplished but they do not state how the results are to be achieved
1933162 a strategy is a pattern or plan that integrates an organizations major goals policies and action sequences into a cohesive whole

1933182 they dont want findings it makes waves and draws attention so they avoid those types of things so the higher ups dont come down on them

1933184 and is taking every step necessary to review and address the issues cited in the report dcaa is committed to supporting any review of its procedures and is prepared to take immediate action to fix any problems found
1933185 in my opinion the end result was a massive bloated soulless bureaucracy that totally lost touch with the taxpayer
1933186 in the end defense contractors big and small are getting away with murder because they know we at dcaa are slaves to the metrics
1933187 theres got to be a balance somewhere but i think in dcaa headquarters strive to become a lean mean audit machine they swung the pendulum too far to the right
1933188 and by doing that they kind of shot themselves in the foot
1933189 not to make waves with these people and to do what i was asked
1933190 i was told that i could call the 800 hot line if i wanted
1933191 however i was reminded that gs 13 positions were coming open and that if i wanted to be promoted i should not report the fraud outside the agency i did not call the hot line
1933192 my understanding was that when contractors complain about any particular auditor bad things happen to that auditor
1933193 when i was there i always had to keep in mind how i interacted with the contractor because if the contractor complained about me it would definitely get back to my supervisor and there would be some sort of personnel actions or retaliation

1933340 tidak benar menyuruh bayi belajar misalnya dengan flash card karena ini adalah overstimulation seorang pakar bermain brian sutton smith menegaskan ini sudah termasuk cognitive child labor atau secara kognitif anak sudah dipekerjakan terlalu keras
1933341 di sana yang lebih ditekankan adalah faktor kognitifnya padahal di usia awal pertumbuhan yang harus dikembangkan adalah senses nya sensomotorik bukan memori artinya bukan melatih memori secara khusus dengan diperlihatkan flash card itu sudah termasuk belajar yang sepertinya ada target yang ingin dicapai jadi sudah bukan bermain lagi
1933342 tentu penelitian itu ada yang pro dan kontra ada yang mengatakan itu bagus tetapi kontra juga sudah mengatakan bukti bukti bahwa itu tidak baik bagi perkembangan anak karena masa anak adalah masa bermain di mana mereka tak bisa dituntut untuk diam dan belajar dengan suatu materi
1933343 dari hasil penelitian menunjukkan rangsangan terlalu dini yang sifatnya overstimulation ketika anak sudah bisa membaca hanya merupakan percepatan yang bersifat sementara tetapi saat mereka sudah menginjak kelas 4 sd dan prestasinya dibandingkan tidak ada perbedaan yang signifkan
1933344 di situ apa dikemukakan glenn doman dimentahkan melalui penelitian psikologis para ahli yang dilibatkan dalam riset itu adalah psikiater ahli neurologi psikolog anak pendidik anak
1933345 ketika anaknya diajarkan lalu mereka frustasi nah itu bahayanya metode ini juga dapat memancing orang tua untuk membenarkan bahwa sejak bayi anak harus belajar
1933346 flash card hanya gambar gambar yang tidak faktual lebih baik mereka belajar misalnya apa itu bola dengan cara memagang dan memainkannya karena yang penting dalam tahap ini adalah sensomotor semua indera perlu dirangsang jadi anak tidak hanya belajar dengan melihat dan mengingat kartu kartu itu
1933347 pada anak usia setahun misalnya sambil dipangku kita perlihatkan gambar mobil lalu lihat juga mobil ayah seperti apa jadi

1933352 nurses have become more skilled clinically and are now capable of taking on more responsibility to help address the doctor shortage
1933353 as our population ages and gets sicker we need to look at better ways to meet that increasing demand and nurses and midwives should be central in any new approach
1933354 this is a major challenge for us in the face of a national and international shortage of nurses
1933355 but we are making ground the nsw nursing and midwiferies workforce is now over 43 000 an increase of more than 9000 since 2002 and i look forward to that number continuing to grow
1933356 the deal we struck is i believe a special recognition of the value the government holds for nurses and midwives
1933357 nurses and midwives in nsw are again the highest paid in the country and of all it is deserved

1933385 a man with 10 wives would collapse and die but my own power is given by allah that is why i have been able to control 86 of them
1933386 i dont go looking for them they come to me i will consider the fact that god has asked me to do it and i will just marry them
1933387 to my understanding the koran does not place a limit and it is up to what your own power your own endowment and ability allows
1933388 god did not say what the punishment should be for a man who has more than four wives but he was specific about the punishment for fornication and adultery
1933389 as soon as i met him the headache was gone
1933390 god told me it was time to be his wife praise be to god i am his wife now

1933395 our results show both the left and right sides of the rowers hearts are larger and function at an enhanced capacity compared with those of controls
1933396 the causes of this are not completely clear it could be due to the production of growth factors such as igf 1 during training
1933397 people do have different levels of igf 1 naturally although elite athletes do tend to have higher levels

1933407 the songs on this record are so different from one another
1933408 they shouldnt make sense together but somehow as a record it works its some of the heaviest stuff weve done but also some of the more delicate i think the b sides on the vinyl will highlight that best
1933409 i did one other cameo in the pilot but i didnt secure to chouse a scene through jeremy piven

1933428 oh well i guess this will be my new dwelling well lets not think about the future for now im starving lets eat
1933429 timely truthful helpful and spoken with a mind of good will
1933430 government should be neutral as to conceptions of the good life government should not affirm through its policies or laws any particular conception of the good life instead it should provide a neutral framework of rights within which people can choose their own values and ends
1933431 liberalism undermines itself by pretending to be above the battle by pretending to be neutral lots of liberals say its only a set of procedures and rules but i would suggest that liberalism is one of the players its not a referee and that liberalism needs to recognize that it too has a vision and that even in claiming neutrality it thereby forfeits a kind of neutrality because by always trying to seek the higher ground it ends up pushing people out of an ethical position
1933432 one of the central principles of the law in judaism is kindness to the stranger and one of the central principles of christianity is love of the neighbor
1933433 in some way those are more powerful foundations for thinking about society than liberalism if you want a society with both solidarity and freedom in it
1933434 there is the case where a monk has developed insight preceded by tranquility as he develops insight preceded by tranquility the path is born he follows that path develops it and pursues it as he follows the path developing it and pursuing it his fetters are abandoned his obsessions destroyed
1933435 we generally react in one of two ways to strong negative feelings that arise in us one is to get lost in it fixated with it we can do 100 good things in a day but that one bad thing that we did we spend all evening or all week remembering it dwelling on it worrying about it blaming ourselves for it we can get fixated and obsessed with feeling the other way to react to strong feelings is to have aversion which can take two forms anger which is the outgoing expressive form of aversion and fear which is the ingoing frozen form of aversion we can try to block out negative feelings crazily trying everything we can think of to avoid it block it out not feel it but there is a third way which neither gets lost in negative feeling nor becomes fearful and angry that third way relates to negative feeling neutrally neither pushing it away or getting lost inside it that middle ground is mindfulness
1933436 to know our intentions before we speak and to know our intentions we need mindfulness this middle ground ive described is very subtle but its a ground we cultivate in meditation
1933437 will saying what i have the urge to say right now really serve my goals in relationship with this person and in my life
1933438 speech is so powerful yet so ephemeral compared to action a word said 20 years ago can still resound these questions are a kind of training which implies imperfection
1933439 the reason it is so powerful is that its where the energy of a communication really lies intention contains the karmic seed of communication
1933440 there is mutual inner and outer awareness at the same time in order to determine the best action or speech
1933441 can you be mindful of every word no but we can be aware of the waves of emotion and feeling that relates to intention
1933442 there are three aspects to every action or speech there is the intention behind it there is the skillfullness of the action and there is the immediate response to the action we tend to ground our identities only in the third aspect and to ignore the first two yet the first two are by far the most important plus there is also a longterm response to a communication that we also usually fail to take into account
1933443 that finally all they will be saying to each other is its a lovely day isnt it
1933444 listening is the key to good communication when you listen well you are listening to yourself as well as them especially to your reactions thoughts patterns and so on
1933445 then i ask myself do i tell him because i want my significant other to know whats going on with me or do i want to tell him just because its a juicy disaster or maybe i should just shut up about the whole thing
1933446 at home i live with people who talk constantly about the bush administration in the harshest and most negative terms not that i disagree with that but their talk is so nonstop bitter and toxic i just want to scream it wouldnt be so bad if once in a while they got up and did something but they never do they just bitch and gripe and moan
1933447 anger is often a useful fuel for speech such as truth telling but there is some danger in being so close to that anger all the time
1933448 youre drained because your doing all things i ask of you in your own strength you arent made to do this alone let me help you
1933449 do nothing out of selfish ambition of vein conceit but consider others better than yourselves each of you should look not only to your own interests but also to the interests of others
1933450 beloved let us love one another because love is of god and everyone that loves is born of god and knows god whoever does not love does not know god because god is love
1933451 you arent really fully alive until you have or are more less striving towards

1933454 i need it to be okay with you for me to feel something
1933455 shoppers care more than ever about the kinds of foods they buy and a growing number of consumers especially want to know where their foods came from and how they were raised or grown

1933644 its not the job of the government to make things easy for the opposition
1933645 i leave it to the government im happy with the way things are
1933646 if the government is no longer as efficient as it is today then large grcs will be an issue because they mean people wont have much choice at the polls
1933647 only one third of the seats were contested that was why i joined the opposition

1933668 doctors are not gods and you have to remember that no ones going to care about you as much as you are
1933669 sitting in a 103 degree tub for prolonged periods of time may impair sperm quality
1933670 when you go to the doctor and you say youre having trouble getting pregnant they might tell you to just keep trying
1933671 but if youve been using an ovulation kit you can prove to the doctor youve been trying at the right time of the month
1933672 theres definitely a need to be proactive but not panicky
1933673 if theyre not open seven days a week theyre manipulating your cycle to fit their schedule
1933674 it turned out she was on the same cycle i was and we became cycle buddies
1933675 id talk to her for hours about the size of my follicles and the fluffiness of the lining of my uterus believe me no one else including your husband wants to talk endlessly about those details
1933676 if you feel like your doctor isnt paying attention to your case or you feel like youre just a number or youre not having success after several cycles its really ok to ask for a second opinion
1933677 and if your doctor isnt ok with that thats reason enough for you not to be there
1933678 your sexual lives are now open for scrutiny your financial lives may be in jeopardy the time commitment tends to interfere with work
1933679 you dont need to put pilots in a vehicle where you are only collecting data providing you can do it safely
1933680 thats going to drive savings in weight which will drive savings in fuel costs so where you see normal routine data gathering operations by manned aviation today i would see that gradually being transferred over to uavs in the next 20 years
1933681 it has a back up so we can take control of the vehicle if we need to and fly it manually
1933682 it tells you the difference between green crops that are photosynthesising and bare ground
1933683 the more dense the crop the less fertiliser you need to apply
1933684 we know you can get good maps of this sort from manned aircraft but its so difficult to get an aircraft to the field you need it in at the time you need it there and its also very expensive
1933685 we can see uavs extending a long way because we know that its useful for monitoring forestry and detecting disease in crops
1933686 the cost of living is crazy right now with two kids gas prices and rent im living paycheck to paycheck
1933687 we are seeing an increase in inquiries but were not sure if its due to the economy or increased awareness
1933688 i know thats why they call us for that financial remuneration
1933689 they dont like to openly admit that but some people are saying that
1933690 i think there is a spike more for financial reasons
1933691 its important to understand that if a young woman walks into a clinic and says she wants to be an egg donor the clinic doesnt just sit down and say sure and hand them money
1933692 there are national guidelines its a tightly orchestrated stringent process
1933693 its six to eight weeks of poking and probing and blood work
1933694 in an ideal world it would be nice to not have to give financial compensation
1933695 but i work for a living trying to help people and i get paid for it is that ok yeah i think thats ok
1933696 the best thing ive ever been in my life is a mom and to help someone else is a cool opportunity
1933697 knowing that it works is much better than the money
1933698 china is trying to project a picture and a narrative about the olympics

1933701 so theyve got people reporting down to the lowest neighborhood level which is not new overlaid by state of the art technology its the best of the old and the new
1933702 if we see any suspicious people we call the police and report on them
1933703 we are happy to help protect our motherland assist the nation and help our leaders relax
1933704 its getting better in china but we still have a ways to go

1933719 they are never held accountable and the united states government will undoubtedly brush this off as another case of oh well they didnt know they were in the united states it is fortunate that this incident didnt end in a very ugly gunfight
1933720 law enforcement operations have led from time to time to innocent incursions by both u s and mexican law enforcement personnel and military units into the territory of both nations

1933779 lester let me give you a hand with that armoire
1933780 to protect freedom of expression freedom of religion and freedom of opinion in your country including tibet
1933781 ensure that human rights defenders are no longer intimidated or imprisoned
1933782 your decision on these issues will determine the success the olympic games and the image the world will have of china in the future
1933783 such retractions take place against a general backdrop of fear in terms of freedom of expression and censorship surrounding the beijing olympic games
1933784 they also further highlight the failure of the international olympic committee to show clear moral leadership ahead of the games
1933785 athletes should feel free to express their personal opinions on human rights without fear or favour
1933786 if you are a person whose voice resonates around the world then it is your responsibility to try and effect positive change
1933787 to me it is remarkable that we want to say athletes should shut up and just play
1933788 in everyday context they are good enough to tell us what cereals to eat what shoes to wear about anti obesity or whatever but when it comes to a fundamental tenet of human rights somehow they are not good enough
1933789 if we want them to be holistic role models then lets let them be holistic role models
1933790 the legacy of most elite athletes is to be completely vanilla
1933791 i played basketball for many years and the idea that my legacy to this world is putting a ball in a hole is unsatisfactory to me
1933792 if people are satisfied they can play a great forehand volley or make a birdie from a bunker if thats enough for them then i cannot comment
1933793 but it is not enough of a legacy when the opportunity to change the world is in your grasp
1933794 it is very convenient to suggest that human rights are political
1933795 the universal charter of human rights says that this is not the case and this is something every country of the olympic community has signed up to
1933796 i am not asking athletes to embarrass the chinese people they have worked hard i am not asking for a boycott
1933797 there have been improvements i applaud the chinese government for that and i am not demonising the people of china but they need support from people who can speak up and perhaps make an impact
1933798 the chinese government puts people first and is dedicated to maintaining and promoting its citizens basic rights and freedom
1933799 we firmly oppose any words or acts that interfere in other countries internal affairs using human rights and religion and other issues
1933800 theres nothing more powerful than an idea whose time has come
1933801 this crime was compounded by law enforcement when it illegally invaded the calvo home tied up the mayor and his mother in law and killed the family dogs

1933803 my first idea was that it would be really funny to see emo kids doing musical theatre
1933804 i felt like they were polar opposite ideas and would do well together with the happiness of musical theatre juxtaposed with the sadness of emo
1933805 i realized that yes they are opposite in this sense but they also have a lot in common since they both involve this incredibly over emotionality
1933806 what is wrong with me why am i so goddam lonely i have friends i think god i dont even know if i do anymore who are my friends and who are my enemies do my friends care about me would my friends go to my funeral if i were to die tomorrow or would they have more important plans

1933808 how to handle tantrums why you need to read to your children at a young age fine motor skill development its an ongoing thing you cant just get a list of parenting skills and go home and think its going to work you need that continual reinforcement
1933809 its difficult for the parents to be on the same page there are different sets of values from different families in a group situation you have to come to a meeting of minds and put what is best for the child first
1933810 its like acquiring a new set of in laws its an extra family commitment youre all connected
1933811 a lot of other parents go through the same challenges
1933812 its very comforting to hear that and the way other parents handle it
1933813 its about being part of the circle which we call community at any level whether you call it the immediate neighborhood the immediate next neighborhood which is your city or your next neighborhood which is your state you are going to become better participants of democracy if you are in this kind of a system you actually see an effect of what you do or dont do in your immediate environs
1933814 it surfaced an intelligent organized discussion in our school about alternative cleaning products what they were how to use them the differences among them when they were appropriate
1933815 we created written instructions posted guidelines and had a parent education process
1933816 you know their friends you know their teacher you know their friends families
1933817 its so important to be able to talk to your kid about school
1933818 its a huge time investment i guess thats the only drawback because its an amazing experience and i know my child is benefiting tremendously from it and its great to get to know everyone intimately well but its a lot of work
1933819 omniplex was built upon the belief that there is a moral high ground in business our customers know that our mission statement is grounded to that value our success is guided by this principle and it reflects our commitment to quality and continuous improvement and is validated in our client satisfaction ratings and sustained annual growth

1933827 i feel cheated that its all up to me by being in the younger generation i have to save the world before i can even begin to think of building a life for myself or there will be nothing to build my life on
1933828 the future is in your hands today the torch passes from one generation to the next
1933829 if you cant find what we were unable to find and our parents were unable to find and their parents were unable to find which is another way for us to go then you may very well live to see the extinction of the human race
1933830 by being in the younger generation i have to save the world before i can even begin to think of building a life for myself or there will be nothing to build my life on
1933831 is put in a double bind by a command or request that contains a concealed contradiction stop being self conscious try to relax society as we now have it pulls this trick on every child from earliest infancy in the first place the child is taught that he is responsible that he is a free agent an independent origin of thoughts and actions he accepts this make believe for the very reason that it is not true he cant help accepting it just as he cant help accepting membership in the community where he was born he has no way of resisting this kind of social indoctrination it is constantly reinforced with reward and punishments it is built into the basic structure of the language he is learning we befuddle our children hopelessly because we as adults were once so befuddled and remaining so do not understand the game we are playing
1933832 is taught that he is responsible that he is a free agent an independent origin of thoughts and actions
1933833 theres nothing to wait for theres no one to wait for no one is going to save the world but the people of the world and you cant make it the sole responsibility of my generation we are the ones with no experience no clout no connections no power no money and its all supposed to be up to us what are you going to be doing while we save the world

1933844 vtxt hi this is daniel odio i am leaving this as a message on my voicemail which might sound a little strange to you because youre probably reading this on my blog but thats the beauty of callwaves voice transcription service which is an automated transcription service that they have created callwave service allows for speech to be transcribed into text which is then sent to the user as a text message or as an email or both and so you can read your voicemail which is a very strange concept to most people so let me just repeat how it works you can actually read your voicemail by whenever somebody leaves a message on your voicemail it then gets transcribed by callwave com into text and that text is then sent to you via text message on your phone or to your email or both its a pretty neat service and i found that the accuracy is generally very good well see how it is once this gets transcribed into text but generally i find it to be very good let me go ahead and just give my number so that you can see how a number transcribed its 202 250 3846 and what im going to do is im going to copy this text message that i get into my blog and post it as a blog posting which also raises a lot of other possibilities about posting audio you know in text form and not having to actually write everything out so enjoy it and check the tool out im very impressed

1933901 a russian advertising executive who sued her boss for sexual harassment lost her case after a judge ruled that employers were obliged to make passes at female staff to ensure the survival of the human race
1933902 in the u s acts that might classify as harassment include sexual abuse unwanted invitations suggestions of acts as quid pro quo coercion and touching in addition according to american laws employees should keep a distance of 40 cm from one another
1933903 but in russia victims of sexual harassment rarely go to court fearing that it would be futile they would lose their job and tarnish their reputation after all the blame is often shifted to the victims of these crimes

1933905 sex at work is a good cure for a boring life

1933987 april who am i gonna go get wings with now
1933988 but asia was always supposed to be there for me to get wings with too
1933989 hell no a few of her whiny pouts later and before i knew it i was over at her place downing shots of the cheap vodka that only college students drink and we were on our way to the bar she was always telling me that she knew i could do it and that even if i wanted to quit shed still be there for me i kept going through twenty weeks six days and my blood sweat and tears to get what i wanted that was time that i wasnt able to spend as much time with her as before but we managed to squeeze in lots of time and she kept my spirits up after i crossed we ate at jims wings and neither one of us could do nothing but smile the whole time because i was finally able to eat and drink without having to hide from anyone anymore i had just gotten my fraternity brand on my arm and as she looked across the table at the burned flesh on my arm she just smiled and told me how proud of me she was i smiled almost like it was my mother herself telling me that we sat there in jims talked and enjoyed our wings and beer that day one of our last times ever that plane ride back to her funeral damn near killed me i still feel that pain as if it was yesterday i still remember hot tears running down my face the entire time i was in the airport on the plane and even when i landed chrisheena came to pick me up from the airport and i remember seeing her with tears in my eyes and crying when she came over to hug me i was happy to see her but sad to be there for such a dismal event i was hoping i wouldnt see mr or mrs mays and break down on them that was the last thing they would need to see another crying face when i got there i shook mr mays hand and gave mrs mays a hug we all talked and they told me about everything and thanked me for being such a good friend to not long after i was there a friend of the family came over and he and mr mays went outside to talk a few minutes later mr mays asked me to come outside so he could talk to me all i heard was that he had something he needed for me to do as he shuffled me into the car i got in the car with the friend of the family who was also named mr mays and we took off driving somewhere in colorado springs on the way there this mr mays told me where we were going and i was blown away you see we were going to the funeral home apparently the funeral home had called and said there was a problem with i immediately start panicking i wasnt ready to see her not like that thoughts raced around in my head as to how i could get out of it i didnt even go see my own mother in the funeral home and there i was on the way to see one of my best friends in a funeral home i walked into the funeral home with mr mays and we were met by the funeral home beautician and led toward a backroom i felt them almost buckling and i thought i was going to faint there is nothing like seeing your best friend covered in a white sheet i wont ever get that image out of my head the beautician explained the problem and i told her what to do with mr mays asked me if i was alright and i had to go and sit down those hot salty tears started running down my face as if someone had turned on a faucet i tried i really tried hard not to cry the dose of reality i had just seen reminded me of what my mother used to frequently tell me we are not promised tomorrow someone got me a cup of water and i thought of how proud i was of myself for keeping it together while i was in the backroom i dont usually handle death well as we left the funeral home to go back to the house i tried to get my mind off of everything but i couldnt my stomach started to churn as i realized that was my first task over this agonizing trip i would have to go to the viewing of the body as well as the funeral asias father had asked me to say something at the funeral when i spoke to him on the phone before i got to and i had been working on something but i was still having a problem putting our relationship into words so many laughs cries great times good food and good drinks over the course of those years and i was supposed to condense it all into something that would memorialize one of the best people i ever knew asias body lying there was the dose of reality that i needed to finish writing what i was going to say at the funeral on the day of the funeral i was severely depressed some of my best friends came down to colorado springs to attend asias funeral khala and her husband west and chrisheena and we all went out to dennys for lunch before the funeral i barely ate or spoke much throughout lunch but i tried hard to be myself although im sure my attempts were futile back at chrisheenas apartment my fraternity brother deonte showed up and gave me a hug he told me to be strong and i was really trying to but a man can only be so strong and can only take so much i sat down and continued to write what i was going to say abut and i met about five years ago in college at an rotc function it was her first few days at csu as she was just leaving the air force academy and it was my first few days there as well as i was just getting out of the air force to go to college at the rotc meeting i was paying attention to the person that was speaking when she was late as i soon would find out over the course of our friendship timeliness was not one of her strong points i didnt notice her at first for whatever reason how i managed that feat still puzzles me because it wasnt until we had finished our meals that our journey toward one of the best friendships either one of us would ever have began once the meal was over and the bill came i forgot my wallet

1934456 we lost our family dogs we did it at the hands of sheriffs deputies who burst through our front door rifles blazing

1934460 they didnt know my name all they knew was my wifes name they matched that to the registration of the car

1934466 i would say that the dogs presented a threat i would imagine to the special operations situation

1934539 i dare say ill make her laugh but only after youve agreed to marry us if she is not delighted within one hour of our engagement the wedding can be called off

1934552 de eeuw van mijn vader begon in de tinten bruin en zwart in de geuren van hout en teer in zweet ijzer en aarde maar daarachter scheen een stralend optimisme een geloof in vooruitgang techniek en de nieuwe mens die zou komen de voorafgaande eeuwen werden beschouwd als duister onze voorouders waren dood en ver weg maar de nieuwe arbeider de verlichte onderwijzer de democratische politicus de wetenschapper en de predikant die de dogmas achter zich gelaten had zij zeilden naar een tijd die anders zou zijn dan al het voorgaande nu na honderd jaar van bloed en idealen weten we meer het is tijd om onze historische arrogantie los te laten om bruggen te slaan door de tijd om naast de voorgaande generaties te gaan staan de betere mens dat zijn we niet geworden onze grootouders en overgrootouders waren anders maar niet slechter of minder dat besef maakt de historie gecompliceerder het maakt de vraag knellender wat zouden wij gedaan hebben als we in hun schoenen stonden met hun achtergrond en wat ze op dat moment wisten maar tegelijk maakt het de nabijheid groter en doorbreekt het onze eenzaamheid in de geschiedenis

1934554 sesuatu yang tidak diatur dalam konstitusi tidak otomatis inkonstitusional dalam hukum sesuatu yang tidak dilarang tetapi juga tidak dianjurkan berarti boleh dilaksanakan atau tidak dilaksanakan

1934567 negritude and the other concepts spoke to the essence of blackness in a philosophical cultural artistic and empowering way something that hadnt been done on a worldwide scale except for
1934568 in 1988 congress passed and president reagan signed an act apologizing to the 120 000 japanese americans who were held in detention camps during world war ii the 60 000 detainees who were alive at the time each received 20 000 from the government

1934570 the philosophy of yoga as espoused by the ancient egyptians incorporated no less than four words whose exact meanings are equal to the indian word
1934571 if anyone suggests that it is disgraceful to fashion base images of the divine and most holy orders it is sufficient to answer that the most holy mysteries are set forth in two modes one by means of similar and sacred representations akin to their nature and the other to unlike forms designed with every possible discordance
1934572 the word which appeared as a pillar of flame out of the darkness is the son of god born of the mystery of the mind the name of the word is

1934575 firestone was barely impacted by the bloody genocidal wars that rocked liberia in 1989 and 2003
1934576 continued to function basically as it did in 1926 the workers were trapped in a medieval nightmare that never ended even as the world moved on
1934577 if you consider global economic factors the increasing price of energy and russia having an economy so heavily dependent on that then of course the weakening dollar three years ago 100 000 euros was roughly 100 000 now 100 000 euros is 160 000 without any other factors changing
1934578 one definite perk of a euro deal however is the free housing utilities maintenance cars health care and flights home that regularly come as part of a package and often escape the taxmans attention
1934579 his american ancestors came over to europe but he doesnt resemble them in outward appearance
1934580 billions of dollars in tax rebates the centerpiece of the governments 168 billion stimulus package spurred more spending in some areas by consumers a major force shaping overall economic activity spending on furniture and household appliances went up while people cut spending on cars

1934584 hip hop was created in the poorest congressional district in america the south bronx where i was born and grew up these were young people who had nothing and have created not only a multi billion dollar industry but have created an international way that we can all speak to each other i think the fact that we have that and that hip hop can be found in palestine in ghana in venezuela in cuba in brooklyn and american indian reservations speaks to the power of it it also makes me understand why we are always being attacked and why they are always attacking the hip hop community

1934591 neter sheds light on they who shake the clouds of error from their soul and sight the brilliancy of truth mingling themselves with the all sense of the divine intelligence through love of which they win their freedom from that part over which death rules and has the seed of the assurance of future deathlessness implanted in him this then is how the good will differ from the bad
1934592 if you seek neter god you seek for the beautiful one is the path that leads unto neter god devotion joined with gnosis
1934593 for the ill of ignorance does pour over all the earth and overwhelm the soul thats battened down w in the body preventing it from finding salvation
1934594 the purpose of all human life is to achieve a state of consciousness apart from bodily concerns
1934595 man is to become god like through a life of virtue and the cultivation of the spirit through scientific knowledge practice and the spirit control the senses the reward will be a clear insight
1934596 make your life the subject of intense inquiry in this way you will discover its goal direction and destiny
1934597 glory like a shadow flies from they who pursue it but it follows at the heels of they who would fly from it if you court it w o merit you shall never attain it if you deserve it though you hide your self it will never forsake you
1934598 purification of the heart consciousness leads to the highest good eternal life and supreme peace

1934600 mind as matter may be transmuted from state to state degree to degree condition to condition pole to pole and vibration to vibration transmutation is a mental art

1934608 allen st pierre spokesman for the national organization for the reform of marijuana laws likened franks proposal co sponsored by rep ron paul r texas to current laws dealing with alcohol consumption alcohol use is permitted and the government focuses its law enforcement efforts on those who abuse alcohol or drive under its influence he said

1934612 no legitimate purpose since the villains and victims are long since deceased
1934613 five states did something over the past 12 months that no state had done before expressed regret or apologized for slavery this year congress which meets in a capitol built partly by slaves will consider issuing its own apology
1934614 it taps into white guilt and helps perpetuate social programs the civil rights establishment likes such as racial preferences and ultimately reparations
1934615 leveling the playing field contrary to popular belief this isnt the first time teh u s a has apologized for past misdeeds
1934616 the senate has no record of any prior effort to apologize for slavery in the house of representatives tony hall an ohio democrat proposed one in 1997 and rep john conyers d mich has tried since 1989 to pass a bill that would create a commission to study slaverys impact and possible remedies including reparations and cash payments
1934617 controversial for african americans to collect reparations is there not enough proof john hope franklin a reknown historian under the clinton or bush administration i forget now did a study on connections to blacks and their past forced servitude surely this study and others like it can be explored to find a solution because they could lead to reparations
1934618 were just apologizing you cant undo the past but you can recognize a wrong was done
1934619 i feel very happy with this trade because its something that ive been really looking forward to
1934620 the reality is when you are talking about a player of this magnitude you have to go in with every expectation that the asking price is going to be very high and if you want to participate its going to be tough
1934621 weve talked to baltimore off and on for two years about tejada certainly in 2006 its sort of ongoing baltimores had a change in their administration with andy macphail and i think baltimore has wanted to change the composition of their club we had a lot of conversations before i dont know how you quantify close baltimore just elected at that time not to move him
1934622 i was in houston last week and ive played in minute maid park in the all star game so i think ill do great in that city
1934623 from the first interview i went through here it was never portrayed that i was inheriting a rebuilding structure this isnt a club to me that was in position to have to rebuild youve got a no 1 starter oswalt a middle of the lineup with berkman and lee young players like pence and towles i know theres been talk that his tejadas range has gone backward i had a chance to see miguel play in my role as a padres scout the last two years his range wasnt what it was four or five years ago but hes got great hands a good arm turns the double play well and with he and matsui around the bag at second base i believe weve got a good double play combination
1934624 thats one of the concepts behind in this position obtaining five players in exchange for one
1934625 nobody knows for certain how these young players are going to evolve but if you get five you start playing the percentages quite honestly
1934626 obviously the price of the deal is high a little painful we gave up some significant pitching in this deal if youre going to bring in a player of this caliber youve got to pay the price for it
1934627 no matter how hard we try to screw this game up its still a great game
1934628 if were up for the rest of the season well have a pretty good year
1934629 every team that wins the pennant this year will probably have a six to 10 game losing streak probably more than once
1934630 i really believe this is a playoff team every day theres more and more guys in here that are starting to believe that
1934631 stand not upon the order of your going but go at once
1934632 rookie pitcher most likely to wind up as a ben amp jerry flavor
1934633 i got the first two guys out then all of a sudden it was 4 oclock batting practice
1934634 i had no idea youre great sources of useless information
1934635 i think we were well up over 200 mph when we hit the ground it was a little bit more of an abrupt stop there was stuff in the front of the plane that started out in the back of the plane
1934636 how many times a day do you have to go out there and check for traffic coming out of the dugout you have to look left and look right i mean its not like youre crossing the highway or jaywalking or anything
1934637 just when you think youve seen about everything you havent seen everything
1934638 well give some guys a day off here and there shannon stewart has been out there almost every day
1934639 i think i could have played if i had to
1934640 oh i can see u there nah i dont need u now
1934641 it was there i saw it before where in are u
1934642 the tigers are a very aggressive organization and theyre very astute dave dombrowski is as good as they come theyre going to put forth a great team which theyve done since theyve gotten there hes put them in championship caliber form and theyve become a team that sets the tone
1934643 ill tell you what there are a lot of american league pitchers getting real nervous and were one of them
1934644 like i said the whole time its all a business i mean i have been on the trading block for kind of a world record for the last three years they found a deal suitable for both sides so im happy to go over there and try to do my thing

1934647 due to circumstances beyond our control social distortion is regrettably
1934648 se voc pegou perp tua at que deve ser legal
1934649 that i am trapped in this particular irrelevnacy is never more apparent to me than when i am home
1934650 would like to giver her home for her birthday but we live differently now
1934651 thats right when youre strung out on crystal you dont need nothing

1934736 may that srimati radhika whose dazzling colorful silk sari defeats the splendour of coral who is a garden of all varieties of blooming flowers which attract the maddened bumblebee sri krishna who comes to play amongst her flowers and who worships the sun god in order to meet with krishna eternally always bestow upon me the service of her lotus feet

1934743 srimati radhika whose darshana audience is rarely attained even by parvati devi and other goddesses who gives great pleasure to her sakhis confidential servants who herself becomes elated upon meeting with sri krishna and who is krishnas dearest lover very quickly makes that person who prays to her singing this astaka a recipient for the nectar of her service this astaka is recited in the poetic meter known as tunaka
1934744 after the killing of aristasura srimati radhika and her sakhis exchanged many joking words with sri krishna concerning the necessary atonement for one who has committed the offence of killing a bull

1934824 may be the first time we started talking about politics he agreed to support my state senate campaign
1934825 as a consequence of that support we became friendlier and i probably had i would probably talk to him maybe five or six months a year we might have breakfast or we might have lunch
1934826 and so i remained then in the state senate and continued to see tony maybe socially for breakfast or lunch maybe four or five times a year
1934827 and it wasnt until um it wasnt until i decided that i was running for the united states senate in 2003 that we started having a lot of conversations about politics again
1934828 again at that time there were no indications that he was involved in anything inappropriate
1934829 ill be honest with you he was helpful to me as i said early in my career not so much introducing but reinforcing relationships with aldermen that he knew on the south side and mainly because of his development work
1934830 practicing law for the next four years our paths would cross at times because they rezmar corp were doing development work but at that time i wasnt particularly close with tony although i was familiar with him and i would see him on occasion
1934831 so we became friendly at that point and through most of my years in the senate 1996 2004 he was somebody i considered a friend and id probably see maybe when i wasnt in the midst of a campaign i would probably see maybe six times a year
1934832 wed continue to have lunches or breakfasts wed talk about politics family
1934833 tony joined my finance committee he was an active member
1934834 where i would probably be talking to him once a day to make sure that was going well

1934966 i have over 200 political books in my collection and i have to say this possibly ranks at the bottom 20
1934967 this is a time in our society where women should have every opportunity they have to make it for themselves theres never been a time when power has just been given away not political power or corporate power or academic power all we have is the power of determining our own fates

1934969 they will mean a lot on one hand for the rest of the world to discover what china really is to discover a country that for most people of the world is a bit mysterious

1934974 what the olympics promote is a form of amoral universalism in which all countries are entitled to take part in the games no matter how barbaric their leaders may be
1934975 im not sure there has ever been an olympic games that will have had as big an impact as these games will have on china
1934976 they provide such a stage to present the host country to the world
1934977 nobody questions chinas future in the world politically socially economically but for the everyday man in the street theres not a lot known about china and these games will be a unique opportunity to present not only the sporting platform but cultural educational and social aspects
1934978 the genius of the olympics is that in theory it allows the chinese government to build its image domestically by means of improving chinas image internationally

1934996 and there will probably be some conservative slate cards that will leave them off

1934999 for a rich and multi faceted artistic oeuvre which mirrors experiences involving exile and gender in a highly sensitive way mona hatoum has availed herself of recent developments as regards means of artistic expression and choice of materials in order to set forth ideas of great urgency and deep personal experiences

1935069 the story is told in a buddhist sutra of a lone blind turtle who dwells in the depths of a vast ocean coming up for air only once every hundred years on the surface of the same ocean floats a golden yoke it is more common for the turtle to place its head through the yoke when it takes its centennial breath the sutra says than it is for a being imprisoned in the cycle of rebirth to be born as a human with the good fortune to encounter the teaching of the buddha human birth in a buddhist land is compared to a rare jewel difficult to find and if found of great value because it is in the human body that one may most easily travel the path that leads to liberation

1935090 i apologize for this long letter i didnt have time to shorten it
1935091 we come more and more to see through the follies and vanities of the world and to appreciate the real values we load ourselves up with so many false burdens our complex civilization breeds in us so many false or artificial wants that we become separated from the real sources of our strength and health as by a gulf

1935096 i was like three pounds and i had to get fed with an eyedropper
1935097 i grew up not giving a damn about anything because why give a damn if you are in a foster home and your parents didnt care anything about you
1935098 kids would tease me saying that im cross eyed and dont have a real mother and all those kids who said those mean things i beat the hell out of them
1935099 when he got shot i had a reality check and said to myself man you got to get yourself together and get yourself out of here because nobodys going to keep taking care of you
1935100 there was just this beauty in her when i looked in her eyes i saw all this pain but she still smiled and lit up the room
1935101 shes just a natural born actor she came from a very very tough background but it didnt scar her so she can interpret that background in her character
1935102 everybody was staring at me i thought that i was doing something wrong
1935103 i was like you want me to act like i was on the corner they were like exactly just be yourself and thats what i did

1935114 it shall be the purpose of the center to study the social criminal political psychological and economic roots of violent radicalization and homegrown terrorism in the united states and methods that can be utilized by federal state local and tribal homeland security officials to mitigate violent radicalization and homegrown terrorism
1935115 on his blog the library of congress in a september 1999 report titled the sociology and psychology of terrorism who becomes a terrorist and why here author rex a hudson discusses the psychological and physiological hypotheses proposed by psychologists including richard m pearlstein the author is proposing that psychological biological and physiological along with social economic political economic factors could all play a significant role in the shaping of a terrorists behavior i agree that they all could but concentrating so much focus on psychological and physiological factors has become an uncomfortable trend is this really the direction our society wishes to take the psychology of terrorism

1935117 the means of defense against foreign danger historically have become the instruments of tyranny at home
1935118 we need a jeffersonian revolution if it doesnt happen our democracy will continue to weaken and things will get worse right now we have a two party electoral dictatorship with each party looking for the highest corporate bidder
1935119 a people that values its privileges above its principles soon loses both
1935120 a democracy will continue to exist up until the time that voters discover they can vote themselves generous gifts from the public treasury
1935121 we are not blind we are men and women with eyes and brains and we dont have to be driven hither and thither by the blind workings of the market or of history or of progress or of any other abstraction
1935122 this country with its institutions belongs to the people who inhabit it whenever they shall grow weary of the existing government they can exercise their constitutional right of amending it or their revolutionary right to dismember it or overthrow it

1935126 one of the greatest delusions in the world is the hope that the evils in this world are to be cured by legislation
1935127 naturally the common people dont want war neither in russia nor in england nor in america nor in germany that is understood but after all it is the leaders of the country who determine policy and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along whether it is a democracy or a fascist dictatorship or a parliament or a communist dictatorship voice or no voice the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders that is easy all you have to do is to tell them they are being attacked and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger it works the same in any country
1935128 preventive war was an invention of hitler frankly i would not even listen to anyone seriously that came and talked about such a thing
1935129 the purpose of the law is not to prevent a future offense but to punish the one actually committed
1935130 ultimately we need to restore the understanding that in a democracy the rights of citizens to govern themselves are more important than the rights of corporations to make money
1935131 it does not require a majority to prevail but rather an irate tireless minority keen to set brush fires in peoples minds
1935132 when people who are honestly mistaken learn the truth they will either cease being mistaken or cease being honest
1935133 during times of universal deceit telling the truth becomes a revolutionary act
1935134 america will never be destroyed from the outside if we falter and lose our freedoms it will be because we destroyed ourselves
1935135 the things that will destroy america are prosperity at any price peace at any price safety first instead of duty first the love of soft living and the get rich quick theory of life
1935136 democracy is two wolves and a lamb voting on what to have for lunch liberty is a well armed lamb contesting the vote
1935137 whoever controls the volume of money in any country is absolute master of all industry and commerce
1935138 if tyranny and oppression come to this land it will be in the guise of fighting a foreign enemy
1935139 the tyrant grinds down his slaves and they dont turn against him they crush those beneath them
1935140 patriotism is the conviction that your country is superior to all others because you were born in it
1935141 freedom is the right to tell people what they do not want to hear
1935142 anyone who believes exponential growth can go on forever in a finite world is either a madman or an economist
1935143 fascism should more appropriately be called corporatism because it is the merger of state and corporate power
1935144 corporation n an ingenious device for obtaining profit without individual responsibility
1935145 the hottest places in hell are reserved for those who in time of great moral crises maintain their neutrality
1935146 we are at the parting of the ways we have not one or two or three but many established and formidable monopolies in the united states we have not one or two but many fields of endeavor into which it is difficult if not impossible for the independent man to enter we have restricted credit we have restricted opportunity we have controlled development and we have come to be one of the worst ruled one of the most completely controlled and dominated governments in the civilized world no longer a government by free opinion no longer a government by conviction and the vote of the majority but a government by the opinion and the duress of small groups of dominant men
1935147 facts do not cease to exist because they are ignored
1935148 i believe that banking institutions are more dangerous to our liberties than standing armies if the american people ever allow private banks to control the issue of their currency first by inflation then by deflation the banks and corporations that will grow up around them will deprive the people of all property until their children wake up homeless on the continent their fathers conquered the issuing power should be taken from the banks and restored to the people to whom it properly belongs
1935149 banking was conceived in iniquity and was born in sin the bankers own the earth take it away from them but leave them the power to create money and with the flick of the pen they will create enough deposits to buy it back again however take it away from them and all the great fortunes like mine will disappear and they ought to disappear for this would be a happier and better world to live in but if you wish to remain the slaves of bankers and pay the cost of your own slavery let them continue to create money and control credit
1935150 it was not accidental it was a carefully contrived occurrence the international bankers sought to bring about a condition of despair here so that they might emerge as rulers of us all
1935151 so you think that money is the root of all evil have you ever asked what is the root of all money
1935152 we shall have world government whether or not we like it the only question is whether world government will be achieved by conquest or consent
1935153 if we dont change our direction were likely to end up where were headed
1935154 there are a lot of exiles in this world each one has his own reason we have ours long before we left america the america we knew left us we travel not to get away from it but to find it
1935155 while each of us is entitled to his own opinions none of us is entitled to his own facts
1935156 find out just what the people will submit to and you have found out the exact amount of injustice and wrong which will be imposed upon them and these will continue until they are resisted with either words or blows or with both the limits of tyrants are prescribed by the endurance of those whom they oppress
1935157 those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it
1935158 a morsel of genuine history is a thing so rare as to be always valuable
1935159 any intelligent fool can make things bigger more complex and more violent it takes a touch of genius and a lot of courage to move in the opposite direction
1935160 in the beginning of change the patriot is a scarce man and brave and hated and scorned when his cause succeeds the timid join him for it then costs nothing to be a patriot
1935161 the first step in the evolution of ethics is a sense of solidarity with other human beings
1935162 earth provides enough to satisfy every mans need but not every mans greed
1935163 if you tremble indignation at every injustice then you are a comrade of mine
1935164 we have reported your recent manner and speech and it appears that the king has favourably considered your change of convictions he knows of your particular skills and insists that the war effort has a place for you your sentence can be annulled and you have the opportunity to enter service if it be your desire what say you
1935165 right well thanks for the offer it is nice to be in the army and all that but i dont think i am quite equipped for active service at the moment
1935166 so could you please lead me back to the cell
1935167 dear stranger you dont know me yet you have judged me with your harsh stare i would like to inform you that your ignorance does not anger or shame me it saddens me i often wish that people who look at me the way you have could live in my skin for one day i wish you could see beauty in unusual places as i do the world i live in is an accepting peaceful world where my compatriots and play partners do not judge me rather i am allowed the freedom to express myself explore myself and become the most amazing person i can be you see me and think i came from a broken world and that i am a broken person i hold a bachelors from a big ten university from which i graduated with high honors and i have a well paying stable job my family though they have moments where your stare has crossed their faces support and love me with all that they are i am exactly like you in my ordinary world i just choose to express myself outside of my mind every mark on my body signifies a journey i once made and completed with joyful success every minute in the hands of a play partner is an expression of the strongest trust a person can give over and i am blessed to have friends whom i can trust with all that i am i am not a black hearted creature i love everyone in my world with all that i am and i have deep spirituality that goes beyond your books and lables i am a whole person made thus by the modern primitivism i choose to embrace safely sanely and consensually if only you could experience the journeys i have taken to feel yourself free falling out of your body as you overcome and transcend your worst fears to look in the eyes of a play partner and see comfort and safety deep inside to be able to trust with your whole being to see with unclouded eyes and to accept everyone who walks this planet even those who wish me ill or wish me different it is a true gift that my journey my world has given me i have faced the worst tragedy and pain a person could face and this life i live has ultimately healed my wounds and allowed me to move on to the greatest things i have experienced the purest love and happiness the purest pain and sensuality and the most stripped down and glorious moments of existence allowed to a mortal i am the luckiest woman alive and i have such an amazing world to share i truly feel sorry that you feel you cannot share these joys with me whatever path you choose i hope you travel it safely to the end and perhaps we shall meet again

1935174 father dont take my people out of the world just keep them from the evil one
1935175 you are the salt of the earth but if the salt loses its flavor how shall it be seasoned it is then good for nothing but to be thrown out and trampled underfoot by men you are the light of the world a city that is set on a hill cannot be hidden nor do they light a lamp and put it under a basket but on a lampstand and it gives light to all who are in the house let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works and glorify your father in heaven
1935176 it is then good for nothing but to be thrown out and trampled underfoot by men

1935183 do not be overly righteous nor be overly wise why should you destroy yourself
1935184 to him who considers anything to be unclean to him it is unclean
1935185 you can only be truly godly if you dont do this or that if you abstain from this and are forbidden from that
1935186 kong its time to stir up the young people in city harvest again start reaching out more uncompromisingly to the youth
1935187 kong you are so privileged you are just a young man yourself and already god is revealing to you the need to reach out to the next generation you dont have to make the same mistake we have all made and wake up one morning to realize that your team around you are all older people and that you have lost a whole generation of young ones
1935188 and it shall come to pass in the last days
1935189 that i will pour out of my spirit on all flesh your sons and your daughters shall prophesy your young men shall see visions your old men shall dream dreams
1935190 kong it is too hard the youth are too busy with their studies they have no time for god or the church
1935191 kong you dont understand how difficult it is the youth today are too consumed with sports and entertainment they have no time for god or the church
1935192 my secret is that i need god i am sick and can no longer make it alone i need god to help me give because i no longer seem to be capable of giving to help me be kind as i no longer seem capable of kindness to help me love as i seem beyond being able to love

1935198 this is going to be our last christmas in this place
1935199 hey i heard that the tax system in country x wont rake us over the coals near as bad lets just close up our factories and buildings here and ship them overseas
1935200 will embrace a new paradigm describing the nations housing market it is not two markets one private and one affordable it is one market in which all people regardless of income can pursue their housing dreams this theoretical construct becomes reality through a few key reforms to todays public housing programs
1935201 for years now i have been trying to develop more domestic production of oil and gas and for years with one exception in the gulf of mexico i have been blocked for political reasons consumers are now paying the price for those years of obstruction
1935202 economists and policy analysts have repeatedly warned the green movement that their campaign of strangling fossil fuel production would lead to higher energy costs which would translate into higher transport related food costs
1935203 they were also warned that creating a market for biofuels through subsidies and mandates would lead to land being used for fuel rather than food with inevitable impacts on food price and availability
1935204 after 40 years it has all come to a head and the economic na vet of green policies has created a genuine disaster as energy prices soar food prices soar and ecosystems are put under the plow for biofuels
1935205 in 1995 congress passed legislation to open the coastal plain of anwr to oil and gas exploration
1935206 president clinton vetoed the bill and one of the reasons he gave was that because the oil wouldnt start flowing for several years it wouldnt do anything to reduce current 1995 high gas prices
1935207 enacting legislation this year to open anwr and ocs areas would not do anything to raise oil production immediately
1935208 however it would lower crude oil prices immediately with high demand and many potential threats to production there is a significant risk premium in oil prices opening up potentially huge new fields in a secure country would burst the speculative bubble
1935209 right now a new neighbor can move in next to you install a solar energy system and then under threat of criminal prosecution force you to take an ax to your trees if and when they grow
1935210 its actually better for the environment to put solar on your roof than to plant a tree
1935211 the globe has warmed and cooled a whole lot more dramatically than we currently observed in the last 100 years or so and yet polar bears as a species clearly survived both much warmer and much cooler times
1935212 the scientific puzzle is really more on how polar bears survived ice ages when there was little to eat and so much ice preventing them from getting to the seals
1935213 thirty years worth of data can hardly be called climate yet these folks are calling it some trends that will promise the demise of polar bears that had survived much warmer and colder times
1935214 this is why this bear listing story is mostly political
1935215 polar bear populations have been increasing in recent decades so there is no current problem the concern is based on forecasts however the government forecasts used to support the decision violate basic scientific principles and thus provide no scientific support for the listing
1935216 there are no scientific forecasts that would suggest a reduction in polar bear populations
1935217 it would be improper then to designate polar bears as endangered application of proper forecasting methods suggests a small short term rise followed by a leveling off we provide full disclosure to support these statements at publicpolicyforecasting com and at theclimatebet com in the long term science will prevail
1935218 canadians who manage two thirds of all polar bears just reviewed their listing status and decided not to up list the bear to a more serious status
1935219 unfortunately the preferred alternatives in the draft plans offer virtually no protection for these three million acres these roadless areas would be vulnerable to damaging off road vehicle use oil gas and hardrock mineral development and other development threats indeed the blms preferred plans would authorize nearly 1 000 miles of off road vehicle routes in these roadless areas eighty six percent of this land would be open for oil and gas development
1935220 from the scars of off road vehicle routes and energy development
1935221 utah already is burdened with seemingly endless federal restrictions and federal ownership over millions of acres of land within our borders
1935222 one thing we dont need is the federal government or east coast funded extremist groups operating in our state further restricting the publics access to public lands
1935223 at a time when it is obvious that global energy demand will soon outpace that which we use in the united states it is only prudent that we not shackle our ability to produce energy from the natural resources on public lands located in our state by creating more wildernesses
1935224 poor utah has suffered enough at the hands of the environmental movement what with the monument locking up an enormous deposit of clean coal
1935225 seeking to do this again with or without utahs participation is just more of the same
1935226 but the fact of the matter is that what utahans think is the last concern of the land lockup types
1935227 the hubris of eastern legislators is not surprising but it knows no bounds
1935228 they regularly impose their desired land use ideals on western states
1935229 eastern states certainly were not required to give up sovereignty over large parts of their territory to become a part of the union
1935230 can you imagine the outcry if wyoming or texas tried to dictate how new yorkers would be allowed to use long island or even central park
1935231 as indicated by the petition text and signatory list a very large number of american scientists reject
1935232 the very large number of petition signers demonstrates that if there is a consensus among american scientists it is in opposition to the human caused global warming hypothesis rather than in favor of it
1935233 claims by partisan and extremist organizations such as greenpeace the natural resources defense council and the union of concerned scientists that their views represent the consensus never should have been taken seriously
1935234 they are not scientific organizations and in fact they have long records of misrepresenting science to achieve political objectives
1935235 this should go down as yet another case in which they were caught lying about science
1935236 there is no convincing scientific evidence that human release of carbon dioxide methane or other greenhouse gases is causing or will in the foreseeable future cause catastrophic heating of the earths atmosphere and disruption of the earths climate moreover there is substantial scientific evidence that increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide produce many beneficial effects upon the natural plant and animal environments of the earth
1935237 if you have great news that 31 000 scientists dont think the world is going to end the press doesnt really want to hear it or share it with their readers and listeners
1935238 art robinson and the oregon institute of science and medicine have performed a tremendous service for the cause of sound science
1935239 their petition confirms what international surveys of climate scientists and recent reviews of the literature show most scientists do not believe most or all of the modern warming is manmade that future climate changes can be predicted with accuracy or that future warming would be catastrophic
1935240 this petition ought to mark the end of a dark chapter in the history of the news media in the u s and around the world
1935241 a chapter in which they were used by interest groups to advance an anti energy agenda with very harmful consequences for all energy users
1935242 the bill actually started with a mandated 25 percent reduction by 2020 and a mandated 90 percent reduction by 2050
1935243 i tried to amend the bill to exclude businesses located in the sparrows point area
1935244 sparrows point is where marylands steel industry is located and this bill would have been a fatal blow to an industry that is already hurting unfortunately the amendment failed 21 26
1935245 i ultimately voted against the bill because it amounts to an indirect tax on the working middle class families of maryland the bill would have inevitably led to substantially high energy rate hikes and it is my opinion that marylanders are already overtaxed and overburdened with state and local taxes energy rates and a high cost of living
1935246 the longer we wait to take strong action on global warming the harder it will be to roll out effective strategies
1935247 aq hendak bertanya kepada mu wahai akal yaitu aq ingin tau siapa kamu ini dan siapa aq ini akal

1935260 the coaches in shelley made us better players and prepared us for the position we are in right now
1935261 to have three russets playing on the same team says a lot
1935262 this is a whole nother level everything is so much faster than it was in high school everyone is big and fast and ill have to work pretty work pretty hard especially since ive been out of it a couple years
1935263 of which the anglican church of canada and the episcopal church are mere
1935264 nothing can separate us from the love of god in christ jesus
1935265 the spirit helps us in our weakness and intercedes with sighs too deep for words
1935266 love is patient love is kind love is not envious or boastful or arrogant or rude it does not insist on its own way it is not irritable or resentful it does not rejoice in wrongdoing but rejoices in the truth it bears all things believes all things hopes all things endures all things
1935267 for now we see in a mirror dimly then we will see face to face now i know only in part then i will know fully even as i have been known
1935268 and now faith hope and love abide these three and the greatest of these is love
1935269 the extent to which the gracious restraint the episcopal church has adopted was unknown
1935270 swallowing our consciences on issues regarding glbt people for the sake of unity in the anglican communion
1935271 the spirit i find is one of willingly providing that restraint
1935272 the number of other provinces across the communion who are very supportive of the kinds of concerns we are trying to address
1935273 it is yet another excuse for the dominant culture to demean them and sometimes violently so
1935274 the archbishop of canterbury may be coming to the united states to raise money to help pay the debt of the lambeth conference which is estimated to be about 2 million
1935275 we are no longer a christian nation we are now a nation of christians jews muslims buddhists

1935278 all of a sudden we all heard this scream this bloodcurdling scream
1935279 the attacker was standing up right over the top of the guy with a large hunting knife a survival rambo knife holding the guy and continually stabbing him in the chest area
1935280 he calmly walks up to the front of the bus with the head in his hand and the knife and just calmly stares at us and drops the head right in front of us
1935281 there was no rage in him it was just like he was a robot or something
1935282 its a good opportunity to remember that we live in earthquake country this is part of living in southern california and we need to make sure were prepared
1935283 weve removed 75 per cent of the mud pile weve had blasts all through the night on the large rocks in the mud pile and were continuing to do that

1935290 not many people believe i dance bharatanatyam actually i dont believe it either
1935291 there are over 25 ph d programmes on indian dance in american universities alone
1935292 this is when there is hardly any such attempt here
1935293 every american idiot is equal to bharata muni since bharata muni did not have a ph d in dance from a reputed us based university
1935294 the university wanted the bharatanatyam professors to have primarily a university degree in bharatanatyam the problem is there are no people with a university degree in bharatanatyam
1935295 this item was revealed to me by such and such apsara in my meditation

1935303 so what if i look vulgar what chitra visveswaran is better
1935304 with competition from satellite channels that beam entertainment programmes round the clock there is pressure to give short duration performances to retain the attention of the audience
1935305 for even a handful of slots there are thousands of proposals
1935306 there are no criteria for selection at the sabhas denying the talented a platform to perform
1935307 gone are the days when art was for arts sake now you may excel in the art but you should know how to market it for which money is required even a mediocre artiste can perform during the festival season if she has the wherewithal
1935308 and not for the sake of the higher spiritual realities he should have written gone are the days when spirituality was the soul of art and when a live religion was of the paramount importance for people
1935309 the present day dancers are not committed to excellence they are in a hurry to perform and create a record of sorts with their performances the audience can sense this lack of dedication which eventually results in their dwindling numbers the artistes should realise that dance is not just physical exertion but an internal introspection
1935310 an element of drama and contrived modulation pass for bhava what was once considered cheap tactics has become the order of the day if there is a great artist today on the veena the situation would change
1935311 the future of bharatanatyam through the prism of bharatnatyams great past
1935312 siete stato voi a mettermi su questa strada non che mi dispiaccia ma vorrei saperne il motivo

1935321 youll see some neoconservatives at the beginning of the bush administration crowing that we do have an empire lets just come out of the closet and say we do
1935322 but the administration never did that because empire doesnt sell well with the public
1935323 the presumption that the united states should rule the world sword at the ready for the foreseeable future is an unacceptable basis for a just even handed foreign policy
1935324 an intense myopic habit of wanting to make the ancient world fit into modern stereotypes
1935325 how stupid is it for all i know you want me to and maybe you just dont know what to do and maybe youre scared to say im falling for you

1935355 your father in heaven causes the sun to rise on the evil and the good and sends rain on the righteous and the unjust
1935356 causes all things to happen for the good of those who love him
1935357 but stretch out your hand and strike everything he has and he will surely curse you to your face
1935358 if he cant stay out of my way thats his problem
1935359 the lord looks down from heaven on the sons of man to see if there are any who understand any who seek god all have turned aside they have together become corrupt there is no one who does good not even one

1935371 then the trees said to the vine come and be our king
1935372 but the vine answered should i give up my wine which cheers both gods and men to hold sway over the trees
1935373 finally all the trees said to the thornbush come and be our king

1935461 the main reason behind launching the water menu is because we are finding more and more of our guests are increasingly health conscious
1935462 often people feel pressured into ordering a glass of wine with their meal but now customers have a choice

1935702 there are technologies that would allow us to detonate every roadside bomb in iraq by heating the wires in the detonators to the point that they triggered an explosion but these systems could severely harm civilians nearby so were not using them either
1935703 in our system we often are not given credit for the fact that we are very concerned about collateral damage

1935715 they thought congress could remove the president from office and of the united states
1935716 why arent you in rehab with the rest of the dk posters
1935717 so apparently bill oreilly today in his latest feverish rant claims that this site advocated the violent overthrow of the u s government today whoever finds this magical post gets a pony

1935787 mr president former secretary of state colin powell says the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism
1935788 if a former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and former secretary of state feels this way dont you think that americans and the rest of the world are beginning to wonder whether youre following a flawed strategy
1935789 if theres any comparison between the compassion and decency of the american people and the terrorist tactics of extremists its flawed logic
1935790 its just i simply cant accept that its unacceptable to think that theres any kind of comparison between the behavior of the united states of america and the action of islamic extremists who kill innocent women and children to achieve an objective

1935836 we were treated very even handedly we were questioned but the police were kind to us we were treated fine
1935837 we were taken immediately to a police station and questioned one of the reasons that we were there was that tibetans couldnt be there in our place
1935838 they were refused visas and if anyone in tibet dared to protest they would certainly be treated much more harshly and would face torture and imprisonment
1935839 we were at the beijing olympics to highlight chinas use of the games to whitewash its human rights record and we achieved that i think

1935858 tidak pernah saya melihat raulullah shallahu alaihi wa sallam tertawa terbahak bahak sehingga kelihatan batas kerongkongannya akan tetapi tertawa beliau adalah dengan tersenyum

1935861 apakah engkau telah mempersiapkan apa yang akan kami bawa menemui kisra
1935862 kalian berdua tidak akan menemui kisra setelah hari ini allah akan membunuhnya pada malam ini bulan ini anaknya syirawaih akan membunuhnya
1935863 silahkan katakan kepadanya agamaku akan sampai dan tersebar di kerajaan kisra dan kamu jika engkau masuk islam aku akan menjadikan raja bagi kaummu

1935876 the bleakness of the landscape is unimaginable it is as friendless and alien as a dali painting ordinary concerns such as work or friends have no place here futility muffles thought time elongates cruelly who is to blame for this situation those with depression think it must be them pointlessness and self loathing govern them so the natural final step is suicide people with depression dont kill themselves to frighten an errant boyfriend they kill themselves because it is the obvious and right thing to do at that point it is the only positive step they can think of

1935886 praised beijings extraordinary efforts to cut pollution ahead of the games
1935887 the chinese authorities have done everything that is feasible and humanly possible to address this situation what they have done is extraordinary
1935888 the fog you see is based on humidity and heat it does not mean that this fog is the same as pollution
1935889 there would be no danger to the health of athletes
1935890 chinas efforts to clean up the air around beijing would continue and have a lasting influence on the climate of beijing these are not short term one shot measures this is going to continue and this is going to have a lasting influence on the climate of beijing he said
1935891 a lot of the people dont think preseason games mean a lot
1935892 but to people like me who didnt play the whole year that game meant a whole lot
1935893 theres parts of his game hes still improving on but it was good to see him play with some confidence all of a sudden you get in this environment and you get to see guys step up a little bit and i was pleased that he did
1935894 the thing you want to do especially in that first drive of the first preseason game is to look sharp
1935895 you want to create good tempo you want to be balanced mixing up the run and pass be efficient eliminate the negative plays no stupid penalties and i think we did all those things
1935896 at the end of the day the three different offenses scored 24 points
1935897 for a preseason opener i dont think thats too bad
1935898 when youre comfortable and you know what youre doing the game slows down a little bit
1935899 he looked smooth in the pocket and his footwork was good i was impressed with his overall play
1935900 he plays a little wild with the drops and slices roddick said
1935901 i wasnt expecting a lot of rhythm and i dont think i got much its a good strategy for him but its tough to actually win a match like that to be able to get through rather straightforward was a good thing
1935902 i got a little bit nervous and he played well on those points he went for big shots and they worked for him i got a little bit tired
1935903 it took awhile for me to get into the match my legs were heavy he served very well and i wasnt moving well
1935904 he played well but i dont think i played the way i wanted to play said young who lost the final three games of the match
1935905 i had my best win and i couldnt play at the same level
1935906 thats something i have to change i dont think its a matter of the shots or the strategy i think its the mental part of it playing at the same level playing consistently
1935907 its always hard playing an american when youre in the usa so i just tried to focus on the whole match i like the atmosphere here and the people

1936136 yeah i hear ya arthur hell for that matter what would rove have done to jesus hangin out with prostitutes and all yknow course jesus wasnt running for anything
1936137 remember the democrats subliminal flash add the media caught him running a few years ago everyone chuckled tolerantly over that one cripes josef goebbels is to karl rove as chuck berry is to keith richards yknow what im saying

1936382 russia will have to think real hard before delivering this system to iran which is possibly on the brink of conflict with either israel or the us since if the system is delivered an ew electronic warfare system will likely be developed to neutralize it and if that happens it would be catastrophic not only for iran but also for russia
1936383 no country will want to buy the system if it is proven to be ineffective
1936384 for these reasons russia may not deliver it in the end to iran

1936386 its up to us to find the best way to get the best result with minimum damage

1936396 error indeed is never set forth in its naked deformity lest being thus exposed it should at once be detected but it is craftily decked out in an attractive dress so as by its outward form to make it appear to the inexperienced ridiculous as the expression may seem more true than truth itself
1936397 we reaffirm the inerrant scripture to be the sole source of written divine revelation which alone can bind the conscience
1936398 the bible alone teaches all that is necessary for our salvation from sin
1936399 nothing found within the creeds is necessary if the scriptures are all sufficient with reference to
1936400 we deny that any creed council or individual may bind a christians conscience that the holy spirit speaks independently of or contrary to what is set forth in the bible or that personal spiritual experience can ever be a vehicle of revelation

1936413 it is unimaginable to call transgender people freaks on tv in other developed sections of the world you wont hear the word nigger on television in the us
1936414 the television programme adopted a freak investigation approach to look into the lives of transgender people
1936415 proud citizen of the united states and a fellow citizen of the world
1936416 i know that i dont look like the americans whove previously spoken in this great city
1936417 this city of all cities knows the dream of freedom but in the darkest hours the people of berlin kept the flame of hope burning the people of berlin refused to give up
1936418 at times weve struggled to keep the promise of liberty and equality for all of our people weve made our share of mistakes and there are times when our actions around the world have not lived up to our best intentions
1936419 i know that for more than two centuries we have strived at great cost and great sacrifice to form a more perfect union to seek with other nations a more hopeful world
1936420 in europe the view that america is part of what has gone wrong in our world rather than a force to help make it right has become all too common in america there are voices that deride and deny the importance of europes role in our security and our future both views miss the truth
1936421 the greatest danger of all is to allow new walls to divide us from one another
1936422 will we lift the child in bangladesh from poverty shelter the refugee in chad and banish the scourge of aids in our time will we stand for the human rights of the dissident in burma the blogger in iran or the voter in zimbabwe will we give meaning to the words never again in darfur
1936423 if the sea level rises ten centimetres over the next ten years which is not impossible you would start to see impacts immediately
1936424 an increase in storm surges for example as extreme weather events become more common which many models believe they will
1936425 stunting which is low height for age is still over 30 per cent
1936426 but now for the last couple of years the rates have not been decreasing anymore when they produce the reference numbers from the 1990s they have halved them but still you cant say that its acceptable
1936427 the study highlights the fact that current water management systems are unable to deal with the impacts of climate change

1936429 i wanted to make him understand how effective a tool microcredit is in helping the poor people particularly the poor women to take control of their own lives and pull themselves out of the problems and benefit the children
1936430 in many other countries particularly in asia many of the development millennium goals would be achieved but africa is way behind so we need to focus our attention to african countries so they still have time left so they still can achieve those goals
1936431 its only in the long term that you get the perspective that lets you say whether an extreme event is part of a wider trend
1936432 we defend our core values of freedom and respect we guarantee the freedom of speech and freedom of religion for muslims as well as for all others
1936433 the cabinet may go down on its knees before islam and capitulate but i will never do that the film will be released

1936435 discriminatory statements are always judged within a certain context whether a statement is unlawful depends on who is stating what against whom and when a cartoon for instance has inherent caricatural characteristics and can thus be insulting
1936436 we were irritated by the way wilders holds the netherlands under his spell with a film that hasnt even been shown
1936437 but we also hope that the surge of alternative fitna clips will push the actual film down in search engine results they also show foreigners that there are so many people who dont agree at all with wilders
1936438 for months we all have been talking about a film that no one has seen yet while wilders sits back and refuses all debate its a clever trick to retain the attention
1936439 under the veil of freedom of speech wilders thinks he has special rights no political faction has ever been allowed to show an unseen political movie in its entirety but let him show the film and then well talk
1936440 whatever is the content one understands the film is pure provocation
1936441 an uncontrolled over emotional reaction is always possible and some can shape it through some inflammatory statements or protest orchestration no one can predict where it is going to end
1936442 climate change will increase uv levels and therefore increase the risk of developing cataracts
1936443 in terms of cataract blindness the figures show those who are most at risk of vision loss are people with no access to services to reverse the condition
1936444 the solution can be as simple as choosing good sun protection by wearing things like wide brimmed hats and sunglasses
1936445 bangladesh is already facing consequences of a sea level rise including salinity and unusual height of tidal water
1936446 in the future millions of people will lose their land and houses their survival will be threatened
1936447 we are taking steps to face the threats of climate change bangladesh needs 4 billion to build embankments cyclone shelters roads and other infrastructure in the next 15 years to mitigate the threats
1936448 these are big challenges and only time will say how efficiently we address them including finding accommodation for the displaced millions
1936449 we are conducting various studies to find options to save future environmental refugees
1936450 the environmental refugee situation will turn into a dangerous problem in the future and the bangladeshi government may find it difficult to face the challenge so we asked donors to help the country
1936451 we have covered 3 5 million people in bangladeshs riverine islands but many more are still left

1936464 the essence and the principle of the world is water
1936465 all things are nothing but shadows of eternal ideas which themselves are in spaceless and timeless sphere
1936466 there is only one principle on which all that is is founded
1936467 if a person kills anybody he will have feelings of remorse
1936468 it seems to me that the only objects of the abstract sciences or of demonstration are quantity and number all other enquiries of men regard only matter of fact and existence and these are evidently incapable of demonstration when we run over libraries persuaded of these principles what havoc must we make if we take in our hand any volume of divinity or school metaphysics for instance let us ask does it contain any abstract reasoning concerning quantity or number no does it contain any experimental reasoning concerning matter of fact and existence no commit it then to the flames for it can contain nothing but sophistry and illusion
1936469 how about your own propositions in consequence of your view your own writings including this book would be without sense for they are neither mathematical nor empirical that is verifiable by expirience
1936470 the result of philosophy is not a number of philosophical propositions but to make propositions clear
1936471 my propositions are elucidatory in this way he who understands me finally recognizes them as senseless when he has climbed out through them on them over them he must so to speak throw away the ladder after he has climbed up on it he must surmount these propositions then he sees the world rightly whereof one cannot speak thereof one must be silent
1936472 if any of you lacks wisdom let him ask god who gives generously to all without reproach and it will be given him
1936473 just because we made love doesnt mean im going to do anything differently

1936487 tall sails scraped the deep purple night as rockets burst flared and flourished red white and blue over the stoic statue of liberty the whole world was watching it seemed the whole world was there ships from fifty five nations had poured sailors into manhattan to join the throngs counted in the millions who watched the greatest pyrotechnic extravaganza ever mounted all for americas 200th birthday party deep into the morning bars all over the city were crammed with sailors new york city had hostest the greatest party ever known everybody agreed later the guests had come from all over the world this was the part the epidemiologists would later note when they stayed up late at night and the conversation drifted toward where it had started and when they would remember that glorious night in new york harbor all those sailors and recall from all over the world they came to new york
1936488 homosexuals want to come into churches and disrupt church services and throw blood all around and try to give people aids and spit in the face of ministers

1936504 i knew i should never have trusted that b t h
1936505 we tend to be bound by our past even when we can imagine the future
1936506 im still not convinced that big media is doing the most important thing listening we are still in a top down mode and dont realize that the conversation is more important than our pronouncements
1936507 the fact is that journalism schools are the main source of new staff but we cant allow them to crank out a new generation of reporters editors photographers and broadcasters who dont understand and appreciate how the profession has changed
1936508 the ability to get the news you want is the hallmark of a net worked world
1936509 i remember it well because i kissed him good bye and he pushed me away
1936510 i asked why did you do that and he said that he doesnt like kisses
1936511 the nazis told my mother that i was being taken to work in a german labor camp for six months but it was of course much longer i was there for years
1936512 i read in inc magazine that to boost morale i should get rid of all the employees who are unhappy is that a good idea it seems pretty drastic to me
1936513 global financial stocks have led declines that have wiped about us 11 trillion from world equity markets worldwide so far this year
1936514 the dow jones wilshire 5000 which is the broadest measure of total market capitalization here in the united states has lost over 3 trillion in shareholder value since the highs of 9 months ago
1936515 its like you totally get why i did the whole new business startup thing success in the traditional corporate world came at too high a price too much stress answering to the bureaucracy the pressure of quarterly targets at the price of customer satisfaction product quality and my sanity success wasnt worth it dude
1936516 im worried about the economy rapidly changing technology and the cost of keeping up the credit crunch is making it harder to finance growth the way we used to need to improve just tell me when you want me to stop
1936517 we know what your biggest worries are now tell me what your biggest problem is
1936518 those are your worries we need to identify your problems the things that are going on in your company that make those other things worrisome
1936519 dean how soon can you meet with my executive team
1936520 one of the worst forms is the medias lazy use of press releases as news
1936521 my people are out of control communication has totally broken down i cant get everyone pointed in the same direction
1936522 ive tried everything i throw money at them flex time you name it i read all the books and ive done it all nothing works
1936523 engaging with a social world a world of clients and employers but also of readers users and other designers
1936524 essentially design for the other 90 is shot through with well intentioned nostrums familiar statistics and a messianic calling to open peoples eyes to the disparities of the world
1936525 too often design solutions are remote solutions even by those with years work in the developing world
1936526 the notion that technology can more often than not provide the solution designers are especially susceptible to this delusion perhaps because they are often trained to solve immediate rather than long term problems
1936527 lawyers and insurance companies would not have allowed it and hospitals would have feared a backlash
1936528 are any of those words supposed to be used to describe you
1936529 im trying to be polite so i dont completely blow you off and simulaneously blow my tip

1936535 on naurait jamais d accorder la chine le privil ge des jeux olympiques etc
1936536 and the holy bible says that people will get more evil because of the lack of teachings you yourself can observe that as far as religion is concerned the earth was never out of it but then again listen to the teachings and you wont wonder why people become more crazy and evil
1936537 you may say im a dreamer but im not the only one
1936538 ill wait to see if i actually need to determine which way this photon went right now it doesnt matter
1936539 am i committing sin just for being born as a gay or homosexual individual does the bible really condemn gay or homosexual people or is just the sinful acts committed
1936540 i will give more verses which i always remember when the integrity of the holy bible is being questioned
1936541 some say they believe that there is a god a good one but you cannot see the concept of their god from their deeds but the opposite of good they are liars too
1936542 cant you see how useful and very truthful the holy bible is it gives exact description of the subject i do not even need to reflect on the verse by writing but because you asked then i will try to write more of what i learned from it but i cannot disregard my reference the verses from the holy bible
1936543 imagine people changed their views about god into something different they now thought that immorality is a good thing because changing their perception becomes their license to do what their hearts desire to do if it did not come from them most likely it came from their teachers even friends who practice such immorality they do not need god they think that they are actually a god to themselves
1936544 and among the prophets of jerusalem i have seen something horrible they commit adultery and live a lie they strengthen the hands of evildoers so that no one turns from his wickedness they are all like sodom to me the people of jerusalem are like gomorrah
1936545 some people are open to talk about these things indeed they are even proud to say and accept that they pollute their own bodies
1936546 notice the above verses god can see that a fool really believes in his heart that there is no god no matter how hard he tries to hide that belief god can see his heart and no matter how obvious their foolishness the more they profess that they are wise the more they commit sin the more they deny god who created them
1936547 even logic and plain analysis will dictate or will tell us that some people love to get drunk they just do not admit that they are after drinking a lot some people deny that they are immoral because they believe that orgies makes them happy and they love doing it with other people who loves doing it with them too especially it is their belief and will ask you to mind your own business
1936548 do you really deny what is truly happening on the earth that we are living now do you still believe that using the verses in the holy bible are illogical and irrelevant
1936549 the holy bible teaches us how we should behave towards different people with an emphasis on not to discriminate
1936550 havent you noticed that it is a real man heterosexual man who is being admonished here that is due to sexual immorality and perversion he might have changed his preference from a woman to a man even women who changed her sexual preference from man to woman because of sexual immorality and perversion
1936551 even nature teaches as that a heterosexual man will not even think of having sex with a man too i saw once a man was asked about this and he had goosebumps and his cheeks got red he even looked very squeamish thats how a heterosexual woman feels too what more of homosexual man and woman why did these things happen why was there a change of preference for a partner
1936552 if you think the holy bible discriminates or condemns gay people as a person then i will not wonder why you talk like that and insinuate that i would have a change of heart and mind on my understanding of the holy bible why would we disregard or will not consider the holy bible in an argument as a person what can you contribute to an argument is it your experience or is it your own knowledge but then again you dont even have a concrete evidence of your existence here in the internet but we do not argue if you are real or not it is the teaching that is important did it make you less a better person or did it make you a better person
1936553 let me just remind you that as a christian we believe too that only a man and woman should marry not both man having the same gender nor both woman but what about us gays we also have feelings like yours but then again we feel them towards the same sex it is never a question in the bible if a gay is person or not the bible gives a sense of direction for us we are people too we can never change what we feel we were born this way but one thing is for sure be it a man a woman or a gay we are all given the freedom but as christians we are taught not to use it given the freedom to lust on the same sex or even to the opposite sex of course not
1936554 one of the privilege of a christian is to know the truth because it will set us free from the eyes of the hypocrites and even the myths that comes along in believing them if you take time to read my blog you will learn how the impossible becomes possible for those who love god and his teachings probably you do not know gods teachings and gospel
1936555 i am not commenting to convert anyone of you in that post to be christians
1936556 they were able to distinguish what belief needs correcting and what belief has a basis so what if i use a bible verse
1936557 so what if i use a bible verse can you prove that the verses are wrong
1936558 when in fact nature even teaches us and testifies even the good values in us if ever you have one that those are facts
1936559 i learned that by taking a firm stand and having the holy bible as a basis is better than arguing without any
1936560 the holy bible is enough to learn how to make sense by using biblical logic and analysis the logic for you still remains incomplete without gods wisdom for man
1936561 actually you have been accusing that the teachings in the holy bible are the reason why we have this kind of world populated by crazy and evil people that is the main reason why the holy bible should be used to answer your accusations
1936562 the holy bible actually can show to you the real score of the world we live in full detail and accuracy of words to describe it what is secular morality by the way according to the internet it is based upon the principle that happiness is the chief end and aim of mankind
1936563 any system of morality that is not based upon a religion
1936564 the holy bible actually can show to you the real score of the world we live in full detail and accuracy of words to describe it
1936565 do you really want me to agree with you and tell you that we know what love is on the earth we live in
1936566 what can you offer me that makes sense when you die
1936567 the earth that you kept on holding on will vanish sooner or later even some scientists say so
1936568 nevertheless let me tell you how the holy bible agrees with you too on how you feel and what you have been doing
1936569 you may want to know how the holy bible defines what kind of world are the christians like me and even
1936570 as a christian we learned that we cannot set aside the holy bible
1936571 evil we have enough of you sin we are no longer your slaves
1936572 i am pasting verses here so that you would know that even in the old days our concerns has been the concern of those people and the holy bible says that people will get more evil because of the lack of teachings you yourself can observe that as far as religion is concerned the earth was never out of it but then again listen to the teachings and you wont wonder why people become more crazy and evil
1936573 maybe those are not misquotes most especially not a reference to you but to those who are concerned
1936574 but then again if you felt that the misquotes ive done which you feel imputed on you well read them again
1936575 todos os nosso problemas ser o magicamente resolvidos quando implementarmos xp

1936712 i once consulted with a teacher of an extremely bright eight year old boy labeled with oppositional defiant behavior disorder
1936713 its no secret that the us educational system doesnt do a very good job studies show that americas school kids lag behind their peers in pretty much every industrialized nation we hear shocking statistics about the percent of high school seniors who cant find the u s on an unmarked map of the world fingers are pointed at overcrowded classrooms lack of funding teachers who cant pass competency tests etc those are secondary problems even if they were cleared up schools would still suck why because they were designed to
1936714 in 1888 the senate committee on education was getting jittery about the localized non standardized non mandatory form of education that was actually teaching children to read at advanced levels to comprehend history and egads to think for themselves
1936715 in his 1905 dissertation for columbia teachers college elwood cubberly the future dean of education at stanford wrote that schools should be factories in which raw products children are to be shaped and formed into finished products manufactured like nails and the specifications for manufacturing will come from government and industry
1936716 h h goddard a major architect of standardized testing wrote in his book human efficiency that government schooling was about the perfect organization of the hive in other words the captains of industry and government explicitly wanted an educational system that would maintain social order by teaching us just enough to get by but not enough so that we could think for ourselves question the sociopolitical order or communicate articulately we were to become good worker drones with a razor thin slice of the population mainly the children of the captains of industry and government to rise to the level private schooling where they could continue running things
1936717 i had more than enough reason to think of our schools with their long term cell block style forced confinement of both students and teachers as virtual factories of childishness is it possible that president bush accidentally spoke the truth when he said we would leave no child behind could it be that our schools are designed to make sure not one of them ever really grows up
1936718 many well known americans never went through the twelve year wringer our kids currently go through and they turned out all right george washington benjamin franklin thomas jefferson abraham lincoln someone taught them to be sure but they were not products of a school system and not one of them was ever graduated from a secondary school throughout most of american history kids generally didnt go to high school yet the unschooled rose to be admirals inventors captains of industry writers and scholars
1936719 alexander ingliss 1918 book principles of secondary education makes it perfectly clear that compulsory schooling was to make a sort of surgical incision into the prospective unity of the underclasses
1936720 once their social role has been diagnosed children are sorted by role and trained so far as their destination in the social machine merits and not one step further so much for making kids their personal best schools are meant to tag the unfit with poor grades remedial placement and other punishment clearly enough that their peers will accept them as inferior people need to wake up to the fact that their children are being destroyed robbed of their potential in these laboratories of experimentation on young minds drill centers for the habits and attitudes that corporate society demands they dont want thinkers and leaders they dont want artists writers poets mandatory education serves children only incidentally genius is as common as dirt if david farragut could take command of a british war ship as a pre teen if thomas edison could publish a broadsheet at the age of 12 if ben franklin could apprentice himself too a printer at the same age then put himself through a course of study that would choke a yale senior today theres no telling what todays children could do
1936721 from my own my experience after personally surveying many many hundreds of buildings i would say probably less than five per cent are compliant
1936722 i would say that 95 per cent are non compliant in one way shape form or another with the data protection act obviously thats quite a worrying thing if the system is non compliant it could invalidate the usefulness of the evidence in a court of law

1936745 the fight was very tough i thought i was winning because of my right
1936746 we talked about this over and over before this fight because hes had a problem with head butts in previous fights and it happened again
1936747 it could have been a small cut and that punch opened it more but it started with a butt
1936748 i gave him the visual check three different times and he could not identify whether it was three fingers or two fingers

1936752 and then ive got a bunch of questions regarding the proposed marine monument and the opposition to it first off why do the opponents keep calling it the pew monument dont they realize that the pew foundation really wouldnt have anything to do with it after it was designated as a monument they simply came up with the proposal thats all is this really about indigenous rights or has it simply become a pissing contest do some of our politicians have their noses out of joint all because this wasnt their idea and they werent consulted about it early enough do the opponents realize that this has nothing to do with the land on the islands at all but that it is protecting the waters around the islands do they realize that they dont have any rights to those waters anyway according to the u s supreme court i see some of them are claiming that they already practice ancient conservation methods so they dont need any help from the federal government in protecting the waters how many of them have ever fished up there how many of them have ever been there period i read where they say they hope to eventually repopulate those islands do they realize that would be illegal under our current laws because the islands are already sanctuaries do they realize these islands would be nearly impossible to live on because of the terrain what do they think their fishing practices here have to do with conserving the environment up there do they really want to allow illegal fishing boats go up there and get away with whatever they can take anytime they want who is financing the stickers ive seen that have a red circle and a line through it with the words pew monument in it is it westpac why is westpac so opposed to this is it because they lose money or control i can understand why the politicians are opposed to it typically they are always opposed to anything that is good for the cnmi if they dont get their cut off the top i just wonder why we cant have a discussion about this based on the facts and not on misinformation and a smoke screen instead of the real issues

1936779 hey boss ive got this awesome metaphor to use as a critical tool
1936780 basically its my view that there isnt a whole lot that happens in life thats random
1936781 wise men talk because they have something to say fools talk because they have to say something
1936782 great spirits have always encountered violent opposition from mediocre minds the latter cannot understand it when a man does not thoughtlessly submit to hereditary prejudices but honestly and courageously uses his intelligence
1936783 there is one light of the sun though it is interrupted by walls mountains and infinite other things there is one intelligent soul though it seems to be divided all things are implicated with one another the spirit that bonds us all as one is holy everything on earth under the heavens is connected with every other thing all the different things in the world are coordinated and combined to make up the same universe

1936785 simple people talk of people notable people talk of events and extraordinary people talk of ideas
1936786 weve got to get out of the habit of thinking we only need to focus on improving the technology that we can invent our way out of this situation
1936787 weve got to do everything we can think of including reducing the size of the task by real conservation
1936788 to push and pull improved technologies and greener alternative fuels into the market place in high volume
1936789 require auto manufacturers to make smaller more fuel efficient cars encourage consumers to chose those vehicles and discourage everyone from driving so much
1936790 offers a path for continuous improvements in vehicle efficiency for the next few decades
1936791 offer a promising path to cost effective reduction in fuel use
1936792 their impact on fuel use and emissions is unlikely to be significant over the next few decades
1936793 fleet fuel use responds with a lag time of some 10 years to changes in the new vehicle market

1936833 your going to burn in hell if you dont agree with me
1936834 all he wanted to do was serve the lord knew it there is a lesson there
1936835 an evil tool of satan masquerading as a godly grandfather is burning in hell
1936836 this old man was a tool of satan as bad as hitler because he contributed to the damnation in hell of almost as many souls
1936837 should you ask why we differ from other christians as they are called it is simply because they are not christians as the new testament defines christianity
1936838 brother taylor has just said that the religions of the day were hatched in hell the eggs were laid in hell hatched on its borders and kicked on to the earth
1936839 we talk about christianity but it is a perfect pack of nonsense the devil could not invent a better engine to spread his work than the christianity of the nineteenth century
1936840 what does the christian world know about god nothing why so far as the things of god are concerned they are the veriest of fools they know neither god nor the things of god
1936841 i asked about raising my dad from the dead and somehow they were all so sure it was not possible where was their faith as priesthood power holders i ask lol
1936842 question just another related question that comes up is the statements in the king follet discourse by the prophet
1936843 i just think you are desperately trying to connect to god tangibly somehow and are making too much of natural random events
1936844 i dont know that we teach it i dont know that we emphasize it i havent heard it discussed for a long time in public discourse i dont know
1936845 i havent heard it discussed for a long time in public discourse
1936846 i dont know all the circumstances under which that statement was made
1936847 and i wouldnt say that others know a lot about it
1936848 i dont know that we teach it i dont know that we emphasize it
1936849 i havent heard it discussed for a long time in public discourse
1936850 inasmuch as this church of christ has been reproached with the crime of fornication and polygamy we declare that we believe that one man should have but one wife and one woman but one husband except in case of death when either is at liberty to marry again

1936860 there was no debate however it was just a proposal
1936861 we expect a greater slowdown in the economy than we have foreseen and economic acceleration in 2009 with the peak of the cycle apparently seen in 2007 already
1936862 after the effects of changes in indirect taxes and regulated prices that pushed inflation higher fade away we could return to the three percent inflation target at the turn of the year
1936863 we see the wage development as a major inflation risk in the czech economy
1936864 this is traditional equipment it is also important that electronic protection the active detection of hostile missiles and the possibility to launch false targets have been added

1936869 weve heard this objection repeatedly since our association was established in 1992 it is absurd the association was founded as a civic initiative no one addressed us no one established us it was founded by three women from the lisov village

1936871 in reaction to the tibetan events i cancelled my trip to the opening ceremony i insist on this i have never backpedalled on my decision
1936872 we have registered with pleasure topolaneks having condemned the march intervention of chinese authorities in tibet however if his words are to be really helpful they must be said in china too
1936873 i can only confirm that we hospitalised the girl with poisoning and that she died today
1936874 we want to discuss the matter with the relevant bodies and thus stem further latent expressions of racism and nazism we find on the part of the national guard
1936875 we will seek a restriction of the guards powers and if possible a complete dissolution of the nss paramilitary entity
1936876 i personally believe that it is up to the interior ministry to assess whether there exist sufficient reasons for the party to be dissolved
1936877 of course the opinions would not disappear with the partys dissolution democracy has to a certain extent tolerate anti democratic opinions cannot be eliminated by bans it is necessary to refute that mainly by arguments

1936893 allah memerintahkan nabi nya untuk menyuruh kaum mukminin menjaga pandangan mereka dan memelihara kemaluan mereka dan memberitahu kepada mereka dan memperhatikan perbuatan mereka firman allah
1936894 barang siapa menjaga empat hal ini berarti telah memelihara agamanya yakni lirikan mata besitan hati ucapan dan langkah kaki
1936895 hati hatilah terhadap godaan dunia dan godaan wanita sesungguhnya bencana pertama yang menimpa bani israil adalah dari wanita

1936897 setan memiliki tiga tempat bersinggah pada diri lelaki yakni matanya hatinya dan kemaluannya sementara setan juga memiliki tiga tempat singgah pada diri perempuan yakni mata hati dan kelemahannya
1936898 yakni seorang lelaki yang ada di antara sekelompok orang bila ada wanita lewat dihadapan mereka ia memperlihatkan kepada mereka bahwa ia menahan pandangannya dari wanita itu tapi apabila mereka lengah ia akan melihatnya padahal allah telah mengetahui yang ada dalam hatinya bahwa ia ingin melihat kemaluan wanita tersebut
1936899 pandangan kepada yang haram itu menanamkan syahwat dalam hati maka terjadilah perbuatan dosa
1936900 lirikan mata itu menimbulkan penyesalan pada awalnya akan menjadikan sengsara akhirnya adalah kebinasaan barangsiapa yang memperturutkan pandangan matanya maka akan tergiring kepada kematiannya sendiri
1936901 demi allah aku hanya melihat ke arah jempolku semenjak aku keluar rumah hingga aku kembali kepadamu
1936902 berapa banyak pandangan mata yang menorehkan berbagai bencana ke dalam hati pemiliknya
1936903 bila anda melihat sakitku kian bertambah dan penyakitmu membuat para dokter menjadi lelah jangan terperangah demikianlah yang dilakukan pandangan mata terhadap hati pemiliknya
1936904 yang menjadi ijmak konsesus ulama kaum muslimin yang disepakati keharamannya oleh para ulama salaf dan khalaf dari kalangan ahli fiqih dan para imam adalah bahwa melihat lawan jenis yang bukan mahram baik kemahraman nashab atau karena sesusuan mereka haram untuk saling melihat menurut kesepakatan seluruh ulama kaum muslimin
1936905 hr al bukhari dan muslim nabi melarang kaum wanita untuk menghentak hentakkan kakinya ketika berjalan agar tidak mengundang kaum lelaki melihatnya dan memandang perhiasan mereka yang tersembunyi
1936906 dan janganlah mereka memukulkan kaki mereka agar diketahui perhiasan yang mereka sembunyikan

1936947 petani selalu menggunakan bawang yang baru dipanennya untuk dijadikan bibit kembali padahal petani daerah ini kerap memanen bawangnya sebelum memasuki usia panen
1936948 jadi wajar saja kalau produksi bawang merah sumut masih rendah selain bibitnya digunakan berulang ulang bibit yang digunakan juga belum cukup umur
1936949 karena itu untuk memenuhi kebutuhan sumut terpaksa mengimpor bawang merah dari brebes india pakistan dan china

1936956 never put off picking a batman villain to tomorrow when you can analyze box office potential today
1936957 my forecast is that around 2050 the state of massachusetts will be the first jurisdiction to legalize marriages with robots
1936958 but once you have a story like i had sex with a robot and it was great appear someplace like cosmo magazine id expect many people to jump on the bandwagon
1936959 theres a trend of robots becoming more human like in appearance and coming more in contact with humans
1936960 at first robots were used impersonally in factories where they helped build automobiles for instance then they were used in offices to deliver mail or to show visitors around museums or in homes as vacuum cleaners such as with the roomba now you have robot toys like sonys aibo robot dog or tickle me elmos or digital pets like tamagotchis
1936961 and almost all of them could apply to human robot relationships for instance one thing that prompts people to fall in love are similarities in personality and knowledge and all of this is programmable another reason people are more likely to fall in love is if they know the other person likes them and thats programmable too
1936962 and its just a matter of adding some electronics to them to add some vibration
1936963 thats fairly primitive in terms of robotics but the technology is already there
1936964 one hundred years ago interracial marriage and same sex marriages were illegal in the united states interracial marriage has been legal now for 50 years and same sex marriage is legal in some parts of the states
1936965 there has been this trend in marriage where each partner gets to make their own choice of who they want to be with
1936966 the question is not if this will happen but when
1936967 i am convinced the answer is much earlier than you think
1936968 massachusetts is more liberal than most other jurisdictions in the united states and has been at the forefront of same sex marriage
1936969 theres also a lot of high tech research there at places like mit
1936970 anythings possible and just because its not legal doesnt mean people wont try it
1936971 if you ask me if every human will want to marry a robot my answer is probably not but will there be a subset of people there are people ready right now to marry sex toys
1936972 people who find it hard to form relationships because they are extremely shy or have psychological problems or are just plain ugly or have unpleasant personalities
1936973 of course such people who completely give up the idea of forming relationships with other people are going to be few and far between but they will be out there
1936974 if you have pedophiles and you let them use a robotic child will that reduce the incidence of them abusing real children or will it increase it
1936975 i dont think anyone has the answers for that yet thats where future research needs to be done
1936976 in a marriage or other relationship one partner could be jealous or consider it infidelity if the other used a robot
1936977 but who knows maybe some other relationships could welcome a robot
1936978 if we allow robots to become a part of everyday life and bond with them well have to ask questions about whats going to happen to our social fabric how will they change humanity and civilization i dont have any answers but i think its something we need to study theres a real potential for intimacy here where humans become psychologically and emotionally attached to these devices in ways we wouldnt to a vibrator
1936979 the ethical issues on how to treat them are something well have to consider very seriously and theyre very complicated issues

1936989 the forgotten frontline in the war on terror is afghanistan where our military effort must be reinforced the taliban cannot be allowed to regain power we must seek to dry up recruiting opportunities for the taliban by funding crop substitution programs a large scale road building initiative institutions that train and prepare afghans for honest and effective governance and programs to enable women to play a larger role in society
1936990 we must create formal links between the international energy agency and china and india and create an
1936991 leadership requires a blend of strategy persuasion inspiration and motivation avoid false choices driven by ideology force versus diplomacy unilateralism versus multilateralism hard power versus soft there is a time for force and a time for diplomacy when properly deployed the two can reinforce each other use our military not as the solution to every problem but as one element in a comprehensive strategy make international institutions work and work through them when possible

1937005 the cabinet retains executive power only as long as it has the
1937006 just as the parliament holds the cabinet in jeopardy the leader of the cabinet usually has the right to have the parliament disbanded forcing a new election that will lead to a new distribution of power
1937007 parties are often more loosely unified in presidential systems than in parliamentary systems

1937009 in terms of productivity that is how much a worker produces in an hour theres little difference between the u s france and germany but since more people work in america and since they work so many more hours americans trade their productivity for more money while europeans trade it for more leisure

1937012 historically the american model arose in the course of the industrial revolution and it found its fullest flowering in england with the new poor law of 1832 goodin 40
1937013 what really annoys the europeans is that this nation perceived to be ignorant of the rest of the world has the wealth and the power to dominate much of it the french parliamentarian noel mamere argued that it is appropriate to be downright anti american because of this combination of strength and stupidity
1937014 between 11 september 2001 and june 2004 us military spending grew to match that of the whole of the rest of the world combined it has damaged americas standing in the world

1937054 ninety six per cent of the justification was about judicial interference he genuinely believed the supreme court was going to block his re election as president and was therefore putting his survival at stake and his personal survival in his mind and myth is now one and the same as the survival of pakistan which is why it proved impossible for the us and others to dissuade him from imposing a state of emergency for a second time
1937055 it has been very difficult to get his attention for quite some time
1937056 it is a real setback because things were all moving forward in accordance with the timetable for him to take off his uniform by november 15 in keeping with the january deadline for free and fair elections
1937057 but all of that has now come to a screeching halt
1937058 pakistans army has traditionally been seen as a people friendly army one that never fired on its own people which is why martial law has in the past been welcomed
1937059 the fighting in the tribal areas is having a very bad impact on the institution of the army
1937060 the antagonism between the civilian and the military is increasing immensely soldiers are returning from the tribal areas saying were not going to kill our muslim brothers and now to make things worse were taking forces away so that they can be deployed in the cities against protesters and as guards of all the private homes of people under house arrest that have become sub jails this is no way to fight a war on terror
1937061 any professional army would have sleepless nights if that number of soldiers defected without a fight
1937062 armies dont lay down their weapons with that ease their heart is not in this fight at all musharrafs agenda to the west is one thing but the reality on the ground is something else creeping talibanisation is occurring not just in the tribal areas but has engulfed much of the north west frontier province and theres great sympathy for it anti americanism is sweeping through the pashtun community in the nwfp
1937063 if gen musharraf wants to defuse the crisis as soon as possible then there must be constitutional revival and the nation must be assured of the national election dates
1937064 there must also be a date for him to resign as army chief these are our demands and we see it as the only way to defuse the current situation
1937065 in the wake of the re instatement of the chief justice in july the pakistan political community split into the transitioning school of ms bhutto and the transforming school of nawaz sharif another former prime minister the ppp thought it would be much more easy to transition to democracy with musharraf as he was on his knees than with whoever might succeed him if he were forced out her attempt to make a transition has aborted she is now seeking to gather the political community to make a common front that mobilises the people to get rid of musharraf
1937066 ninety six per cent of the justification was about judicial interference he genuinely believed the supreme court was going to block his re election as president and was therefore putting his survival at stake and his personal survival in his mind and myth is now one and the same as the survival of pakistan which is why it proved impossible for the us and others to dissuade him from imposing a state of emergency for a second time
1937067 the order is set aside and declared void quorum non judice without jurisdiction and passed without lawful authority
1937068 we are all aware of the need to help build institutions that are not dependent on any one person
1937069 we have lost control in pakistan to the extent that we had any in the first place we did threaten musharraf that there would be consequences for aid so now the situation is worse you dont want to pull the trigger although you said that you would do it all indications are that the administration is reluctant to cut off musharraf and cut off aid because they still see him as a necessary partner in the war on terror
1937070 its not just musharraf against the extremists its also musharraf against the lawyers against the people we could end up we are ending up turning the majority of the population against us as the dictators supporters thats just not a great place to be
1937071 go to every corner of pakistan and give the message that this is the time to sacrifice dont be afraid god will help us
1937072 the time for sacrifice has come to rise up for the supremacy of the constitution
1937073 he is the first judge to become a symbol of resistance and that too against a military ruler that is what makes him different and that is what makes him one of the strongest leaders of pakistans civil society
1937074 in pakistan where nobody dares to speak against the military iftikhar chaudhary had the guts to take a stand against a general
1937075 why should people assume that iftikhar chaudhary wants to be leader all he wants to do is carry on being a judge with a great reputation
1937076 there are many people in pakistan who are not happy with any politician for them iftikhar chaudhary becomes the alternative figure

1937082 i recently had lasik surgery performed by dr robert selkin originally i was skeptical of the procedure and wanted to be very selective in the physician who performed it after meeting with dr selkin i agreed to have the procedure i now see better than i have ever seen and can now wake up in the morning and see my alarm clock dr selkin and his staff have been wonderful through this experience and are true professionals the procedure itself isnt really fun but the results ive gotten and the treatment by dr selkin and his staff has been wonderful i would recommend dr selkin to anyone considering lasik
1937083 i have worn glasses since the age of five so the one thing i have always wanted to change about me was not my height weight or complexion but my vision i have known for years that i was a candidate for lasik but the 4000 cost ruled it out selkin gave me the affordable alternative i have been looking for for well under half of the cost of other procedures i not only had my vision corrected but also cured the dry eyes associated with fibromyalgia through a simple tear duct procedure done at the same time as my lasik i am forever grateful to selkin laser center for making all this possible for me
1937084 having the lasik eye surgery has been like a dream come true when i first realized that i could read without glasses i couldnt keep from crying i am just so thankful for what dr selkin has done for me everyone was so nice and supportive through it all
1937085 my experience with the selkin laser center was wonderful the doctors and aides were all very helpful and nice dr selkin did a wonderful job he talked me through the surgery and made me feel comfortable i went into surgery with 20 1000 and came out with 20 20 i couldnt be any happier

1937157 what happened in the war with your dad and aramis
1937158 im not completely sure of the details aramis would be the one to ask if you
1937159 aramis told my mother that my fathers and his unit were in a recently raided town aramis had headed into a ransacked store checking for survivors and useful supplies my father was outside the store resting against an old barrel full of rain water when a stranded enemy soldier emerged from across the street hurling a hand grenade at a truck parked across the entrance of the store
1937160 my father was not seriously injured by the explosion but the store behind him had become filled with flames

1937174 the power to prosecute is one of the most awesome powers of the state without proper checks and balances it can easily be abused by those in power to humiliate and discredit innocent people
1937175 even when the injustice is corrected its victims are often left with their reputations permanently damaged
1937176 in malaysia the power to prosecute is being used to try to discredit mr anwar the remarkable leader of the opposition victim of a similar attack 10 years ago
1937177 we find it impossible to believe these charges we know anwar as a man of integrity and we appreciate the way he has spoken on behalf of freedom democracy and human rights
1937178 the charges are inconsistent with everything we know about his character
1937179 his political future should be decided at the polls not through some suspect prosecutorial proceeding
1937180 we are deeply concerned that the safety freedom and reputation of an important leader in the muslim world are at risk
1937181 so too is the integrity of malaysias judicial system and along with it the credibility of the government in general the future of malaysia as an example of success for the developing world and for the entire muslim world may be at stake

1937183 they had an great acid jazz night that brought together great players from the local to national scene who might not otherwise have the opportunity to play together
1937184 i thought the acid jazz experiments would be a great asset to the humboldt county music community
1937185 it brings out everyone from musicians to music connoisseurs to people who just want to get down with the funk
1937186 the idea was to gather all of the musicians in town
1937187 see who wants to play funk music and instead of doing an open mic thing i have a structured thing where theres usually two sets of players every night and they get a full 90 minute set so its really like having two bands that have never played together before
1937188 after the second or third jam during the acid jazz experiment you start to get to know the players
1937189 and after a while the music starts sounding really good
1937190 it always starts out with just a jam in a key
1937191 this particular night is made to forget what you know and get onstage and make people dance funky style
1937192 im extremely interested in seeing what people can do when they get outside of themselves
1937193 my view for this whole thing is that id like to see the next five or six good bands come out of this
1937194 id like to see some of these players get together and form bands so thats why its different from a blues night
1937195 its got its own style its got its own niche its got its own music scene its a total community that breathes its own life and theres tons of good music

1937199 the question is flawed whether we are a christian nation or not is an over simplified approach to the issue we are very certainly a nation whose culture laws and traditions are derived from our judeo christian history the idea of religious liberty comes straight out of our protestant christian heritage right from the start we mention god creator when in the course of human events it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another and to assume among the powers of the earth the separate and equal station to which the laws of nature and of natures god entitle them a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights that among these are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness those foundational ideas of god and creator come straight out of a western judeo christian philosophy those who argue that we are not a christian nation usually completely discount that contribution to our founding documents that having been said it is clear that an important portion of the early settlers of the colonies came seeking religious freedom that from which they sought protection was not the government theyd fled but the church they wanted a government in the us that protected them from a state church this is entirely consistent with more christian philosophy specifically protestant and more specifically baptist or anabaptist which includes ideas like priesthood of the believer and soul competency these ideas assert that man is competent and capable of a one to one relationship with god and that there is no requirement or need of a church to provide access to that relationship as the constitution was being drafted and the politic ing started to try to get the colonies to ratify it there was a lot of going back and forth between the religious leaders in the colonies and the guys pushing the constitution the main body of the document is basically agnostic about religion but the baptists in the northeast were so worried about religious liberty that they insisted on explicit language protecting their rights and would not support ratification until unless they were assured that the bill of rights would explicitly protect their interests so it was a bunch of religious zealots that helped get the bill of rights in the mix and it was they who pushed for this separation between church and state it was in response to their concerns that jefferson coined the phrase the idea of a separation of church from state was a protestant christian idea when the framers of the constitution were trying to get large significant portions of the population to support the constitution they were not writing letters back and forth with a bunch of worried atheists they were corresponding with a bunch of christians to say that the christians were not a major influencing factor in the formulation of our founding documents shows an ignorance of the history of how the documents came together for a lot more info on this stuff see http www bjconline org resources pubs pub spivey separation htm and just about everything else on that site a great site for this kind of info and look up john smyth and thomas helwys and the letters between thomas jefferson and the danbury baptists

1937201 the government of the united states of america is not in any sense founded on the christian religion

1937312 if you know where the chemical industry is you know where the cancer hotspots are
1937313 smoking is related to about 419 000 u s deaths each year
1937314 a vast body of evidence has shown consistently that those in the lower classes have higher mortality morbidity and disability rates
1937315 we found that mortality was strongly related to inequality in the distribution of income but not to the median income or per capita income of a state
1937316 the evidence in these two studies suggests that the increased death rates in those states are not due simply to their having more poor people income inequality seems to be increasing mortality rates among nonpoor people as well and we are investigating that possibility

1937328 though i speak with the tongues of men and of angels but have not love i have become as sounding brass or a clanging cymbal and though i have the figt of prophecy and understand all mysteries and all knowledge and though i have faith so that i could remove mountains but have not love i am nothing and though i bestow all my goods to feed the poor and though i give my body to be burned but have not love it profits me nothing love suffers long and is kind love does not envy love does not parade itself is not puffed up does not behave rudely does not seek its own is not provoked thinks no evil does not rejoice in iniquity but rejoiced in truth bears all things believes all things hopes all things endures all things love never fails but whether there are prophecies they will fail whether there are tongues they will cease whether there is knowledge it will vanish away

1937346 the claim against frankenstein is that he created a being without providing it with any knowledge about how to survive or be happy he completely abandoned the creature despising it it is obvious that frankenstein is solely responsible for the creation of the monster and when we hear the monsters story we realize that frankenstein is also responsible for the unhappiness his creature is doomed to experience still because we as readers are humans and not monsters it is easy for us to take the side of frankenstein he created the being with good intentions wanting to know if he could reverse the natural decay of humans however when we hear the monsters side we know that frankenstein is in the wrong shelley uses frankensteins actions to teach us that our natural sympathies do not always lead to justice there is still the question though about how much of what he went through was actually deserved in looking at how the monster took his revenge on his creator we must ask ourselves if his actions were justified

1937366 should we continue in sin so that grace may abound
1937367 unless you are circumcised according to the custom taught by moses you cannot be saved
1937368 the gentiles must be circumcised and required to obey the law of moses
1937369 brothers you know that some time ago god made a choice among you that the gentiles might hear from my lips the message of the gospel and believe 8 god who knows the heart showed that he accepted them by giving the holy spirit to them just as he did to us 9 he made no distinction between us and them for he purified their hearts by faith by putting on the necks of the disciples a yoke that neither we nor our fathers have been able to bear 11 no we believe it is through the grace of our lord jesus that we are saved just as they are
1937370 you see brother how many thousands of jews have believed and all of them are zealous for the law 21 b they have been informed that you teach all the jews who live among the gentiles to turn away from moses telling them not to circumcise their children or live according to our customs 22 what shall we do they will certainly hear that you have come 23 c so do what we tell you there are four men with us who have made a vow 24 take these men join in their purification rites and pay their expenses so that they can have their heads shaved d then everybody will know there is no truth in these reports about you but that you yourself are living in obedience to the law e 25 as for the gentile believers we have written to them our decision that they should abstain from food sacrificed to idols from blood from the meat of strangled animals and from sexual immorality
1937371 we have heard stephen speak words of blasphemy against moses and against god

1937426 tak lama setelah buku change beredar saya menerima banyak sekali tanggapan dan komentar salah satu komentar yang banyak saya temui adalah mengapa baru sekarang buku seperti ini diterbitkan komentar seperti itu lama saya renungi akhirnya saya menyesali sendiri karena saya cukup lama menahannya kebetulan hari hari itu saya diminta untuk memasukkan karya karya ilmiah saya untuk pengurusan gelar guru besar saya sebagai seorang academician saya dituntut untuk berkarya dan menulis upaya upaya seperti itu tentu sangat menyita waktu selain harus melakukan penelitian gaya penulisannya juga berbeda tetapi kalau saya terus menerus berkonsentrasi di sana maka saya akan kehilangan waktu menulis karya karya seperti ini saya mengalami sejumlah dilema melakukan publikasi internasional yang berguna untuk karir saya sebagai academician atau mengolah konsep konsep itu dan memberi sentuhan kontekstual pengalaman dan pengamatan profesional untuk kepentingan bangsa saya yang sedang kehilangan arah
1937427 kita harus berani banting stir untuk memberikan perhatian yang besar pada dunia pendidikan nasional kalau perlu dengan mengorbankan sektor lain kita asyik dengan upaya lain lain karenanya hal ini harus disudahi tekanan sekarang harus dialihkan kepada upaya pengembangan sumber daya manusia dengan sekuat kuatnya
1937428 kita bisa menjadi seperti sekarang ini karena tempaan guru guru kita tanpa guru murid enggak ada karena itu orang boleh berkhayal menjadi apa saja tetapi dia harus dibesarkan dan dibina guru kalau dia seorang otodidak seperti saya juga tidak berdiri sendiri saya tetap mempunyai guru di dalam dan di luar negeri
1937429 secara teoretik kita dapat membuat alur berpikir logis yang sangat sederhana sebagai berikut suatu bangsa yang ingin memiliki daya saing terlebih dahulu harus menyiapkan sdm yang berkualitas dan untuk menyiapkan sdm yang berkualitas diperlukan sistem pendidikan yang relevan dengan tuntutan kemajuan agar sistem pendidikan dapat senantiasa menyelaraskan tuntutan kemajuan maka perlu dilakukan reformasi pendidikan dan kunci sukses reformasi pendidikan ada pada guru sebagai tokoh sentral di dalam dunia pendidikan itu sendiri

1937450 were eating and drinking wine in the house of their eldest brother when a whirlwind swept across the desert and struck the four corners of the house till it fell upon the young folk they are dead and i alone escaped to tell you
1937451 so the eternal said to satan he is in your power only spare his life
1937452 still holding to your loyalty curse god though you die for it
1937453 who darkens my design with a cloud of thoughtless words confront me like a man come answer these my questions
1937454 where were you then answer me that if you have wit to know who measured out the earth do you know that who stretched the builders line on it what were its pedestals placed on who laid the cornerstone when the morning stars were singing a nd all the angels chanted in their joy
1937455 when i swathed it in mists and swaddled it in clouds of darkness when i fixed its boundaries saying thus far and no farther here your proud waves shall not pass
1937456 i know that thou canst do everything and that no thought can be withholden from thee i thoughtlessly confused the issues i spoke without intelligence of wonders far beyond my ken i had heard of thee by hearsay but now mine eyes have seen thee wherefore i abhor myself and repent in dust and ashes
1937457 all the days of my appointed time will i wait till my change come
1937458 study that job knew he was merely the work of gods hands which god the master potter was to mould and fashion and reshape
1937459 we are all as an unclean thing and all our righteousnesses are as filthy rags and we all do fade as a leaf and our iniquities like the wind have taken us away but now o eternal thou art our father we are the clay and thou our potter and we all are the work of thy hand
1937460 many are the afflictions of the righteous but the eternal delivereth him out of them all we must through much tribulation enter the kingdom of god
1937461 every person reflecting about the world and his or her place in it has been asking throughout the ages
1937462 yes someones finally catching on and realizing the need for a worldview
1937463 since this course is about the biblical worldview i am not going to set out to
1937464 the bible takes this stance assuming gods existence to be true and not something to be proven gen 1 1 ex 3 14 rev 1 8
1937465 in the beginning god created the heavens and the earth
1937466 i am alpha and omega the beginning and the ending saith the lord which is and which was and which is to come the almighty
1937467 there is no need to postulate assume the existence of a personal god
1937468 often in a discussion someone will say didnt god then if he is personal and if he loves need an object for his love
1937469 what is the nature of the universe its origin and structure
1937470 heres one for you lets say theres a sick person over here and you can cure him you can do it would you help him would you try
1937471 but why not say that youd help a sick and maimed person if you could most of us would if we could but god doesnt
1937472 he doesnt does he my brother was a christian who died of cancer even though he prayed to god to heal him how is this god good hmmm can you answer that one
1937473 thats right god made satan didnt he tell me son is there evil in this world
1937474 evils everywhere isnt it and god did make everything correct
1937475 if god created everything then god created evil since evil exists and according to the principle that our works define who we are then god is evil
1937476 is there sickness immorality hatred ugliness all these terrible things do they exist in this world
1937477 who created them there is still no answer suddenly the
1937478 science says you have five senses you use to identify and observe the world around you have you ever seen god
1937479 have you ever actually felt your jesus tasted your god or smelt your god have you ever had any sensory perception of god
1937480 according to the rules of empirical testable demonstrable protocol science says your god doesnt exist what do you say to that son
1937481 and that is the problem science has with god there is no evidence only faith
1937482 you can have lots of heat even more heat super heat mega heat unlimited heat white heat a little heat or no heat but we dont have anything called cold we can hit up to 458 degrees below zero which is no heat but we cant go any further after that there is no such thing as cold otherwise we would be able to go colder than the lowest 458 degrees every body or object is susceptible to study when it has or transmits energy and heat is what makes a body or matter have or transmit energy absolute zero 458 f is the total absence of heat you see sir cold is only a word we use to describe the absence of heat we cannot measure cold heat we can measure in thermal units because heat is energy cold is not the opposite of heat sir just the absence of it
1937483 what about darkness professor is there such a thing as darkness
1937484 youre wrong again sir darkness is not something it is the absence of something you can have low light normal light bright light flashing light but if you have no light constantly you have nothing and its called darkness isnt it thats the meaning we use to define the word in reality darkness isnt if it were you would be able to make darkness darker wouldnt you
1937485 yes professor my point is your philosophical premise is flawed to start with and so your conclusion must also be flawed
1937486 you argue that there is life and then theres death a good god and a bad god you are viewing the concept of god as something finite something we can measure sir science cant even explain a thought it uses electricity and magnetism but has never seen much less fully understood either one to view death as the opposite of life is to be ignorant of the fact that death cannot exist as a substantive thing death is not the opposite of life just the absence of it
1937487 now tell me professor do you teach your students that they evolved from a monkey
1937488 if you are referring to the natural evolutionary process young man yes of course i do
1937489 have you ever observed evolution with your own eyes sir
1937490 since no one has ever observed the process of evolution at work and cannot even prove that this process is an on going endeavour are you not teaching your opinion sir are you now not a scientist but a preacher
1937491 to continue the point you were making earlier to the other student let me give you an example of what i mean
1937492 is there anyone in the class who has ever seen the professors brain
1937493 is there anyone here who has ever heard the professors brain felt the professors brain touched or smelled the professors brain no one appears to have done so so according to the established rules of empirical stable demonstrable protocol science says that you have no brain with all due respect sir so if science says you have no brain how can we trust your lectures sir
1937494 now you accept that there is faith and in fact faith exists with life
1937495 of course there is we see it everyday it is in the daily example of mans inhumanity to man it is in the multitude of crime and violence everywhere in the world these manifestations are nothing else but evil
1937496 some people say it will take as much as another year before the bottom is reached
1937497 we have to expect continued weakness in the global economy which might extend into next year and we wont be able to avoid a slowdown if that happens
1937498 the situation now is different from what it was three months ago the american economy is in a much more perilous state now and the risks facing the financial system which is a global system and not just an american system are still very substantial
1937499 food prices have also somewhat levelled off so our expectation is we should be within our latest inflation forecast of six to seven per cent lower inflation at the end of the year compared to what we saw in the first half of the year
1937500 sometimes we depend on other people as a mirror to define us and tell us who we are and each reflection makes me like myself a little more

1937519 ruu pilpres dan peluang kaum muda dalam pilpres 2009 di jakarta selasa 5 8 adyaksa dault menyebut empat kriteria yang diperlukan oleh seorang calon pemimpin nasional
1937520 empat kriteria itu adalah memiliki wawasan luas dan punya visi misi bisa mengartikulasikan kepentingan rakyat memiliki pengalaman organisasi yang cukup dan berakhlak baik
1937521 saya harap akan ada kombinasi misalnya calon presidennya dari tokoh tua tetapi calon wakil presidennya dari kalangan muda
1937522 jadi sebenarnya yang harus diwujudkan adalah adanya visi dan misi yang jelas dari calon presiden dan wakil presiden karenanya forum debat antar capres atau cawapres menjadi penting seorang capres itu harus berani berdebat sehingga publik mengetahui kapasitasnya
1937523 dulu bung karno berusia sekitar 44 tahun ketika memimpin demikian pula bung hatta dan sjahrir yang juga masih muda tetapi mereka merupakan orang orang cerdas di zamannya dan tidak ada tokoh tua yang sekaliber mereka
1937524 yang paling relevan adalah agenda apa yang ditawarkan kepada publik
1937525 kalau memang kita prioritas untuk kawasan wisata sebaiknya di sekitar daerah danau toba tidak diizinkan industri beroperasi karena limbahnya akan berdampak dengan kualitas air
1937526 dukungan ini tidak perlu untuk terlalu dipolitisir karena uu memungkinkan
1937527 saya dari awal mendukung pembentukan suatu provinsi dan kebetulan aceh meminta menjadi ala abas jadi kalau aceh mau pemekaran karena dilihat dari geografisnya dan terutama aspirasi rakyat ala abas menginginkan itu kita harus segera memberi kesempatan dan dorongan penuh
1937528 saya dari dulu mendukung pembentukan suatu provinsi kebetulan aceh meminta pembentukan provinsi ala dan abas sebenarnya persoalan ini jangan terlalu dipolitisir undang undangnya memungkinkan adanya pemekaran kita melihat saat ini banyak sekali pemekaran
1937529 jadi mengapa tidak bisa seharusnya bisa kalau ada aspirasi dari rakyat di wilayah tersebut di papua saja sudah selesai adanya pembentukan provinsi red irian jaya barat jadi kalau ada rakyat aceh ada yang menginginkan ada pemekaran ya cukup memungkinkan wilayahnya cukup besar apalagi rakyat ala dan abas menginginkan untuk itu
1937530 sebetulnya kita harus segera memberikan kesempatan dan dorongan penuh kepada masyarakat ala abas tekait keinginannya ini
1937531 dengan begitu pemuda pdi perjuangan bisa menjadi pendamping dan memberikan pendidikan bagi pemuda di lingkungannya
1937532 tmp bertekad untuk meraih suara anak muda pada pemilu 2009 sehingga akan menambah suara pdi perjuangan
1937533 golput itu sikap yang individualistis sejak kapan indonesia menjadi negara yang menganut paham red individualisme
1937534 jadi kalau rakyat disuruh golput lantas bilang ini hak saya ya sudah jangan di sini silakan cari negara lain yang bisa seperti itu
1937535 kalau sampai ada 80 persen warga yang golput terus mau diapakan negara dan bangsa ini
1937536 kalau memang tidak senang dengan figur figur yang ada munculkan tokoh yang lain jangan hanya berdiam diri
1937537 saya yang baru menjadi menteri saja sudah sangat sibuk dengan agenda jadi saya tidak bisa membayangkan jika usia presiden di atas 60 tahun
1937538 mari yang mudamuda dari aktivis silakan masuk ke sistem dan berjuang memperbaiki bangsa ini dari dalam
1937539 satu hal yang penting adalah etika politik bagaimana mau mencari pemimpin nasional jika tidak dengan etika politik

1937791 later as i walked the mountain trail with my bag of plants i felt a kinship with this monk like me he had anger but i was perplexed that he would want to overcome it because i felt my anger protected me
1937792 a week later i was again outside the monastery watching the monks sweep
1937793 the next time i stood outside the monastery watching the monks i was drawn to walk over to a fifth monk and before he could ask me what i was doing i asked him
1937794 as i left the monastery that day i thought his answer strange i didnt understand what he meant by service and by peace and i certainly couldnt see how these had any value for me
1937795 the next time i visited the monastery was the last time
1937796 as i walked home later that day i thought about his answer and was glad that he did not seem any different than me when i was required to do anything my heart was never in it and my attitude was that i was passing time until i could be excused taking a nap was certainly preferable
1937797 the next time i passed the monastery on one of my foraging trips another monk stopped his sweeping and also asked what i was doing
1937798 without saying anything i nodded and left to continue my foraging

1937803 the absolute weight doesnt matter it depends on how long you try to hold it if i hold it for a minute thats not a problem if i hold it for an hour ill have an ache in my right arm if i hold it for a day youll have to call an ambulance
1937804 in each case its the same weight but the longer i hold it the heavier it becomes
1937805 and thats the way it is with stress management if we carry our burdens all the time sooner or later as the burden becomes increasingly heavy we wont be able to carry on
1937806 as with the glass of water you have to put it down for a while and rest before holding it again when were refreshed we can carry on with the burden
1937807 so before you return home tonight put the burden of work down
1937808 when i was 13 my family would send me up to the mountains around the monastery to collect edible plants for our evening meal
1937809 occasionally during my foraging trips i would pass by the monastery while the monks were out sweeping the leaves from the many pathways

1937826 widespread resentment and alienation toward the national government appears to be fueling a growing acceptance of conspiracy theories

1937836 lets wait for 2010 approach stupid that we are electing an unknown package is the reason why there should be more people participation in between elections either individually or via ngos to make sure that promises either in tone or substance are kept
1937837 this realization i believe lies at the heart of our not having an edsa people power iv
1937838 congress ought to recognize that these firms are insolvent that it is allowing these firms to continue to exist as bastions of privilege financed by the taxpayer
1937839 at some point were going to reach that inflection where the government is going to have to either guarantee explicitly or fannie and freddie are going to have be left to fend for themselves
1937840 were getting to that point where a decision has to be made by washington
1937841 without posing undue risks to the financial system or taxpayer
1937842 we are managing our business and maintaining a capital position that will allow us to fulfill our congressionally chartered mission now and in the future
1937843 freddie mac is doing exactly what congress intended when it chartered the company and more recently when it passed the economic stimulus act
1937844 we are well capitalized and positioned to continue to serve our vital housing mission
1937845 we know in a crisis the federal reserve tap would be open
1937846 they are huge they dwarf the bear stearns issue in the very worst case scenario i dont know how you do it other than extend money and the public takes the loss
1937847 people seem to lose sight of the fact that a majority of the mortgages that they are holding and are guaranteeing were originated pre 2006
1937848 just given the size of the two companies surely the government would not stand aside
1937849 worse in states such as texas where utilities deregulation means rate hikes for electricity can be based on the futures market price for natural gas we all paid higher electric bills thanks to amaranth and its manipulation
1937850 its a classic pump and dump boy i bet you see some cftc inquiries concerning the last two days

1937852 i can think of three to five organizations that will want to lease 1 million hectares and not ask for guarantees
1937853 nationally its going to 5 per cent the issue for us is whether its in the public interest for us to stretch to 10 per cent
1937854 weve got to pay attention to some of the other developments including food costs to make sure that we are not contributing to that
1937855 as a result there is the possibility that the commission may not purchase biofuel in 2009
1937856 in light of the record price of oil and the need for viable climate change solutions the case for biofuels has never been stronger
1937857 biofuels cushion the impact at the gas pump by reducing the cost of gasoline by up to 15 per cent
1937858 weve taken a look at this and were convinced that our decision here in ontario is not having a significant impact because of a whole bunch of circumstances that are driving up food prices
1937859 so which is it premier is more ethanol a good idea or not

1937861 mlq3 description of gma traveling with blank checks is proof positive that she knows that you buy loyalty in this country
1937862 theres a good point for our government to invest with the company
1937863 philippines has to go back to basic basic commodities and its production
1937864 elitists they think the poor are incapable of helping themselves without help from others have a mindset of i have more important things to do but here is a check
1937865 that kind of thinking is what enabled manuel gallego iii to shamelessly propose the forced sterilization of parents of street children are less than human and more like pets who can be neutered
1937866 the organization hopes that their book will enable congressmen to deliberate on the budget more wisely and efficiently and that it will inform the public so that it can keep tabs on budget preparation and execution
1937867 what is more important is the year end report how is it that senators and congressmen and the executive do not submit a detailed report on where the spent the money and no rounding off to the nearest 1000 please in the uk with the right to information act you can look up how much so and so mp paid for taxi or take away dinner why cant we do the same given that congressmen are even overstaffed
1937868 better yet i would like to invite them to do an observation duty in a congressmans office to get a real hands on experience of how a congressional office is run that would really provide sufficient authority to those who comment on legislators
1937869 the companies fannie mae and freddie mac have been hit hard by the mortgage foreclosure crisis their shares are plummeting and their borrowing costs are rising as investors worry that the companies will suffer losses far larger than the 11 billion they have already lost in recent months now as housing prices decline further and foreclosures grow the markets are worried that fannie and freddie themselves may default on their debt
1937870 under a conservatorship the shares of fannie and freddie would be worth little or nothing and any losses on mortgages they own or guarantee which could be staggering would be paid by taxpayers
1937871 the government officials said that the administration had also considered calling for legislation that would offer an explicit government guarantee on the 5 trillion of debt owned or guaranteed by the companies but that is a far less attractive option they said because it would effectively double the size of the public debt
1937872 the officials also said that such a step would be ineffective because the markets already widely accept that the government stands behind the companies
1937873 the officials involved in the discussions stressed that no action by the administration was imminent and that fannie and freddie are not considered to be in a crisis situation but in recent days enough concern has built among senior government officials over the health of the giant mortgage finance companies for them to hold a series of meetings and conference calls to discuss contingency plans
1937874 a conservatorship or other rescue operation would be the second time in four months that the bush administration has stepped in to engineer a rescue to prevent the financial system from collapsing last march it forced the sale of bear stearns to jpmorgan chase to avert a bankruptcy of that venerable investment house
1937875 officials have also been concerned that the difficulties of the two companies if not fixed could damage economies worldwide the securities of fannie and freddie are held by numerous overseas financial institutions central banks and investors
1937876 bowing to pressures from the roman catholic church arroyo has removed funding for the governments family planning program

1937999 along with weak data from europe evidence of a weakening global economy is becoming much more tangible
1938000 it is possible that the economy may already be in a recession
1938001 the japanese economy is entering a phase where we cannot necessarily remain optimistic
1938002 the chances are that the us economic slump which is at a slow pace at the moment will enter a full swing late this year and into next year pulling down the japanese economy with it
1938003 it is inevitable that japans machinery exports are sagging due to economic slowdowns in the united states and european union
1938004 while the recent decline in oil prices alleviates pressure on corporate profits the global economy is likely to slow further in coming quarters with the weakness spreading outside the united states
1938005 in this environment capital expenditure growth is unlikely to be a driver of growth over the course of this year

1938031 kesalahan adalah kekeliruan pemahaman dan praktik yang terkait dengan perkara syariah yang konsekuensinya hanya maksiat sedang kesesatan adalah kekeliruan pemahaman yang terkait dengan perkara aqidah atau syariah tapi diyakini kebenarannya yang konsekuensinya adalah kekufuran

1938033 kpi pusat mengingatkan dalam pasal 36 ayat 6 uu penyiaran 2002 dicantumkan bahwa isi siaran dilarang memperolokkan merendahkan melecehkan dan atau mengabaikan nilai nilai agama martabat manusia atau merusak hubungan internasional
1938034 orang beragama bisa menjelekkan agama orang lain kalau percaya kepada tuhan satu tujuan pada hakiki hidup
1938035 selain mengganggu penonton di rumah kpi pusat juga mendapatkan keluhan bahwa di studio indosiar tidak disediakan tempat shalat untuk penonton acara reality show tersebut
1938036 problem kpi justru karena ia tidak mandiri sebagai lembaga regulator penyiaran kpi masih harus berbagi peran dan wewenang dengan pemerintah dalam menentukan regulasi penyiaran di bawah undang undang termasuk dalam memberi izin penyiaran
1938037 beer should be an aromatic and taste and texture experience but we all know what the stuff looks like has a huge impact to how people perceive things
1938038 you wouldnt want a pint of barley wine well you may want one but shouldnt have one
1938039 by doing it that way it knocks a little gas out of the beer it makes it taste smoother less harsh all those bubbles are filled with aroma so if theyre popping theyre releasing aroma
1938040 its nice to have a thick head on beer it feels good on the lips its all about those details
1938041 you never want to put a really good beer in a frozen glass its a waste of money
1938042 the aromas just cant get out they get locked into the liquid so at slightly warmer temperatures they have the ability to jump out of the glass and get into your nose

1938047 it is obvious that some pro abortion zealot was in the united states or was searching the internet in an effort to find something that could be used to attack mr andrews
1938048 they eventually discovered that mr andrews and his wife margaret are members of our board of advi sors to pro abortion activists one may as well be a mem ber of the ku klux klan

1938050 officially listed as a board member to life decisions international ldi
1938051 ldi is called a radical right wing organization we are later referred to as an extremist body
1938052 make deci sions that affect companies boycotted by the extremist body he advises
1938053 this is nonsense we do not even send the boycott list to kevin and margaret andrews and even if we did the minister would have to carry it around with him to know which corporations to target walsh and singer cannot be serious
1938054 kevin andrews and his wife margaret are members of ldis board of advisors
1938055 he has had ab solutely no role in determining ldi policy or strategy the listing of prominent lawmakers or business leaders on let terhead in an advisory capacity is nothing new

1938076 you know when one thinks of god from the quantum perspective that gods intent is imbued within first matter which is the common bond for all living beings sentient or not it is then when one realizes the nature of god reflected within
1938077 soul of my soul and mind of my own mind
1938078 is never taught but when the time is ripe its memory is restored by god
1938079 he wrote books indeed many of them treating of the gnosis of things divine in which he asserts the greatness of the highest and one and only god
1938080 wherefore send me o father seals in my hands i will descend through ons universal will i make a path through mysteries all ill open up a way all forms of gods will i display the secrets of the holy path i will hand on pg 52 and call them gnosis
1938081 an introduction to the gnosis of the nature of all things
1938082 for to the good there is no other shore it hath no bounds it is without an end and for itself it is without beginning too though unto us it seemeth to have one the gnosis
1938083 therefore to it gnosis is no beginning rather is it that gnosis doth pg 53 afford to us the first beginning of its being known
1938084 the beginning of perfection is gnosis of man but gnosis of god is perfect perfection
1938085 seekst thou for god thou seekest for the beautiful one is the path that leadeth unto it devotion joined with gnosis
1938086 the seeds of god tis true are few but vast and fair and good virtue and self control devotion devotion is god gnosis and he who knoweth god being filled with all good things thinks godly thoughts and not thoughts like the many think
1938087 for this cause they who gnostic are please not the many nor the many them they are thought mad and laughed at theyre hated and despised and sometimes even put to death
1938088 but he who is a devotee of god will bear with all once he has sensed the gnosis for such an one all things een though they be for others bad are for him good deliberately he doth refer them all unto the gnosis and thing most marvellous tis he alone pg 55 who maketh bad things good
1938089 blessed are ye when they shall revile you and persecute you and shall say all manner of evil against you lying for my sake
1938090 blessed are ye when men shall hate you and when they shall separate you forth from them and revile you and cast out your name as evil for the sake of the son of the man
1938091 learning of the things that are the contemplating of their nature and the pg 58 knowing god
1938092 being taught the nature of the all and the supreme vision
1938093 for only then wilt thou upon it gaze when thou canst say no word concerning it for gnosis of the good is holy silence and a giving holiday to every sense
1938094 for neither can he who perceiveth it perceive aught else nor he who gazeth on it gaze on aught else nor hear aught else
1938095 and shining then all round his mind it shines through his whole soul and draws it out of body transforming all of him to essence
1938096 for it is possible my son that a mans soul should be made like to god een while it still is in a body if it doth contemplate the beauty of the good
1938097 but on the pious soul the mind doth mount and guide it to the gnosis light and such a soul doth never pg 60 tire in songs of praise to god and pouring blessing on all men and doing good in word and deed to all in imitation of its sire
1938098 be then not carried off by the fierce flood but using the shore current ye who can make for salvations port and harbouring there seek ye for one to take you by the hand and lead you unto gnosis gates
1938099 where shines clear light of every darkness clean where not a single soul is drunk but sober all they gaze with their hearts eyes on him who willeth to be seen
1938100 no ear can hear him nor can eye see him nor tongue speak of him pg 61 but only mind and heart
1938101 but gnosis is far different from sense for sense is brought about by that which hath the mastery oer us while gnosis is the end of science and pg 62 science is gods gift
1938102 this is the sole salvation for a man gods gnosis this is the way up to the mount
1938103 by him alone the soul becometh good not whiles is good whiles evil but good out of necessity
1938104 the virtue of the soul is gnosis for he who knows he good and pious is and still while on the earth divine
1938105 gnosis of god hath come to us and when this comes my son not knowing is cast out
1938106 gnosis of joy hath come to us and on its coming son sorrow will flee away to them who give it room
1938107 to them sunk in fit silence reverently their souls and minds pendent on hermes lips thus love divine began to speak
1938108 the single love the love of wisdom loving which consists in gnosis of divinity alone the practice of perpetual contemplation and of holy piety
1938109 but they who have received some portion of gods gift these son if we judge by their deeds have from deaths pg 65 bonds won their release for they embrace in their own mind all things things on the earth things in the heaven and things above the heaven if they be aught
1938110 and having raised themselves so far they sight the good and having sighted it they look upon their sojourn here as a mischance and in disdain of all both things in body and the bodiless they speed their way unto that one and only one
1938111 this is my son the gnosis of the mind vision of things divine god knowledge is it for the mind is gods
1938112 we must turn ourselves back into the old old way
1938113 i mind myself am present with holy men and good the pure and merciful men who live piously
1938114 to such my presence doth become an aid and straightway they gain gnosis of all things and win the fathers love by their pure lives and give him thanks invoking on him blessings and chanting hymns intent on him with ardent love
1938115 but i with thanks and blessings unto the father of the universal powers was freed full of the power he had poured into me and full of what hed taught me of the nature of the all and of the loftiest vision
1938116 give ear to me who pray that i may neer of gnosis fail gnosis which is our common beings nature and pg 68 fill me with thy power and with this grace of thine that i may give the light to those in ignorance of the race my brethren and thy sons

1938281 this information comes from burkes peerage which is the bible of aristocratic genealogy based in london every presidential election in america since and including george washington in 1789 to bill clinton has been won by the candidate with the most british and french royal genes of the 42 presidents to clinton 33 have been related to two people alfred the great king of england and charlemagne the most famous monarch of france so it goes on 19 of them are related to englands edward iii who has 2000 blood connections to prince charles the same goes with the banking families in america george bush and barbara bush are from the same bloodline the pierce bloodline which changed its name from percy when it crossed the atlantic percy is one of the aristocratic families of britain to this day they were involved in the gunpowder plot to blow up parliament at the time of guy fawkes
1938282 the americas have always been owned and governed by the same royal families of britain and europe that conventional history states as being among those defeated during the wars of so called independence
1938283 if it really is the land of the free and if as is claimed anyone really can become the president you would fairly expect that the 43 presidents from george washington to george w bush would express that genetic diversity youre having a laugh the presidents of the united states are as much a royal dynasty as anything in europe from whence their bloodlines came
1938284 if you go deeply enough into the genealogical research you will find that all the presidents are from this line a spokesman for burkes peerage the bible of royal and aristocratic genealogy based in london has said that every presidential election since and including george washington in 1789 has been won by the candidate with the most royal genes now we can see how and why united states presidents are not chosen by ballot they are chosen by blood
1938285 according to burkes peerage even according to the official genealogy bill clinton is genetically related to the house of windsor the present royal family in britain to every scottish monarch to king henry iii of england and to robert i of france
1938286 al gore is a descendant of edward i roman emperors louis i ii and charles ii and is direct descendant of charlemagne which makes him a distant cousin of richard nixon and george w
1938287 never in the history of the united states have two presidential candidates been as well endowed with royal alliances
1938288 even bill clinton and bob dole who opposed each other at the 1996 election are distant cousins they can trace their ancestry to englands king henry iii who reigned from 1227 to 1273 and us presidents william henry and benjamin harrison clinton has far more royal blood than dole and is directly descended from the same bloodline as the house of windsor every scottish monarch and king robert i of france this is why he was the brotherhoods choice
1938289 father george and wife barbara bush are both descendants of godfroi de bouillon who in 1099 led european noblemen in the successful crusade to recapture jerusalem from the islamic faith and moved into the kings palace at temple mount godfroi de bouillon was the first king of jerusalem and the duke of lower lorraine a major region for the illuminati bloodline so when george w
1938290 this same bloodline also includes key scottish families like the lords of galloway and the comyns marie louise of austria who married napoleon bonaparte kaiser wilhelm ii the king of germany at the time of the first world war and maximilian the habsburg emperor of mexico who died in 1867 on and on it goes into country after country this bloodline connects into every surviving royal family in europe including king juan carlos of spain and the dutch swedish and danish royal lines
1938291 one common link in this bloodline is philip of macedonia 382 336bc who married olympias and their son was alexander the great 356 323bc a tyrant who plundered that key region of greece persia syria phoenicia egypt babylon the former lands of sumer and across into india before dying in babylon at the age of 33 during his rule of egypt he founded the city of alexandria one the greatest centers for esoteric knowledge in the ancient world alexander was taught by the greek philosopher aristotle who in turn was taught by plato and he by socrates the bloodline and the hidden advanced knowledge have always gone together

1938414 exaltaba el absurdo en la comparaci n de la relativa credibilidad de los medios principales y la blogsfera
1938415 en el seguimiento de la guerra de irak muchos de los medios principales incluyendo el new york times perdieron su revestimiento de incuestionable confianza para muchos lectores y veedores y se hizo claro que las fuentes de los nuevos medios pueden ser confiable y sin duda son a menudo mucho m s r pidas en corregir errores que las viejas fuentes medi ticas
1938416 crecientemente impulsado por el miedo el miedo en la baja de lectores el miedo de perder anunciantes el miedo a la disminuci n de ingresos el miedo a ser ahogado por internet el miedo a la irrelevancia el miedo maneja al peri dico de arriba a bajo para corromper a toda la operaci n noticiosa
1938417 muchos de nosotros hemos sido notable e injustificadamente complacientes esperando silenciosamente que esta cosa llamada revoluci n digital comenzara a cojear

1938424 today i was told by an afghan general that if kandahar becomes secure all of afghanistan will become secure
1938425 what were doing here in the provinces of kandahar and zabul helmand and oruzgan is designed to create a strong professional afghan national police force an impact here in regard to the security of afghanistan as well as the international community
1938426 were in the most volatile region in the country but were also producing the most trained afghan police than any other region
1938427 for example our efforts to train the afghan national police at the regional training center here in kandahar is limited to only 350 training seats a cycle
1938428 in order to train more than the 350 allowed this cycle we coordinated to send police to attend training at other afghan regional training centers
1938429 adding an additional 150 focused district development trained afghan national police to the community is well worth the extra effort
1938430 as the focused district development program is aging were creating a better training program with each iteration with police officers that graduate
1938431 were honing their skills and their understanding of what it means to be a police officer in this fight
1938432 some of the marksmanship practices of the past were point and shoot usually spray and pray kind of stuff
1938433 so were trying to teach them that controlled marksmanship here at the focused district development cycle training
1938434 theres people looking to stand up for their country to contribute to the security of their country and to do better for themselves and their lives
1938435 non cera niente al campo giocavo a palla e correvo spesso non avevo neanche le scarpe
1938436 quando arrivato ero sopraffatto racconta robert rogers il padre adottivo che prese due altri ragazzi sudanesi lopez non sapeva se fidarsi e noi gli abbiamo detto che la nostra casa era sua

1938439 happiness is being the creator of your experience choosing to take pleasure in what you have right now regardless of the circumstances while being the best you that you can be
1938440 honestly ive looked back and realized that from august may my relationships suck and i usually have a breakup then a hookup then a break up again
1938441 so now im just running on whatever pops into my head which is how i usually write
1938442 est loco yo no trato con la gente de hollywood lo hice cuando compon a bandas sonoras y descubr que la mayor a eran reptiles
1938443 lo hago por placer nadie me ofrece producir el disco con mavis staples fue una obsesi n m a ella no se sent a tan apasionada por esa m sica de la lucha por los derechos civiles de los negros con el grupo de su padre los staple singers pas por situaciones apuradas lo mismo con dersi arvizu era una veterana muy quemada con la escena chicana la industria no quiere grabar a artistas de una cierta edad
1938444 yo mismo he cumplido 61 a os simplemente hago lo que me apetece
1938445 no salgo de gira desde principios de los noventa me irrita esa jerarqu a que considera que lo mejor son los directos cuando generalmente s lo intentan aproximarse a algo que se grab en un estudio con gran esfuerzo para m un disco sigue siendo un objeto m gico no un subproducto de los conciertos
1938446 aqu el pasado es borrado con cada capa de asfalto aparte de escritores como james ellroy nadie escarba en los recuerdos finalmente lo que estoy haciendo yo se parece m s al radio teatro canciones que cuentan una historia que desarrollas en tu cabeza
1938447 we are proud to hold the olympics and we are looking forward to them but we do not feel we have to please anyone or explain ourselves we have our own business like the rest of the world and will do it
1938448 maybe the world has a quaint picture of the old china but we want progress hu tongs might look nice on a picture but they are not nice to live in they are hovels we want better houses better buildings and a better future and this has nothing to do with the olympics
1938449 what people dont seem to understand is that so much of what they see out there really hasnt got that much to do with the olympics
1938450 the olympics merely provided an immutable deadline for some of the infrastructure that was needed to keep pace with other developments it has to be remembered that no country in history has ever undergone the changes that this one is now dealing with
1938451 in the next 20 years between 200 and 300 million chinese will move from the countryside to cities many of them newly developed there was never for a second a question that china would take on the olympics without being sure of what they were doing the olympics may be costing around 20bn but it is just a fraction of the cost of what is happening around the city and the country
1938452 the chinese are looking for world class models for the urbanisation which is going to be vast in the next few years
1938453 for most chinese tibet is simply a non issue maybe down the line there will be a settlement something like home rule but even the tibetans i gather from journalist friends who went up there are saying look clear out well deal with it ourselves
1938454 the chinese are now obsessed with the future and they do realise they have some massive issues like the movement of population the environment economic development there is so much to do they feel that if you mention tibet it is almost like asking them where they are going to put the sofa
1938455 i can see a lot of old china disappearing and i dont really want to see that so many people were moved to make way for the olympics and the old hu tongs are in danger of disappearing
1938456 perhaps a million people have moved in recent years but only a fraction was a result of the olympics
1938457 obviously you do not want to see a culture disappear and i would be very disappointed if that happened
1938458 i believe the chinese have been very clever they know the value of psychology and there is no doubt that the olympics can be important in how a lot of the people here think of themselves
1938459 when i look at it i believe it is facing the future of china not its past
1938460 in the nineties we were all a little in awe of the japanese and a lot of people wanted to copy them well i have to say that in engineering the chinese are better able to absorb the demands of advanced work
1938461 in fact i think in the near future in places like london there are going to be a lot of signs saying things like national engineering company of china

1938470 for the first time weve built a sequence from ancient dna that is essentially without error
1938471 it is still an open question for the future whether this small group of neanderthals was a general feature or was this caused by some bottleneck in their population size that happened late in the game
1938472 theres no proof that they saw each other only that they inhabited the same place at about the same time but i think its likely that they came across one another
1938473 what weve done is confirm that the mitochondrial dna of neanderthals and modern humans was so different that it forms powerful evidence that there was very little if any interbreeding between the two species
1938474 we have also got tantalising evidence that the neanderthals formed a small population and we can only speculate as to what happened to them small population sizes are always more prone to extinction and they have a greater chance of something going wrong
1938475 the question then is whether when the populations met they regarded each other as simply people enemies aliens or even prey
1938476 we simply dont know the answer and the answer may have varied from one time and place to another especially given the vagaries of human behaviour

1938479 she treated everyone as idiots im not choked she is going to jail we started running together in 1997 she has stolen my best years everything could have been different for me
1938480 they have kids at 16 and you think phew where have their lives gone my goals wont be complete until i become the olympic champion
1938481 sport at my level requires discipline and as a result you have to make a lot of sacrifices
1938482 the most difficult thing for me is having to resist big plates of pasta
1938483 usually to be successful you have to become androgynous or beefy and slightly aggressive
1938484 it doesnt have to be that way its almost like its not considered very feminine to be competitive
1938485 like sharapova the idea of being glamorous is important to me i dont agree that you are either a sportswoman or a girl its important that there are women who bring glamour to sport
1938486 sono veramente lieta di esserci il mio allenatore ha cercato di consolarmi dicendo che avrei partecipato ai giochi del 2012 ma nella situazione in cui viviamo chi dice che sar ancora viva

1938495 this book a fascinating mix of dogmatic left wing self righteousness combined with rich and scathing condescension toward all who are even a tad less left than the author is rich in unintended irony
1938496 it is difficult to find many articles that so richly combine exegetical errors historical misconceptions and purple prose in so finely honed a synthesis but i do utterly agree with his final appeal not to mess with the trinity in support of a contemporary agenda
1938497 a tweedy poetaster who spent his time spinning out parables and japanese koans a literary aesthete who toyed with 1st century deconstructionism or a bland jesus who simply told people to look at the lilies of the field such a jesus would threaten no one just as the university professors who create him threaten no one
1938498 now despite the fact that this book is mainly philosophy dawkins is not a philosopher hes a biologist even taking this into account however much of the philosophy he purveys is at best jejune you might say that some of his forays into philosophy are at best sophomoric but that would be unfair to sophomores the fact is grade inflation aside many of his arguments would receive a failing grade in a sophomore philosophy class this combined with the arrogant smarter than thou tone of the book can be annoying i shall put irritation aside however and do my best to take dawkins main argument seriously

1938822 th nardier is het allerslechtste personage in het stuk hij is naast hetero wat voor mij alleen al een hele uitdaging is een heel slechte berekenende man terwijl k een heel lieve jongen ben althans dat vind ik zelf maar goed wat het interessant maakt is dat hij een personage is met verschillende lagen iemand wordt niet voor niets zo door en door slecht ik zal behoorlijk moeten worden geschminkt een baard van vier dagen een tand eruit
1938823 ik denk niet dat ik hier dikke verkering aan overhoud maar ik vind het heerlijk ik kan in deze rol mijn meest slechte lelijke vieze en geile kant kwijt op een gegeven moment sloopt th nardier bij een riool tanden uit een lichaam ik bedoel wat heeft er moeten gebeuren voordat een mens zo diep zinkt

1938865 lho emang ada aturan spt itu ya ok dech puti pinjem baju ibu juga yok ganti baju
1938866 sepertinya sudah cukup engkau belajar dariku saatnya engkau belajar dari dunia luar lingkungan yang sebenarnya
1938867 namun ada satu hal lagi yang harus engkau lakukan sebagai bekalmu nanti dan pelajaran akhir dariku
1938868 bukankah di dasar laut itu gelap guru bagaimana aku bisa tahu itu mutiara atau bukan
1938869 dengan ilmu yang engkau miliki engkau bisa menerangi dasar laut yang gelap tsb sehingga engkau bisa membedakan mana yang mutiara dan bukan
1938870 untuk itu aku akan memberimu sesuatu buatmu yang pertama adalah kuberi kau sebuah kantung di mana dengan kantung ini kau bisa menyimpan mutiara yang engkau dapatkan sebanyak banyaknya semakin banyak kau dapatkan maka kau akan semakin kuat sehingga bisa untuk mencari mutiara di tempat lain jangan kau masukkan mutiara yang cacat atau selain mutiara karena hal itu akan melemahkanmu dan akan membuatmu berat mengerti kau
1938871 satu lagi yaitu kuberi engkau sebuah kotak yang dengan kotak ini engkau dapat menyimpan mutiara maksimal sebanyak empat namun tidak sembarangan mutiara yang engkau masukkan masukkanlah mutiara yang menurutmu paling bagus paling indah paling bersinar bisa menyenangkanmu semakin cepat engkau memasukkan mutiara yang menurutmu paling indah tersebut dalam kotak ini maka kekuatanmu akan berlipat ganda lebih dari kantung mutiara tadi tapi ingat jika engkau memasukkan mutiara ke dalam kotak itu lebih dari satu sedang engkau tidak bisa menahan kekuatannya maka engkau yang akan mendapat kerugian kotak tersebut akan pecah mutiara tersebut akan hilang dan kekuatanmu akan melemah engkau harus pandai pandai dan bijaksana mengambil keputusan serta aku sangat tidak menyukai engkau mengambil lagi mutiara yang telah engkau masukkan dalam kotak tersebut kecuali jika memang mutiara yang engkau masukkan justru akan mengurangi kekuatanmu dan ingat waktumu sampai matahari terbenam di ufuk barat
1938872 lumayan juga banyak mutiara yang telah kudapatkan tenagaku pun terasa lebih kuat aku akan pergi ke tempat lain lagi barangkali di sana kutemukan mutiara yang cocok untuk kotak ini
1938873 guruku berpesan jika aku tidak kuat maka jangan memasukkan mutiara ini ke dalam kotak yang sudah terisi akan berbahaya bagiku guruku juga melarangku untuk mengeluarkan mutiara dalam kotak ini apalagi mutiara tsb telah memberiku kekuatan tapi mutiara ini teramat indah lebih indah dari sebelumnya
1938874 guru aku sudah menyelesaikan tugas ini guru aku sudah berhasil membawa mutiara dalam kantung ini dan dalam kotak ini
1938875 bagus kalau begitu ketahuilah wahai anakku aku akan memberitahumu sesuatu di balik hal tersebut ketauhilah bahwa kantung yang kuberikan itu ibarat tempat untuk menampung teman sahabat maka carilah sahabat yang baik buatmu carilah sahabat yang menjadi mutiara bagimu yang mampu memberimu kebaikan semakin banyak engkau memiliki sahabat maka akan banyak sahabat lagi yang akan kau dapatkan di kemudian hari seakan akan tempat itu bisa menampung tak terbatas banyaknya semakin banyak akan semakin baik tetapi jika engkau memiliki sahabat yang buruk yang bukan mutiara bagimu maka hal itu akan memberatkanmu dan akan merugikanmu
1938876 kotak ini memiliki maksud dengan pasangan hidup atau istri nanti dalam hidupmu engkau hanya diperkenankan memiliki istri maksimal empat carilah istri yang engkau anggap paling indah paling engkau suka menurut pandanganmu karena hal itu akan memberimu kekuatan kebahagian kesenangan mungkin juga setelah engkau memiliki istri suatu saat engkau akan menemukan lagi orang yang lebih indah menurut pandanganmu jika engkau memang sanggup dan dapat berlaku adil dan bijaksana maka hal itu baik juga bagimu tetapi jika engkau tidak kuat dan tidak dapat berlaku adil pada mereka maka engkau juga yang akan menderita dan terbebani juga akan membuat mutiara tersebut tidak bisa memberimu kekuatan justru memberatkanmu jika engkau mengeluarkan mutiara atau engkau menceraikan istrimu padahal dia telah memberikan kebaikan bagimu sesungguhnya hal itu sangat tidak disukai dan engkau telah dzalim kepadanya kecuali jika memang istrimu bukan mutiara tidak memberikan kebaikan bagimu melainkan memberatkanmu maka menceraikannya adalah hal yang baik bagimu karenanya engkau harus pandai pandai dalam mengambil keputusan engkau harus bisa memilih mutiara diantara batu batu dan memilih mutiara terbaik bagimu serta engkau harus bijaksana jika engkau suatu saat menemukan orang yang lebih baik dari istrimu menemukan mutiara yang lebih baik dari yang ada apakah engkau mengerti wahai anakku
1938877 nanti jika engkau telah berada diluar gunakanlah ilmumu gunakanlah al islam sebagai penerang bagimu dalam menentukan mana yang baik dan yang buruk insya allah engkau akan mendapatkan hasil akhir yang baik jika engkau berpegang padanya
1938878 baik guru insya allah saya akan mengingat pesan pesan guru jika nanti saya berada di dunia luar doakan saya agar saya sanggup berpegang teguh dengan al islam

1939025 sci fi but its very much well i think people toss out philip dick sci fi when they mean small dark sci fi although when i think of philip dicks books its something very different i think people are confusing it with the movie blade runner
1939026 to me its a lot more like the first terminator its very sci fi but its very character based and very concentrated its very different from the terminator movies but its like the first terminator in that time travel is involved with it but only as a plot device

1939062 the internet is like a bad news petri dish negative information multiplies and spreads with frightening speed and becomes virtually impossible to erase
1939063 reputational persistence is a unique internet phenomenon that traditional reputation specialists have never had to deal with the fact is that where the internet is concerned the only way to counteract persistent negative information is to overcome it with a greater weight of positive information this means getting to grips with internet reputation management

1939082 my parents seem to have taken on traditional gender roles with dad as the breadwinner but mum is a very strong woman when it comes to most decisions at home so i think the application of gender roles as such is a little twisted i have never experienced the pressures that my mum did ive had a private school education and been able to travel and go to university i still live at home and though id love to move out i know i cant afford to because i travel and spend money on luxury items but ive never gone into debt for them i lead a more social life than mum she says there wasnt much choice when she was growing up and my parents are realistic about relationships theyre very comfortable with my boyfriend which makes things easy
1939083 i remember being very proud of my financial independence when i started working because i was no longer much of a burden on my parents i was a good student who wanted to study physiotherapy but i felt it was a big ask on my parents financially so i went to secretarial college instead something i still regret i had my children when i was in my early thirties i suppose this was old for my time but i believe its a good age for settling down nowadays it seems having children will come later for most couples if at all anne doesnt take womens advancements for granted she feels very privileged to have had a good education and for the opportunities for success and equal pay in her future career that being said i think young women today will be challenged by a faster more stressful life especially as they compete for positions with men perhaps at the cost of quality time with their families and friends
1939084 i came from a very traditional family i was expected to help around the house and find a good husband we didnt have a lot of savings but i taught my kids to put their money to good use so now vicki has a traditional mentality buy your own home as soon as you can and dont get a credit card ive raised my children with a combination of the lebanese catholic traditions that i hold dear and the opportunities available to them in australia ive particularly emphasised education but now that vicki has finished her phd ive made it very clear that its time to start thinking about marriage still i have encouraged all their dreams i want them to have everything that i dreamed of but couldnt have
1939085 we always needed our toughie mums permission to go out little things like going to the movies or shopping with friends were never a problem even though other girls begged to be allowed i think she was saving it till we were 18 and wanted to hit the party scene i remember coming home at six one morning a furious mum enforced a midnight curfew after that in her day a suitor would ask the parents permission to get to know the daughter but mum broke the rules and eloped at 16 so we dont have specific dating rules i wish shed say more on how she feels or what shes thinking though mums inspiring life shows me selflessness and sacrifice she was nothing more than a kid when she married and left lebanon for a life of challenges in australia learning a new language and customs working and raising a family but with more disposable income than she had all i have to do is juggle my social calendar pay my phone bill on time and save up a house deposit kinda doesnt compare does it
1939086 all i ever wanted was a close knit family but i was born into a family of seven children and my father had died when i was young so we were split up and sent to different homes because mum couldnt afford to look after us i had a midnight curfew and i wasnt given much freedom especially when it came to boys as the mentality was that id get pregnant i started working at 12 so i could afford the cheapest possible education for myself something that was the highlight of my childhood i have always encouraged danas education no matter the expense i just want her to understand what i went through only so she can appreciate all the blessings in her life
1939087 when she was young mums idea of fun was going to the movies with her girlfriends and holding hands with a guy was her idea of hooking up she was exposed to corruption drugs and alcohol when she met my musician father but her innocence never wavered and although i was disciplined well i found it hard to be a christian teenager with so much peer pressure around when i got to high school my grades dropped and i started skipping school i felt there were more fun and exciting things to do i dated at a young age behind my parents backs and ran away from home a few too many times when i turned 18 i began to regret the mistakes i had made like taking my family and studies for granted i went to the philippines and matured enough to realise that my mother only wanted the best for me trying so hard so that i wouldnt have the life she had
1939088 i had a typical italian upbringing i wasnt allowed to go out on my own or with boys unless i had a chaperone i had to have an italian boyfriend he could only see me at home once or twice a week and had to leave before 11pm travelling was out of the question until after marriage i was lucky that my mother insisted on having me educated i graduated with a music degree despite my fathers opinion that i didnt need to study because i was a girl and my duty wouldve been to stay home clean and mind the children i have encouraged my daughter just as my mother encouraged me though in my day you could only choose secretarial work nursing or teaching i always remind my children of how lucky they are because their father and i have been liberal on most issues but they still do what they like women today speak up for themselves regarding their pay workload and rights world events wont affect vanessa if she strives and believes that she can succeed in all she does
1939089 when i hit my teens all i wanted to do was go to parties with friends date and travel i always had to beg my mum to go and though i respect her decisions i think ill be a little different as a parent but she disagrees now that i am older shes been a lot more lenient ive had a boyfriend for three years and sometimes i can push my midnight curfew but even though we have different views shes done a lot for me helped me with my studies and lent me money for a car shes steered me in the right direction like her parents did but i hope i learn to make the right decisions for myself amp enjoy life to the fullest
1939090 my husband and i left our beloved country to make a better life for our family i remember us crying on our first night in sydney we had 200 an apartment to pay rent on and a two year old son we didnt know how wed support ourselves but we soon started to enjoy the benefits of living in australia getting decent wages and going on holidays i didnt have much encouragement or expectations to forge my own career or identity i came from relatively humble roots i guess i was simply expected to be a nurturer and wife but i broke the mould after i had janice in australia running my own businesses and working incredibly hard id like to think i made a solid contribution to the community and my family
1939091 mum grew up under a state sanctioned regime of hate apartheid in south africa so the comparison between her life and mine in a free and fair australia is incredibly stark i cant imagine not being able to use certain toilets public transport or beaches because of my skin colour mum didnt finish high school yet i never considered not doing my hsc or going to uni she was incredibly brave to start a family so young im thirty years old and i still think im too young to have a family in my own small way ive wanted to show my family that the leap of faith they took in coming to a new country wasnt squandered ive worked hard to make them proud having an appreciation of what my parents went through has been a huge motivating factor in my life
1939092 young designers need to stay creative and true to what they do im inspired by travelling my husbands creative and we feed off each other but i have little kids and i also get inspired by their happiness life is challenging and inspiring success is about moving forward always having goals and not living only in the here and now ive always had a clear direction about where i want to go and most of the time ive followed my gut instincts theres an amazing world out there that we have at our finger tips keep an open mind and read books that you wouldnt normally read and visit places you wouldnt normally go getting inspired is just about seeing the beauty of other peoples lives sometimes just sitting in a park can inspire you to do anything
1939093 my inspiration comes from family and from being able to love what i am doing and thats music music is the common thing in all i do i work to be happy in life success is being happy with what you have achieved so far i dont think everyone ever stops dreaming or planning theres always the next goal once youve achieved things i think its important to have new years resolutions outlining what youd like to achieve that year and how youll work towards it its all about little steps in a bigger picture to better yourself identity plays a huge role in our life the biggest challenge is finding your place and who you are if you have strong enough determination you will always find a way there might be obstacles but theres always support the best inspiration is to do what makes you happy think about what you love and what gives you satisfaction and look into how you can get into that world life is full of surprises enjoy them
1939094 we have a lot of students that go on and do great things in their life for others this is the greatest thing theyre ever going to do in their life and some dont quite make it a way to stay motivated is seeing their efforts and how much resilience that they have we have young people that have some kind of challenge that they have to deal with on a day to day level and i find it inspiring that they still come here and create the most amazing art jewellery pieces or songs and how they see the world in a different way through their photographs its very easy to stay inspired because theyre inspired theres an amazing product at the end of the day you can see someone grow in so many different ways the worst part of the job is when some people dont make it that highlights system errors in the world the disadvantage that people have on a day to day level you see so much potential and when that potential is not met its really sad im inspired by peoples stories everone has one i live by a latin saying memento mori which means remember you will die it sounds dark but its quite liberating because its like this is your time here so make the most of it success is not always about having the answers its about having energy and an openness to finding out stuff its about feeling connected to the world and other people a psychologist named carl rogers had this idea that people are like potatoes you can put them in the darkest dingiest and disgusting places like under a sink but they still sprout and try to find their way to life and light finding a sanctuary somewhere is a key to getting inspired its incredibly important to have that space for yourself see the opportunities in life even if you fail theres always an opportunity to learn and improve
1939095 i established youth off the streets after reading a great deal about street kids in the newspapers i soon became involved in their lives they would call me when they were arrested i would go along to court with them visit them in hospital teach them on the streets as several wanted to get their school certificates and feed them every night the greatest motivation i have on a daily basis comes directly from the kids i work with and that is by way of their courage they have been beaten raped gaoled drug addicted rejected emotionally psychologically and physically and yet they still try to make a good life for themselves and others the other motivating force for me is seeing how tragically some of these kids live i had a good upbringing and was surprised to see that some peoples families did not only not care about them but actually hurt them on the issues of homelessness drug abuse and prostitution i see it as my role to highlight the injustices involved with these issues in our community they relate to the injustices where the few have much and a third of our youth lives in poverty the cross has given me the strength to take up all fights it helps me to survive my darkest moments without losing faith jesus has obviously been my greatest role model he was outspoken against injustice irrespective of the cost to him personally and they crucified him the incredible support i have received throughout australia is indicative of how i am perceived i see it as my role to work at all levels of the community with all faiths and creeds and with all nationalities not to convert people but to respect and value who they are as human beings my job is to uplift people from powerlessness and abuse to reflect back to them through my eyes the greatness that i see in each
1939096 starting any small business is always hard listening to music that i really like inspires me generally i put records on that reflect my mood and then very occasionally i find records that actually concept my mood and thats such a nice thing for me i can be feeling a certain way and a record can make you feel completely different just by putting it on and listening to it life is a glass of beer three quarters full success is working really hard and doing what you want to do and enjoying it its about not relying on others but surrounding yourself with the right people if you want to stay inspired keep reading yen having a really good idea and the ability to apply yourself above and beyond what is normally entailed means there are not many things that you couldnt do
1939097 i choose not to listen to criticism because i do what i love and i feel quite strongly about it thats what motivates me on a daily basis if youre not doing something for yourself theres no point in doing it creatively my inspiration comes from day to day life it could be a song on the radio a movie or even the news that triggers something in my head for a new idea or concept to get inspired read and look back into history think about how you can evolve it by putting your own style or creativity into something thats already happened keep your eyes open for anything that gives you a certain feeling life is like a box of chocolates you never know what youre going to get take on every opportunity dont waste a second of your life
1939098 everyday i work with activists who go the extra distance for animals sometimes putting their selves on the line animals cant speak up for themselves and the knowledge that i am making a difference in their lives and the changes i see because peta is here keep me fighting my work involves a fair mix of optimism and pessimism the worst part is that you cant save them all young people have a fire to change the world i hope every young person uses that fire be an individual mistakes dont really matter you have time to pick new directions try to get a perspective on your life a lot of young people think life is hard but they dont really know what else is out there above all travel learn be happy and make a difference
1939099 the hardest part of my work is being confronted by the cruelty we are trying to change but im motivated knowing that peoples attitudes towards animals are changing for the better i am inspired by those people who believe so strongly in something that they never give up my partner and dog help me to stay focussed by helping me to put things into perspective and see the funny side of life i think the key is to find the one thing that you are really passionate about it helps to see everything as part of a big picture begin with a belief in yourself and then think laterally about how you can create the life you want goals and priorities change but its always important to know where youre headed so you can enjoy the journey of getting there
1939100 the biggest motivation in what i do is the end result im inspired by art music and pop culture i am always on the lookout for things that are new and interesting and that inspires me to keep on pushing and make whatever i am doing a little better the secret to success is perseverance im always willing to do whatever it takes to make something happen and come up with alternative solutions to problems life is about drama no drama or emotion means theres no life travelling and putting yourself among new cultures and experiences is definitely inspirational keep your eyes open and always look for inspirational things in the everyday make a judgement on any opportunities that arise and if theyre relevant to your end result give them a go try to remain passionate about what you do and you will be successful
1939101 i love to live everyday to the fullest because you only get one life obviously family and friends inspire me but i get a lot of inspiration from travel the theatre and the fabulous characters i played in the past some days you find it really hard to stay motivated when youre at the lowest lows you just remember the highest highs and thats what keeps you going i thrive on adrenalin but i also like having balance in my life and taking a little bit of time out for me in 2008 i want to stop being much of a control freak i think the fast paced lifestyle of modern technology is a big challenge to this generation getting a hobby outside your normal circle exercising and travelling can really get you inspired life is a big challenge but you should take risks to maximise your opportunities its also really important to nurture your contacts you never know how much the next person you meet might be able to help you
1939102 i am motivated by the reaction when we perform a song everything that im interested in and issues that i want to address other good music is also a strong influence local indigenous hip hop artists have a whole new approach and style there is a lack of opportunities and direction for young people in my community no one to help you get what you want life is a blessing you have to live everyday to the fullest find out what you are good at how to achieve this goal and then figure out your own path most importantly love what you are doing and do it for yourself and no one else believing in yourself when everyone else has doubted you is success to me that and turning heads when everyone loves you
1939103 im inspired by my friends and family i love seeing the changes that people make in their lives you can change peoples opinions without knowing that you have
1939104 plan that will you make you more conscious of how you spend your money
1939105 they should let students know what the outcomes are if you dont follow them theres a big problem of communication at both ends
1939106 we have a phone and online system which makes it easier for students to access our services and change their details without actually going into a centrelink office
1939107 and the staff dont reason if they looked at my first tax return they could have stopped it in the first year it happened
1939108 the australian community expects us to reclaim the debts and we have a responsibility to do so
1939109 ok so i have a bit of an obsession with psychos
1939110 admission of a mistake and an invitation to be asked to make good
1939111 the adult understands all sides weighs them up against each other and makes a decision based upon what is better or worse
1939112 i lied to my parents about where i was going once and when they found out they were furious
1939113 i was freaked out when they were mad but it did not compare to the weeks of quiet treatment and disappointment afterwards because i had let them down
1939114 making amends is a necessary step towards forgiveness and redemption
1939115 the grand essentials of happiness are something to do something to love and something to hope for
1939116 action may not always bring happiness but there is no happiness without action
1939117 making an organic meal for friends using freshly picked herbs from the herb garden that youve lovingly tended before composting the scraps to restore your garden
1939118 you have to take it as it happens but you should try to make it happen the way you want to take it
1939119 cant help but imagine what would have happened had she fallen to the right
1939120 so thankful for everything in her life and the ability to just live it
1939121 from enduring the cruelties of a fur farm where theyre often skinned alive
1939122 discovering that you dont have to go overseas to discover the magic of wilderness areas
1939123 the more it hurts to give the greater the happiness
1939124 contentment with the past happiness in the present and hope for the future
1939125 happiness is looking at how much money youve saved on your credit card through not buying stuff that you dont actually need
1939126 those that bring sunshine into the lives of others cannot keep it from themselves
1939127 an inner discipline rooting out destructive mental states and replacing them with positive constructive states of mind
1939128 the idea of marriage is traditionally based on an alignment between two families and many people from non english speaking backgrounds are bringing this tradition with them to australia
1939129 i am pressured to a degree but i do not want to be with an egyptian and i do not think it is right that i am under pressure because it is my happiness that matters most
1939130 my grandfathers view on marriage is based more on something benefiting his family name rather than my self happiness
1939131 parents often see television as a way of generalising on the state of australian families because you see no absolute traditional nuclear unit
1939132 most important aspect of any relationship is personal compatibility and love
1939133 eventually result in a breakdown of relationship as the customs that each partner was raised with are lost in the mix and not passed onto children
1939134 they want us to stay true to our roots but we consider ourselves to be australian and we live an australian way of life
1939135 i totally condemn that i am so glad that media attention has shunned it but it is not fair that it is labelled as a strictly muslim thing
1939136 sometimes you can just say mum dad i dont love him or they can disapprove of a particular person without actually arranging a partner
1939137 feel strange about telling her parents about boys in general
1939138 although they are fairly liberal my parents definitely have their specificities regarding dating and my anglo australian friends find that difficult to understand perhaps because they do not experience the culture in the way that we do
1939139 but there is a major problem when you cant be with someone you love because of race parents should not judge who their children want to be with
1939140 most kids in india now marry for love and it does not work out
1939141 so they come back home and the only condition their parents place is that they will choose their partner the second time around its simple in an arranged marriage you are forced to work things out because your families are part of it too
1939142 each person should decide for themselves the extent to which they wish to accept decisions made by others this is often difficult but no less important as a principle for a democratic society
1939143 it isnt very smart it tends to make one part so broken hearted
1939144 make myself prettier or cooler for someone else and now it is time to grow up for me
1939145 apparently giving too much oral can cause throat cancer if thats the case i know some people who are gonna be screwed later in life
1939146 to risk everything for the sake of going for the dream
1939147 cram as much into your life as possible and dont be set back by failures because theyre always going to happen and without them there will be no successes
1939148 reciprocate by making me too realise that i need too smile
1939149 life is a journey if youre too focussed on the destination you miss out on the ride
1939150 like any fantastic banquet there has to be both sweet and sour achievement and difficulty struggle and triumph to provide the savour
1939151 dogs give the unconditional love that everyone needs in their lives and that happy dogs and happy people go hand in hand

1939168 to do something because you want to do it not because you have to
1939169 happiness is a state of being that is not dependent on anything outside of oneself
1939170 justice shall roll down like waters and righteousness like an everflowing stream

1939172 these are simple people they are a family of butchers
1939173 failed messiah follows the controversy closely with links to related press articles and judicial records

1939175 if you dont do something you are going to die
1939176 that night was absolutely heart breaking i knew that i had to be done with you
1939177 you were so mean and everything you said was a lie
1939178 it was heart wrenching and horrible i got so angry because you wouldnt listen to anyone

1939289 we celebrate to make sure the person knows that they did a good thing we make sure we encourage each other thats the basic thing that actually keeps us as a team if we didnt have that wed be individuals who could play the game but i dont think wed be where we are
1939290 im a little bit jealous sometimes because it seems so easy for them to play and not over critique theyve got such good spirit about them and they seem to always be having fun sometimes the teams that are really just trying to grow and learn the sport have so much more enthusiasm for it youve got to really tip your hat to that and respect that
1939291 its not a bad thing to make a bad play
1939292 we tell them to forget about it dust it off it happened you cant cry over spilled milk its not right we enjoy everything about the game every error we make we make up for it and we learn from our mistakes we dont let anything get us down
1939293 playing at these games definitely means a lot to them
1939294 they want to know this game better than they do now and by being included in an event like this now there is a goal to play for they will be looking forward to coming over to play in this tournament and that will maybe give them courage to be more involved in softball
1939295 its amazing to see the passion that they have and how into the game they are
1939296 its like going out and playing when you were a little kid you remember why you play and why you love it so much you see that in them when you come out there and you take yourself too seriously and get wrapped up in every play this reminds you that you have to have fun
1939297 you dont lower yourselves to an opponent at any time
1939298 and i think that by respecting the game you raise their level of play they made some good plays today and i think they got better hopefully so did we
1939299 we grow a lot from it its not necessarily going out and playing a game and going back home you learn something new every day and when you go back home you become a better person
1939300 its nice to have them share the experience with me they get to see internationally what its all about and see the competition and not just hear the stories afterwards its nice to have the support if i have a bad game or a good game theyre always there supporting me
1939301 its always exciting to watch megan play for me the biggest thing for me is to watch the growth its a huge leap from university to play internationally its amazing the difference and thats what exciting for us
1939302 were very proud coming to bangkok has been such a wonderful experience being with a whole different culture and experiencing that weve never been to asia before and the people here are just so supportive and so warm and lovely were just having a great time they really seem to support the universiade going to the opening ceremony the other night was an incredible experience to see all of those thousands of athletes from all over the world was fabulous to be there we are very proud to be part of it
1939303 i really appreciate my mom making the effort to come all this way im used to seeing her at all my games so it kind of gives me that little feel like im not so far away from home
1939304 the other day we went to the market after one of our games she said i cant believe im in bangkok its nice having her here and having some home support here for the team we know everyones rooting for us back home but its nice to have someone thats coming to all our games
1939305 its been a real thrill to watch erica play at the universiade
1939306 we sort of invited ourselves to go to the market with the team the other day we got to hang out with them and check out the market downtown so we got to spend a couple of hours with the girls which was really fun theyre here for basketball though and when were parents not watching the games were being tourists and getting to know bangkok a little bit its almost overwhelming theres so much to see and so many interesting things to learn how you get around in this city how you pay for things the people you meet the taxidrivers and the information you get its a real experience
1939307 its really exciting having my mom here shes been one of my best supporters for my volleyball career its really great to see familiar faces in the crowd especially having my mom here makes the experience so much sweeter
1939308 if carla gets time off it would be great to spend some time together and take her sightseeing bangkok is a beautiful city and the people are extremely friendly theyve been so open in assisting us at the hotel and helping us to get to venues and theres the shopping im sure shell want to go shopping at the market first and foremost for carla though shes here to play volleyball
1939309 im so excited this will be the first time that my mum has come to a big international meet she always gets so stressed im so happy that shes come and that im going to get to share this with them and that theyll get to see me race and race well my dad and my sisters came and watched me at commonwealths in 2002 but this is the first time since then
1939310 its been awesome hanging out this week and being at the opening ceremony with my sister tiffany who plays for canadas womens volleyball team here what more can you ask for and mom and dad made the trip too for each game im giving them my jerseys im not wearing so they can cheer me on in them theyre going to be busy watching two different sets of matches every day
1939311 both our kids playing makes it pretty special the traffic in this city is unbelievable and weve been taken to the wrong venue a couple of times so its been a real adventure this could be the last time theyre playing in the same competition so we didnt want to miss it mark plays at 5 oclock today so its going to be a bit of a run around but well make it work
1939312 its great to have them here great to have a little hometown support you could say its always nice to see canadian fans in the stands at the games and when its your parents its just an extra comfort to have them there my mom was able to come to rio too so shes kind of been on the world tour this summer now that my dads here it also feels like i have an extra coach hes always been my coach growing up so its more eyes on the field
1939313 its great to come here and see my son represent canada we met some of the team on the trip over here and have got to know them quite well the entire team is exciting to watch and the country has done a good job hosting everyone from around the world
1939314 my parents are the biggest motivation i have and im so glad that they came to thailand to watch me compete to improve is one thing but to make them proud has become a major factor for me spending time with them here even though i didnt medal has been important for me
1939315 these changes will enable anz to offer our customers some very competitive fixed rates
1939316 we would like to cut those interest rates but we will have to assess what is happening to our funding costs at that time
1939317 john is at his best when hes not trying to get it right but when hes trying to do the right thing

1939319 you know the media used to like john mccain but now they are into this obama mania thing but well try jawboning them and then when we sit down they will realise they have to be more neutral

1939369 people make fun of china for restricting the places for demonstrations in beijing but france is doing exactly the same
1939370 the paris police have banned any demonstration near the chinese embassy on the grounds that a demonstration has already been authorised on the trocadero esplanade which has become a sort of human rights ghetto
1939371 we are organising demonstrations in nine countries tomorrow to coincide with the olympic games opening ceremony
1939372 we are challenging these orders before the courts because we think we have a right to demonstrate peacefully outside the embassy of any country that does not respect human rights we hope the judge will take this into account and will recognise the non violent nature of reporters without borders protests
1939373 demonstrations organised during the olympic torch relay in paris on 7 april that resulted in outbreaks of violence any demonstration envisaged between 7 a m on 7 august and midnight on 8 august is forbidden
1939374 the aim of these demonstration could be perceived by part of the local population as a provocations likely to elicit hostile reactions that could result in serious public order disturbances

1939420 this should be your ambition to live a quiet life minding your own business
1939421 for that which is highly esteemed among men is abomination in the sight of god
1939422 what prayer means to god criticism means to the devil
1939423 the lord looks from heaven upon the children of men to see if there are any that act wisely that seek after god
1939424 they have all gone astray they are all alike corrupt there is none that does good no not one
1939425 those who do not know god shall suffer the punishment of eternal destruction and exclusion from the presence of the lord and from the glory of his might
1939426 for god so loved that world that he gave us his only son that whoever believes in him should not perish but have everlasting life
1939427 every one who calls upon the name of the lord shall be saved
1939428 dear god i realize that i have sinned against you in not seeking after you i ask you to forgive me now i believe that jesus christ your only son died and rose again for my sin i receive him as my lord and savior make me your child through jesus christ your son amen
1939429 if you confess with your lips that jesus is lord and believe in your heart that god raised him from the dead you will be saved
1939430 behold i stand at the door and knock if any one opens the door i will come in
1939431 if you then being evil know how to give good gifts to your children how much more your heavenly father will give good gifts to those who ask him mt 7 11
1939432 this building stands witnessing the fact that god of elijah lives
1939433 o god i come to you through christ your son i ask that you forgive me and make me your child
1939434 they that call upon the name of the lord shall be saved
1939435 lord you have promised this and unless you fulfill this promise i will not let you go
1939436 for god is one and there is one mediator of god and of men the man christ jesus 6 who gave himself a ransom for all to be testified in due time
1939437 lord give me rs 1000 this week so that i would know you are answering my prayers for the land
1939438 you did not choose me but i chose you and appointed you that what ever you ask of the father in my name he may give to you
1939439 that whatever you ask the father in my name he may give to you
1939440 lord jesus i am helpless help me i pray amen
1939441 had not moses his chosen one stood in the breach before him to turn away his wrath from destroying them
1939442 and i searched for a man among them who should build up the wall and stand in the gap before me for the land that i should not destroy it but i found none
1939443 thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven
1939444 this building stands witnessing the fact that god of elijah lives
1939445 then you shall call and the lord will answer you shall cry and he will say here i am
1939446 seek ye first the kingdom of god and his righteousness and all these things material needs will be added to you
1939447 he has shown his people the power of his works in giving the heritage of the nation
1939448 sir only half a bag of cement is available by 11 am we need 2 bags more
1939449 the lord will provide our needs otherwise i will give your wages whether cement is there or not as i called you for work this day
1939450 tomorrow we are on leave please take your material to day itself
1939451 sir what is there in money please dont stop your work due to lack of materials i will give it you you bring me money later on
1939452 yes as you say i am a liar you dont have to believe my words but listen to your so and so servant telling about the other one
1939453 if my people who are called by name shall humble themselves and pray i will says the lord
1939454 sir i am from so and so village i heard you have cow dung for sale
1939455 sir it is too late in the night for me to go and see where it is and to fix a price i will come tomorrow in the evening will you be here
1939456 yes i will be here tomorrow evening but you dont come late
1939457 all you may need he will provide god will take will take care of you trust him and you will be satisfied god will take care of you
1939458 he will give his angels charge of you to guard you in all your ways
1939459 for the eyes of the lord run to and fro through out the whole earth to show himself strong in the behalf of them whose heart is perfect toward him
1939460 call upon me and i will answer you and i will tell you great and mighty things which you do not know
1939461 call upon me in the day of trouble and i will rescue you and you will honor me it is god himself who has given us these promises he is the initiator he did not decide to answer prayer after the trouble filled man went to him for help he invites people to come to him with their problems
1939462 for thou hast magnified thy word above all thy name
1939463 i am the way the truth and the life no one comes to the father but through me jn 14 6
1939464 if i did not fail you with your five children why cant you trust me for fifty
1939465 lord give me a sign by a crow and i will name my ministry cherith childrens home
1939466 lord i cannot accept it because the tree belongs to my enemy
1939467 why you could have given it to me tomorrow i am going to be here all day tomorrow
1939468 tomorrow i do not know whether i would be able to give it to you because if i thought in the night even its tithe itself is a good amount why should i not give him only the tithe or i may discuss the matter with my wife and if she expressed disagreement then i would be found guilty of disobeying god so please accept it now
1939469 it is mine now you will please do me a favor tomorrow take it to the bank and bring me cash
1939470 now tell me how did you decide to give me so much money
1939471 ten years ago i lent this money to one of our close friends then finding that he would not return it in the time he promised i asked him several times about it but he was not in a position to give it back to me five years ago i wrote it off from my mind as money which was lost but yesterday before i came to the meeting he brought the money back apologizing for the undue delay when i got the money i thought to myself why should this money come to me now it is money written off and came to meeting there as i listened to your testimony the lord said this money is for mathew paul i decided then and there to give you this money
1939472 why should you run the old vehicle any more keeping so much money in hand lets get you a vehicle ill pay the balance now you can give it me when you get it
1939473 the eternal god is our dwelling place and underneath are the everlasting arms
1939474 call up on me and i will show you great and mighty things which thou knowest not
1939475 among the many bible passages setting forth this aspect of prayer one to which we would specifically call attention to is the last part of james 5 16
1939476 the energy put forth by the fervent prayer of a righteous man issues in mighty results
1939477 what ever you do i dont mind his pain must go
1939478 sir i am an atheist dont tell me about god if you can help me in any other way please help me this is my problem
1939479 is that your problem ok now listen to me for some time
1939480 i will continue to pray for you you please go and sleep comfortably god will do a miracle for you
1939481 you have a big family you need a big vehicle
1939482 for to the man who pleases him god gives wisdom and knowledge and joy but to the sinner he gives the work of gathering and heaping only to give to one who pleases god this also is vanity and striving after wind
1939483 lord if it is your will for me to go to different places to take classes like this make me provision to buy a good vehicle before i left this place
1939484 lord i asked you for something yesterday you did not give me an answer for it
1939485 the lord is asking me to give you rs 50 000 for you to buy a car i do not have that much money now i will give it you within a month
1939486 i could have sent this money by post but the lord asked me to go and give it me in person so i came
1939487 what did you think when you found me weeping that day before i left
1939488 no one understood anything we all were wondering what happened
1939489 you know i was asking the lord to make provision to buy a car before i left that place
1939490 i have had experience of evangelists come to me and ask me for financial help but to those who request i never give the lord asked me to give you this money
1939491 tell me how the lord asked you did you guess that i was praying for a car
1939492 brother i have been a business man all my life
1939493 as i was filling the second form an inner voice told me to write 500 on it so this time i wrote 500 knowingly when i went to the counter the inner voice again said send this as tmo so i sent rs 500 that day as telegraphic mo to that brother instead of sending 50 by ordinary m o
1939494 then when i went back home i was thoroughly confused i did not know why i had sent that much amount as tmo to that brother i was wondering what that brother would think about me as thirty years ago that was a sizable amount
1939495 till i got his reply on the fourth day i was in confusion when his reply came i knew it was the lord who prompted me to send that tmo
1939496 in his reply that brother wrote thank you for the tmo
1939497 i have two or three experiences like this now when the lord tells me something i will not hesitate or i will not consult flesh and blood you know the lord asked me to give this money and i am giving it to you in obedience to the lord if i do not do it i will be disobeying the lord so please accept the money without hesitation
1939498 i am not happy here let me go to the other meeting below i do not like the music here there it is good let me go there please let me go there
1939499 you do not have grace to chase me you cannot do anything to me

1939501 we are five of us our names are so and so
1939502 we did not come on our own we were sent by some one else
1939503 did you not know who i was but still why didnt you go all these days
1939504 sir we know who you are we know we cannot escape from your hands but we have no freedom we are tied down here
1939505 we will not tell you who it is i know you will fight between each other if you know who it is

1939513 ok you know where the knot is under my hand you can go and release the knot and go from this lady permanently until you do that i wont let you go
1939514 are you all ready to go out of this lady permanently
1939515 ok now one by one come and promise me that you will never come back to this lady again you must do two things first you must take hold of the bible in your hand and then you must give me promise in the name of the father the son and the holy spirit
1939516 sir that is fire in your hands we cannot take it
1939517 unless you take the bible in your hands and promise me i wont let you go whatever you say
1939518 and the lady gave me a male name four spirits gave male names and one a female name
1939519 take hold of the bible and say after me what i say as your promise
1939520 now say after me ok in the name of the father the son and the holy spirit i so and so promise to leave this lady permanently never to come back
1939521 get out you devil in the name of the father the son and the holy spirit never come back again
1939522 mr paul i am willing to be persuaded by your position
1939523 i would do every thing for you as i would do to my own brother
1939524 i called and he answered me i could not believe that he was listening to my voice
1939525 and whatever you do in word or deed do every thing in the name of the lord jesus
1939526 because as he is so are we in this world
1939527 i pray for them i do not pray for the world
1939528 what ever you ask in my name i will do that the father may be glorified in the son
1939529 as you turn to the left or to the right there is a voice behind saying this is the way and walk ye therein
1939530 i will instruct you and teach you the way you should take
1939531 and what ever you ask in prayer you will receive if you have faith
1939532 lord you have told me thus and i believe it there is no chance for it to happen humanly speaking but i know and trust it will happen because you have told me so
1939533 your iniquities have made a separation between you and your god
1939534 you ask and you receive not because you ask amiss to spend it in your fleshly desires
1939535 he who turns away his ear to listening to the law even his prayer is an abomination
1939536 he who shuts his ear to the cry of the poor will also cry himself and not be answered
1939537 when ever you stand praying forgive so that your father also who is in heaven may forgive you your transgression
1939538 you husbands likewise live with your wives in an understanding way so that your prayers may not be hindered
1939539 effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man avails much js 5 16

1939590 since a certain learning experience i have felt strongly that i should never allow my relationship with a new person to be a tool used to avoid dealing with a broken other relationship in fact one of the things i am most careful about is emotional spillover i have a policy of not spending intense time with otherloves when there is something out of balance with one love naturally this tends to speed up the opening of negotiations about the difficulty i think its unfair to my loves to use the time i spend with them as a palliative when theres trouble elsewhere it keeps me from doing the work i need to do the work i agreed to do when i took on the reality of the relationship

1939632 kita sebenarnya tidak menghadapi resesi dalam arti pertumbuhan ekonomi kita itu cukup bagus dan di balik itu agregat permintaan juga meningkat cukup baik kredit perbankan nya baik
1939633 pengeluaran pemerintah nantinya juga akan semakin memberikan stimulus dan ekspor kita masih bagus artinya kita tidak mengalami gonjang ganjing sektor keuangan masalah kemerosotan pertumbuhan ekonomi juga tidak satu hal yang kita alami adalah mengendalikan inflasi supaya tidak mengenai kepada mereka yang tidak berpendapatan tetap
1939634 ini semacam krisis di sektor keuangan dan ketiganya terjadi di amerika serikat kita syukur sampai sekarang dan moga moga juga ke depan tidak menghadapi masalah krisis sektor keuangan
1939635 dan yang penting lagi kebijakan sisi suplai untuk memperlancar arus barang dan sebagainya itu sangat penting untuk membawa inflasi ke bawah sangat penting untuk membawa inflasi ke bawah karena dampaknya pada mereka yang kurang mampu

1939648 what would you say i wonder if you were told that there is a teaching sweeping through evangelical churches in our day that not only has made changes to but has also taken out the very core of the gospel and replaced it with a fake
1939649 positive confession is the belief that if a believer speaks
1939650 copeland is responsible for spreading many of the faith movements unbiblical teachings he distorts the biblical concepts of faith and covenant he reduces god to the image of man while elevating man to the status of god he lowers jesus to being a product of positive confession who took on a satanic nature at the cross and he promotes the occult practice of creative visualization
1939651 at rhema i was taught the heretical doctrine that jesus had to die spiritually which by the way renders jesus work on the cross insufficient for mans redemption and justification i remember kenneth copeland telling us that when christ died on the cross the second person of the godhead was broken off from the other two persons
1939652 positive confession a movement that came to popular acclaim through supposedly good fruit such as healing has revealed its true nature as something more like a cult with extremes of belief that bring the name of the lord into disrepute the roots of word of faith doctrine are firmly planted in the soil of the metaphysical cults
1939653 by saying the right formulas can people control god can the holy spirit be held in the palm of the hand pumped or scooped into other people is it true that jesus christ will not come back until christians all over the world unite under the leadership of new apostles and prophets and take control of the whole earth can christians be gods
1939654 a biblical analysis of the disturbing claims put forward by the faith movement which include the inefficiency of christs blood alone to atone for the sins of man the need for christs spiritual death and that the redemption of mankind was completed in hell
1939655 some people have asked me how did god open your eyes to the errors of the faith movement so i thought it would be helpful to post to this website my own story its not a researched article but a personal testimony so take it or leave it
1939656 these examples and many many others can be demonstrated from the materials produced by the word faith teachers if you would like to hear these and many other quotes for yourself wav files please send an email specifying the individuals you are interested in
1939657 the reason you havent been healed is that you dont have enough faith
1939658 we can write our own ticket with god if we decide what we want believe that its ours and confess it

1939660 one of the most blatant and blasphemous heresies taught by the major internationally known word of faith teachers is the doctrine that says jesus christ god the son died spiritually and had to be reborn spiritually due to becoming a lost sinner
1939661 this important transcript from a tape by david wilkerson of times square church is shocking moving and very timely
1939662 as a movement rather than an organized group there is no founder or founding date per se the philosophical roots extend to gnosticism e w kenyon 1860 was perhaps the earliest modern exponent to blend the movements eastern mystical and new age elements with christian teaching
1939663 positive confession is the belief that if a believer speaks
1939664 even though the health and wealth faith movement continues to attract a following it has been seen that in many of its key doctrines it deviates from historic christian belief this is evident in almost every aspect of doctrine and practice such as christian living the doctrine of god the atonement and anthropology
1939665 want to know what someone really believes watch how they live their lifestyle when men live and promote an opulent lifestyle they have ignored the warning of jesus of loving god or loving money you cannot serve both listen to what they are teaching on the majority of sermons are on getting money and their life revolves around it what more can be said
1939666 have you heard of joyce meyer kenneth hagin kenneth copeland benny hinn fred price paul crouch kathryn kuhlman or marilyn hickey there are many proponents of the word faith movement which currently endorse a great number of heresies and blasphemies
1939667 the testimony of a man who get invovled with henry hinn benny hinns brother and his church vancouver christian center he details the false doctrines false prophesies and shady financial dealings of the church
1939668 but peter said unto him thy money perish with thee because thou hast thought that the gift of god may be purchased with money thou hast neither part nor lot in this matter for thy heart is not right in the sight of god

1939676 the rev creflo dollar jr has unabashedly embraced his name by building a religious empire on the message that his brand of piety leads to prosperity he drives a black rolls royce flies to speaking engagements across the nation and europe in a 5 million private jet and lives in a 1 million home behind iron gates in an upscale atlanta neighborhood but now dollar is wrestling with more temporal matters hes been cited for contempt of court in the evander holyfield divorce
1939677 some current teachers seem to think that moses forsaking the riches of egypt was not necessary he could have had the best of both egypt and god he didnt have to give up anything for gods kingdom the teaching that is promoted is that if we are working for the lord we should get paid better than we did when in the world after all we are serving god
1939678 among those who teach jesus and the apostles are rich are oral roberts and creflo dollar kenneth hagin
1939679 after many of her family members joined world changers church international under the charismatic leadership of the rev creflo a dollar jr florence duncan decided to give it a try but what duncan says she found was closer to a cult than to christianity
1939680 man is not divine or can he ever be man is not omnipresent omniscient or omnipotent like god and neither does he have an ability to create with words only god has these abilities may creflo dollar and kenneth copeland reject these silly notions once and for all
1939681 he is a man with more stories than anyone else has in their holster unlike his discipler copeland there is very little expository teaching from him nonetheless we have another who alters the word to his likin instead duplantis uses his personal stories to woo his audience into laughter and he is funny but it is not funny what he teaches duplantis disdains doctrine
1939682 mr hagin has long been touted as a prophet by many within the charismatic movement for years without a doubt all people within the word of faith movement look to mr hagin as a genuine prophet of god the facts seem to indicate otherwise here are three examples of hagins prophetic ability all of which failed to come to pass
1939683 that which has hindered shall be taken out of the way
1939684 from her school and these others a new generation of word of faith ministries is being grown with more and more error and heresy remember heresy does not get better it does not improve with age like a fine wine it continues to drift further and further into darkness the only way heresy is stopped in the church is by godly people standing up for the truth and being willing to swim upstream against what is popular i pray you are i will be some of these people
1939685 we must choose the stakes are enormous and eternal put away the jakes materials and revisit the bible it will tell you the truth minus the velcro
1939686 christians have come to presume that teachers and authors who profess to speak and write out of a calling from the holy spirit will present a message that is doctrinally sound and consistent from sermon to sermon and book to book however anyone who has watched the christian charismatic scene over the past several years knows that such a presumption is dangerous and often will fail to be borne out joyce meyer a rising star on the charismatic horizon with a weekly program on cable tv and the trinity broadcasting network and a new book the word the name the blood is the latest example
1939687 were going to press in and take hold of what you have for us
1939688 iccdm is of the opinion that this testimony like so many others shared by charismatic extremist ministries is untrue
1939689 parsley is a powerful motivational preacher who mixes truth with error he is one of the most popular pentecostal tv preachers in america right now he is able to release the anointing to people cuts up prayer clothes to heal by laying hands on them and praying he literally transfers and releases the tangible anointing the prayer is answered due to the what he calls the corporate anointing this is more like a transferable energy since the anointing is the holy spirit who is god and is being used as a force he tells us his faith is released toward us faith is godward not toward man he states because he prayed every prayer is answered
1939690 parsley can scream shout stomp prance obfuscate and mislead but it is all noise and no substance it is froth without real content which helps to pump money into his empire

1939826 long term investors should do nothing save for correcting mistakes of the past
1939827 diversify keep costs down and take risk intelligently the first is simple via vanguard index funds u s foreign emerging markets the second leads to vanguard as well but the third is very tough it means buying whats wounded whats down and if the market drops more buy more
1939828 im a strong believer in maintaining a well diversified portfolio through thick and thin
1939829 in the current market turmoil i recommend that investors rebalance to sensible long term targets by buying what has gone down domestic and foreign stocks and selling what has gone up treasury bonds and
1939830 when you think about investing over the long term people can put their money in only so many places they can put it in the bank in u s stocks or international stocks in real estate commodities what happens is the money moves to these different areas where ultimately almost regardless of whats happening from an economic standpoint things get so cheap they start to rebound
1939831 in general its a combination of equities fixed income investments and alternative investments in things like commodities and real estate if somebody has those components in their portfolio and the equities are diversified between u s and international theyll weather the storm a lot easier than somebody whos not quite as broadly diversified
1939832 each of those asset classes is going to have good times and bad when they go through these cycles use it as a rebalancing opportunity
1939833 this might be a good time to shift out of some of the things that have done better maybe fixed income if the investor had commodities maybe take them off the table and put that toward equities which are getting down to bargain prices this is an opportunity to rebalance the portfolio and take advantage of selling high and buying low
1939834 if you dont have any emerging markets exposure youre getting an opportunity to buy that now
1939835 its very easy for investors to get caught up in what i call short term noise its important for people to fight hard to take a step back stay focused on what your goal is be focused on building a strategically positioned portfolio for the long term and then check on it once a year twice a year
