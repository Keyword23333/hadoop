720000 after a surprising drop in the number of people employed in june we expect the canadian labour market to rebound modestly in july and add 10 000 jobs to the employment ranks
720001 despite the expected turnaround in the canadian labour market in july the sluggish pace of canadian economic activity will continue to limit the extent of any employment gains going forward
720002 because of those two things the market has turned into an emotional rollercoaster
720003 we think that in june there will be a last gasp boost to income from the remainder of the stimulus cheques
720004 as a result personal income and spending are likely to be subdued
720005 the south asia cannot progress unless there is stability and security throughout the region we have condemned all forms of terrorist violence and emphasized that our states should firmly cooperate especially through the exchange of information on terrorism and organized crime
720006 both of them if unchecked can have the potential of undoing the hard won developmental gains that the peoples of south asia and their governments have achieved
720007 we affirm our resolve to make south asia once again a major granary of the world through a series of specific regional collaborative projects

720107 well done your service to our fair town cannot be repaid and yet i am afraid we must ask for your aid again the rumors you bring do not bode well if some dark cult has risen to serve orcus they can only be interested in one thing opening a rift to the shadowlands
720108 the keep which you speak of is just north of winterhaven along the abandoned trade route it was built many centuries ago by the old nareth empire but not to guard against marauders as local legend tells no it was built over the site of a rift to the shadowfell a place of darkness
720109 not all of shadowfell is evil but this rift apparently connects to an unholy sanctuary of of orcus demon lord of the undead
720110 the surviviors fled and with the empire in ruins it was abandoned to time rumors of great treasures buried beneath the keep surface from time to time but few dare explore its halls sir keegans ghost is said to roam the corridors where he died wailing in grief over the tragedy of his life few in winterhaven dare even to mention shadowfell keep in superstition

720117 during this time of economic downturn and high gas prices mrs capito shows little regard for the burden she is placing on taxpayers
720118 as she always does during an election cycle shelley moore capito is flooding the mailboxes of west virginians with slick mailers west virginians know why mail from capitos congressional office suddenly shows up out of the blue every two years and they dont appreciate their money being spent so freely
720119 theres too much money sloshing around and too much of it sloshing around with people with overlapping affiliations and allegiances by either blood or friendship or just ties over the years there are red flags all over these relationships
720120 the climate has made millions of americans who havent been involved in a political campaign ever in their lifetimes very active
720121 we estimate that 70 percent of our grass roots volunteers havent worked in a campaign before were somewhere just shy of 2 million volunteers and we think we can potentially triple that on election day
720122 we think the turnout will be beyond record turnout and if were effective we will have done two additional things brought in millions of new people who are registered to vote and we will increase the percentage of registered voters who will turn out

720129 god isnt a teacher grading us not am i looking for the adulation of others
720130 i see the church on a plane some sitting back just expecting to be waited on others looking intently out the window but outside there is fog and cloud the folks inside the plane know they are on a journey but the cannot relate it to where they have come from nor can they engage with where they are going too it is simply obscured the reference points are obscured then suddenly and it is suddenly the plane comes right out of the cloud and fog into a clear blue sky and right there right in front of their noses is the runway horizontal runway lights inform us that we have come the right distance and vertical runway lights lead us into the landing itself as we land the holy spirit says welcome to a new season as this plane lands everyone has to get off and move on sitting there on the tarmac is not really a viable option welcome to a new season i tie this into amos 5 which i think i shared at heartland dont go back to gilgal beersheba or bethel all good places in their godly past but not where god wants us now it is a new season and the timing is no mistake
720131 what was jesus thinking when he chose both a tax collector matthew and a zealot simon to be on his team
720132 at home there is no warmth or vigor in me but in church when the multitude is gathered together a fire is kindled in my heart and it breaks its way through
720133 it was he who gave some to be apostles some to be prophets some to be evangelists and some to be pastors and teachers to prepare gods people for works of service so that the body of christ may be built up until we all reach unity in the faith and in the knowledge of the son of god and become mature attaining to the whole measure of the fullness of christ
720134 the team owner gave some to be offensive coordinators defensive coordinators conditioning coordinators special teams coordinators to coach and prepare the players to win to play with passion for the game partnership in the game and knowledge of the game
720135 we had a little bit of momentum going into halftime give credit to them they made some great adjustments and were able to do a lot of things on us in the second half
720136 the more we see the more we know the more we know the more we see
720137 the god of this age has blinded the mind of unbelievers so that they cannot see the light of the gospel of the glory of christ who is the image of god
720138 the idols of the nations are silver and gold made by the hands of men they have mouths but cannot speak eyes but they cannot see they have ears but cannot hear nor is there breath in their mouths
720139 if were going to accept this invitation to see our king again to behold his beauty and majesty were going to have to kneel well have to come in humility and wonder not with analysis and pride and self sufficiency to open our eyes and look at jesus again wondering if weve perhaps missed something lifting our eyes to see the king again in all his glory in all his shocking majesty in his surprising grace and tenderness as well his blinding holiness and purity
720140 so if youre serious about living this new resurrection life with christ act like it pursue the things over which christ presides dont shuffle along eyes to the ground absorbed with the things right in front of you look up and be alert to what is going on around where the action is see things from his perspective
720141 you always know when a person has been beholding the glory of the lord you feel in your inner spirit that he is the mirror of the lords own character
720142 i had to lift the lid to look inside and i just got walloped
720143 i could be dead its as simple as that if it was a little old lady i dont think they would have taken the shock

720150 a lot of times the u s companies because they were successful in the u s they tend to repeat their current business models
720151 i feel amazed and surprised when the exact question i am trying to ask the proper answer on that is already uploaded
720152 our goal is to plant the flag to be present said maneesh dhir aols india based international chief
720153 i do think local companies have an edge over international companies because local companies start with chinese services whereas international companies have to follow their overarching goal and cant easily adapt to chinese needs
720154 just a matter of getting some of the numbers right
720155 as far as we are concerned chances of the fight happening are around seventy percent
720156 for all of boxing and for all the people who love the sport
720157 also something personal because we have other things to settle with the golden boy
720158 i know there are so many other things that need to get settled if and when our fight pushes through what better way to do it than finish things on top of the ring
720159 our fight with de la hoya is more than personal to me than it is for the money it is for the honor of my family and my country i am putting my honor at stake because of principles that guided my career ever since i started boxing
720160 i would remind you that extremism in the defense of liberty is no vice
720161 i am very happy he won this wbo title this means so much to his career i thank the lord for this win
720162 part of my trip here is really to look for promoters and link with them
720163 if i can contact the right authorities i am thinking of giving them the chance to fight here like in the united states where there are lots of filipino boxers now

720166 the use of stolen content had become so pervasive that i couldnt surf the adult internet without running into stolen copies of our images
720167 not only did this really put a damper on my late night porn surfing but it upset me to no end instead of enjoying adult entertainment i started using those late night hours to document thieves
720168 spiders websites only grabbing the content we tell it to find
720169 once it finds the content it documents everything that a lawyer needs to prove that the thief was in fact using stolen content
720170 the big problem i see right now is not outsiders doing this rather it is people who purport to be contributing members in our industry
720171 this means when we come for you we know how to get you to the thieves that laugh about this remember that we are coordinated we are your affiliates we are the guys you sit next to at industry dinners and the people that bump your posts on boards hiding is hard to do when we know what you look like bro
720172 i dont currently see the problem with the end users as much as i do companies creating locations where the exploitation of stolen works is encouraged
720173 im sure the riaas nearly decade long efforts was what ultimately convinced them
720174 self policing is a must myspace and youtube cleaned up their act so it can be done

720176 vancouver is host to two capitals chinatown and davie village
720177 each is doing exactly the same thing for their respective communities
720178 chinatown was the capital city to all of the chinese in vancouver all of the institutions were there they have now spread
720179 it is identified for the gay community but by no means exclusive to it there is the pumpjack which tends to focus on the leather and blue jean crowd
720180 then there is the majestic which has a stage and they do shows and there is cocktail lounge where you can go in and they do entertainment and we need more
720181 i kind of miss the dufferin it was a place where you had a total mixture of incomes and backgrounds it was probably due to the cheap beer and the fact there were a lot of charity events
720182 i think gay bars are often seen as scenester type places but ive had a lot of political conversations there also straight girlfriends of mine prefer going to them because theyre not getting preyed upon by horny men
720183 leaders of rival political parties are trying to create confusion among the masses by stating the bjp would go for a pre poll or a post alliance with the sp or the bsp i will like to clarify here the bjp will have no tie up with any of these political parties both the sp and the bsp on one occasion or other have extended support to the congress led upa government
720184 there will be a straight fight between the nda and the upa in the lok sabha election the political parties including the sp bsp and the left will not emerge as an alternative as they are unable to form the government on their own

720193 ill tell you one of the best moments of my police career was getting to personally tell sandra boss that weve recovered her daughter and she absolutely collapsed in my arms i caught her before she hit the ground
720194 her first words were that she was very happy to see very nice people
720195 we both love her dearly and have only her best interests and well being at heart
720196 seems to me house republicans should be holding a public event every day in washington from now until the end of the democrats vacation to call attention to nancys anti drilling intransigence and her refusal to hold votes on the issue
720197 its not a request we make lightly but the american people are suffering
720198 the consequences of continued congressional inaction on gas prices are unacceptable weve called on the speaker to call congress back into an emergency session this month and schedule a vote on the american energy act we must continue to make a stand until the speaker complies
720199 it wont be perfect this first preseason game but we have several to get up to speed
720200 the preseason games you dont put a lot of stock in
720201 we want to get the offense going and make everyone comfortable and we want to get the defense established
720202 i think its an effective tool having that ability to get the call in in real time
720203 it alleviates some of the time it takes to get a call but they do turn it off 15 seconds before the play clock expires
720204 any time an athlete does something extraordinary anymore its how can that be
720205 because its happened so many times the heroes keep crumbling under the weight of scandals
720206 i have the perception that you want to believe and you should give someone the benefit of the doubt
720207 but unfortunately other athletes in the past have ruined that for a lot of people
720208 now its become harder and harder for people to do that
720209 we like those comeback stories we like people overcoming odds
720210 everybody in masters that ive talked to is just ecstatic
720211 its just phenomenal what shes done for a lot of us being older athletes it shows weve still got it baby
720212 with any kind of scandal or allegation if you like the person you think its so unfair to jump on them or make an assumption
720213 that was something in the back of my mind that wow shes really at that level at that age
720214 there was too much evidence there there was too much pointing to him and so i became disinterested
720215 there seems to be a willingness to say ok ive got suspicions this may be happening but now lets play the game and see who wins
720216 we have a choice we really are at the cross roads now
720217 we can decide to keep these rich hotspots of nature or see them razed to the ground if we lose the species at the rate we are going we will be losing untold riches
720218 this scandal has confirmed his reputation as the most cynical of new zealand politicians a harmful influence on the nations public life and an unfit participant in government
720219 there is a god shaped vacuum in the heart of every man which cannot be filled by any created thing but only by god the creator made known through jesus

720250 the important thing now is to see how he feels tomorrow after that ill put together a schedule to get him back pitching
720251 he threw a lot of breaking balls fastballs and a few cutters
720252 he didnt feel pain initially he had problems getting the breaking ball over and then it started getting more consistent as he finished up look forget all of that whats important is to see how it feels tomorrow and if it feels fine then we can step it up and get him ready to pitch

720260 we didnt get any news of major violence from the election areas
720261 its positive he said he felt good so its just a first step
720262 just the fact that he got out there and he felt good throwing he didnt have any discomfort thats a great sign
720263 so well just every day add to it build it up
720264 hes been doing a lot of shoulder conditioning hes been doing a lot of stuff in the weight room with our strength coach hes been doing a lot of core work a lot of leg work a lot of cardio and just getting treatment on his shoulder

720267 mentally im pretty good if you tell me something i can get through it
720268 but now this is dragging on toward 10 weeks and i know its a new injury and i didnt count on that and its mentally draining its something ive struggled with mentally at home
720269 i dont know how much id be able to help but id like to see
720270 id like to at least try to help out around here
720271 maybe this is a triple a rochester team in minnesota
720272 rochester has taken one on the chin to the benefit of the major league club
720273 they all understand what were trying to do down there manager stan cliburn and pitching coach stu cliburn in triple a understand that we want these guys to be versatile be able to move around a little bit play both sides
720274 they move them all around down there if you look at the triple a lineup you see guys playing everywhere
720275 they were in spring training they know how we play and how we go about doing things
720276 its no secret to them they come in and plug right in
720277 i dont know the exact term of what he has i know he had a bad throat infection just under the weather i dont know maybe a touch of the flu a virus he hasnt even been at the park the last two days weve left him at the team hotel because we wanted him to rest as much as possible and also make sure that he didnt spread it to anybody else
720278 hes throwing the ball low to mid 90s with a good breaking ball the stuff is there just repeating the delivery and being consistent in the strike zone is really all he needs to do the physical ability with the pitches is there weve seen him dominate at times but consistency isnt there and this is a very tough league without consistently putting the ball where you want to thats the main thing
720279 but this is the big leagues and really you have to perform at this level its the top the top league in the sport so hes right there hes had success here before and we expect him to have more in the future but right now he wasnt performing up to what we need
720280 im just trying to get the barrel to the ball
720281 i havent done anything different thats just the way things are sometimes
720282 when he gets hot he puts home runs together in spurts
720283 hes swinging the bat really really well right now they pitch him a little differently here lately theyve been really pounding him in theyve been playing their defense over to the pull side he takes advantage of it when they make a mistake and hell drive a ball to right center field or pick up an rbi in that situation
720284 hes fun to watch and hes a guy that can carry a team at any time
720285 this is my first time getting to watch him up close and im having a lot of fun watching him
720286 i dont know why that is i guess im just excited when hes pitching
720287 when he gets hot it doesnt matter if hes hitting in yosemite
720288 wood threw a lot of breaking balls threw fastballs and a few cutters and didnt feel it
720289 he hadnt been out there in a while initially he had problems getting the breaking ball over then it started getting a little more consistent when he finished up
720290 he looked a little rusty thats to be expected the important thing now is to see how he feels on monday after that ill put together a schedule to get him back pitching a lot depends on monday
720291 then we can step it up and get him ready to pitch
720292 once we get through the first obstacle the finger then we can worry about getting his arm in shape thats why i mean stepping it up

720348 you want me to teach you how to be less gay so you can sleep with more men ok
720349 4i thank my god always concerning you for the grace of god which was given you in christ jesus 5that in everything you were enriched in him in all speech and all knowledge 6even as the testimony concerning christ was confirmed in you 7so that you are not lacking in any gift awaiting eagerly the revelation of our lord jesus christ 8who will also confirm you to the end blameless in the day of our lord jesus christ 9god is faithful through whom you were called into fellowship with his son jesus christ our lord
720350 7so that you are not lacking in any gift awaiting eagerly the revelation of our lord jesus christ
720351 it is not by personal holiness that a man shall enter heaven but yet without holiness shall no man see the lord
720352 it was a good game with a good intensity for pre season we were not in trouble defensively too much and also created a lot of chances it was very positive our shape was much better than yesterday our movement was better and overall we got what we wanted from these kind of games it was serious but as well we could take different initiatives in the last two days i have learned a lot about my squad and how our preparation has gone it was two great days
720353 he felt that people had questioned his commitment and the best answer to that is to give your all on the pitch play well show that you are ready to fight for your shirt fight for your team and be efficient he showed that and he is a man of character you know how it is if you score goals people quickly forget the frustration you have to show things with performances in our job
720354 i dont know if gareth barry will leave aston villa or not but i am not on his case i like gareth barry and i like two or three other players it is better i dont speak about names i said that yesterday it is better i leave things to your imagination and creation
720355 i cannot tell you anything more if we sign a player we will come out and tell you but i can say to you now that we are not close to signing anybody
720356 you wouldnt want to put any limitations on his participation in the season because he is only 16 at that age you can improve he looked strong enough and not phased by the big games the quality is there i dont look too much at his age more at what he is doing on the pitch and right now what he is doing is good
720357 he is ahead of where he was last year i hope theo is more regular in the team this year no 14 is a big number to inherit but i have confidence in him of course but it is down to performances i feel his first touch is much better he moves the ball quicker and his penetration and final ball is better there is goal scoring potential in him and hopefully one day we will get that out of him for now he is not a link player between the midfield and the strikers like robin van persie can be and he is maybe at the moment a fraction short physically to play as a real target man because there you get bombarded in the air he can play wide right and wide left as well
720358 i think it was a good game between robinho and bacary sagna he wasnt fazed by the physical challenge if you want to know if i think robinho can adapt in the premier league he looks like he has the ingredients to do it i am not worried if he joins chelsea because chelsea will always have 11 good players on the pitch no matter if it is robinho or somebody else they will always have the choice

720470 this is a real place there really are jewish people israelites we can actually go to places like jerusalem bethlehem and egypt all of these stories are supposed to be real
720471 they are israelites and to them belong the adoption the glory the covenants the giving of the law the worship and the promises to them belong the patriarchs and from them according to the flesh comes the messiah
720472 lamb of god that takes away the sins of the world

720474 in the last two weeks there has been specific intelligence of a threat to prince harry
720475 of course given the source and the princes status as a serving army officer who has seen active service in afghanistan it is being treated seriously every precaution is being taken
720476 intelligence reports show that he came into the country from somalia to seek medical attention because of a kidney condition

720482 theres nothing like fiddlers bid in full flight you should take every opportunity you get to see them live
720483 i kind of was able to go under the radar screen for the first four days until i had five gold medals
720484 and then of course there was a lot more pressure i think this michael phelps has got a good handle on all the pressure
720485 he knows how to handle it hes done very well
720486 how did this ever happen to a little old town like ours
720487 did i ever think this would happen naw not in a million years this is beyond my imagination
720488 if we can stabilize some of these costs we can provide good jobs for the future of these young people
720489 we know they have been interested in having a relationship with our company for some time
720490 we will of course be looking forward to how this will evolve
720491 ill tell you one of the best moments of my police career was getting to personally tell sandra boss that weve recovered her daughter and she absolutely collapsed in my arms i caught her before she hit the ground
720492 her first words were that she was very happy to see very nice people
720493 we both love her dearly and have only her best interests and well being at heart

720502 well put a boot up your ass its the american way
720503 new and interesting species are still being discovered on caribbean islands despite the very small amount of natural forests remaining
720504 for many years it has been said that capital is the bottleneck for a developing industry i dont think this any longer holds true i think its the work force and the companys inability to recruit and maintain a good work force that does constitute the bottleneck for production i think this will hold true even more in the future
720505 i am the bread of life he who comes to me will never go hungry and he who believes in me will never be thirsty
720506 i tell you the truth unless you change and become like little children you will never enter the kingdom of heaven
720507 thats cool as long as you arent just doing for the sake of being different
720508 hmm yea youre right i just think i approach things from a different angle its cool whatever
720509 god knows whats up and i just put my faith in christ being who he says he is and who i am
720510 pressure buildup in a small sealed sample bottle in a storage safe resulted in plutonium contamination of a storage room
720511 we have the organizational ability and the financial ability to compete there
720512 some of the old givens are no longer true its not how it was 20 years ago or even 10 years ago
720513 it cant be understated that he is from our neighbouring state
720514 barack obama coming up here and competing here is going to force john mccain to make a choice
720515 for everything that mccain does up here thats a little bit less that he can do in these big battleground states we always hear about
720516 m nga anv nde syrgas f r f rsta g ngen
720517 he was kind of a lost soul it was as if he was always looking for something
720518 i think in their culture the issue of mental illness is kind of frowned upon
720519 there was the constant paranoia a feeling that he was always being watched and that others might be out to get him there were his bizarre rambling stories that seemed to come out of nowhere
720520 not only is it creepy but its objectifying and downright annoying i have never once stopped in my tracks looked at my perp in the eye sincerely thanked him and then handed him my number
720521 its a feminist issue but its also a human issue why have so many women simply accepted this kind of harassment as part of the female job description
720522 it doesnt matter what im wearing either ive been hit on on my way home from the gym red faced pony tailed wearing sweats and coated in a sheet of sweat er excuse me glistening
720523 this initial graph shows that the majority of men actually did want to pursue something with me beyond catcalling which was unexpected especially considering its strange that they would use such a relatively offensive method of catching my attention if they actually wanted to go on a date with me or maybe they were caught off guard since im sure they never get a positive response from the women they verbally harass upon approaching them they appeared rather flustered but still semi confident i gave them each fake phone numbers sorry boys
720524 woo i dont know if its the impending heatwave or the fact that im wearing a belted t shirt as a dress but every construction worker and his brother in law wanted to bang this hot mami this morning or so they verbalized
720525 an anonymous commenter brought up the excellent point that just because the men positively embrace my response to their jeers it does not mean they want to date me instead it probably means they just want to fuck me
720526 so now we will operate under the premise that when they ask for my phone number they are simply trying to get in my pants
720527 if any fellow catcallers and readers of jess and josh want to take on this task and report back we would be very grateful otherwise i guess well all have to keep on wondering why men do the things they do zomg lolz
720528 damn anyone that says the good lord dont smoke is crazy you gotta be high to give one girl all that
720529 a completely frivolous way to choose the next president of the united states
720530 a complete waste of the money john mccains contributors have donated to his campaign
720531 it is a complete waste of the countrys time and attention at the very moment when millions of people are losing their homes and their jobs
720532 miss hilton was not asked nor did she give permission for the use of her likeness in the ad and has no further comment

720534 its beyond dispute that hes become the biggest celebrity in the world
720535 previously we had guessed at what logs would need to be replaced
720536 now we can see that a lot more of them do
720537 id like to think that by christmas we can have the foundation stabilized and the house back on it

720540 sekolah kami ini sekolah abnormal biasanya ada yayasan punya duit bangun gedung dan kepala sekolah tinggal menerima kuncinya sekolah pgri tumbuh dari bawah tidak ada sumber dari yayasan
720541 kalau di sekolah umumnya di dalam kelas kalau tidak mendikte guru menulis di papan tulis dan anak mencatat atau seorang anak disuruh mencatat di papan tulis anak anak lain menyalin gurunya baca koran celakanya lagi anak anaknya disuruh mencatat guru tidak ada di dalam kelas kegiatan belajar mengajar kita tidak jauh dari itu bagaimana anak anak kita bisa kreatif
720542 saya ingin memberikan contoh sudah tua pun saya masih sekolah pembelajaran yang tidak pernah berhenti dibutuhkan untuk seorang guru
720543 she turned up her coat collar so he could not see that she was crying weakly like an old woman
720544 part of what makes him want to get married is chemistry and passion but its also about certain actions and behaviors that are more concrete than youd think
720545 she does this by being spontaneous and a little unpredictable taking on new interests all the time and revealing different facets of herself
720546 she makes being with her an adventure as if theres always a new idea or activity just around the bend
720547 with most of my girlfriends i feared that wed run out of things to talk about if we spent too much time together but when i met my fianc e gwen i kept discovering new layers to her one day she came home from work with a stack of cookbooks the next week she told me stories about how she loved designing outfits in high school shes full of small surprises
720548 i dated a lot of girls who liked pushing boundaries but it all seemed a little forced my wifes sense of adventure however comes from within shes naturally driven to challenge herself by trying new things thats the kind of girl you want to marry if you arent continually fascinated by each other it wont last
720549 the thing that makes my fianc e so captivating she takes risks i dont mean she bungee jumps off bridges its more that when a new opportunity comes along a different facet to her job or the chance to meet new people at an event or party she grabs it and proceeds her boldness makes her enchanting
720550 men crave sex thats erotic but they also want sex that makes them feel deeply bonded
720551 a guys biggest fear is that the great sex that made him think you were the one will fall by the wayside
720552 a woman who puts effort into maintaining that sizzle is a dream come true
720553 to make sure that the awesome sex we had when we first met didnt lose its passion my wife came up with this idea for regular sex bets for example shed bet me that i couldnt make her climax several times in a row or id challenge her to initiate action in a semipublic spot we have never fallen into a rut and our competition keeps us feeling connected
720554 my fianc e did this terrific thing when we first started having sex after we were finished shed tell me how good i made her feel that she really liked how i felt against her skin it made me want to tell her what i liked too guys arent supposed to admit it but opening up about how sex affects us emotionally actually enhances the physical side of things
720555 my fianc e was up front from the start about her desire for an extremely satisfying sex life she never had any hang ups about taking charge in bed or proposing out there activities that a lot of women would be afraid to admit they were curious about i could tell i wasnt getting ensnared in the classic bait and switch marriage that so many guys fall into you know when the action slows to a halt a year after you become husband and wife
720556 a woman who depends on a man for her sense of fulfillment is a scary thing for a guy
720557 men dont want to feel smothered or totally responsible for their partners day to day happiness
720558 before we were married jess would go out with her group of friends a lot which i later became a part of but she didnt put all of her focus on me she made it clear that she was there to hang out with them i really liked the fact that she wasnt the type of girl who ditches her girlfriends when she meets a guy it made me confident that shed always have her own life outside our relationship
720559 she definitely makes time for me so we can do things as boyfriend and girlfriend but my fianc e also keeps up her own life she has a weekly dinner with college friends an art class every thursday night plus the responsibilities of her job as a journalist i like that she doesnt check with me first to see what i want to do and she doesnt offer to bail out of an event or night out with pals in favor of always being with me
720560 men view life as a struggle or war that theyre fighting and they want someone wholl be on their side at all times through thick and thin
720561 this doesnt mean that a woman should mother him or assist him with every little detail of his life its more about consistently doing small nurturing things that let him know you really care
720562 these gestures are tiny but they reassure a man that his girl is solidly on his team
720563 when we first started becoming a serious couple my fianc accepted a new job that required a lot of travel and attention still even from hotels across the country she took the time to call and check in on how my day was going and e mail me little messages she even stocked my refrigerator with beer and sandwiches before shed leave on another trip her concern and thoughtfulness helped push our relationship to a higher level
720564 every so often my in laws and i will get into an argument
720565 young guys tend to try to get away with as little as possible and a lot of women let them thinking that it would be out of line to challenge their man
720566 but a man admires a woman who encourages him to shape up and toe the line as long as she has his best interests in mind and isnt trying to mold him
720567 even though it might seem like tough love at the time she helps him achieve and accomplish things and deep down he appreciates her for that
720568 before we got engaged the woman who is now my fianc told me that she thought i was drinking too much working too hard and not taking care of myself ouch but when i actually took in what she said i knew that she was right and she was looking out for me no other girlfriend had ever been so honest
720569 the shelter was falling apart and they were going to shut it down so he stepped in
720570 it was far and above what they needed and ever received
720571 it just struck me as such a rough situation just because cops in general get kind of a bad rap lately and people forget it is the scariest job out there
720572 im from arizona so im always a little aware of things that are going on there
720573 enables me to earn my living five francs a day and self respect
720574 when i step into the brown of her eyes brown earth color woman takes me into the secret of her sighs gentling me in a balance of passion

720577 she was basically trying to say charlie manipulated the kids and acted inappropriately with them
720578 its disgusting and totally untrue charlie is furious denise has really pushed it too far this time
720579 i kissed sarah jessica parker i played a lesbian in sex and the city and i had to kiss her
720580 i have experimented with same sex relationships in my life but it wasnt about enjoyment with sarah jessica
720581 her character was supposed to be reluctant about getting involved so it wasnt a passionate kiss it was a reticent one which is the reason i didn t enjoy it
720582 attorneys for mr labeouf confirm that an automobile accident involving an additional party occurred early morning in los angeles on july 27 2008
720583 she doesnt like my taste in guys she says i have terrible taste
720584 she was stunned when he suggested the idea explaining that his son loved a good dance
720585 but charles gnawed his fist to within an inch of its knuckle when his aides explained what sort of dancing she did for a living
720586 lilys flat is lovely but it helps when youve got friends in high places when she told camilla mohammed al fayeds daughter she was moving into her new place she jumped into action and asked her dad if he could help lily out
720587 of course he said yes not all of it was free but he gave lily a massive discount well over half price on household stuff that should have cost more than 30 000
720588 he really likes lily they met when she opened the harrods sale for him a couple of years ago and got on like a house on fire
720589 mr al fayed let her have the run of the store that time and he was more than happy to do that for her again
720590 she said it was love at first sight and he is completely in love with her watching them look deeply into each others eyes it was obvious that this is a very serious affair
720591 if the north american churches dont accept the need for moratoria then to say the least we are no further forward
720592 the idea of a covenant which includes as many of them as possible becomes more fragile and that means that as a communion we continue to be in grave peril
720593 thats an assumption i cant accept because i think the issue about what conditions a church lays down for a blessing have to be shaped by its own thinking and its own praying
720594 in these days together we have not overcome our problems or reinvented our structures that will still take time
720595 we may not have put an end to all our problems but the pieces are on the board
720596 cada giro en mi cabeza fue una historia buenos aires con su magia se meti en mi memoria
720597 negar que he deseado ser querido ser a una impostura lo he so ado lo he padecido y lo sufro con agrado siempre he deseado que me quisieran aunque esta aspiraci n no conduzca jam s a buenos resultados comerciales ni traiga aparejada una libreta de cheques pero mi capacidad fraternal es tan sincera de tan sencilla buena fe que soy de los que quieren sin discriminar a la gu a telef nica entera quiero a los que me saludan y quiero hasta a los que me estafan

720600 claire huchet bishop was raised in le havre france and studied at the sorbonne story telling was a favorite avocation in the huchet family and claire began telling stories at the first french childrens library in paris later she told stories at the new york public library and began to write them down as well
720601 the most insignificant office that ever the invention of man contrived or his imagination conceived
720602 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
720603 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
720604 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
720605 the worst thing you could do is raise peoples payroll taxes my god
720606 on social security he sen obama wants to raise social security taxes i am opposed to raising taxes on social security i want to fix the system without raising taxes
720607 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
720608 a politician with a troublesome reputation for trying to have it both ways
720609 mr gore has a bit of a reputation for flip flopping and corner cutting
720610 at least you know what i believe and where i stand
720611 achieving the goal before this decade is out of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to the earth
720612 we are being told by scientists we may have less than 10 years to make dramatic change lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
720613 addressing both the challenges and significant opportunities that humanity is facing requires significant innovation in technology business and building and we are extremely excited to hear mr gores timely exploration of the intersection of these industries
720614 wait a second if youve gotten to the point where youre sheepish about us doing well i cant vote for you
720615 hey jimmy were only guys we show up at 11 30 we tell the jokes thats what pretty boys do all night
720616 gas prices are not coming down in the near future
720617 if all electricity used in the united states can be produced by using sun wind and geothermal energy vehicles that operate on rechargeable batteries would become practical
720618 he is a great surrogate he is the top surrogate
720619 we just found out last week that gore could come to the island
720620 he asked gore to come and to be his surrogate
720621 obama is the first presidential candidate to refuse federal funds in a general election
720622 while mccain will get 85 million from the federal government for his campaign our goal is to raise 300 to 400 million
720623 this will be the second or third fundraiser hell attend its pretty special gores a nobel prize winner an academy award winner and almost president
720624 i had just come out of the cotton fields and corn fields
720625 i was on welfare with my family and i hated welfare i got angry and upset and told them i wanted to go to work
720626 we wanted better health care shoes and clothing i felt during the years of my life working in the cotton field they owed me that i just got angry went from door to door we pulled together a few hundred women
720627 we started marching on the welfare department demanding what we wanted and needed it was about 6 000 people
720628 the police came and arrested us we had to do something to call attention to our agenda of wanting jobs and wanting to get away from welfare
720629 i feel good about the honor i am grateful because i earned it i worked for it and i do it from the cotton fields to the bright street of las vegas earned that
720630 scientists have confirmed that enough solar energy falls on the surface of the earth every 40 minutes to meet 100 percent of the entire worlds energy needs for a full year tapping just a small portion of this solar energy could provide all of the electricity america uses
720631 enough wind power blows through the midwest corridor every day to also meet 100 percent of u s electricity demand
720632 anyone can make a baby but not everyone can be a parent
720633 if president bush had pursued the right energy policies and made the investments in clean coal technology that he promised eight years ago he might not be talking about the high gasoline prices today
720634 big hurdle is fund raising even among a business community that is desperate to throw out mr mcgraw
720635 10 thinks you didnt know about west virginia gov joe manchin
720636 in my 31 years of social work i dont think ive seen a crime this heinous perpetrated against a social worker in the line of duty
720637 colorado obama 47 mccain 45 virginia obama 47 mccain 46 missouri obama 45 mccain 47
720638 alabama too close to call arkansas too close to call
720639 why is it that barack obama cant consistently overshoot 50 and john mccain cant comfortably crack 45 in the national polls
720640 thats just as powerful just as strong just as well funded
720641 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
720642 do you think running a campaign ad in which you feature britney spears and paris hilton with barack obama is respectful
720643 its a bit of humor its a way to draw people into the ad
720644 were not deciding whos our favorite celebrity who we are fans of
720645 the only strategy theyve got in this election is to try to scare you about me
720646 well you know hes got a funny name and he doesnt look like all the presidents on the dollar bills and the five dollar bills
720647 what obama was saying is theyre trying to scare you
720648 theyre trying to scare the american people and believe me im an expert on how they do that
720649 to insinuate that his celebrity is somehow all he has
720650 theyre trying to say to america somehow hes not like you
720651 the mccain campaign is to use barack obamas words raising the question is he a risky guy but it has nothing to do with his name or his skin color it has to do with his lack of experience and bad judgment his unreadiness to be president
720652 in 2000 al gore gave me the extraordinary honor of being the first jewish american to run for national office and al gore said he had confidence in the american people that they would judge me based on my record not on my religion
720653 and i urge barack obama to have the same faith in the american people that they will judge him on his record or lack of record certainly not on his name or his race
720654 break americas gridlock by honoring a bipartisan effort if that is the only way to move us towards alternative and renewable fuels
720655 when john mccain brings american troops home from iraq theyre staying home
720656 i think liebermans going to want to be part of the stronger democratic majority
720657 i choose to reach across the aisle with john kerry to protect homeowners against foreclosure
720658 kerry advocates all kinds of additional socialism at home appeasement abroad and what that means is weakness for the future
720659 i came up with one more energy related prediction the greatest self propelled vehicle ever invented the bicycle will experience a major renaissance
720660 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
720661 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
720662 i had other priorities in the 60s than military service
720663 in the councils of government we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence whether sought or unsought by the military industrial complex
720664 the potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist
720665 surrender of personal excellence and community value in the mere accumulation of material things it measures neither our wit nor our wisdom and can tell us everything about america except why were proud to be americans
720666 and yet few politicians have seemed inclined to address solutions particularly if those solutions involve a modest individual sacrifice
720667 since taking steps to make his home more environmentally friendly last june gore devours an average of 17 768 kwh per month 1 638 kwh more energy per month than the year before the renovations by comparison the average american household consumes 11 040 kwh in an entire year according to the energy information administration the cost of gores electric bills over the past year topped 16 533
720668 the conrad foundation is based on petes history of innovation and entrepreneurship
720669 we believe that ultimately it will offer a platform to encourage students to explore entrepreneurship while creating innovative solutions to important issues that face our world and their future
720670 when al gore recently challenged america to convert to clean renewable energy he struck a chord within our foundation
720671 if al gores challenge can galvanize the nation to develop renewable energy why not ask americas youth to answer the challenge in our 2009 competition we have invited our students to answer al gores challenge
720672 fancy farm represents something very special in the american political tradition
720673 isnt it remarkable that a community like this one for 112 years has been able to play a key role in shaping the future of kentucky and sometimes the future of this nation
720674 every state is important to john mccain but there are other states where hes going to have to be
720675 i would love to see him come to kentucky i really would during this election and i hope he will
720676 but you dont have to be a mental giant to look at the map and see that there are more fruitful opportunities in terms of winning the election
720677 its the changing nature of the south and southern border states which has not been favorable to democrats and the movement of white conservative democrats to the republican party
720678 i wouldnt put kentucky or tennessee out there with utah and the really strong overwhelmingly republican states but at least with presidential politics democrats will struggle in those states
720679 there might be a give of one or two points but i think for the long term we have consistently led by double digits for some time for kentucky i dont see that narrowing to single digits
720680 when i ran for u s senate in 04 we werent on that map either before fancy farm i think i was behind somewhere around 27 points so no one was looking at kentucky
720681 there are a lot of things that can happen between fancy farm and november
720682 should we ignore gore or put him in charge hes an absurd extremist says mark davis the planet does not need saving the climate is not in crisis
720683 options fade for failing schools outside managers lack of interest in texas has forced campus closures
720684 we have to live with our feet very much rooted in reality
720685 were pursuing renewables as well but you cant simply take away half of your energy base
720686 to be sure reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years will require us to overcome many obstacles
720687 it would be difficult for north carolina to meet a 10 percent renewable portfolio standard with only new north carolina renewable supply resources by 2021
720688 by 2010 were lowering sulfur oxide and nitrous oxide emissions by 70 percent from 2002 three years before required
720689 the main reason we did it was just to show people what the possibilities are
720690 a price point comparison will be low enough to do it one day i guess the way of capturing solar energy is kind of expensive silicon is expensive
720691 this is really just our first dip of our toe into the water
720692 this is our time to step up and see if its feasible
720693 were just getting into it right now we wont know probably for at least a couple of years how it works
720694 coal is dirty any way you slice it coal isnt good
720695 if you were to put a price on health coal would cost a whole lot and solar would begin to seem more reasonable
720696 dr zawahiri was enjoying a meal when the earth suddenly heated up by several thousand degrees
720697 the way it happened makes al gore look like a prophet
720698 dr zawahiri was enjoying a meal when the earth suddenly heated up by several thousand degrees
720699 the way it happened makes al gore look like a prophet
720700 but i resent when you throw out stupid allegations that have no merit and really no purpose other than to inflame
720701 for ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but ye have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry abba father rom 8 23 and not only they but ourselves also which have the firstfruits of the spirit even we ourselves groan within ourselves waiting for the adoption to wit the redemption of our body rom 9 4 who are israelites to whom pertaineth the adoption and the glory and the covenants and the giving of the law and the service of god and the promises gal 4 5 to redeem them that were under the law that we might receive the adoption of sons eph 1 5 having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by jesus christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will
720702 i object to the gentleman from california vote being counted he came down and voted late he said he was not in the chamber when his name was called and therefore hes not entitled to vote
720703 cleve youre wrong chet was back there behind the rail and i was standing by him when he answered his answer just wasnt heard
720704 you have a talent for leadership bob the country needs young men like you in the leadership of the nation
720705 after about a year i became disinterested quit paying my dues and dropped my membership in the organization during the nine years that have followed i have never been interested in the klan
720706 the klan is needed today as never before and i am anxious to see its rebirth here in west virginia and in every state in the nation
720707 you have a talent for leadership bob the country needs young men like you in the leadership of the nation
720708 after about a year i became disinterested quit paying my dues and dropped my membership in the organization during the nine years that have followed i have never been interested in the klan
720709 the klan is needed today as never before and i am anxious to see its rebirth here in west virginia and in every state in the nation
720710 ive always said this document and the holy bible theyve been all the guidance i need
720711 much to be thankful for theres not much i wouldnt do over
720712 we just ask that in the end gods grace shines upon us
720713 he said and taking one hand to steady the other he slowly scratched his name on the gift thank you senator byrd http my barackobama com page community post jefferyfloyd ggbfbb aug 2 2008 at 8 50 pm
720714 i would never fight in the armed forces with a negro by my side rather i should die a thousand times and see old glory trampled in the dirt never to rise again than to see this beloved land of ours become degraded by race mongrels
720715 it is appointed unto men once to die but after this the judgment
720716 you know i have been very clear in my denunciation of minister farrakhans anti semitic comments i think they are unacceptable and reprehensible i did not solicit this support he expressed pride in an african american who seems to be bringing the country together i obviously cant censor him but it is not support that i sought and were not doing anything i assure you formally or informally with minister farrakhan
720717 but if the word reject sen clinton feels is stronger than the word denounce then im happy to concede the point and i would reject and denounce
720718 look over there at my links they are brilliant pick one any one you wont be disappointed
720719 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
720720 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
720721 once again the oilman in the white house is echoing the demands of big oil
720722 americans deserve policies that free us from fossil fuels and give us better choices that will bring down our energy costs make our air cleaner and help solve global warming
720723 the idea that we can drill our way out of this is just so absurd
720724 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
720725 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
720726 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
720727 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
720728 coal makes us sick its global warming its ruining our country its ruining the world weve got to stop using fossil fuel
720729 when we brought the organization to philadelphia and we did research with then television partner nbc polling people of the philadelphia area the awareness factor of arena football was about 1 5 percent
720730 today i dont think theres a sports fan in philadelphia that hasnt at least heard of the philadelphia soul
720731 i know that the players are happy i know that our fans are happy i know that the recipients of our philanthropy are happy
720732 if this victory can clear the way and get rid of the curse that theyve had here for a number of years i hope it does
720733 i hope the eagles now can win it the sixers mo cheeks and those guys can win it
720734 its amazing how many people have texted or e mailed or called
720735 coach tom coughlin from the giants andy reid bill belichick bob kraft doug flutie john elway al gore youd be surprised at the people who were glued to their tv sunday charlie weis
720736 so many people that weve run into over the years that just had the best of wishes for what we just accomplished it was pretty cool
720737 i respect speaker pelosi i think shes one of the great american success stories
720738 we talk about new york sen hillary clinton and her inspiration to millions of americans speaker pelosi has been an inspiration as well
720739 i may disagree with all the ways of getting there but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue and his continuous leadership and i am in no way trying to get into a fight with him
720740 but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue and his continuous leadership and i am in no way trying to get into a fight with him
720741 mccain is going to be just like obama mccain is a socialist and will pick nancy pelosi as his vp because he hates conservatives
720742 i respect speaker pelosi i think shes one of the great american success stories
720743 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
720744 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that
720745 the quickest cheapest and best way to start using all this renewable energy is in the production of electricity in fact we can start right now using solar power wind power and geothermal power to make electricity for our homes and businesses
720746 our struggling auto giants switch to the manufacture of plug in electric cars
720747 new and replacement generating plants will cost about 560 billon through 2030 absent a significant expansion of energy efficiency programs or new climate initiatives
720748 of course there are those who will tell us this cant be done
720749 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
720750 we have been drilling for more oil and the prices have gone up
720751 a lot more oil has been found a lot more has been produced
720752 the exploding demand for oil especially in places like china is overwhelming the rate of new discoveries by so much that oil prices are almost certain to continue upward over time no matter what the oil companies promise
720753 john mccain enters the offshore drilling debate with voters favor
720754 wants the government to act to address the immediate price consequences and to act now for achieving energy independence in the medium and long term
720755 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
720756 i didnt read all the specifics of his plan i agree with his goal i may disagree on all the ways of getting there but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue
720757 i am in no way trying to get in a fight with gore because we share the same goal
720758 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
720759 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
720760 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
720761 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
720762 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
720763 the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
720764 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil 10 years from now
720765 the way to bring gas prices down is to end our dependence on oil and use the renewable sources that can give us the equivalent of 1 a gallon gasoline
720766 windmills should be installed in every uninhabited windy place in this country
720767 the driver of the town car that eventually whisked away gores wife and daughter left the engine idling and the ac cranking for 20 minutes before they finally left
720768 anyone who drives an electric car falls in love with an electric car
720769 we could further increase the value and efficiency of a unified national grid by helping our struggling auto giants switch to the manufacture of plug in electric cars an electric vehicle fleet would sharply reduce the cost of driving a car reduce pollution and increase the flexibility of our electricity grid
720770 hi mom this is john doe your son you believe me dont you
720771 oil generates only 3 percent of our electricity therefore a 100 percent renewable electricity system does little to reduce our oil dependency
720772 we can not drill our way out of this crisis regarding oil
720773 americans hate being dependent for our mobility and therefore for our livelihoods on countries often hostile to our way of life
720774 the need for math and science education and higher level thinking skills
720775 the capital costs of wind and solar are terrifying to contemplate
720776 wir haben hier einen fan von dir und wollten fragen ob du heute da bist ja super den gesamten tag das ist toll dann schauen wir nachher rein danke tsch
720777 naja und wenn ich schon mal in bremen bin ists doch klar dass ich mal hier her muss

720779 wenn du zeit hast w rde ich gerne mal sehen wo die blogeintr ge entstehen
720780 naja wenn du schon hier bist warum nicht zotter schokolade
720781 lacks the qualities needed to lead britain effectively through its current economic problems
720782 browns hypocrisy is much closer to the classical sense of the term which involves not believing what you say
720783 answering clintonism with ken starrs inquisition impeachment was offering a cure worse than the disease
720784 anyone who drives an electric car falls in love with an electric car
720785 to show that he is a regular guy despite a perceived surplus of gravitas which at least some americans seem to find intimidating
720786 all over this country people are asking whether or not george bush is smart enough to be president of the united states
720787 does anyone in america doubt that kerry has a higher iq than bush im sure the candidates sats and college transcripts would put kerry far ahead
720788 i dont know how theyve done it because my record is not public
720789 i must have been drinking the night before i took that military aptitude test
720790 once you settle for a ronald reagan then its easy to settle for a george bush and once you settle for a george bush then its real easy to settle for bush ii you know this should be evolution instead its devolution whats next
720791 all of us are ignorant of many things its just that the liberal here thinkss he knows what the conservative is ignorant of
720792 small c conservatives are smeared as stupid by liberals because they respect the values of western civilisation
720793 a few months later another study emerged demonstrating that the average iq of states that had voted for gore was much higher than those that went for bush connecticut was given an average iq of 113 while conservative utah scored an 87 again barely above retarded according to these numbers the 16 smartest states all went for kerry while the 26 dumbest went for bush
720794 liberals believe in free speech individual liberty religious freedom the right to make a living
720795 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
720796 the leading experts predict that we have less than 10 years to make dramatic changes in our global warming pollution lest we lose our ability to ever recover from this environmental crisis
720797 eliminate carbon from the us electricity supply by 2018 or we are doomed
720798 a challenge to all americans in every walk of life to our political leaders entrepreneurs innovators engineers and to every citizen
720799 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront this issue as president next year
720800 given how hot its been this summer can there be any doubt about global warming
720801 does anyone have any reliable information from knowledgeable sources regarding how much oil is out there
720802 on this anniversary of his first landmark testimony hansen once again appeared before congress today
720803 i tell you the truth it is hard for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven again i tell you it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of god
720804 there is strong disagreement with many of the legal analytical economic science and policy interpretations
720805 is a deeply flawed and unsuitable vehicle for reducing greenhouse gas emissions
720806 will not only harm the us economy but will fail to provide an effective response to the global challenge of climate change as the president observed in april decisions with such far reaching impact should not be left to unelected regulators and judges
720807 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
720808 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront the issue as president next year
720809 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
720810 the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
720811 this is an investment that will pay itself back many times over
720812 its an expensive investment but not compared to the rising cost of continuing to invest in fossil fuels
720813 for decades al gore has challenged the skeptics in washington on climate change and awakened the conscience of a nation to the urgency of this threat i strongly agree with vice president gore that we cannot drill our way to energy independence but must fast track investments in renewable sources of energy like solar power wind power and advanced biofuels and those are the investments i will make as president its a strategy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and cannot be outsourced and one that will leave our children a world that is cleaner and safer
720814 i urge your colleagues to take even bolder steps toward solving the climate crisis
720815 we have an historic opportunity to shift to a clean energy economy and in the process create new sustainable jobs to support the development and deployment of these new technologies
720816 im afraid right now that we are more concerned about the business climate than the earths climate
720817 until we realize they are not mutually exclusive we wont be able to address these issues
720818 but it should be clear to anyone who has been watching the session that weve already
720819 under governor patrick massachusetts joined the regional greenhouse gas initiative and became the first state in the nation to require greenhouse gas analysis and mitigation in major real estate projects
720820 comprehensive energy legislation the oceans management bill and pending biofuels legislation all put massachusetts into a leadership position nationally we support the creation of an economy wide cap as the next step in reducing greenhouse gas emissions but many details remain to be worked out with the legislature
720821 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
720822 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment
720823 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations
720824 our country needs a new energy policy that reinvests in america and it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy
720825 if hed been president we wouldnt have hadthese bush administration messes the past eight years
720826 hes charismatic hes a strong orator he has a presencethat draws you in
720827 al gore is one of the few public figureschallenging my generation to do anything hes inspirational
720828 i dont think im very good at some of the things that themodern political system rewards and requires and ive foundother ways to make a difference and to serve the publicinterests
720829 hebecame a star by rising above politics with his passion for theenvironment hes now international leader on an issue more andmore people care about there has been no more successfuldefeated presidential candidate
720830 if the vice president says its do able i believe
720831 its a strategy that willcreate millions of new jobs and one that will leave ourchildren a world that is cleaner and safer
720832 it cannot be the basis of a soundenergy policy by any responsible official in america it seemsto me maybe i am wrong but i dont think so
720833 you win some you lose some and then theres that little known third category
720834 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
720835 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
720836 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
720837 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
720838 we want to jump on this bandwagon we have to
720839 bridging the worlds of environmentalism finance technology and politics together mr gore is ideally suited to speak to this audience of innovators striving to integrate green building practices and leading edge technology into the 21st century in a way that is both smart and sustainable
720840 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
720841 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
720842 i have never seen an opportunity for the country like the one thats emerging now
720843 at the least the have a lot of hatred of anybody who is enjoying life
720844 produce every kilowatt of electricity through wind sun and other earth friendly energy sources within 10 years this goal is achievable affordable and transformative
720845 in 1970 the u s imported 24 percent of its oil by 1990 it was 42 percent and today its almost 70 percent we import 70 percent of our oil at a cost of us 700 billion a year four times the annual cost of the iraq war ive been an oil man all my life but this is one emergency we cant drill our way out of but if we create a new renewable energy network we can break our addiction to foreign oil
720846 when president john f kennedy challenged our nation to land a man on the moon and bring him back safely in 10 years many people doubted we could accomplish that goal
720847 but eight years and two months later neil armstrong and buzz aldrin walked on the surface of the moon
720848 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now
720849 living like ed a guide to the eco friendly life
720850 nearly identical to rep mark kirks congressional pension forfeiture act h r 6172 from last congress never considered
720851 this was the moment this was the time when we came together to remake this great nation so that it may always reflect our very best selves and our highest ideals
720852 when you connect the dots it turns out that the real solutions to the climate crisis are the very same measures needed to renew our economy and escape the trap of ever rising energy prices
720853 because the sun doesnt shine and the wind doesnt blow all the time
720854 the country is not going to be able to go cold turkey
720855 we have a hundred years of infrastructure with trillions of dollars of investment that is not simply going to be made obsolete
720856 hey i want to add a photo of my as a buddy icon in empathy
720857 a christian in the present life is a mere shadow of his or her
720858 belief in the bodily resurrection includes the belief that what is done in the present in the body by the power of the spirit will be reaffirmed in the eventual future in ways at which we can presently only guess
720859 spirit who brooded over the waters of chaos the spirit who indwelt jesus so richly that it became known as the spirit of jesus

720871 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done

720877 during the campaign i strongly advocated for the democratic party to seat the florida and michigan delegation with their full votes the democratic party has always stood up for the principle of counting every persons vote today senator obama has requested that the credentials committee give florida and michigan delegates their full votes this is the right position for the democratic party and for the country and i urge the credentials committee to restore full votes to florida and michigan delegates
720878 many great intelligent talented academy winning actors standing by awaiting a major press conference to show their support
720879 the ad is a bit ironic given that mccain has been the most pop culture savvy republican candidate in quite some time
720880 barack obama may be the one but is he ready to lead
720881 johns been a celebrity ever since he was shot down
720882 obama has almost transcended that and has become famous as a famous person which is why they are comparing him to paris hilton
720883 you can definitely makes the case that mccain stands out among republicans for his associations with hollywood and his celebrity status
720884 the fact that he was in wedding crashers it underscores the fact that he does have a lot of friends in the entertainment industry that bush cant claim
720885 john mccain is a widely respected and admired political leader in our country and the world
720886 who else could get 200 000 people in berlin those arent voters those are fans

720908 this demonstrates the deep contrast of the two belief systems
720909 it is this latter culture thats being percecuted by the former
720910 even athletes competing in the 2008 olympics have been forced by beijing to sign agreements not to criticize the government of china while there
720911 your government fired upon unarmed students at tienanmen square killing hundreds
720912 you have no basis for an opinion as you have none that a communist liar didnt give you
720913 your country is directly responsible for the murder of over 1 million tibetans
720914 please explain why you want tibet to be independent when as a land locked country surrounded by china and chinese allies one that no other country would do business with as they are all bound under the one china policy to see tibet as part of china it would be unable to sustain itself why do you want to hurt the tibetan people so much
720915 because the kind of business china does with tibet right now is faaaar worse than no business at all
720916 because the business china does are for the benefit of the chinese settlers and the detriment of the tibetan natives
720917 because the business china does is to pillage the tibetan resources
720918 there are no bases at all for the figures used regularly by the exile groups they use the figure of 1 2 million tibetans dying from the 1950s to the 1970s but no source for this is given as a lawyer i give no credence to statistics for which there is no data no visible basis
720919 tibet had a feudal land tenure system which structure resembled the one in europe during the middle age but was not as inhumane
720920 it displayed a strong mongolian influence was derived from the yasa statute book of genghis khan and like the penal system of the european middle ages was extremely cruel bizarre mutilations like blindings the cutting off of limbs or tearing out of tongues deliberately allowing people to freeze to death the pillory shackling yoking lifelong imprisonment in damp pits all count as common punishments up until the 20th century
720921 in fact no chinese suffered from the famine they created
720922 over 1 2 million tibetans have been up until today victims of the final solution started by the communist china
720923 treated little better than slaves the serfs went without schooling or medical care they were under a lifetime bond to work the lords land or the monasterys land without pay to repair the lords houses transport his crops and collect his firewood they could not get married without the consent of their lord or lama they were bound to their masters guaranteeing a fixed and permanent workforce that could neither organize one 22 year old woman herself a runaway serf reports pretty serf girls were usually taken by the owner as house servants and used as he wished they were just slaves without rights one 24 year old testified that under serfdom he was subjected to incessant toil hunger and cold after his third failed escape he was merciless beaten by the landlords men until blood poured from his nose and mouth they then poured alcohol and caustic soda on his wounds to increase the pain he claimed
720924 the traditional tibetan was not paid and provided services in exchange for his food but as a result of the chinese policies they began to be paid and food was supplied in rations
720925 the desire of the chinese to get rid of the tibetan people
720926 43 of the areas cultivated land had been confiscated and redistributed with 60 of the rural population benefitting many poor peasants now became middle peasants the importance of this measure in terms of consolidating the support of the peasantry behind the regime cannot be underestimated
720927 exact numbers such as the death roll or the year famine happened are hard to find
720928 humanitarian organizations and the tibetan government in exile do provide estimations

720970 i am delighted that the efforts of the chinese authorities to push forward this law have borne fruit
720971 it is expected that these rules will provide more clarity and predictability for companies operating in the chinese market
720972 we should maintain the principle of fair trade and oppose a monopoly market which would have a negative impact on consumers
720973 we already have three companies monopolizing the market if they become two companies and a more monopolistic market it would be easier for them to control the market and prices and that would have a more negative impact on consumers

721144 after belabouring a great many people for a great many years for being unprogressive mr shaw has discovered with characteristic sense that it is very doubtful whether any existing human being with two legs can be progressive at all having come to doubt whether humanity can be combined with progress most people easily pleased would have elected to abandon progress and remain with humanity mr shaw not being easily pleased decides to throw over humanity with all its limitations and go in for progress for its own sake if man as we know him is incapable of the philosophy of progress mr shaw asks not for a new kind of philosophy but for a new kind of man it is rather as if a nurse had tried a rather bitter food for some years on a baby and on discovering that it was not suitable should not throw away the food and ask for a new food but throw the baby out of window and ask for a new baby
721145 could you elaborate your latter sentence pls i mean could you explain in details as to how greece treated gcs just out of curiosity
721146 this is how cypriots were treated color red luckily gcs fought back during the coup makarios survived and returned to the island and gcs managed to rebound economically even with one third of their number as refugees and with severe loss of resources
721147 are you suggesting that without the intervention the gcs would have defeated the coupists
721148 we know other benefits of physical activity can reduce your body fat percentages and improve your ability to metabolize glucose in your bloodstream possibly if you were a diabetic but other than that there hasnt been a lot of research looking into how physical activity might change your brain function or your mental health
721149 growing evidence that exercise could put a dent in depression even a small dent would save millions in money and misery
721150 this was somewhat of a surprise to the field of neuroscience so for many years people thought the brain was created in utero and we never could get more brain cells after you were born you just had the number you were born with
721151 i expect important progress to be achieved by the end of this year and a solution by the beginning of 2009
721152 however we at this stage have agreed on our positions details will be discussed during the negotiations process
721153 some say the decision can be perceived as the allusive recognition of the trnc by fifa and the union of european football associations uefa
721154 with a view to improving relations between the football communities on the island of cyprus
721155 this is an interim measure prior to a solution to the cyprus problem
721156 to play in formal competitions you have to be a member of fifa the only way would be to join the greek cypriot league but we are not willing to do this therefore we would only be able to play friendly matches under this proposal
721157 a great number of problems are being experienced in education health the economy and other aspects of social life all as a result of the ongoing non solution of the cyprus problem
721158 most scientists are bored by what they have already discovered it is ignorance that drives them on

721170 thai troops said they will pull back only when the issue near preah vihear temple is resolved
721171 on the morning of friday june 8 110 buses pulled up at the border site of nong chan a few miles north of aranyaprathet where several thousand refugees were now camped in fields thai soldiers in the buses told the refugees they were being moved to another better camp some refugees seemed to believe what they were told and were happy enough to leave the squalid overcrowded conditions of nong chan others were not one woman who had walked out of cambodia to nong chan with her three children only a week before said later that she was terrified when the thai soldiers began to herd them into buses
721172 each person murmuring angrily or fighting back tears tried to come to grips with catastrophe in his own way shocked disbelief showed on every face we had just come from hell and were being sentenced to return we couldnt believe our awful fate defeated many wished only for a quick death
721173 cruel as it was we could understand the lie but it was doubly cruel to push us back across in the north when arrangements had been made for returning us to the south it seemed little short of cold blooded premeditated murder the remote jungle had been chosen deliberately the thais wanted an international incident and we were to be it
721174 loaded with cambodian refugees from temporary camp sites all over eastern thailand hundreds of buses converged on a mountainous region of the northeastern border near the temple of preah vihear whose ownership had long been a source of bitter dispute between thailand and cambodia
721175 the path down the mountains became steeper the jungle thicker dozens scores of people fell onto mines those with possessions had to abandon them to carry their children down
721176 below the ridge we could hear people screaming and moaning those who had been forced over the border during the past two days stubbornly refused to move off the mountainside trails yet the press of refugees from above kept pushing them farther down the entire face of the hill had been heavily mined by the khmer rouge four years ago and everyone was terrified to break a new trail in the five mile wide occasionally a mine exploded as the crowd pushed someone off the trail since everyone wanted to step only where they had seen others step they slid cautiously downward only when forced from above by the pressure of others moving downhill descent proceeded at a snails pace
721177 one group of refugees desperately pooled whatever valuable they had left filled two buckets with them and walked back up toward the thai soldiers carrying a white flag the soldiers took the buckets and then opened fire on the refugees
721178 the chinese gentleman and his party had pooled their thai money in a red plastic bucket quietly he offered it to the soldier then asked to be pointed in a direction leading to freedom the soldier accepted the bucket and motioned with his gun down a side path as he looked the other way no sooner had the group started down this path however than the guard turned and raised the muzzle of his submachine gun they fell like dominoes
721179 i thought the nightmare i had lived through for years and the trauma of our escape had exposed me to all the suffering and horrors this world had to offer i was wrong nothing had prepared us for this first night on the trail descent from the cliff was like being lowered into the jaws of hell

721284 while the earliest reference to amarnath can be seen in the nilamata purana v 1324 a 6th century sanskrit text which depicts the religious and cultural life of early kashmiris and gives kashmirs own creation myth the pilgrimage to the holy cave has been described with full topographical details in the bhringish samhita and the amarnatha mahatmya both ancient texts said to have been composed even earlier
721285 the lake of dazzling whiteness resembling a sea of milk sheshnag which he created for himself as residence on a far off mountain is to the present day seen by the people on the pilgrimage to amareshwara

721288 received intelligence that my nawab felt very impatient and uneasy on account of my long absence
721289 the grotto full of wonderful congelations is the amarnath cave where blocks of ice stalagmites formed by dripping water from the roof are worshipped by many hindus who resort here as images of shiva
721290 the ceremony at the cave of amarnath takes place on the 15th of the hindoo month of sawan

721294 no matter how sophisticated you make these automated systems youre not going to make them perfect and all you can really strive for is to tune them as you go along
721295 its pretty clear there was a lapse in terms of the quality control of
721296 leverages a combination of algorithmic and editorial processes to identify current relevant and popular terms
721297 we are really only in the infancy of this kind of automated analysis
721298 im sure its going to be expanding greatly not just in volume but in sophistication
721299 the quality of the content and the information is paramount
721300 you want to make sure youre striking the right balance between giving your readers everything the web has to offer with making sure theyre getting the right information and the relevant information
721301 to educate a person in mind and not morals is to educate a menace to society
721302 we require that different media have the fullest access possible to report on the and im adamant in saying there has been no deal whatsoever to accept restrictions our requirements are the same from host city to host city and remain unchanged since the ioc entered into a host city contract with beijing in 2001
721303 im not going to make an apology for something that the ioc is not responsible for
721304 we are not running the internet in china the chinese authorities are running the internet
721305 foreign media will be able to report freely and publish their work freely in china there will be no censorship on the internet
721306 again i think we are trying to hang on every single word often spoken by people whose mother tongue isnt english let me be clear again the ioc would like to see open access for the media to be able to do their job
721307 we will give the media complete freedom to report when they come to china
721308 i guess there will be some debate as we move toward the games if there are sites that may or may not be open
721309 and the line between what could be considered as a national interest issue might be a bit blurred but well work on it and we will deal with any potential grievances

721318 batting first would have been ideal though i dont think toss alone was crucial though it was not easy to chase down 307 i thought we could have achieved it its always important to get a good start when you chase which is something we did not get that is probably where we lost the game
721319 we felt that in these kind of conditions usually slow medium guys are effective
721320 terrorists are carrying out a proxy war against india they are aided and abetted from across the border we expected that manmohan singh would question the pakistans prime minister on this issue but he has disappointed
721321 there is need for tough anti terror laws at a time when the entire country was facing the serious problem of terrorism several state governments favoured such laws even andhra pradesh chief minister y s rajasekhara reddy had said states alone cannot face the scourge
721322 the joint venture company which was registered on july 31 has a total capital outlay of rs 380 crore
721323 we need to negotiate a separation in the communion sooner rather than later to leave the strongest possibility of remaining in some kind of fellowship
721324 a major question is how we move towards that point the highest degree of fellowship whilst allowing for an orderly separation he stressed
721325 market is likely to be volatile with a positive bias the volatility in the us market and the softening crude oil prices will impact the sentiments in the domestic market as well
721326 market is likely to remain sideways as there is no major trigger this week and investors will take stock of the situation with the quarterly results season ending last week
721327 you give us a formal proposal we will look into it
721328 these facts will conclusively establish beyond reasonable doubt the veracity of what we had complained
721329 in the absence of the channel having performed its public duty we along with our colleagues have continued to pursue this matter and have several facts to place before you and the inquiry committee
721330 these are direct evidences which can be corroborated by the statements of the mps and members of the cnn ibn team the independent channel which conducted the cash for vote sting operation
721331 the transcript of the video where sanjeev saxena an alleged aide of amar singh and another person reach the ferozshah road residence of one of the mps and gives the money has been given to the head of the parliamentary committee
721332 we are planning to set up a new manufacturing facility in india entailing a capital expenditure of about rs 150 crore which would be made in the next fiscal besides we will be undertaking another rs 100 crore of capital expenditure this fiscal at our existing facilities
721333 there would however be no hike in price of our food products
721334 the violent policies of the pakistani army and intelligence agencies
721335 this agreement is an important first step in bringing india into the international nuclear safeguards regime
721336 we applaud prime minister harper and the government of canada for acting to end thirty four years of bureaucratic hostility towards india by voting at the iaea to accept india as a responsible nuclear power
721337 its just a beginning my targets are very high and i believe that i will achieve the targets set by me
721338 they would stop off during the rally to deliver supplies and badly needed aid that they have funded
721339 this initative is an attempt to increase literacy and decrease child labour
721340 the rally would make its way through south central and western india vellore bangalore hassan mangalore bhatkal panaji tarkali ratnagiri mahad and alibagh before it concludes in mumbai on august 14
721341 the way we have come back after four days it is really amazing and i am really proud of the fact that we have this group of players who have shown so much of resilience not just once but time and time again so there is quality so there is absolutely no doubt
721342 we have done that in the past and this team has been through ups and downs it team has fair amount of experience and quality so there is absolutely no doubt that we will regroup and come back hard and i am really proud the way we played in this test match
721343 we have now been here for five days and it has been fantastic
721344 we thought the best way to promote oman was by making it a destination for people
721345 the best way to do that was by tying up with film production houses in india and other parts of the world and bring them over here to shoot films here
721346 we are left with the prospect that what has been termed our best known analogue to earths modern glaciation is in fact poorly known
721347 this study is an example of the wealth of untapped climate information stored in earths deep time geologic record millions of years ago
721348 in chandni chowk i have a double role in om shanti om i played a double role i feel privileged to essay double roles so early in my career
721349 i never thought i would be an actress as my confidence grew i realised that taking up acting is the gradual growth process for a model
721350 like me she is independent and traditional she studies in sydney and works to fund her education i also started working at the age of 18 which made me more responsible
721351 the farmers are requested to strictly adhere to the spray schedule advertised through media to check paddy blast
721352 it takes an amount of around rs 10 000 to cultivate cotton on every acre of land here however the output doesnt yield commensurate profit
721353 surjeet is not among us but his principles will always remain with us we hope that we can continue to work for the development of the country along with those who believe in his thoughts
721354 i had a long association with surjeet with whom i shared a father son relationship
721355 a great leader and a great worker and the void left by his demise will never be filled
721356 it is not the same story i was in college when the novel was released and it created a tremendous impact on me
721357 it is also the story of a fanatical devotee who is forced to turn her back on god in the face of traumatic experiences
721358 it is possible that nano particles of precious metals are suitable candidates for catalysts in important reactions in the chemical industry
721359 seven uncharged gold atoms form a triangle with an additional vertex
721360 uncharged gold atoms probably prefer this structure as it is easier for the electrons to avoid each other
721361 the clusters are rather unstable you cant just buy them as a powder
721362 this means we have to repeat the experiment with around 200 different wavelengths of the infrared laser
721363 i dont need any extra motivation my motivation is to win
721364 im very proud of my area around the plate i dont want anyone messing with my dirt
721365 its a yankee world were just falling apart in it
721366 i think it is too little too late for the yankees to make the playoffs
721367 based on past performance by department of transport on luas red and green lines estimated at 400m actual cost 800m and integrated ticketing now at 50m and no delivery on street it is difficult for the business community to believe that a financial envelope of 4bn will not become 8bn to 9bn to complete construction
721368 there is growing concern that the metro north project as presently proposed is not serving the city
721369 deputy gilmore suggested that a decision had been made or rather he seemed to suggest that he had knowledge of a decision made to cancel metro north and i clarified that that was not a correct perception
721370 i think the discussions are moving ahead and i hope we have something resolved by monday i think weve gotten to the point where we kind of have to force it
721371 primarily it starts with the fact does brett want to play football
721372 the second is do the packers want him to play for the packers those are the two principal points that have to be resolved and only two parties can make that determination not me
721373 i was interjected into it because there was a tampering charge initially
721374 im not looking for things to interject myself to its an issue that needs to be addressed because of the competing interests you want to make sure its done properly and within our rules this is an issue that ultimately has to be decided between brett and the packers
721375 whats going on between brett and the organization is something that the players and coaches we cannot handle
721376 were not involved in it i think they did a good job from a responsibility standpoint dealing with it for about two days but the focus has been on improving
721377 nobody starts out wanting to play offensive line its just where we end up
721378 to make it here today with some of the best whoever played the game in the gallery i am more humbled and blessed than ive ever been in my life
721379 i stand before you today a proud and gracious man
721380 and while dressing down for the first practice i thought how strange it was i was no 75
721381 not getting what you want is sometimes a magical stroke of luck
721382 that if you screw up you would forever be known as the guy who lost the franchise
721383 the john elway of the offensive line and the second best player to play for me
721384 there better be a guy who really impresses me when camp rolls around because itll really really bother me then
721385 but the difference between practice and games is theres not a lot of pressure hes looking good so far but you really cant gauge until crunch time down by two with two seconds left those are kicks jason elam used to make
721386 i dont want him to do bad because jasons not here
721387 dont get me wrong i wish we could have kept jason but we didnt so lets move on
721388 i totally agree its until i do it in the game
721389 i think it was really big for me because of all the questions
721390 and i think the biggest kick for me was the last one in the two minute they said we were down by one with three seconds on the clock and if i hit it we win if i miss it we lose that was a huge kick
721391 i kind of liked the last one when we put all the pressure on him game winning field goal three seconds left but hes been doing that pretty consistently since hes been here so it doesnt really surprise anybody but its sure nice to see him do that in his first live two minute drill
721392 you just watch him kickoff hes kicked it 10 yards out of the end zone
721393 his length is probably 75 78 yards and he doesnt kick any harder he has the same swing consistently hopefully he can make the ones inside 45 and every once in a while depending on the situation the guy gets a chance to attempt one of those but usually thats at the end of the half or the end of the game
721394 theres no way to really learn something and get it through your head without actually doing it
721395 i guess from that point of view i was a little behind but i think im catching up now and coming along ok
721396 it didnt swell up or anything its just the fatigue factor

721413 i believe party unity calls for the delegates from florida and michigan to be able to participate fully alongside the delegates from the other states and territories
721414 i want the michigan delegation and the florida delegation to be seated and however the democratic national committee determines we can get that done im happy to abide by those rules
721415 as a candidate for the nomination i supported the dncs efforts to establish and enforce a schedule for primaries and caucuses that would broaden the opportunity for democrats from all regions of the country and all backgrounds and walks of life to have a meaningful voice
721416 as we prepare to come together in denver however we must be and will be united in our determination to change the course of our nation to that end democrats in florida and michigan must know that they are full partners and colleagues in our historic mission to reshape washington and lead our country in a new direction
721417 during the campaign i strongly advocated for the democratic party to seat the florida and michigan delegation with their full votes the democratic party has always stood up for the principle of counting every persons vote today sen obama has requested that the credentials committee give florida and michigan delegates their full votes this is the right position for the democratic party and for the country and i urge the credentials committee to restore full votes to florida and michigan delegates
721418 this matter will be the top priority for the credentials committee when we meet on august 24 as always our goal is to ensure a fair process and a unified democratic party so that we can win in november

721478 the devilsaur is an exotic pet that will ultimately require 51 bm to tame there are several other exotic pets that are not implemented yet the moth is not an exotic pet the size of the devilsaur is not a bug but i also cant promise its going to stay that way it would be awesome if it did but only if it doesnt cause a bunch of other problems like clipping through terrain and making it impossible to see mailboxes in dalaran
721479 it think its pretty evident that having pets that are too large might make the game less fun to play in some situations were just going to have to see how the beta goes but ideally it would be cool if devilsaurs could remain at their current size well try

721538 now when you move one over with ctrl tab then hit it again it takes you back to the last one you were on rather than continuing to move to the right this is bad
721539 because this is what you want most of the time
721540 o wesley n o est bem e todo o clube est assustado com a les o este um momento muito dif cil o atleta tem muita dor
721541 ainda precisamos fazer um ltimo exame mas n o parece que o resultado ser muito bom pode ser at problema nos ligamentos cruzados
721542 you cant feel the pleasure of the treasure without pressure
721543 hopefully we will be shooting next summer for release in 2010
721544 there was a fourth book written but it was not by mr ludlum so were probably going to take our own direction and were working on what that storylines gonna be right now
721545 i think hes headed down south i think hes headed to south america
721546 he is karthikeya the one who is worshipped by lord brahma
721547 i would never cut my hair that short i would miss it so much
721548 do you guys want some dessert or cake we have the best cheesecake
721549 dont look at me dont touch me dont speak to me right now
721550 well theyre excited because my youngest is filming a commercial
721551 i think its come to the point where there need to be some decisions made on behalf of the packers on behalf of brett on behalf of all the fans
721552 we hope the meeting supports cubas efforts to do justice to the five
721553 when she made it clear she didnt want to have anything to do with him he became enraged
721554 after they made a deal they were following her to another motel room when they were approached by three males from behind and forced into a room at gunpoint
721555 theyll be a lot more ready this year what we did last year was unbelievable it was a dream come true the only thing id like this year and its not much is just to finish one spot higher
721556 im sure that if id tried to do this in 1998 just after winning the championship it would have been a lot easier
721557 although theres a lot of respect for what ive achieved my oval experience is not huge and even though there was the indy 500 win in 1995 ultimately what people want to know is how youd do in a 36 race season how you do on the ovals and are you still hungry enough to do it
721558 a good showing would help with the sponsors but it wont have any effect on the teams because this is a road course
721559 we had a good race last year but you can tell the level of competition has stepped up
721560 im confident weve got a good crew here and a good car
721561 unfortunately most nascar races are like the last two minutes of overtime in hockey it gets out of control if theres a caution with 10 minutes to go cautions breed cautions theres going to be a lot of contact thats what caught us out last year we need to avoid that
721562 he is an amazing road course racer and hes been driving this thing since january
721563 so if he was strong last year he should be even stronger
721564 what the hell are they smoking does the term social network mean anything to them
721565 the top 5 green social networks by alexa traffic rank
721566 we use the term green in its broader sense to refer to marketing and networks oriented not only toward environmental sustainability but to corporate social responsibility and social causes as well
721567 basic tools or features serve as minimum requirements for being considered a social network
721568 ive never seen a community do what bay city has done in the past 10 years
721569 you have value on the ground more than you spent
721570 under the texas local government code the city has the right to approve the professionals it hires
721571 the attorney general ruled that a contractor is a professional
721572 on the design specific aspects of the application who our vendor is can make a lot of difference as to what technology we use for the design
721573 so when we didnt have the final vendor we werent able to answer the questions to either ours or the nrcs level that we wanted to answer those questions so we asked them to hold up on the review of the design specific parts of the application
721574 they did about 30 000 man hours of due diligence with toshiba to determine their abilities and as they did this due diligence they determined that not only are they capable of building the units to the standards that we expect but they are exceptionally able to build them to the highest standards
721575 toshiba has been lead contractor on two of the units built in japan and subcontractor on a third one
721576 because we live on the coast the red cross had us on standby so we didnt know when they were going to call us out
721577 just when we got back home decided it was too late for them to call us out is when we got the call that we were supposed to leave
721578 three days after the fact there is still terrible flooding many of the roads that we need to take to get to some shelters are still impassable and i heard that about 200 000 people down here are still without power or bathroom facilities
721579 there are lots of roofs blown off houses trees are blown over and downed power lines
721580 we just have to expect the unexpected and go where we are needed
721581 ive been on the phone trying to get more supplies sent down here to the shelter in santa rosa
721582 this is just for the culverts which is phase one of the southwest cut project and it will be paid for by the ciap grant
721583 there has never really been anything proven that this will be good for the bay
721584 east matagorda bay is a unique bay its a small bay system its not like galveston or any other of the larger bays
721585 my concern is the salinity that will come in through the colorado river into that east matagorda bay
721586 we have no idea what its going to do to the sea grasses the fish the shrimp and everything else
721587 im really concerned not just me but the whole community because weve been known to do things that effect systems in our environment negatively and a lot of times you cant backtrack and fix them
721588 this culvert as it stands right now will be monitored if it is detrimental to the bay it will be simple to close it in and reverse it
721589 this is not something that is irreversible in fact the last thing that i would want to do or anyone would want to do would be to do something that would be harmful for east matagorda bay
721590 this will help keep the mouth of the river open itll be good for drainage and i think it will be good for marine life
721591 judge i can tell you that there are a lot of people upset at the live oak landing subdivision because they were told that they would be able to build up to the creek and they cant
721592 ive had several calls and a contractor that came in and was supposed to have built a bunch of gazebos and decks and they cant do it because it is on the flood plain
721593 so i dont know how far they are going to take it but its a serious problem i mean its out of our control but its happening
721594 i just hate to see these people come in and get sold a bill of goods before anything has even been done to support it
721595 that is just deceptive trade practices and we just need to encourage people to be diligent before they buy something
721596 all we can do is really encourage people to use a realtor who is legally obligated to disclose the conditions of the property because i dont know how you regulate honesty
721597 in cold years the gas company earns money and in the warmer years you lose money
721598 the board has tried to keep gas prices to the bone as much as possible
721599 six or seven years ago we had the money to back the funding for the next year
721600 its easy to look at last years budget and see what should have been done the hard part is not the amendment process but the upcoming budget
721601 i get the excuse always that there is a broken truck
721602 we use 128 bit encryption on most of our web pages
721603 2 why has the national media not picked up on this and pushed mccain more to explain himself
721604 a great moment something ive been targeting for many years hopefully this is the first of many
721605 at the end i tried to put pressure on massa and hoped something would happen and it worked out that way
721606 there have been various incidents this season that have happened when ive been in a position to fight for a victory so im very glad to get this first win
721607 its nowhere near as bad as it could have been i could have had felipe and kimi right at the front
721608 it was a surprise that we werent as quick as we should have been we were quick at the beginning but struggled with our tyres
721609 i couldnt believe it when i saw felipes engine go and i was p2 so this is remarkable after the race in hockenheim and the big crash
721610 we could have managed to do the race a little better and i was stuck behind alonso all the way to the second stop
721611 we just need to sort out the problems and then we will be fighting for wins

721628 the consequences of continued congressional inaction on gas prices are unacceptable weve called on the speaker to call congress back into an emergency session this month and schedule a vote on the american energy act we must continue to make a stand until the speaker complies
721629 we realize not everyone can be in washington next week but if you can be we ask that you come to the capitol join our colleagues and lend your voice beginning this monday at 10 00 am
721630 if you cant be in washington we ask that you contribute to the cause in other ways such as spreading the word among your constituents writing an op ed for your local newspaper or taking our all of the above energy message to your local airwaves
721631 republicans stand with the american people we share their passion and determination for energy independence and weve pledged to fight boldly until congress heeds their will

721634 williams will be in toulon on monday or tuesday we have discussed things with his agents and we are going to try and complete the move boudjellal told news agency afp
721635 if everything goes well he will have his medical on tuesday and could make his debut in a friendly match on friday
721636 the fact he is prepared to forward what is supposedly a private and confidential text message reinforces that he has gone off the rails in my opinion
721637 i got a response but sonny wouldnt want that response printed and im not going to give it to you the fact that he is prepared to toss that up to a paper i think is a pretty ordinary thing to do
721638 on the back of what he has done it confirms there is something wrong with his head
721639 i was certainly aware of his interest in sonny and he was here doing the sly tana was upfront with me
721640 he said ive spoken to sonnys management group and he made sure to keep me in the loop of what was going on
721641 if sonny hadnt been in a position he was in im not too sure he would have made that move to toulon
721642 had a few other areas in his life been more settled we probably wouldnt be talking today about it
721643 i could sense his frustration with a few things when we talked
721644 as a friend those issues are between him and i and thats how they should stay
721645 im not saying what he did was the right thing to do but he is a young guy and we have to look at exactly why he made this decision
721646 no i looked when i woke up and my tooth was still there
721647 we dont need a summer of introspection the starting point is not debating personalities but winning the argument about our record our vision for the future and how we achieve it
721648 the history of the past 11 years is pretty clear on virtually every big argument that divided britain in 1997 labour has been proved right and the tories wrong
721649 the next election will be fought in a world where british families cant buy or sell a home because us bankers lent money to impoverished americans
721650 was to be bud flanagans last legacy to the public who had loved him for so long
721651 our surveys show that most women are child centered even when they dont have or want children of their own nearly every single woman we know is a devoted aunt big sister godmother or friend to the children of her relatives co workers and friends
721652 these professional aunts are loved by their lucky nieces and nephews yet often overlooked by marketers many brands are so focused on moms that they are missing the economic clout of these generous aunts who love to indulge the kids they never had with the gifts and experiences that they can afford savvy auntie is the first site weve seen thats recognizing this powerful segment
721653 when i decided to pose for nn i told harry my bloke that i was going to do it outside where i might be seen
721654 joseph ratzinger is both more theologically sophisticated than his predecessor and a good deal less religiously adventurous john paul ii was a stout defender of tradition yet he was untroubled by post conciliar liturgical discontinuities which so disturb his successor and he thought nothing of drastically recasting two of the most precious devotional treasures of the catholic church he blithely added an entirely new set of mysteries or themes to the rosary and he dared to revise the number and subjects even of the stations of the cross representations of which adorn the walls of every catholic church in the world eliminating much loved by apocryphal characters like veronica the woman who allegedly wiped jesus face with a towel a theme which has inspired transcendentally great religious art and giving more prominence to mary the mother of jesus wojtylas piety was plebeian saturated in the preoccupations and attitudes of polish catholicism it had a strong apocalyptic streak benedict xvi is also deeply indebed to the traditional piety of his native bavaria to the baroque churches the music and devotional practice of his youth but his traditionalism is altogether more considered bookish and conceptual than wojtylas and we neither expect nor fear from him dramatic liturgical innovation nevertheless pope benedict does believe that what he sees as the hectic activism of much post conciliar liturgy is destructive of true worship
721655 probably part of that is that i dont see any particular superiority to obama mccain advisers agree on worsening economy not solution bloomberg crockefeller captured manhunt ends in bust of dad daughter new york daily news in the last year ive read

721678 im absolutely terribly impressed with her quick thinking the way she handled herself is just amazing
721679 the only thing she wanted to do as he left is to remember his registration she kept saying it over and over and over again to herself until the neighbour arrived and she said quick write it down
721680 i think shes amazing she is so strong if i put myself in that position i dont think i could have done what she did
721681 but in light of this i suppose well have to give it some consideration
721682 for 10 years prior to coming here i had felt no joy no hope nor anticipation for the future
721683 today all of those blessings have come back to me
721684 i was fascinated and wondered what he would do next

721691 a fellowship within the one holy catholic and apostolic church of those duly constituted dioceses provinces and regional churches in communion with the see of canterbury upholding and propagating the historic faith and order as set forth in the book of common prayer
721692 we also stand in solidarity with all the faithful bishops clergy and laity in the united states and canada and elsewhere who are suffering recrimination and hostility perpetrated upon them by their dioceses and or national churches which have not unequivocally complied with the specific windsor proposals required of them in full
721693 we gather at a critical time when the anglican communion as a communion of ordered churches is at the probable brink of collapse we urge the official endorsement of the proposed anglican covenant by acc 14 in may 2009
721694 we further urge this lambeth conference to give clear endorsement and immediate implementation of the interim proposals of the windsor continuation group on the swift formation of the pastoral forum with the terms of reference as set out in particular
721695 on the complete cessation of a the celebration of blessings for same sex unions b consecrations of those living in openly gay relationships and c all cross border interventions and inter provincial claims of jurisdiction
721696 we look forward to the 4th south to south encounter on a broadened representation sometime in 2009 we are encouraged that the emphases will be on the pastoral and missional needs for focused leadership and development the deepening of collegial foundation and framework for the transformation and renewal of the anglican communion
721697 we are committed to work together with one another in the global south and with all orthodox groups in the united states of america and canada to listen together to what lord jesus says to his church today to draw strength and insights from one another and to take fresh initiatives in upholding and passing on the faith once delivered to the saints
721698 if you strip away the smoke and mirrors this is a simple argument about whether online auction sites should be pro active in policing the property being sold on their sites and this issue is not going to go away no system is ever going to be perfect at identifying all questionable items but you have to start somewhere checkmend is the most comprehensive system of its type recommended by ebay in the uk when buying a mobile phone

721727 no matter how sophisticated you make these automated systems youre not going to make them perfect and all you can really strive for is to tune them as you go along
721728 its pretty clear there was a lapse in terms of the quality control of yahoos keyword list

721736 we are genuinely interested in learning about how truck drivers are using technology to prosper during these difficult times
721737 we thought giving the winner a brand new laptop equipped with gaming capabilities and a built in web cam would make the contest particularly appealing

721739 truckers are essential to our nations economic health and to our individual comfort without them our society simply cannot function
721740 so i know how hard they work and i understand they are using computers to stay competitive and to stay in touch with family members

721757 chris koster was rarely in the office rather he spent his time at his private and fully staffed home in the caymen islands leaving his office to be run by the assistant prosecutors
721758 and when he was in the office he spent his time reading several newspapers and discussing his political career he was contemplating the missouri attorney generals office within months of winning the cass county prosecutors race
721759 i merely commented on his absences and his concerns with respect to the high profile cases as examples of his lack of interest in the job itself

721767 i think we had a great summer and everybody seems to be coming in early so they must be ready to play ball
721768 after all the hard work its nice to see it pay off as a starter but ive got a couple of good guys behind me pushing me ive been here when we had seven eight healthy offensive linemen but its nice to have depth
721769 i feel good i feel great i just want to see how i feel against the big fellows offensive linemen i am looking forward to the test
721770 it doesnt seem like it could be 25 years since it was me checking in here but im just glad to be here and that my son has an opportunity to come here and compete
721771 we had an 800 pound gorilla on our backs now we have to right the ship again have had some adversity but coach snyder and his staff are on the right track bringing in some great kids character type kids into the program and thats what it takes to win
721772 its really convenient to have my parents just 20 minutes down the road not really thrown out of the nest its kind of a cushion there its real cool to come here where my dad played its sentimental just a little bit but its gonna be fun
721773 its really cool to think about in state guys like matt altobello and coming in here and now they are starting they are among the best
721774 cabell midland is going to be pretty good this year they have a good tackle named
721775 thats disappointing to me but what are you going to do
721776 i know the marshall coaches will continue to recruit him because there are some good things happening here and cole could come in here and be an impact player next year
721777 thats the specialty we have got having so much talent back there it pushes us to be better and to push the next guy to be better so when its game time and someone goes down we have someone to step up in there
721778 its like life you dont get too many chances so you have to make the most of it when you get on the field and make the best decision when you get that pitch in your hands
721779 we had a good spring and we are looking to pick it up from there
721780 oh yeah you know albert is the guy and he will get that attention no matter what the circumstances the knee injury and recovery so that takes attention away from everyone else back there
721781 weve grown and really bonded as a team a lot of players have stepped up this summer this program is maturing and growing and if we can keep this thing going we will be right this year
721782 when adversity comes we have to step up to the challenge
721783 they teammates hassle us a little bit about not hitting each other but we have to work on getting those nerves down we have to be accurate top knotch
721784 it was rough there were times i didnt want to play football no more but then i would get my head together and stuck it out he was my roommate and is like a brother now
721785 it was kinda hard its like everything you ever worked for in your life is taken away dont take the game for granted anymore i like the defense and we have a chance to be something real special they havent seen in a long time brandon is like my big brother the friendship is amazing
721786 getting to read their bodies on the break we had a good lifting and running system this summer so we are ready to go its a fun time and exciting with the changes that have been made the running game is going to be important establish the running game and the passing game will come you just take it a day at a time
721787 we had a lot of guys here this summer wanting to work out we have to go all the way this year and i believe we have the guys to do that i believe i am in a lot better shape im cleared full go ready to go
721788 we had real huge guys like me 6 foot 9 but they were huge like wes jones we have slimmed those linemen down now and we have many of them weve got to bear down and come to play every day i will play where every they need me

721813 he said that christmas was a humbug as i live
721814 thats the truth and not so pleasant as he might be however his offences carry their own punishment and i have nothing to say against him
721815 his wealth is of no use to him he dont do any good with it he dont make himself comfortable with it he hasnt the satisfaction of thinking ha ha ha that he is ever going to benefit us with it
721816 i am sorry for him i couldnt be angry with him if i tried who suffers by his ill whims himself always here he takes it into his head to dislike us and he wont come and dine with us whats the consequence he dont lose much of a dinner
721817 because i havent great faith in these young housekeepers what do you say topper
721818 he never finishes what he begins to say he is such a ridiculous fellow
721819 that the consequence of his taking a dislike to us and not making merry with us is as i think that he loses some pleasant moments which could do him no harm i am sure he loses pleasanter companions than he can find in his own thoughts either in his mouldy old office or his dusty chambers i mean to give him the same chance every year whether he likes it or not for i pity him he may rail at christmas till he dies but he cant help thinking better of it i defy him if he finds me going there in good temper year after year and saying uncle scrooge how are you if it only puts him in the vein to leave his poor clerk fifty pounds thats something and i think i shook him yesterday

721825 in these conditions when hes bowling at 140 i didnt see the speeds but the way the keeper was collecting the ball you could sense that he was in good rhythm and thats a good sign
721826 the way ishant and zaheer bowled today was amazing on this pitch to crank it up like that from a 19 year old was something special
721827 thats something for us to discuss we felt that in these conditions the medium pacers are effective as well ishant is an exceptional bowler with his height and everything
721828 he creates a bit of bounce on this kind of wicket thats something that india has we need to make a smart choice
721829 this team has been through ups and downs and it has a fair amount of experience and quality there was no doubt that we would regroup and come back hard
721830 i was confident we would come back one look at the dressing room shows you how much potential this team has im really proud of the way we played in this test
721831 hes a very good player and the way he scored runs in both innings was great also gautams contributions and the partnerships getting 201 in a total of 329 is something amazing taking that forward into the second innings is never easy but he batted brilliantly and gave us another strong start
721832 everybody has got starts sachin was batting brilliantly in the second innings and rahul also sourav spent some time at the ssc but didnt get the opportunity here otherwise laxman has been in the runs so its not really a worry
721833 it definitely requires a discussion there are some areas which really help the umpires but there are some where it takes a long time and there is doubt about whether someone looking at a tv can take a call
721834 its 1 1 and we need to assess the conditions at the p sararavanamuttu stadium
721835 were really confident of putting up a good show and if we repeat this performance we will get a good result
721836 we should have got more runs jayawardene in a complete role reversal it was mahela jaywardene who had to look for ways and means to explain away failures

721840 the odd ball is spinning but if you bowl in the right areas and set the field accordingly you can create chances

721842 i also tried to mix my pace and that worked
721843 and if you vote for obama you will lose your job
721844 what i said was that a company has the right to inform the workers of the stark reality of the effect the election may have on their business i wasnt endorsing voter intimidation a company doesnt have any obligation to maintain a particular number of employees or production output if a company feels that the political climate is going to add weight or cost to doing business a company is free to cut staff or production if that is not the case then who is going to force a company to maintain said levels of production and staff or stay in business at all for that matter

721855 in the mid to late 90s there were a lot of music fans out there like myself that picked up on the internet long before the music industry ever took it seriously now many of the labels out there are still trying to catch up and with cd sales on the decline and digital sales on the rise the industry knows that it has to stay on top of any new technology or trend if it wants to survive

721868 russia did a good job of slowing us down a little bit but we still made our run at the end of the third quarter
721869 if you take a look in past games the american team most points they score is fast breaks and its dunks i think for the most part we contained the ball
721870 for the most part i think we did a pretty good job to stop them
721871 russia is a team we could see in the gold medal game and a team thats been playing very well of late so it was good competition they made us run some sets slow us down a little bit but i think overall we played good defense

722081 to that end democrats in florida and michigan must know that they are full partners and colleagues in our historic mission to reshape washington and lead our country in a new direction
722082 accordingly i ask that the credentials committee pass a resolution that would entitle each delegate from florida and michigan to cast a full vote
722083 we deeply appreciate and value senator obamas perspective on this important issue
722084 this matter will be the top priority for the credentials committee when we meet on august 24th as always our goal is to ensure a fair process and a unified democratic party so that we can win in november

722106 they were cleaning the street when this huge explosion rocked the entire neighbourhood i counted 15 bodies most of them are women who were torn to pieces
722107 there is blood everywhere dead and wounded people strewn across the street
722108 this is a tragedy i have never seen such carnage from what i can see they are all women who were cleaning the area
722109 we received 47 civilians who were injured in the blast and so far five have died in the hospital three of them women
722110 its the largest number of civilians we have received from one incident in weeks
722111 my sister leaves three orphans behind she had been doing this kind of work for three months but now she has lost everything she has lost her life
722112 specifically on the 8th the weather in beijing will be cloudy and overcast and we will see some rain showers and thunder showers
722113 good weather has a great deal to do with the natural conditions but whether this can be maintained has a lot to do with our pollution control measures because they also have a lot to do with the improvement
722114 we will not only host a quality and unique games but build a more scenic greener and more civilised city in a sustainable manner
722115 the conditions you were working in on tuesday were not good
722116 i am not going to make an apology for something that the ioc is not responsible for we are not running the internet in china
722117 i am sure that come the 9th of august the day after the opening ceremony the magic of the games and the flawless organisation will take over

722122 those who are accused of breaking the law will be investigated and if found to be guilty they will be brought to justice those who are proved innocent will be released
722123 confirms these people are breaking the law because they prefer to surrender themselves to the israeli occupation than to stay in their homes
722124 yesterday evening abu mazen abbas and palestinian prime minister salam fayyad made a request for israel to allow them to cross into israel and then to hospitals and the west bank
722125 shortly afterwards israeli defence minister ehud barak was contacted again by abbas who asked him to allow all of them to return to gaza
722126 dialogue is important we have called for it egypt has agreed to invite palestinian factions to meet in cairo
722127 we cant lose hope we disagree and fight but we have to work together to bridge the big gap created unfortunately by hamas
722128 in every generation there is a chosen one one girl in all the world one born with the strength and skill to hunt the vampires
722129 allora un giorno di questi ti scioglierai tutta perch quando parlo con te sono sempre felice rido scherzo sei speciale anci troppo speciale
722130 we are serious in talks and we want the talks to be based on the law so it will bear practical results we hope that other sides are serious too
722131 if its in 16 days instead of 14 its not a problem we are not obsessed with a date
722132 when we were in france we told them about the syrian position on irans nuclear issue but they asked us if we have details of the iranian programme
722133 in this trip we got details so in future if we are asked again we know irans position
722134 it is clear that iran doesnt pay attention to talks and this is a clear message to the international community to continue with real and effective sanctions
722135 we need to understand that we need to act today in terms of sanctions sanctions can be effective as long as the iranians and the entire world understand that all the options are on the table
722136 preparati al crepuscolo della tua vita appena iniziata preparati a rinunciare a tutto
722137 new and interesting species are still being discovered on caribbean islands despite the very small amount of natural forests remaining
722138 you sound a bit like a neo nazi or a white supremacist how is that working out for you it must be nice going through life full of such ignorance and hate
722139 im really grateful that acting is the job that was chosen for me
722140 i get really lost when im not working i dont know what im supposed to do with myself thank god for dance class and the new york times crossword puzzle and american idol but acting is what i really have to do
722141 the united states word should not be so carelessly broken nor its standing in the international community so needlessly compromised
722142 there is no dispute that if texas executes mr medellin in these circumstances texas would cause the united states irreparably to breach treaty commitments made on behalf of the united states as a whole and thereby compromise u s interests that both this court and the president have described as compelling
722143 im where im at because i made an adolescent choice
722144 this is not about vengeance this is not about a deterrent or about closure its about the punishment
722145 everybody wants me to say closure or vengeance im never going to have closure its just a miracle word thats going to make us feel good but it aint going to happen
722146 the law is clear texas is bound not by the world court but by the u s supreme court which reviewed this matter and determined that this convicted murderers execution shall proceed
722147 we pushed it more this time but there are no bedroom scenes we didnt want to push it that far
722148 maybe in the next one they do love each other so maybe
722149 it was early in the relationship and we were on a weekend getaway in vancouver
722150 we were just all over each other the sauna wasnt going to stop me
722151 i dont know what makes our marriage work im not an expert we just love each other
722152 at the end of the day we sit and have a drink together we talk she has a cigarette i try to get her in the sauna again
722153 i hate wearing the metal because i bang it everywhere and hurt myself
722154 we made a compromise and i said if i get a tattoo can i take the ring off
722155 she liked it and went out and got one for herself
722156 its a phrase we say to one another but i dont actually tell anybody its aysf it stands for something
722157 i didnt understand what she said she has an english accent now
722158 no it was a highlight for me to work with her again the first scene was just great we immediately felt that there was still a connection
722159 i did the first couple of weeks without her when gillian showed up and i started doing scenes with scully thats when i really started to feel we were doing the x files
722160 its just luck you know its like meeting somebody you like in life
722161 you know sometimes as actors you work well together and sometimes you dont and we were lucky from the beginning
722162 ive only seen her a few times since the show ended with her being in london but we stay in touch we email
722163 coming back had always been my desire i thought it would be natural to take this to cinema and turn it into a movie franchise
722164 i would have done it sooner maybe two years after the tv show ended
722165 i think it would have been depressing if i had to try to play him the same way i did 15 years ago when i started
722166 thank goodness we werent trying to do that we were acknowledging that 15 years had passed since then
722167 older mulder was the term that was used on set but i wanted him to look more matured psychically as well as physically
722168 i mean come on this guy lost every battle he is beaten down by life that leaves scars i wanted to make sure we bring that across in this film
722169 i do have suspicions that we are not alone out there it just makes more sense that there are more forms of life than just us that makes intuitive sense to me
722170 i dont have the quest that mulder does because i assume that it exists i dont feel the need to prove it or yell at people who disagree with me
722171 oh god none of us want to do the television show again
722172 none of us have it in us to go back and do that nor have the desire to do that but we like the idea of the films coming back every four or five years and trying it again
722173 you want a prime time audience with over a million viewers
722174 you mean the solar eclipse that the chinese could have predicted five thousand years ago
722175 spark has had one for a while now http twitter
722176 which individual is responsible for granting use of the cbc logo at facebook and twitter
722177 is there a prize for guessing correctly who is responsible for and in control of cbc twitter
722178 however i would characterize the biggest challenges from existing technologies incineration autoclaving for example and really educating potential users on the technology
722179 the educational curve while declining is still very large the more and more people become more comfortable with this new technology the more it will be seen throughout the country
722180 i am seeing that there are limited growth opportunities for this kind of waste to energy process
722181 we are not running out of landfill spaces or suitable places for landfills to be located
722182 but as landfill space diminishes those rates will climb and other technologies will become more viable including waste to energy
722183 there is a tremendous amount of regulation that goes into that and long lead times
722184 in other words from the time that you decide you need a landfill to the end of the regulatory process it can take a number of years
722185 i think companies are probably excited because this represents another source of energy for them and in this day and age diversity of energy supply is a good thing
722186 can smooth out those higher price fluctuations and could help to save costs down the road if the price of natural gas indeed continues to increase
722187 i dont know that were necessarily a fixed world of ever increasing natural gas prices but its certainly likely that the demand for gas is only going to grow
722188 komunitarian sebenarnya berusaha menentang liberalisme yang menjadikan prinsip hak kesempatan dan kebebasan yang sama sebagai tolok ukur normatif bagi pluralisme masyarakat modern ini macintyre sama seperti rousseau mengkritik proyek pencerahan mencoba menunjukkan bahwa masyarakat hanya dapat diberi pendasaran dengan mengacu pada tradisi tradisi historis dengan kebiasaan kebiasaan etis dan pandangan teleologis tertentu tidak ada nilai dan keyakinan an sich yang ada hanyalah nilai dan keyakinan khas menurut tradisi komunitas tertentu macintyre menolak dengan tegas paham keadilan yang berdasarkan kriteria rasionalitas murni menurut macintyre liberalisme telah salah paham ketika mengaku dapat merumuskan konsep keadilan universal dan netral bahwa kehidupan yang baik adalah individualisme liberalisme justru dengan demikian merupakan suatu tradisi sendiri dalam suatu masyarakat yang ada hanyalah konsep konsep keadilan dalam masing masing tradisi etis tertentu macintyre mau membayangkan suatu masyarakat yang dibangun atas dasar nilai nilai dan keyakinan keyakinan khasnya sendiri namun dapat membandingkan dengan tradisi saingan perbandingan dan penilaian itu tidak menggunakan rujukan kriteria rasionalitas objektif dan netral hal ini dapat dibayangkan seperti percakapan di mana paling tidak orang mencapai pengertian diri baru
722189 im very happy to have joined this club its a very proud moment in my career
722190 i didnt really enjoy my time in the city playing football and living in the city at the same time made me tired
722191 instead clubs want to sign players left right and centre and leave them high and dry after they realize that there was in fact no use in signing them in the first place
722192 this is an awesome awesome moment in my life and i will never forget it

722206 am renun at de trei ori la canotaj ns tot de trei ori am revenit asupra deciziei

722211 noi nu facem alegeri politice fi indca daca facem acesta este sf rsitul universalitatii jocurilor olimpice

722288 yet after four and a half decades our the u s governments i think obstinacy has prevented us from engaging one of our closest neighbors and has prevented our u s i think companies from benefiting from the changes that have occurred there we are truly the last bastion that has failed to recognize that the ghost of khrushchev is gone

722290 i see ibm ibm and fujitsu numbers one and two worldwide in bpm
722291 many including the smaller suppliers offer multiple bpm related products because of acquisitions made over the last 36 months so a more useful ranking to determine market acceptance would be by product rather than vendor consider ibm with everything from filenet to notes or oracle with everything from fuego to the plumtree portal to the collaxa bpel engine
722292 however bpm software alone generally focuses on the automation management and control of business processes and does not address all of the activities needed to improve processes by itself bpm software may not allow an organization to fully understand a given process and how it relates to the strategy people systems and data that the process impacts across an organization

722321 many on the left believe that the only way to end racism is to end races the only way to conquer nazism they argue is mass miscegenation
722322 the champions of diversity ultimately believe that our future is not as a species with many races but with one race a quarter chinese a quarter indian a quarter african and a quarter european
722323 the eternal human urge for self segregation surrounding yourself with people like you is likely to triumph over the more ephemeral economic and political incentives to leave what you know
722324 it is not hackney that is the future of the world but japan
722325 sharing the same language culture and values as the people you come into daily contact with may not be excitingly multicultural but it means you end up with deeper relationships a sense of community belonging and security
722326 the white flight or white self segregation which is such a feature of us cities is now endemic in the uk with hundreds of thousands of white britons sic fleeing the effects of the governments open border policy on london each year
722327 the slowing of mass migration is good for those who appreciate real diversity the decline of diversity within countries preserves the diversity between them
722328 i have been convinced that mixed race people by a blessing of nature combine the best of all their parts
722329 and as our minorities keep telling us it is not easy being a minority since in democracies it is the majority that sets the rules
722330 self segregation is apparent all around us but there is a reluctance to accept it because it mocks multiculturalism
722331 sharing the same language culture and values as the people you come into daily contact with may not be excitingly multicultural but it means you end up with deeper relationships a sense of community belonging and security

722335 the new contract includes eight paid holidays which is the same number provided in the old contract
722336 labor day differs in every essential way from the other holidays of the year in any country
722337 all other holidays are in a more or less degree connected with conflicts and battles of mans prowess over man of strife and discord for greed and power of glories achieved by one nation over another labor day is devoted to no man living or dead to no sect race or nation

722349 its sad that he doesnt even have the sympathy to leave her alone when shes pregnant
722350 the victim was seven months pregnant the baby and mom were transported to the hospital
722351 they induced labor took the baby the baby and mom are both alive
722352 we dont know what the motive was but once the victim recovers a little better well be able to talk to her and get a little more information
722353 its only happened on one side of the street due to the fact that theres a bayou on the back so easy access for them to get away

722362 by creating him and ordering him with wisdom and love to his final end through the law which is inscribed in his heart the natural law
722363 both the old and new testaments explicitly affirm that without love of neighbor made concrete in keeping the commandments genuine love for god is not possible
722364 if you wish to be perfect sell what you possess and give to the poor and you will have treasure in heaven and come follow me
722365 jesus brings gods commandments to fulfillment particularly the commandment of love of neighbor by interiorizing their demands and by bringing out their fullest meaning love of neighbor springs from a loving heart which precisely because it loves is ready to live out the loftiest challenges jesus shows that the commandments must not be understood as a minimum limit not to be gone beyond but rather as a path involving a moral and spiritual journey towards perfection at the heart of which is love
722366 perfection demands that maturity in self giving to which human freedom is called
722367 if you would be perfect sell what you have and follow me
722368 lets see how many interesting event we can squeeze into one day
722369 the vision is to figure out how to re establish the connection between individuals and their natural environments and reconnect families in the process
722370 think of the traffic and the noise and light until we know how many houses are being proposed its hard to know what the impact will be
722371 they own the land and they can do what they want with it
722372 we need a business to keep people here not drive people away
722373 its a little difficult when you dont have direct contact with the landowners
722374 this is a significant change whether you like it or not
722375 we want to be a good neighbor and partner and were trying to find ways to do that
722376 one of the tasks of the conference is to address the fact that there are three million people who now get the drugs but another nine million who do not
722377 they are used a lot in australia which has a big problem with skin cancer and i expect screening like this will become much more popular over here
722378 if sen mccain feels that i can help his candidacy which i think its so important to elect him our next president i will do it
722379 and frankly im going to go to a partisan convention and tell them if i go why its so important that we start to act like americans and not as as partisan mudslingers here in washington
722380 they are engaged in character assassination even john mccains partner in a number of initiatives in the senate russ feingold said yesterday theyve decided they cant win on the issues so now theyre going to try to destroy his character and that is exactly what this ad is calculated to do
722381 as we prepare to come together in denver however we must be and will be united in our determination to change the course of our nation
722382 to that end democrats in florida and michigan must know that they are full partners and colleagues in our historic mission to reshape washington and lead our country in a new direction
722383 accordingly i ask that the credentials committee pass a resolution that would entitle each delegate from florida and michigan to cast a full vote
722384 we deeply appreciate and value senator obamas perspective on this important issue
722385 if i can get paid to do that then im in
722386 i notice that you say dammit a lot is that scripted or improvised and the second part of my question is would you say dammit cameron to me
722387 let me address the second part of your question first
722388 how old is richard alpert and how many toes does he have
722389 i asked a richard alpert question and all i got was this lousy t shirt
722390 the primary focus is the safety of the detainees as well as the detainee guard force and thats why we have this intelligence activity
722391 guantanamo has become little more than a holding center for hundreds of men most of whom will never be charged with a crime and have nothing to offer the u s government in the way of actionable intelligence
722392 you always want to make sure you understand the mood of the camp
722393 if i see a change in behavior my question then will be well is this because of a new procedure ive implemented or is this just because its hot outside or ive got a new rotation of detainee guards
722394 confirms what professional interrogators have been saying for years that captured terrorism suspects provide no useful intelligence after the first six months of detention
722395 it is the worst tragedy on k2 since 1986 when 12 climbers were killed due to exposure
722396 i have carried down both living and dead people from the mountain i panicked when a pakistani high altitude carrier fell straight onto my back with his entire weight
722397 i was terrified that he would pull us all off the cliff and screamed to him to use his ice axe but he lost his grip and plummeted off a 300 metre cliff
722398 we had a feeling this would not turn out well and decided to turn around the accident could have been prevented these mountains lure out way too inexperienced and naive people
722399 at present it is believed that anyone who is classified as position unknown will not be coming back
722400 the lower they come to the ground the closer they are to safety but they are totally exhausted and not out of danger yet
722401 the problem is that we live in the most perfect imperfect medium in the world the web
722402 six rules for creating a data driven drug design project
722403 in the past many experimentalists shared a similar sentiment regarding of the usefulness of theoretical and computational methods to their drug discovery problems namely youre always explaining to me after the fact why a molecule ive already discovered is active but youre never able to tell me ahead of time which molecules i should be investigating
722404 i have heard that if the drug universe included all the possible drug like molecules its size would be 10 62 molecules other authors have proposed 10 200
722405 make a conscious choice what job you want to be in
722406 if you want to change your boss and your company then youll have to become a marketer someone with an understanding marketing principles someone who can be a customer advocate champion someone who can evangelize the purpose of data in creating customer centric decisions
722407 it is important nay critical to constantly check yourself and ask if the business is really serving the needs of data or vice a versa
722408 so many people think that bullying is just a rite of passage
722409 kids have feelings too and so thats what we try to do is help them channel and be able to discuss and find a solution that works for them
722410 thats the key to the whole thing that violence is never the answer
722411 ive always liked the comedy part of it and that kind of stuff
722412 we have to start teaching these young kids that are getting on the internet and writing these things to be careful about the words theyre using
722413 one kid told us a really scary story about how he was bullied every day because he walked home i guess these kids pushed him down in the street in the bushes and stuff so we talked to him and last time we found out he was getting help from his teacher to try to stop the bullying
722414 that encompasses several websites serving key african markets relevant to mtn this particular website primarily a news site was scheduled as part of googles content network which enables us to geo target according to our target audiences
722415 we therefore included these placements in our strategy along with many other news related sites and targeted sa users only
722416 seems about right its definitely not something that happens every day
722417 a sample kept on site exploded which led to the plutonium leak inside the laboratory
722418 i think ordinary people have no opportunity to see the games and i find it hard to accept that everyone around the country has to adjust their lives and work for it just because this is about the countrys image
722419 this is a warning to my friends who are trying to oppose the beijing olympics be careful
722420 assembling to march and protest is a citizens right but it must be stressed that when exercising this right citizens must respect and not harm others freedoms and rights and must not harm national social and collective interests
722421 if there were freedom there would definitely be people protesting
722422 at least half the people i know cant wait for the games to be over its a glorious event for the country but ordinary people are the unlucky ones
722423 i can barely feed myself so what do i care
722424 weve had a few leads and were in the process of confirming an identification
722425 the boys turned around and realised deon wasnt with them
722426 he was looking down at the river saying something to the boys and they told him to get down in a split second he fell
722427 they saw him two or three times bobbing up and down in the river they did have contact with him yelling out screaming to him to get to the other side
722428 all of a sudden he went down and never came back
722429 i saw an old woman who lost two legs and a hand she was bleeding and later died before our eyes but we could do nothing as we ourselves needed help
722430 we do not have enough doctors and enough operational theatres it takes some time before all patients get access to emergency treatment
722431 they are lying in the corridors and some bled to death
722432 there is no compelling evidence that this infection was contracted anywhere else
722433 well eventually but not now its working our supporters get a bit angsty but its working
722434 nationals made it clear we wont be selling assets in our first term if theres any change to that position we will go and seek that mandate by going out and asking the voters of new zealand whether they support a particular policy or not
722435 theres never going to be a blanket change made by national without that support of the public when it comes to assets
722436 i dont think you can expect that to be on the agenda i wouldnt jump to any conclusions
722437 theres no issues of public trust our position is quite clear
722438 we wouldve had something like working for families but not the same we wouldve given them quite a bit of cash in the hand
722439 the last thing we want through the whole election campaign is families saying mr key took money off us we cant do that later on well have to have a bit of a sort out
722440 this would be bad news for our economy and raises questions about what other public assets national may ready for the auction block if elected
722441 este problema n o vai prejudicar o clube o mauro estava ali como torcedor foi feito um tco termo circunstanciado de ocorr ncia e provavelmente ele dever responder pagando cestas b sicas a alguma institui o
722442 ronaldinho foi cercado por uma multid o pedindo aut grafos gritando seu nome e tirando fotos

722546 people came to visit me in my hospital room in kenya and one of the pastors was talking to me about forgiving the people who hurt me
722547 i knew just in my mind that my words were important for my own ears to hear
722548 i did it with totally no emotion whatsoever and i just about forgot the important thing so i said hang on ive got to do something else so then i went through all of them again forgiving them for what they did to my husband and then i broke all up and started crying from my very guts but i said it
722549 if we dont forgive then its like poison in our own systems were just like an emotional slave to the people who have hurt us

722626 whats so fantastic is that we found them completely furnished with beds chairs tables communication systems and the personal effects of the soldiers who lived inside
722627 emptied by the danes of their contents after world war ii to salvage the scrap iron and electrical devices that were needed
722628 it was like entering the heart of a pyramid with mummies all around i dug a tunnel through the sand that was blocking the entrance to the bunkers and what i saw blew me away it was as if the german soldiers had left only yesterday
722629 it was a race against the clock because of the risk of looters we lied to keep them at bay saying that there was only one furnished bunker and that it was guarded around the clock which wasnt true but even so there were two attempted break ins
722630 it was surprising to see the soldiers living conditions in the bunkers
722631 in a way this discovery can be compared to tutankhamuns tomb almost a century ago it has to be preserved and to blow up the bunkers as some have suggested would be like denying that world war ii ever existed
722632 disgusted that people want to attract tourists to this kind of garbage
722633 was not from the bronze age what has been found is incredibly authentic and tells us a lot about how they lived in these bunkers
722634 we dont expect contemporary objects like these to be so well preserved maybe its because they were kept for 60 years in the cold and dark like in a big vacuum
722635 world war ii and its memories will not just go away and discoveries like these breathe new life into the story and the fascination that still surrounds this war

722690 unless a man be born again he cannot see the pearly gates when he dies

722728 ok fair enough on the drink thing but when one character asks another one out for a drink given the context of the episode her asking if he was still single him saying he wasnt very good at this stuff and then her acknowledging it when asking it wasnt a big leap to assume she was asking asking him out for a drink and if they did go out in that way then asking if they were going now isnt that far a question but from how the scene played out i didnt take the question of a drink any other way
722729 in critical mass caldwell from what i remember had his symbiote removed by beam technology was there a specific reason why that was not done to adria in dominion because if they had beamed it out from another room then baal would not have expected it especially as he was unaware that caldwell was implanted with one and would not have released the poison that killed her
722730 werent the genii supposed to be super secretive in their underground hiding places society it seems as though almost everyone in the galaxy knows that they arent simple farmers
722731 so apart from the confusion over pleats etc were you happy with the finish product from pacific custom
722732 are you surprised by the generally negative reaction to trio
722733 i watched the illusionist last weekend and very much enjoyed it the explanations behind the magic are discussed by the director on the commentary track
722734 the most destacable one being the infamous zelenka bashing one honestly i cant imagine weir saying such things
722735 although nitpick if she is so socially awkward never had any friends which is what i understood her to imply in quarantine howd she learn any nifty bar beer drinking games
722736 so let me get this straight there isnt going to be any conclusion to wrap up that random and tantalizing teaser cliffhanger scene because torri decided not to do it
722737 joe if the dinner is on april 3rd could mgm bridge stop you from attending any events while creation is in town
722738 you stop chewing put that fork down you spit it out spit it out now
722739 i was just looking back at the spoiler poem you posted in december and was wondering if this line the status quo shifts a power play made the arrival of this one leave some feeling dismayed refers to woolsey taking coming to atlantis
722740 a shake room would be a great way to teach people what its like and why they need to prepare any info on how it was built
722741 dont suppose we might see an episode that shows a hive ship being created
722742 ive always wondered what the actors and the production staff think when they watch the finished episodes of their own product
722743 yknow marty g is going to need to be careful should he ever get near a con i think there would be a long line of women waiting to give him a big ol smooch for yet another great episode
722744 will the rodney keller thing be revisited or is it official now
722745 when you said that this season is going to be very tight schedule wise did you say that because you guys are pushing for a possible july premiere
722746 i hope that means mr binder will be flying back up to vancouver soon
722747 i know that you guys were totally concerned because five or ten online fans were screaming bloody murder about carter joining the team and how she was going to take over everyones positions she was going to trump sheppard on military stuff mckay on science stuff etc clearly this was the big worry and the thing you guys took to heart all throughout season four
722748 who thought of the bar trick because seriously that was brillent and who thought of rodneys hand motions when he wanted sam to flash the boys just hilarious
722749 so i was wondering if you ever considered writing some short stories for ffn
722750 quando um time n o vence a primeira cabe a pedida a do treinador isso normal no futebol tenho um carinho muito grande por todos e estou sempre trocando id ias com os meus superiores vou dar continuidade ao meu trabalho porque sou pago para isso tenho o meu limite e ele n o chegou ainda
722751 would the actress in mind for porter happen to be leela savasta or am i totally wrong
722752 what does the magic eight ball say about a jack oniell guest spot in season five
722753 speaking of trio you said to the fans that as soon as the ep aired youd write out the unedited version of the not so subtle sj ship reference that ended up on the cutting room floor will you still do that
722754 1 will there be an ori related episode in season 5 atlantis 2 will we see the tria in season 3 is the brotherhood of dagan episode gonna be revisited for the missing zpm in season 5
722755 if i remember right you are watching lost what do you think of the new episodes
722756 at this point how many episodes for season 5 are set in stone
722757 re comic con make sure you swing by the mile high comics table and say hi to lisa our official sjhw representative
722758 since the porter idea got the axe will the new character actress follow along the same lines as what had been originally intended for porter i
722759 did you ever get a chance to read good omens
722760 one thing i have noticed at both stargate amp star trek conventions is that other actors and others associated with the shows are always full of praise for the attitude of both amanda tapping and robert picardo to their work knowing their lines being on time respect for other actors etc is this one of the factors that led to both being on the shortlist for the position of base commander in the run up to season 4
722761 what happened to the militarization of atlantis which seemed so hellbend in season 4
722762 joe f had done two episodes of womens murder club while on hiatus once the writers strike gets settled will joe be able to continue his role on there since you guys will be in production by then
722763 have the writers ever scrapped a story idea early on because it seemed like itd be too expensive daunting or too much of a hassle to do
722764 i was curious about something since you average over a hundred comments on your blog do you really read them all or do you randomly just pick and choose which ones to read and answer
722765 is april 1st a typo or are you playing an early april fools joke on us
722766 just started watching trio and ive got to ask was rodneys comment about shape magazine compliments of an adlib or the writers
722767 i dont care who wins just so long as its a good game
722768 i dont follow football but im rooting for the patriots
722769 any chance we will be seeing the travelers in season 5 most notably larrin
722770 have you ever seen the disney movie atlantis the lost empire
722771 my husband did not like the original battlestar galactica series he says it annoyed him do you think he would like the new series would you recommend any other scifi series for him
722772 todd is my best friends absolute favorite character hes a close second to mckay for me will we be seeing him again at all in season 5
722773 any chance that you will be at dragon con this year
722774 if all five episodes have been written and a sixth brilliant idea comes up is there any possibility of more than five beckett episodes
722775 my favorite was when i was shopping in the shoe department at macys wearing clothing that in no way resembled a uniform of any kind and had a purse etc a lady came up to me and rudely asked me to get her a particular size of the shoe she was holding she then got all pissed off when i told her i didnt work there that was weird
722776 why take dr keller in sheppards team and not major lorne
722777 okay mr m would you say the chances of bringing back kolya are slim to none or better with bribery
722778 how does it feel to commit television genocide washing the nonexistant blood of fictional people from your hands hearing the silent screams of those that dont exist as they are written out of existance
722779 how do you live with yourself making choices that i might not agree with did you not once think to consult me did you think for some delusional reason that your creative decisions might hold more weight than mine do
722780 after all at the end of the day youre just the executive producer and writer for the show i on the other hand spend 45 minutes a week slumped on the couch with a bag of potato chips watching this if anyone knows how to run things around here its me
722781 also based on the beginning of bamsr is it correct to say that there are still nanite particles floating around in space from the attacks caldwell and ellis made waiting to be re activated
722782 in the original idea that mr flanigan pitched out did he go to earth alone or did ronon or any other members of the team go with him and which of the writers was responsible for the scene with sheps brother
722783 the many pineapples appearances despite the fact that i was allergic to it therefore an obvious attempt to mock me
722784 in short could you confirm whether the new commander is or is not another character from sg 1
722785 will details like which writers and producers will return also be announced in press release or will you just fill us in here
722786 was there a scene filmed with sheppard and the horse
722787 what is the most expensive thing that has been broken on set
722788 who should i bet on and what should i say to make it sound like i know what im talking about
722789 with the absence of carter sheppard joe flanigan will pick up more leadership responsibilities rumor has it he may even be in for a promotion to full bird colonel however nothing along those lines has been confirmed
722790 we may also be seeing a little less of rachel luttrell as teyla at least in the early goings of the new season as every fan of the series knows rachel spent most of season 4 being pregnant for real by the time season 5 airs she will have delivered her baby and will be spending some quality time with her new addition to the family she is expected to return in full capacity later in the season however
722791 there will be an addition to the atlantis sg team named captain alison parker she is military tough and ready for action but frustrated over colonel carters slowness in making her a permanent part of the team that will change quickly after the first episode
722792 the show will also get to see a lot more from recurring characters like major evan lorne kavan smith and dr katie brown brenda james rodney mckays david hewlett love interest
722793 hey wait minute if able to sneak bomb on board for to blow up crate door why not just sneak bigger bomb on board for to blow up plane
722794 the sheriff played by tommy lee jones shares in this role so the decision to dispatch of joshs character off screen and about a half an hour before the final credits is a sound one
722795 your cervo implants must be messing up your synaptic plasticity
722796 a films protagonist is its hero the character driving the action the tommy lee jones character on the other hand was a passive entity a commentator philosopher more akin to ancient greek dramas chorus to suggest otherwise is ridiculous
722797 perhaps the most important aspect of adapting a book to the big screen is in translating the written word to the visual medium giving the source material life within the filmic framework
722798 is your adreno serum screwing with your basal ganglia how the hell can he possibly imagine someone he has never met before
722799 ive decided to read another iain banks novel you recommend both the player of games and use of weapons do you have a preference of one over the other
722800 youve indicated mcgillion is onboard for 5 episodes do you already have outlines for those stories or are you planning to write the scripts now that you know you have the character
722801 oh and another point about keller not everyone who skips grades and graduates early has a miserable childhood
722802 you got rid of elizabeth because she wasnt leadership material because atlantis was at war right and you needed someone military
722803 the decisons to get rid of beckett and weir the decisions to switch to carter and keller and now the decision to bring in woolsey as a leader will go down in scifi history as some of the dumbest things ever done
722804 if you havent even spoken to torri or decided how many episodes you want her for isnt it a little presumptuous to be telling fans shell be back
722805 will we see the wraith worshiper that escaped at the end of reunion return this season or in season 5
722806 will the focus of the show still be on the team i e sheppard teyla ronon and mckay in season 5
722807 i was wondering who wrote these last episodes of season four
722808 do you consider mrs claudia black to play porters character
722809 i have a question as i was watching some of sg 1 seasons i noticed a lot of the episodes are labeled with the actors as executive producers or writers like rda as executive producer and christopher judge as writer is this something that the actors wanted to do to help their career or something fun for them
722810 is the michael storyline going to be revisited at all in s5
722811 was bill dow really sunburned or was all of that makeup just to set up the joke that dr lee got called in from vacation
722812 where did you and the rest of the sga writers get your sense of humors
722813 when the decision was made to cast hewlett was there a lot of revising of scripts early on
722814 i was wondering if you would be so willing as to confirm or deny acastas kolyas reappearance in season 5
722815 ive herad that dogs like yours are prone to have breathing problem because of the way the nose is can you confirm that
722816 have you read susannah clarkes jonathan strange and mr norrell yet
722817 im glad that hes going to remain the team leader but as for there being no discussion about promoting him why on earth not carter made lieutenant colonel one year before he did wouldnt it then make sense for him to be promoted to full colonel one year after her that is in season 5
722818 you can say that michael shanks will guest star in several episodes but you cant give the same statement for torri
722819 can you confirm if jewel staite will be regular or recurring next season
722820 the mysterious character porter was an announcement about her not included because the actress hasnt been decided because she wont be significant enough in the show or some other reason
722821 also how was the decision to bring woolsey over made i know the writers have said it was considered when thinking who would be in charge for season 4 was it a quick obvious decision or did it require a lot of thought
722822 what the hell are you thinking sending daniel to atlantis without vala you know very well that these two are totally incomplete without another around and i swear im gonna hate you forever if you make daniel act like vala doesnt exist at all and there wont be at least one mention of her
722823 will season five introduce new enemies alongside its new atlantis personnel
722824 joe look what i found i think youll enjoy this http www linein org media screenclean swf
722825 k ytt ess n nesteit ei voi n hd esteit
722826 a book that opens with a story about creatures who live their entire existences in sand castles from when youthful builders abandon them to when the tide destroys them demands readers possessing a healthy sense of wonder and the willingness to embrace the bizarre and fantastic
722827 the originality of rothfusss outstanding debut fantasy the first of a trilogy lies less in its unnamed imaginary world than in its precise execution
722828 its 1998 and a physicist in cambridge england attempts to send a message backward in time
722829 john percival hackworth is a nanotech engineer on the rise when he steals a copy of
722830 middle aged rock star judas coyne collects morbid curios for fun so doesnt think twice about buying a suit advertised at an online auction site as haunted by its dead owners ghost
722831 thus reads the message received from a nazi commander stationed in a small castle high in the remote transylvanian alps
722832 does fondy have fashionable outfits for a 10week old female norwegian buhound
722833 also i couldnt help noticing the gaps in the fence are kind of wide has lulu every tried to or successfully escaped
722834 mckay said that the planet was where they first developed drone technology does this mean they never had it back in the milky way
722835 do you feel the wraith are a success in how theyve been written and developed and do you feel they are as effectively entrenched as an enemy with a backstory and impact as the goauld were by this same point in that series
722836 how often do you writers find yourselves being surprised by your characters
722837 well of course he is with a wife like that
722838 and he rolled away and went to sleep i guess there wasnt much he could have done it was a bad way to bring it up i was 23 or 24 at the time too young and too stupid to handle this better
722839 i really expected to hate harmony but i ended up being pleasantly surprised
722840 do you guys have staff meetings or something before starting filming of an episode
722841 oh a friend asked me a question of pugs can they take some of australias summer heat
722842 have you had a chance to pick up mister b gone by clive barker yet
722843 when the episode harmony was written was jodelle ferland a quick decision to fill the title role
722844 how long did it take to film harmony and were the nighttime scenes filmed on location as well or on the set to give you more flexibility with time
722845 was wondering what you thought of the amazing race finale this year
722846 when you say that they were looking to drasticly reduce rdas role was this a rda decision or a manegement decision
722847 in case you forgot vala is part of the team now what you said sounds to me like youre trying to prove something else that carter is the only girl on sg 1 and vala is entirely a fifth wheel
722848 as for a movie entirely devoted to the vala character again i cant speak for brad and robert but i think that would be highly unlikely future movies should focus on the team
722849 vala is too important character to really big part of the audience and deserve a story in the movie as the main character devoted to her entirely
722850 joe if sci fi never puts out a press release before s5 starts filming will you then be allowed to tell us who shows up for work i think it will be hard to keep it secret for long
722851 i was wondering since you guys mentioned previously that the weir story line would be visited in s5 would that be done sort of behind the scenes way
722852 did marty g have the portrait in the script from the beginning
722853 wouldnt that line refer more to millers crossing than mckay and mrs miller
722854 is it possible that shell direct a season 5 episode
722855 speaking of books have you started on bright of the sky yet
722856 are the fake gunshots not loud enough to cause problems or am i just missing something
722857 also im going to be in vancouver in a couple of weeks what is a good french resturant for a first timer
722858 my question was if you had any numbers for the live 7 for
722859 forgot to ask was there some outside reason for harmony not including the whole team actors were busy or was it just planned that way because was there thought about the inside reason for why ronon and teyla wouldnt be there
722860 theres a chance that brad wright or rob cooper will invite claudia to the third or perhaps fourth sg 1 movie vala is too important character to really big part of the audience and deserve a story in the movie as the main character devoted to her entirely
722861 where you inspired by the dolphins in hitchhikers guide when thinking up the whangels
722862 the decision may have been made but fans have made a difference before it has happened in this franchise remember the daniel wars i wasnt around then but i have read plenty about it and they did make a difference
722863 weve had some wonderful years in this class but having lost our mean machine mojo on the road to success time has come to stop and take stock ive considered the option to make changes to the team in order to get back on track but that would not have done justice to the fantastic group of people we had for so many years there are times one has to realistically admit to have performed bellow its standards being the owner and skipper i take full responsibility for that
722864 perch sei capace di giocare a biliardo ma non riesci a usare martello e chiodi
722865 though we are not now that strength which in old days moved earth and heaven that which we are we are one equal temper of heroic hearts made weak by time and fate but strong by will to strive to seek to find and not to yield
722866 all i need is a few drinks and the music
722867 whites stunning second crime novel to feature ex cop and ex pi jackson donne fulfills the promise of his debut
722868 intricate plotting and nonstop action make this a nail biting read from start to finish white is a writer to watch
722869 scenes of donnes mothers decline however are knowing and movingly written and the gritty new jersey locale seems an ideal setting for portraying the evil that men do
722870 white has learned early the art of the hard boiled
722871 white has created an appealing character in donne and the plot flies between the events in the 1940s and explosions kidnappings and murders in the present
722872 an engrossing evocative debut novel that will grab most readers from its opening sentences fans of hard hitting uncompromising private investigators will hope that donne ditches his college dreams and continues to pound the pavement
722873 white manages the neat trick of respecting the genres traditions while daring to nudge it toward something new and unexpected
722874 a unique and artful blend of the pi novel and the police procedural with a story as deceptively simple as your first love and as fatal as your last car wreck a terrific novel
722875 its the great american private eye novel reborn for the 21st century with a fast moving spare style that punches you in the gut at the same time it squeezes your heart
722876 when one man dies barrels straight out of the old school and swerves onto the highway that will take detective fiction where its going next dave white has one hand on the wheel the other on the gear shift and his foot on the floor
722877 fast and funny with plenty of classic action but a setting and character that are entirely new dave white is creating a winner with jackson donne
722878 when one man dies heralds the introduction of two astonishing new figures in the crime fiction world new jersey pi jackson donne whose emotional journey will break your heart and author dave white whose voice has the confidence and assurance many more established writers would kill for
722879 now why did i put these in here they are all spoiled now
722880 i seem to remember reading that joe flanigan thought sheppard would not be from a rich family do you know why or why the writers decided he is
722881 when you mention that you will be revisiting weirs story onscreen will we be seeing torri
722882 have you thought of making an sga episode in the snow
722883 alas phoenix has no restaurant week is there anything like this in vancouver and if so do you participate
722884 what id like to know is if studios specifically animation studios would hire someone like me at this age attending school and with no experience to speak of do studios have any internships or part time positions for writers
722885 are there any books that would give me an insight into how animation scripts work
722886 though you have adamently sp said that you are not going to attend the creation con in vancouver is there a chance that you will make an appearance at a picnic some of the fans are having outside the studio
722887 are you concerned or ok with the rating numbers so far for season 4
722888 hence thats why kevin odonnell poisoned him towards the end because he saw him as being partly responsible even though kevin odonnell was probably involved in a lot of the atrocities he had to blame someone else
722889 thanks joe for being a conduit for dogs being adopted
722890 you know i almost led my parents to go insane let me make it up to them by being the coolest toddler ever
722891 damn i wish i could find a restaurant that actually served food like this
722892 if im not in the office by ten a m tomorrow assume im dead please send someone to the house to take care of the dogs
722893 this would be a great place to have a special stargate dinner
722894 you should just get a bunch of people from your blog to together during the creation con
722895 greyias and i have been discussing carsons return weve finally worked it out however prepare to be amazed
722896 did you listen to torris interview i am not sure if i want her back now considering how you and the rest of the powers that be treated her
722897 any chance weir might be figuring prominently in the mid season two parter
722898 just out of curiosity whats your process for selecting the nominees for the botm
722899 can you give us an inkling as to the number of episodes well see amanda in
722900 will you or any of the stargate gang be in attendance at the 2008 san diego comic con
722901 so when you were deciding about who was to replace weir did you guys honestly think of creating a new character
722902 sofri muita press o do kimi estava patinando um pouco na pista pois estava com os pneus extra macios deteriorados mas consegui manter o ritmo chegar ao final e subir no p dio pela primeira vez
722903 confesso que tive um pouco de sorte se pensar na coloca o no campeonato j para a pr xima corrida espero que consiga continuar brigando pelas vit rias
722904 hoje fomos bem claro que poder amos ter ido melhor com o fruto do meu trabalho na pista consegui ser mais r pido que alonso
722905 estava disposto a tentar de tudo nas ltimas voltas mas o glock se manteve muito bem e n o cometeu erros
722906 fico feliz com o meu resultado neste fim de semana eu conseguiu alguns valiosos pontos que ser o importantes para o resto da temporada
722907 it is amazing how quickly he has been able to incorporate our science into his
722908 whose idea was it for the painting at the end of harmony
722909 i just wanted you to know that i dont not like your blog
722910 in the latest amanda interview on scifi com amanda mentions the cut line in trio and makes it sound like its still there and not cut is the not so subtle hint still in trio or is it truly on the cutting room floor
722911 wow i cannot believe you disagree with the comparison to trek
722912 i forgot to ask how is jellys degenerative hip condition
722913 you guys film at a location with a lot of sand and sand dunes hills several times during sg1 for instance a matter of time moebius where is that site
722914 joe i am wondering if you are intentionally ignoring my questions the first was about bloopers the next few were about the video on mgms website
722915 have you considered severing atlantis from earth permanently therefore changing the entire basis of storyline from exploration to survival
722916 dreaming of tokyo let me help you with the visuals i was there a year ago have a gander at my photos on flickr
722917 oh by the way some friends and i want to come to vancouver this summer can we sleep in your wok kitchen
722918 i looked through your blog for books but there were a lot too many could you narrow it down to in your opinion the best
722919 i dont if this has been asked answered before shame on me but how did you and paul become writing partners
722920 also why didnt you get them micro chipped rather than tattooed
722921 also has the title been changed to search and destroy now
722922 i was wondering if you had a chance to write an episode for any tv show throughout all time what show would you write the episode for
722923 i was just wondering if it was your idea to include the 42 reference in quarantine
722924 tune in this friday when extra airs a special sga segment with host jerry penacoli
722925 so joe since you did not bother to give even a sarcastic answer to my inquiry about crashing on one of your puppy pillows for the april time frame i can only assume that it was a stupid inquiry to begin with
722926 alison porter hmm interesting possibly the gate tech from quarantine
722927 i was thinking about joining my local roller derby what do you think
722928 so is there anything were supposed to be doing to help bam bam get selected for gladiators
722929 i am wondering if you know who at mgm and or sci fi channel i can get into contact with in order to ask about potential employment opportunities
722930 have you read enders game by orson scott card its a great book that i read many years ago also the sequel speaker for the dead is good
722931 joe have you ever fallen over max in the dark
722932 do you have the directors set for season 5 yet
722933 several years ago i think it was back during season brad rob wanted to do a stargate movie that was supposed to be a lost season 2 episode what was the idea for the episode
722934 dallas wanted to keep me but it is over now
722935 i promised myself 10 years ago that i would quit while i still had a strong position in the team and now it is over
722936 what is amazing this year is how many people have bought the fundamentally childish notion that if you dont like the way things are going the answer is to write a blank check for generic change empowering someone chosen not on the basis of any track record but on the basis of his skill with words
722937 barack obama concedes that americas troops have contributed to improvements on the ground in iraq but he still stands by his vote against the surge why not just admit that he was wrong obama has fallen to pride in part because he has bought his own myth by staking his future on a past of supernatural vision he has made it difficult to admit human fault the magic isnt working anymore and obama the visionary one cant even see what everyone else sees he was wrong
722938 so senator obama and his campaign decided that it would be inappropriate to visit wounded soldiers in germany while touring europe as a candidate for the presidency senator mccain hit this one right on the head it is never inappropriate to visit our wounded men and women in uniform
722939 barack obama represents an obnoxiously elitist attitude that reeks of paternalistic government
722940 sen obama owes it to the public to let us know how much of our hard earned money he in his wisdom believes we have a moral obligation to give away to poor people around the world and how much of our money that he has a moral obligation to extract from our wages forcefully through federal taxation
722941 what do you want to know about generating best practices
722942 i can tell youve been drinking because you were riding on the wrong side of the road
722943 i just wanted to be sure i could see what was coming my way officer i had some to drink but not much ill get off an walk it if you like
722944 no man its not a full grown deer but its a deer
722945 he was walking around carrying her head and telling the astonished villagers not to stop him
722946 they knew he had psychological problems but they didnt expect he would reach this point
722947 but theres one particular harbour so far but yet so near where i see the days as they fade away and finally disappear

722957 ive been with her for 10 years a lot of wins she hit every green today it is the sign of a champion to come out when you dont have a chance of winning and play like that shes great nobodys done it better ill never forget this
722958 i think i was born to compete there were times i wish i didnt have it but i probably wouldnt have achieved what i have maybe there were times the last few months when i wish i had the desire and the motivation and the drive then i wouldnt step away
722959 but i just dont have that when you have the mind of a champion and the mind of a competitor but then theres a few pieces missing thats hard to accept sometimes
722960 i came up 18 made the corner turn and there was a sign saying annika you will be missed
722961 i thought that was very special i waved to the guys they clapped and then i came up 18 and everybody was cheering it just makes you feel good when you get that type of applause ive been out here for 15 years and ive experienced a lot of joy a few setbacks but overall its been great
722962 im going to miss it no doubt about it i love the majors i try to gear up for them and kind of be ready for them ive had happy tears there ive had unhappy tears this game and this championship just sucks everything out of you

722969 often asked him to tell her about the war but her attention always wandered
722970 he thinks you have lost your ambition that you havent got a definite aim in life charley simmons who is just your age has a good job and is going to be married
722971 the boys are all settling down theyre all determined to get somewhere you can see that boys like charley simmons are on their way to being really a credit to the community
722972 it wasnt any good he couldnt tell her he couldnt make her see it it was silly to have said it he had only hurt her
722973 it is a complete waste of the money john mccains contributors have donated to his campaign it is a complete waste of the countrys time and attention at the very moment when millions of people are losing their homes and their jobs and it is a completely frivolous way to choose the next president of the united states
722974 only 22 think the paris hilton ad was racist most of those being black people of course only 18 of white people took this view

722985 contemporary forms of globalization are rooted in the historical development of capitalism as a world system shaped by processes of technological change particulary in the information and communication fields
722986 around the globe the creators of free and open source are thus contributing to the development of a digital commons where new forms of collectivity and grassroots participation in economic political social and cultural life become possible brazilian cultural policy offers an imaginative model to pursue the potential benefits of digital literacy and digital inclusion where the skills and opportunities to use information technology are made available to historically disenfranchised social groups this is an ambitious plan and since this policy is relatively new its effects are largely unknown nonetheless it presents an intrigiouing alternative grounded in a vision of diverse participation in a software sharing community

722988 senator obama said this week that even knowing what he knows today that
722989 do you think running a campaign ad in which you feature britney spears and paris hilton with barack obama is respectful
722990 its a bit of humor its a way to draw people into the ad
722991 were not deciding whos our favorite celebrity who we are fans of
722992 the only strategy theyve got in this election is to try to scare you about me
722993 well you know hes got a funny name and he doesnt look like all the presidents on the dollar bills and the five dollar bills
722994 what obama was saying is theyre trying to scare you
722995 theyre trying to scare the american people and believe me im an expert on how they do that
722996 to insinuate that his celebrity is somehow all he has
722997 theyre trying to say to america somehow hes not like you
722998 the mccain campaign is to use barack obamas words raising the question is he a risky guy but it has nothing to do with his name or his skin color it has to do with his lack of experience and bad judgment his unreadiness to be president
722999 in 2000 al gore gave me the extraordinary honor of being the first jewish american to run for national office and al gore said he had confidence in the american people that they would judge me based on my record not on my religion
723000 and i urge barack obama to have the same faith in the american people that they will judge him on his record or lack of record certainly not on his name or his race
723001 break americas gridlock by honoring a bipartisan effort if that is the only way to move us towards alternative and renewable fuels
723002 when john mccain brings american troops home from iraq theyre staying home
723003 i think liebermans going to want to be part of the stronger democratic majority
723004 i choose to reach across the aisle with john kerry to protect homeowners against foreclosure
723005 kerry advocates all kinds of additional socialism at home appeasement abroad and what that means is weakness for the future

723108 a shared responsibility between employers workers insurers providers and government all americans should have coverage they can afford
723109 theres no real consensus yet on which is the best health care reform to do other than we are committed to universality and were committed to getting there
723110 we believe that as you make health care more affordable people will be able to buy health the basic principle how we get there is a matter of the legislative process
723111 it was important that that was stated quite clearly in the platform
723112 while there are differing approaches within the party about how best to achieve the commitment of universal coverage we stand united to achieve this fundamental objective through the legislative process
723113 you cannot persuade me there are not more disturbed or disgruntled persons with a political agenda in such a large group
723114 one of the complaints by people who work in safety and security is they cant get the time of day from people running the labs
723115 are viewed as deeply offensive by a lot of scientists as if their patriotism is being questioned
723116 though several agencies have a need to know no one agency knows the number and location of these labs in the united states
723117 the united states word should not be so carelessly broken nor its standing in the international community so needlessly compromised
723118 there is no dispute that if texas executes mr medellin in these circumstances texas would cause the united states irreparably to breach treaty commitments made on behalf of the united states as a whole and thereby compromise u s interests that both this court and the president have described as compelling

723123 im really grateful that acting is the job that was chosen for me

723126 to that end democrats in florida and michigan must know that they are full partners and colleagues in our historic mission to reshape washington and lead our country in a new direction
723127 accordingly i ask that the credentials committee pass a resolution that would entitle each delegate from florida and michigan to cast a full vote
723128 we deeply appreciate and value senator obamas perspective on this important issue
723129 this matter will be the top priority for the credentials committee when we meet on august 24th as always our goal is to ensure a fair process and a unified democratic party so that we can win in november

723159 match play is hard its a whole week of really good golf which is different from stroke play stroke play you can maybe have an off day and come back and shoot a 65 which ive done match play is much different you really have to play solid every single day its tough
723160 im trying not to put too much pressure on it but still i really want to do well and get the trophy

723162 shes got the game to do it sometimes you just have to get things to go your way
723163 when i play with her she hits out of anything give her a bad lie like stepping on the ball or running over it with a golf cart and shell hit out of it and get it on the green
723164 its nice when you take a little bit of a break sometimes you just get tired of playing it was great to have a month off and get ready for this tournament

723173 today were going to look at almost the exact opposite of what weve done in the past in our posts on security converting binary numbers to decimal the hard way on linux or un
723174 if you recall a while back we looked at using perls
723175 today were going to continue in a sense where we left off on yesterdays post regarding using mkfifo for user

723183 and then theres a knock on the door by the police who serve a letter
723184 theres an informal conference held at the school where some of the agencies get together along with the school and discuss what the issues are
723185 we dont want to prosecute parents for not having their kids at school but we also want them to buy in to the process to get their kids ultimately re engaged back in to school
723186 shes not a bad kid its just she hadnt been turning up to school
723187 sometimes the tough love approach is the best way because it is a shock to students when mum or dad is going to get prosecuted because theyre not going to school
723188 they havent just dumped her i knew he was doing that and its great
723189 there is a remarkable cutthroat battle for market share on the east coast like nothing we ve ever seen before

723192 the incentives for taking the bus have never been better and it comes at an interesting time with airfares shooting up like a rocket

723228 doing it a third time would be a big proposition
723229 weve only talked loosely about it though chris and i
723230 but im not going to tell you chris is very particular about that
723231 i do think though that if theres not a third film these two movies stand on their own
723232 i dont know what id do next or what would happen next i felt in doing a sequel that it would be a big mistake to try to hold anything back for future films you have to put everything you can into this movie and try and make it as great as it can be
723233 i always like to have to think when im leaving the theater i do love any movie that leaves me questioning what has happened what is going to happen i see that in finishing the movie i want to know what will happen what is going to happen but it is completely in the hands of chris weather he decides to do that or not it will be a lot of money that he didnt give you any indication if that was going to happen or not but its completely his decision i cant imagine doing this without chris i dont even want to consider that because hes created this this is his

723278 newsom has said the city began its policy of not referring young immigrant offenders to federal authorities for deportation under previous mayors and that he reversed the practice after he became aware of it this year
723279 is they took the concept of sanctuary and they applied it in a way that it is as close to harboring as ive ever seen
723280 then they accommodate them by providing all these services to continue their unlawful status
723281 the city in this case is using taxpayer dollars to basically endear itself to activist groups that need funding for their activities

723304 theres no issues of public trust our position is quite clear
723305 we wouldve had something like working for families but not the same we wouldve given them quite a bit of cash in the hand
723306 the last thing we want through the whole election campaign is families saying mr key took money off us we cant do that later on well have to have a bit of a sort out
723307 this would be bad news for our economy and raises questions about what other public assets national may ready for the auction block if elected
723308 this is cynical dirty politics and shows that while the face at the front of national may have changed nothing else has
723309 the boys turned around and realised deon wasnt with them

723410 technology applications in all disciplines of the curriculum offer promise but are underdeveloped
723411 the confluence of having new tools both pedagogical and technological
723412 take on many characteristics of ideology ideology being defined as a systematic body of beliefs that requires loyalty and conformity by its adherents
723413 overuse of these materials is unfortunate and unnecessary but critics narrow anecdotal case that such overuse predominates is hardly compelling
723414 high stakes standardized testing can greatly influence the teaching of reading and writing many teachers change their literacy curricula in order to train students to take the test
723415 to teach in ways that contradict their ideas of sound instructional practice
723416 studies have demonstrated that students are less likely to engage in extended research writing complex problem solving and experimentation when the accountability system emphasizes short answer responses to formulaic problems
723417 unless we work hard to establish new schemas our existing schemas tend to determine how we evaluate and shape new information
723418 the reform movement can influence the use of technology and technology can influence the reform of education
723419 those restructuring the schools often have failed to consider the use of technology when designing new programs
723420 promote creativity collaboration and communication and they dovetail with learning methods in which these skills play a part
723421 the way schools have employed computers has been perfectly predictable perfectly logical and perfectly wrong
723422 students know how to use these tools for their own purposes schools must help them to use the tools to learn as well
723423 takes more preparation time compared to preparing to implement a more traditional lesson
723424 learn best when information is presented in a real life context
723425 more comfortable that they could use technology in their teaching
723426 instructors technology uses were not at a level that could be influential
723427 a focus shift from quantity to quality in educational technology policy and standards can help create necessary conditions for technology uses that have positive student impacts
723428 appropriate use of technology can reinforce higher cognitive skill development and complex thinking skills as promoted through the use of constructivist teaching practices

723431 confirm that teachers who have solid basic skills and comfort levels with technology and those who use computer technologies in their classrooms are more likely to use constructivist teaching practices
723432 the nteq model is not intended for use with every lesson taught
723433 teacher beliefs concerning their personal ability to effectively use technology and their beliefs regarding the potential effect on student achievement is quite possibly a significant factor in determining what actually happens in the classroom
723434 students are setting trends with their use of technology both in school and out of school
723435 evidence shows that teachers are more likely to adopt new technology if they can use it in accordance with their existing beliefs and practices
723436 offers the opportunity to experience firsthand the use of technology for meaningful and authentic activities
723437 teacher education needs to begin with these traditional beliefs and subsequently challenge them through activity reflection and discourse in both coursework and field work throughout the duration of the program

723456 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here

723518 bus system pe alosa said public transportation in his city is actually too popular and 20 of rail riders own cars they dont use
723519 to make more highways or bigger roads to solve traffic jams is like trying to put out a fire with gasoline

723527 towards a more socially and environmentally sustainable third world city
723528 they are just as important as hospitals and schools they create a sense of belonging this creates a different type of society a society where people of all income levels meet in public spaces is a more integrated socially healthier one
723529 getting more affordable housing in the centre of the city and giving back some dignity to people who walk rather than drive cars
723530 cars are seen as status for people big fast roads are seen as status for cities that is still the idea of progress in many places
723531 people in the u s now recognize there are problems with building cities for cars and not for people
723532 and we in the third world need to know that
723533 violence is not the answer however it is a good alternative
723534 why are you still reading this review and not buying playing the game
723535 doesnt show on flyff when you hit enter and flyff displays frog instead of
723536 if we in the third world measure our success or failure as a society in terms of income we would have to classify ourselves as losers until the end of time
723537 with our limited resources we have to invent other ways to measure success this might mean that all kids have access to sports facilities libraries parks schools nurseries
723538 i was almost impeached by the car owning upper classes
723539 one of the great public servants of our time he views cities as being planned for a purpose to create human well being hes got a great sense of what a leader should do to promote human happiness
723540 you must remember that third world cities are still two thirds unbuilt
723541 we can take advantage of whats been done mistakes and successes by cities in the developing world
723542 in spanish we have this saying that it doesnt cost anything to dream
723543 so i say lets play lets just imagine how you want your home to be how you want your kids to live do you want to walk or drive to get bread thats the basis of thinking about cities we have not given enough thought to how we live we have left too many of these decisions to others
723544 ninety nine percent of third world people have never seen a dutch or danish city where you see people on bikes everywhere a city full of cars is not a good model for us
723545 the images we get from the united states are a very damaging model to third world cities
723546 we need to avoid undesirable developments such an urban sprawl people in the u s now recognize there are problems with building cities for cars and not for people and we in the third world need to know that pedestrians and bicyclists should be given as much importance as motor vehicles even more so in developing country cities where most households dont own cars
723547 we all need to see other people we need to see green wealthy people can do that at clubs and private facilities but most people can only do it in public squares parks libraries sidewalks greenways public transit
723548 the least a democratic society should do is to offer people wonderful public spaces
723549 my focus has always been social how you can help the most people for the greater public good but if you are thinking constantly about how to help the environment you come to the same conclusions
723550 we live in the post communism period in which many have assumed equality as a social goal is obsolete
723551 although income equality as a concept does not jibe with market economy we can seek to achieve quality of life equality urban policy can be a powerful means to achieve equality in quality of life
723552 is to offer people wonderful public spaces public spaces are not a frivolity they are just as important as hospitals and schools they create a sense of belonging this creates a different type of society a society where people of all income levels meet in public space is a more integrated socially healthier one
723553 in bogot our goal was to make a city for all the children the measure of a good city is one where a child on a tricycle or bicycle can safely go anywhere if a city is good for children it will be good for everybody else over the last 80 years we have been making cities much more for cars mobility than for childrens happiness
723554 you cannot overestimate the impact pe alosa has had on a personal level in ten or twelve countries
723555 he takes these ideas which can be rather dry and speaks emotionally about the ways they affect peoples lives he has the ability to change how people think about cities hes a revolution that way
723556 i invite you to imagine for a minute a 20 mile long 50 feet wide road only for pedestrians and bicycles through your neighborhood regardless whether you live downtown or in a suburb at intersections there could either be bridges underpasses for motor vehicles or simply traffic lights ideally it would link your neighborhood to a waterfront a large park a shopping area a library and schools just to mention a few examples you and your neighbors could ride bicycles with your children to the beach or the library go jogging older citizens could walk to a caf and babies could be taken out for fresh air in their carriages it could completely transform a neighborhoods life and even significantly increase property values yet the cost of creating such a road would be minimal if done at the time of laying city plans where new areas are being urbanized large networks of such pedestrian and bicycle roads can easily be incorporated
723557 bikes are a wonderful thing in cities theyre sensual you can watch all the other people on their bikes meet your friends stop to talk
723558 all these issues were talking about are from the soul

723641 we have spent specifically on the provisions in the draft executive order the better part of the last two or two and a half weeks dealing with multiple committees on the hill at the staff level at the member level making experts available to provide briefings

723643 after seven years of a go it alone presidency perhaps i should expect nothing more from this white house but this order will be binding on future administrations as well
723644 as it was the text of the order was not provided to the intelligence committee until 30 minutes before the committee was briefed and after it had been released on the web given the impact that this order will have on americas intelligence community and this committees responsibility to oversee intelligence activities this cannot be seen as anything other than an attempt to undercut congressional oversight

723693 when youre a teenager you just take everything in you absorb all these ideas
723694 it just opened my mind not only to new ideas but just that theres a bigger world out there and that i can do anything i want and so when i got home i was like im going to be a filmmaker thats when i decided when i was about 17 and i stuck to my guns
723695 theyre revealing themselves in a way that could follow them for the rest of their lives
723696 i felt the weight of that responsibility when i was making it

723698 and i wanted it to be economically mixed and i was hoping for it to be racially mixed but that was hard to find in the midwest in small towns
723699 much more than my film and theres much more of an emphasis on wealth and competition
723700 more stagy we want to control everything in america its unfortunate
723701 i think theres something mean spirited about a lot of them too theyre appealing to the basest part of ourselves weve become bottom feeders
723702 i think that because this film is about teenagers there is a natural assumption that its influenced by reality tv because there is so much reality tv about teenagers
723703 but a lot of reality tv got their cues from documentaries and now documentaries are being criticized for learning things from reality tv funny
723704 there were parallel story lines a bit more like you have in
723705 so it was written like that but in the editing process my editor and i realized it wasnt working that left us in a kind of crisis especially me because everybody really liked the script everybody loved the script and i remember going into the shoot with a huge attitude like i knew i had the cast and i knew i had the script and i felt like nothing could go wrong and then it was like waking up we saw the first rough cut and discovered that it didnt work at all

723718 four boys in a repressive environment who find freedom through this play
723719 students 1 2 3 and 4 are characters outside of the shakespearean characters
723720 its their story i get a buzz when i see what happens when you look at things through a different lens
723721 it needs muscularity a pack of teenage boys generates an energy violence is always possible something happens with an all male environment there is a kind of mob mentality a different energy when there are no women around
723722 forget about gender and sexuality its much more exciting if the characters are swept into something monumental and dangerous that was not in their minds to have the play itself push them to emotional abandon
723723 my job as a director is to cast well and then to paraphrase british director richard eyre give the actors a comfortable loving environment and ask them to soar

723844 one look at the dressing room shows you how much potential this team has this team has been through ups and downs but there was no doubt that we would regroup and come back hard this group has shown amazing resilience not just once but time and time again
723845 viru sehwag getting a double hundred and gautam gambhir getting us off to fantastic starts in both innings was very important also the way harbhajan bowled in both innings and how ishant and zaheer bowled today was amazing
723846 on this pitch to crank it up like that from a 19 year old was something special
723847 to get three of the top order wickets and on a fourth day wicket like this everybody saw what he is capable of there is quality in this team and it augurs really well going into the last test
723848 getting 201 in a total of 329 is something amazing taking that forward into the second innings is never easy but he batted brilliantly and gave us another strong start
723849 everybody has got starts sachin tendulkar was batting brilliantly in the second innings and rahul dravid also sourav ganguly spent some time at the ssc but didnt get the opportunity here otherwise laxman has been in the runs so its not really a worry
723850 there are some areas which really help the umpires but there are some where it takes a long time and there is doubt sic whether someone looking at a tv can take a call
723851 i am very happy with the performance of the guys except for the batting in that we were not consistent enough in a test match you have got to be more consistent thats probably where we lost this match
723852 virender sehwag is anyway going to play his natural game the day its going to come off it will come off the days it wont come off it wont come off a few players did try to play a few shots not all of them but at the same time we managed to pick up wickets when they did that that is a positive thing for us
723853 you can step away a proud lad because you have given it everything
723854 news items shown on the channel are many a time based on half truths and false and suggestive innuendos this information is provoking people to take recourse to violence and arson
723855 if the administration discloses its stand on the issue of land transfer to the shrine board
723856 what is happening is a form of a civil war
723857 it is a war between factions families more like the law of jungle
723858 i will not be surprised if tensions rise further and the palestinian cause will be casualty and israel will emerge the biggest winner
723859 each party tries to eliminate the other and this wont work neither of them will be alone in leading the palestinian people
723860 there is a new level of deterioration between hamas and fatah the return of militias kidnapping and execution threats
723861 it is a war between factions families as if it is a jungle
723862 interest of the homeland and the cause would be higher than self interest
723863 even after the latest 10 hike we are far from being out of the woods another 15 hike is needed along with structural reforms the latter include cost cutting by rationalizing flights tax reforms on jet fuel pricing temporary relief in landing parking and navigation charges and a freeze on any increase in airport charges especially at new private airports
723864 he might have felt that by murdering students the ashram would close down and his desire to leave the ashram would be fulfiled
723865 my son has been made a scapegoat in the episode
723866 to be on the ball field on the same team as one of my sons was far superior than running the third leg of a triathlon

723868 just so you know i never want to live in a vegetative state dependent on some machine if that ever happens just pull the plug
723869 believe none of what you hear and half of what you see
723870 im really grateful that acting is the job that was chosen for me
723871 i get really lost when im not working i dont know what im supposed to do with myself thank god for dance class and the new york times crossword puzzle and american idol but acting is what i really have to do

723877 those who know li weiquang say that he is a muslim married and since coming to canada has worked in restaurants and newspaper delivery
723878 be disassociated from the infidels hate them for their religion
723879 today the charge made by the west is that muslims hate the west because they are incapable of reconciling themselves with modernity the muslim response is the same that was manifested by turkey and asia opposition to the west is because of western imperialism and hegemony
723880 these terrorist have no religion and they distort the image of islam
723881 united states government officials say american intelligence agencies concluded members of pakistans spy service helped plan the july 7 bombing of indias embassy in kabul afghanistan that killed 41 people the new york times reported
723882 im really looking forward to do a film on sports i guess there is a lot of excitement and enthusiasm about sports in our country and films should be made on them we have a culture for sports and it will be nice if more films are made on it such films are great to be a part of im keen on finding a good script in a sports based film ill surely do it
723883 if i would have gone straight into acting im not sure whether i would be as confident to face the cameras as i am today however when i was modelling i did not really have any plan of joining the film industry it just happened that people trusted my abilities
723884 i cannot really compare whether modelling is more exciting than acting or vice versa they are entirely different but its true that modelling was the best learning ground for me so the progression into acting was natural and smooth i knew the basic things when i signed movies and it gave me the required confidence
723885 i was perfectly fine with it our personal lives are totally different from our professional lives we are actors at the end of the day and we have to know that such things are only limited to the roles we play
723886 barack obama once again demonstrated that his words dont really matter
723887 sen obama supports the constellation program and he understands how critical nasa is to americas scientific and economic edge
723888 it really never had any momentum in the u s whatsoever
723889 its probably like drag racing is in england its one of those things where theres a cultural gap
723890 the x games is one of those formats where you can take a sport thats in the shadows in the u s and put a spotlight on it in away that you couldnt possibly have imagined
723891 other action sports sponsors have found their way into this sport
723892 berita kan kalian yang buat jadi kalian saja yang klarifikasi
723893 hey manny do you think i could get boston to pay me 7m for the next two months as well
723894 in a nation in which 66 of the voting age population is overweight and 32 is obese could sen obamas skinniness be a liability despite his visits to waffle houses ice cream parlors and greasy spoon diners around the country his slim physique just might have some americans wondering whether he is truly like them
723895 our goal is to just collect taxes it is only as a last resort that we would pursue foreclosure
723896 theyre trying to take my house away for a parking violation
723897 i know it was my own fault for letting it drag on ive been under mental duress i havent been able to handle this
723898 but on the other hand the city has to enforce its zoning laws i dont fault the city for that
723899 its a shame someone didnt intervene to help him it would be nice if someone who worked for government would take the time and say lets look at this and see if were doing the right thing it would be nice if they would remember the human factor here
723900 it was a combination of things financial and emotional my caregiving role all heaped themselves on me at the wrong time
723901 one day in a very bad mood mom told me to get rid of the cars in the driveway right away
723902 if someone says im dealing with a death were going to be reasonable and give them a 30 day extension
723903 but 1 475 thats a lot of months mourning not to be insensitive
723904 if youre telling me we had a mentally anguished individual and that inspectors made no attempts to get at that that can be considered
723905 there will have to be some serious evidence but if we were deaf to that point i would be willing to reconsider some of those fees
723906 provided a whole lot of excuses as to why he didnt comply
723907 theres really not too much that would allow us to reverse those charges
723908 if you were a criminal wed take care of the whole problem for you get you an attorney
723909 but if youre involved in civil litigation in jeopardy of losing your house or your family what we do is make you go out and find your own attorney
723910 if we gave people the help they needed near the beginning of their problem their problems wouldnt snowball the way they do

723927 the prophet did not order the killing of all the dogs for some are to be retained for hunting and watching he ordered to kill the jet black ones they might be more mischievous among them
723928 what is the trouble with them the people of medina how dogs are nuisances to them the citizens of medina he then permitted keeping of dogs for hunting and the protection of herds and for for the protection of cultivated land
723929 it is your duty to kill the jet black dog having two spots on the eyes for it is a devil

724178 my connections to national political figures including the reagans the money i believed i could raise much of which cindy and i would lend the campaign

724189 specifically sought out people who are going to play by those rules
724190 i dont know that wed get t shirts made that say it but we take pride in not leaking we take pride in not being a typical campaign

724222 he fancies himself a doctor today im probably going to have permanent nerve damage from him popping my shoulder back into place dont know why i couldnt wait for proper medical personnel and drugs
724223 we should be able to walk to the stargate as soon as i sort through our supplies
724224 i think i may have broken my leg when i landed something definitely popped im not sure i can ronon what are you doing damn it dont
724225 kneecaps dislocated i can put it back did it to myself once
724226 not so tight teyla you okay except for that bump and shiner
724227 i believe he has bruised or cracked ribs but otherwise he appears fine rodney dislocated his shoulder when he fell and we all received some small cuts nothing serious
724228 with ronon helping you we should be able to walk to the stargate
724229 it was nearing sunset when we left the ruins and we crashed at least five kilometers from the gate we wouldnt make it there before it was completely dark even if we had nods i dont want us wandering around a strange forest at night especially after that jurassic park wannabe attacked us if this planet has had pterodactyls evolve since the ancients left god knows what else is wandering around out there
724230 or giant mutant boars with really long tusks more likely in this environment or saber toothed monkeys
724231 thank you for that rodney itll be better to wait
724232 but i dont want anyone out there alone the gate was active when we crashed and the idc had been sent
724233 atlantis knows something happened to us even if they didnt get my radio call so well wait here until morning well head out if rescue hasnt reached us by then
724234 theres no power so no radio too many crystals are busted to attempt repairs and the beacons not working it never seems to survive a crash which makes it pretty damned useless if you ask me
724235 ronon see if you can get the rear hatch open youll need to use the manual release
724236 i thought you wished for us to stay in the jumper
724237 there is a large rock right behind the door it cannot be opened any further
724238 thats okay so long as we can squeeze out tell ronon to take his time
724239 im trying to ignore how much pain im in by keeping my mind occupied with something else thank you so much for reminding me of my agony
724240 there is something moving around but it stayed away from our light and we could not see it
724241 great well the hatch was going to have to be closed anyway rodney your turn
724242 well the hatch is going to be closed for the night so its now or never or until morning whichever comes first ronon will help you
724243 spending the day sweating on an over heated too heavy world crashing almost dying and then having to spend the night in an uncomfortable jumper while waiting for the marines to come rescue us again
724244 i would do anything for them including spending the last months helping to get the new settlement in order the homes set up the fields cleared so that crops could be planted going on trading trips to arrange for the supplies they need i do all of this gladly
724245 i know it takes a lot to get all those people settled in a new home and ready to be self sufficient i remember when you the athosians moved to the mainland perfectly understandable that you want to help to stay with them
724246 the last of the crops are being planted this week the animal pens are built and occupied and i am tired of being a farmer i am ready to move the last of my possessions back to atlantis and resume all of my duties there
724247 i am not abandoning them john it is much easier to step through the stargate than it was to find someone to fly me to the mainland halling maya and erak have assumed leadership roles truly they had already done so while we still lived on the world of the ancestors they are perfectly capable of guiding our people to prosperity on the new world i have been helping while things were so new and chaotic but everyone knew i would be returning to atlantis they know that my work in helping to defeat the wraith is important
724248 surely you understood that i was not going to remain on new athos permanently
724249 i had wondered why you hadnt moved all your things back to the city ive been waiting for you to come and tell me you were leaving the team
724250 i am sorry john i did not realize i should have made my intentions
724251 and still i should have been clearer about my plans
724252 could have fooled me you know im perfectly capable of walking on my own been doing it since i was eleven months old ow dont try to stuff me in there like a cork youll reinjure my arm sheppard youll never guess what is out there
724253 it must be this tight to keep your arm from moving rodney
724254 whatever thanks anyway where was i oh yeah it was a saber tooth rat
724255 it refers to the size of its teeth not its accessories
724256 seriously sheppard this thing is or rather was the size of those giant rodents they have down in south america
724257 god i am not looking forward to walking back to the jumper
724258 maybe ill just stay here and let the saber toothed rats eat me itd probably be less painful
724259 its not like your leg is broken couple weeks and youll be trying to keep up with me during our runs
724260 thanks for the sympathy i appreciate your concern ill be sure to return it when beckett is wrapping your ribs and forbidding any physical activity for the next month well see whos laughing then
724261 is it safe to stay here for a couple more minutes while my leg calms down
724262 should be i didnt hit that thing when i fired but its been scared off besides it has dinner now
724263 so teyla says shes ready to move the rest of her things back to the city
724264 probably means well be volunteered to help with the move you going to be around for it
724265 you wont have to cancel any plans at the settlement
724266 naw the schools open its up to kragan to make it a success now should do okay so long as he doesnt drink all the profits
724267 coulda sworn i had i know i told someone in atlantis oh yeah it was mckay
724268 you know people used to come to sateda to train and kragan was one of the best now that the settlement is doing so well hes decided to start taking pupils again
724269 id been wondering why you were spending so much time there i was beginning to suspect you were seeing someone
724270 i was but shes seeing someone else now she wanted me to stop fighting the wraith stay in the settlement like melena
724271 while you guys were back on earth after the ancestors made you leave ladon radim came to new athos he offered teyla and me jobs fighting the wraith said he knew wed never be content to be farmers
724272 we turned him down we couldnt work for the genii but he was right until all the wraith are dead im not going to be able to think of doing anything else
724273 lets hope we can accomplish it before were all too old to enjoy it
724274 bugs are starting to come in looking for the light source and a meal
724275 were coming were coming its not like i can move any faster unless you want to see a grown man cry

724316 this is a very important milestone for statoilhydro we have worked in nigeria for 15 years to achieve this remarkable project and its most satisfying to commence production
724317 at plateau production statoilhydro expects some 44 000 barrels of equity production a day from agbami a substantial contribution to our overall international output
724318 the second quarter result is primarily influenced by high oil and gas prices our record earnings are also coming as a result of operational focus contributing to high production
724319 our equity production increased 6 from the second quarter of 2007 mainly due to new capacity both on and outside the norwegian continental shelf ncs and higher gas offtake a number of our fields will undergo planned turnarounds in the next quarter in total we are on track to deliver on our 2008 production ambition
724320 we are also satisfied with our exploration results this year in the first half of 2008 we have completed a total of 49 exploration wells out of which 18 have been declared as discoveries for the full year we plan to drill at least 70 wells

724331 the fact is that were police forces there we understood that like last week when there was a violent incident when they the hikers came to them the bedouin with weapons we were ready because we knew that this was a place of confrontation they bedouin set up cameras and therefore the police were there
724332 if the police were there and watched the confrontation what was the problem of the police to stand openly and prevent them the hikers from passing and if it was not permitted to stop them the situation as i see it looks like an ambush somebody hides out like thieves in the night
724333 im not the one who decides there are officers above me who decide what is overt and what is concealed
724334 you agree that special police forces were in the area at that time
724335 they wore a police hat and they shouted that they are police and identified themselves as police some were in a hiding place and some waited on alert
724336 all of sudden policemen disguised as civilians but with police hats suddenly came out from behind a small hill and arrested the person who shot in the air and some of the armed escorts

724338 for me he is the best in the world and im convinced that hell do well in milan
724339 it would be an exaggeration to say that ronaldinho was barcelonas only problem as for me we win and lose as a team
724340 but everyones so focused on ronnie and great players that the media only ever talks about them congratulations came when we won the champions league but then there was a no confidence vote after a horrible final season
724341 weve also lost zambrotta and thuram but its true that they were two of the best in the world
724342 last season wasnt good and its true that they spent much of the year injured thats one of the problems in that footballers who are absent are accused
724343 now we have another cycle starting and what we have to do is focus i get along well with them and thank them for all theyve given us ive lost companions but ive gained friends outside
724344 etoo is a problem he is a great player who is training eagerly once again and if hes here hes not a problem
724345 yet we must always be clear that the most important thing above any player is the team
724346 some say that puyol is no longer the same and that id fallen the euros showed otherwise
724347 the truth is that im not affected by things that they say i try to do my job and i have a clear conscience because i give my all sometimes things dont go well i m the first to be angry in such situations and i am to improve
724348 we have to wait and see it looks very bad which is very disappointing
724349 i mean he is a great player a great person and we have to wait and see

724396 when people go on the internet they must systematically fill in forms asking for their name and address our idea was to memorise all that information and make it mobile so it could be accessed at any pc whether you were in an internet caf or at home
724397 a hotel site for instance will ask orange for your details and then orange will ask you if youre happy about sharing your details with the hotel
724398 since a contract exists a customer can ask at any time to have their personal data removed from the records of a company
724399 because everything linked if you change your address you just change it with your identity provider not with every website you use

724408 il grido di allarme della confconsumatori sullo stato di abbandono della stazione ferroviaria di foligno va raccolto e se questa citt piange la vicina spoleto per le stesse ragioni non ride
724409 giustamente denunciato dalla confconsumatori estensibile a quasi tutti gli scali ferroviari dellumbria
724410 il caso di foligno sottolinea tracchegiani non un episodio localizzato ma il sintomo chiaro di una grave malattia e cio del fatto che le ferrovie nelle sue due componenti trenitalia e rfi si stanno disimpegnando nei confronti della nostra regione
724411 ormai in stato di abbandono anche se si tratta di una vasta superficie raccordata ai binari della linea ancona roma e alla ss 3 per cui utilizzando anche gli immobili che sono in stato di buona conservazione rappresentava il sito ideale per lintermodalit cio lo scambio di merci tra strada e ferrovia
724412 abbandonate da una politica ferroviaria incapace di sfruttarne le potenzialit affermano ma anche da scelte sconsiderate della regione umbria che nel maldestro tentativo di imporre la fcu ha favorito il disimpegno delle fs nei confronti degli scali umbri
724413 pu tollerare che ormai quasi tutte le stazioni ferroviarie siano prive di presenziamento che spoleto citt darte accolga i turisti con un impianto lasciato in mano a frange di emarginazione e al degrado e come si pu accettare che assisi capitale mondiale della spiritualit offra uno scalo ferroviario i cui giardini e sale dattesa sono state trasformate in campeggi e alloggi per vagabondi con tutti gli episodi di criminalit che ne conseguono come i continui furti al bar e alle biglietterie automatiche per non parlare poi aggiungono di ellera scalo posto al centro della pi grande zona commerciale dellumbria e che rappresentato da un decrepito vano di accesso e da marciapiedi impercorribili per i rovi e le erbacce ma il governo regionale che sottoscrive con fs laccordo di programma deve essere in grado di esigere una corretta gestione degli impianti ferroviari in quanto la qualit del servizio offerto comincia proprio nella stazione impegnando le ferrovie a ristabilirne il presenziamento favorendo anche lutilizzo dei locali di stazione non strategici ai fini della circolazione dei treni per attivit commerciali o del mondo dellassociazionismo
724414 la regione conclude tracchegiani deve saper anteporre linteresse dei cittadini e lo sviluppo territoriale agli opportunismi politici e non permettere che aziende come le ferrovie dello stato che utilizzano fondi pubblici rinuncino alla loro componente di socialit per imporre condizioni capestro a chi vuole aprire unattivit commerciale in stazione preferendo con una devastante logica di mercato guardare agli utili piuttosto che al servizio offerto al cittadino

724423 i believe fdc faces an exciting period in the next three years under waldens leadership he brings a clear vision and principled commitment to an urgent task ahead the need to craft an alternative national economic platform that challenges neo liberal globalization
724424 we have paid our debts many times over yet owing to the tyranny of global finance we will never be able to leave the treadmill of debt repayment if we stick to unfair rules that mainly serve the interests of creditors
724425 in their view that is the only way to continue to access international capital markets
724426 but this is the bankrupt logic that has led to debt being piled on debt we have not really escaped the infernal logic of contracting new debt to pay off old debt meantime our total debt mounts dangerously and brings us closer to the edge of bankruptcy
724427 as a result of kirchners successful campaign to drastically reduce debt repayments argentina has been growing at 10 per cent of gdp for each of the last four years the result partly of the fact that money that would otherwise leave the country for debt servicing has been channeled into investment in the domestic economy
724428 some of its biggest borrowers have walked away from it and since the funds budget stemmed in great part from repayments from these borrowers the imf is today facing both a crisis of credibility and a budgetary crisis it is in real trouble
724429 the governments policies toward its creditors continue to be the old policy of being a model debtor that was initiated by president corazon aquino in the 1980s the conditions for a successful break with the old and the crafting of a new bold policy of unilaterally writing down the philippine debt are better today than they have ever been

724795 it was ok for him he didnt have a wife or children to worry about
724796 the screen was filled with screaming orphans innocent victims of the tsunami
724797 im giving up the money after thinking about the years i spent in an orphanage when i saw the children crying on the tv and thought about those who will end up in orphanages i decided to make the donation the same children have no clothing on their backs and i realised theyve been told that no mummy or daddy will be coming back to get them i thought what the hell can i do and decided to place the lump sum with one charity at least i received three meals and a roof over my head every night
724798 where after all do universal human rights begin in small places close to home so close and so small that they cannot be seen on any map of the world yet they are the world of the individual person the neighborhood he lives in the school or college he attends the factory farm or office where he works such are the places where every man woman and child seeks equal justice equal opportunity equal dignity without discrimination unless these rights have meaning there they have little meaning anywhere

724814 the fact he is prepared to forward what is supposedly a private and confidential text message reinforces that he has gone off the rails in my opinion
724815 i got a response but sonny wouldnt want that response printed and im not going to give it to you the fact that he is prepared to toss that up to a paper i think is a pretty ordinary thing to do
724816 on the back of what he has done it confirms there is something wrong with his head
724817 i was certainly aware of his interest in sonny and he was here doing the sly tana was upfront with me
724818 he said ive spoken to sonnys management group and he made sure to keep me in the loop of what was going on
724819 if sonny hadnt been in a position he was in im not too sure he would have made that move to toulon
724820 had a few other areas in his life been more settled we probably wouldnt be talking today about it
724821 i could sense his frustration with a few things when we talked
724822 as a friend those issues are between him and i and thats how they should stay
724823 im not saying what he did was the right thing to do but he is a young guy and we have to look at exactly why he made this decision
724824 i want to reassure people that national will not worsen this situation we will be careful stewards of the economy and of taxpayers money

724854 every time a potential customer tried to bow me out without buying i saw that child standing there in the old mill her big eyes glaring in defiance and i said to myself ive got to make this sale the majority of all the sales i have made were made after people had said no
724855 that experience was a blessing in disguise it taught me to keep on keeping on no matter how hard the going may be a lesson i needed to learn before i could succeed in anything

724924 estos partidos siempre son as no tienen car cter amistoso porque hay mucho prestigio cada uno quiere hacer un buen papel ganando a un equipo importante por eso and bamos con mucho cuidado para no correr riesgo con los jugadores de la selecci n porque son partidos serios
724925 son rivales con los que hay que hacer un esfuerzo a adido porque no son de tanto nombre como otros m s conocidos es un arma de doble filo pero la concentraci n ser como si fuera un rival de nombre con la intenci n de dejar sentenciada la eliminatoria cuanto antes

724932 he assured me that this isnt the real republican party unfortunately the dirty trick wing has taken control
724933 supported legislation to increase the amount of tax dollars he receives for practicing medicine
724934 at the same time page voted to cut over 21 million from missouris medicaid program the same medicaid program that republicans voted to cut
724935 on august 5th lets show sam page that providing health care to the neediest of missourians should take priority over lining his own pocket
724936 my reaction is that this is an unprecedented sign of weakness for a republican incumbent to try to choose his opponent by attacking a candidate in the democratic primary
724937 he not only cut services for 400 000 people but now hes going after the doctors who take care of the poor
724938 it looks like something a democrat would be aiming at page
724939 sam page has to get used to being held accountable for his deeds and his actions
724940 everywhere hes spoken hes attacked the lieutenant governor and hes run ads about the blunt kinder medicaid cuts were just pointing out problems with sam pages record if hes going to attack us with distortions were going to respond
724941 oui alors jai fait comme a et puis comme a
724942 et bien non ce nest quun dessert de faignante jassume
724943 ive been looking so long at these pictures of you that i almost believe that theyre real

724945 i i mean oh god sarah please i oh god i didnt i want
724946 youre beautiful youre the most beautiful thing ive ever seen
724947 with breasts like yours id think youd hear that all the time at home
724948 oh god i love youre hair it smells like nothing ive ever known before and it will stay with me forever every time i go down the shampoo isle i smell every bottle to try and find your scent i dream of that smell
724949 youre going to like this just let me love you

724955 let me hold you inside of me please im aching for you oh please
724956 i also have in my mind that seemingly wealthy but most terribly impoverished class of all who have accumulated dross but know not how to use it or get rid of it and thus have forged their own golden or silver fetters
724957 roll back government and corporate encroachment on individual freedom by allowing information to flow past the barriers erected by totalitarian or authoritarian governments and around the gatekeepers of the mainstream media
724958 just as a trusted computing system will load neither programs nor data files without a validated certificate whose signature matches their contents neither will the secure internet transfer any document in any standard protocol without such a certificate accompanying it
724959 a documents certificate its imprimatur identifies the person individual or legal entity responsible for its publication provides a signature which permits verifying its contents have not been corrupted or subsequently modified and identifies the document registry which granted the imprimatur and which on demand will validate it and confirm that it has not been revoked
724960 more than any innovation in the last century the internet empowers individuals to spontaneously teach learn explore communicate form communities and collaborate measured relatively this individual empowerment comes at the expense of the power of governments and large commercial enterprises thereby reversing a trend toward concentration of power more than a century old which has acted to reduce free citizens and productive individuals to mere subjects and consumers

724975 its great bringing my movie to a place that i feel familiar

724979 she does so much out of the glare of the lights to make the world a better place

724985 the administration plans to tighten the leash around your throats until you choke but were lovers of freedom and were opposed to it so well tighten it only a couple of inches
724986 however those numbers werent discussed we got into a different discussion in genetics
724987 the defendant the u s in this case cannot go forward with delisting until there is a full hearing on the merits
724988 they picked and chose where they wanted to go to court i think you might wonder why missoula montana
724989 most likely because they wanted to be before a particular judge in missoula
724990 the judge basically picked that one thing and hung his hat on it
724991 he also ignored the federal governments expert who said that exchange was occurring
724992 we think theres ample exchange 8 to 22 percent of the wolves are outliers theyre moving around
724993 i attended the hearing in missoula when the governments position was presented and that option was presented in oral argument
724994 that means that the department idfg was hand in glove with fish and wildlife service to bring the wolves into the state
724995 yet you people know the ramifications of wild wolves on our big game herds
724996 using the 8 000 per head elk figure that we came up with when we did the collaborative with sen crapo theres 80 000 worth of dead elk within two miles of my home
724997 the last i heard the federal government couldnt take anything without just compensation
724998 most of us on this commission are just like you folks were elk hunters
724999 they trump anything we can do in idaho under state law
725000 we worked diligently to try to get a plan that we could get u s fish and wildlife service to approve so we could take over
725001 not only are we also being deprived of hunting opportunities just as you are we get to hear people who accuse us of introducing the wolves and not trying to control it
725002 its a real worry eventually you reach a status quo between the wolves that start dying off because theres too many of them
725003 i hope we dont take it to that limit because there wont be a whole lot of elk left by the time that happens
725004 i am right now running into people in the woods who are actively hunting wolves
725005 judge molloy did us a big favor and the reason i think he did us a big favor is because there is now a line drawn in the sand
725006 i dont see it ever getting delisted to the point that well have a hunting season weve already got groups within the state of idaho who are wanting wolf viewing areas
725007 i was injured by the killing of wolf253m because i will never be able to see this well known wolf again
725008 in the 1994 agreement suzanne stone of defenders of wildlife agreed to the 100 wolf numbers per state and now they want many times more
725009 this is not the end of the road its the beginning of the road
725010 my counsel is we need to follow that review through to its end
725011 dari rm3 anda boleh menjadikan ia banyak jika kita sama sama jujur dan ikhlas ianya tidak mustahil jika hari ini anda tolong saya insya allah di hari yang lain orang akan tolong anda pula
725012 we will hold a reassessment based on the rocket and sniper fire along the border as well as the humanitarian situation in gaza
725013 we want to send a clear message to hamas but at the same time we do not wish to get into clashes with the international community
725014 four female teachers and 17 pupils were wounded including five very young boys
725015 there is a major risk of a total collapse of all the infrastructure
725016 the blockade measures have an enormous human cost and we have asked israel to immediately lift all retaliatory measures
725017 the population finds itself hostage to this conflict and is suffering the most serious consequences
725018 many medicines are lacking and need to be restocked otherwise hospitals will have to close
725019 we are very concerned about the situation of children in gaza children are always the victims in times of conflict
725020 cowley later called shock a momentary pause in the act of death a process that once set in motion was irreversible
725021 if you are critically injured you have less than 60 minutes to survive you might not die right then it may be three days or two weeks later but something has happened in your body that is irreparable
725022 in 1970 cowley expanded his dream feeling that not a single patient should be denied the state of the art treatment available at his trauma center in baltimore
725023 he envisioned a statewide system of care funded by the state of maryland available to anyone who needed it
725024 the father of many of the things we do today
725025 the fire had been contained by the activation of a single sprinkler head wfr crews quickly suppressed any remaining fire and ventilated residual smoke from the building the fire appears to have started on an exterior skylight and is being treated as suspicious
725026 he used to own a restaurant in north vancouver called the vault on lower lonsdale
725027 it was a very trendy place i used to frequent it quite a bit and got to know him quite well
725028 he was a successful restaurateur back in the late 80s and early 90s i dont know things fell apart somehow somewhere something took a wrong turn
725029 i was a little surprised i saw him about a year ago here and he looked pretty rough i thought maybe he had a stroke or something i didnt talk to him very much then i read this
725030 he was a good guy happy joyful sort of guy it was a pub restaurant he owned and i dont really remember him having any alcohol type problems but times change and things happened
725031 there was no cooperation from him or a friend of his now we are pursuing the line of questions again in light of his death hopefully that will change their attitude with respect to their cooperation
725032 thats not true at all were just putting back up a couple that blew down in the last storm
725033 and its not just us who own billboards there there are three or four organizations everybody thinks weve got them all but thats not the case
725034 were looking at mega types of developments its not going to be too long before were going to be looking at high rises and thatll be a new feature
725035 i think the owner of any major sports franchise has two jobs first its to work hard to win a championship year after year and second to be the caretaker of the franchise in the community

725038 she was treated by police and bc ambulance and transported to clearwater hospital the victims son was arrested and taken into custody
725039 at this point there is nothing to indicate that drugs or alcohol were factors we know that the woman and her son both lived at the same house but we dont know what caused this incident
725040 the woman is of course unable to give us a statement at this point and her son is exercising his right to remain silent he has spoken with legal counsel but not with the police yet

725049 people came to visit me in my hospital room in nairobi and one of the pastors was talking to me about forgiving the people who hurt me
725050 i knew just in my mind that my words were important for my own ears to hear
725051 i did it with totally no emotion whatsoever and i just about forgot the important thing so i said hang on ive got to do something else so then i went through all of them again forgiving them for what they did to my husband and then i broke all up and started crying from my very guts but i said it
725052 if we dont forgive then its like poison in our own systems were just like an emotional slave to the people who have hurt us
725053 there are so many so many women who have gone through what ive gone through there
725054 theyve had nobody to hold them theyve had nobody to tell their story to them and theyve had nobody to cry with

725060 4 yet because of false brothers secretly brought in who slipped in to spy out our freedom that we have in christ jesus so that they might bring us into slavery 5 to them we did not yield in submission even for a moment so that the truth of the gospel might be preserved for you
725061 11 but when cephas came to antioch i opposed him to his face because he stood condemned
725062 if you though a jew live like a gentile and not like a jew how can you force the gentiles to live like jews
725063 that their conduct was not in step with the truth of the gospel
725064 for freedom christ has set us free stand firm therefore and do not submit again to a yoke of slavery 2 look i paul say to you that if you accept circumcision christ will be of no advantage to you 3 i testify again to every man who accepts circumcision that he is obligated to keep the whole law 4 you are severed from christ you who would be justified 1 by the law you have fallen away from grace 5 for through the spirit by faith we ourselves eagerly wait for the hope of righteousness 6 for in christ jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision counts for anything but only faith working through love

725066 the fishing rod fishing has been good over the past two weeks as evidenced by the shore
725067 though realizing that many other factors were involved i reasoned that if we could get a freer flow of trade freer in the sense of fewer discriminations and obstructions so that one country would not be deadly jealous of another and the living standards of all countries might rise thereby eliminating the economic dissatisfaction that breeds war we might have a reasonable chance for lasting peace

725210 hein kuun katsotaan ik n kuin peilaavan my s loppuvuoden kehityst
725211 you have to talk about what you know what makes sense to you and when youre talking about something that you really do have experience with and talking about your honest feeling thats what people are going to respond to
725212 thats my style i say things that are left of center im sure some people are really shocked and im sure there are many people who are appalled hopefully those arent the people who are coming to see me perform
725213 it had to do with the very specific characteristics in the dna of the letters and what was in bruces labs
725214 no rules so we could do the best and most compelling approaches
725215 clearly the most expensive case fbis ever undertaken and the most scientifically compelling case
725216 it was under a rock we got two of them
725217 we tell the enemies of god that god has saved those who will be even more painful for you
725218 as abu khabab has gone he left behind with gods grace a generation of faithful students who will make you suffer the worst torture and avenge him and his brothers
725219 a big name does not mean a big impact on the ground
725220 the bottom line is that those people are replaceable the organization has developed in such a way that it can survive and fill in any gap even if osama bin laden was to die
725221 al qaida might be facing setbacks in iraq but not in afghanistan and any loss will appear to its fighters as a triumph against the enemy not a defeat
725222 we will severely punish airlines which experience aircraft occupations and other incidents as a result of service reasons which originate with the airline
725223 if there is bad weather for example we will tell the media to publicize it so that passengers can be informed ahead of time and avoid long waits at airports due to the weather
725224 you cannot persuade me there are not more disturbed or disgruntled persons with a political agenda in such a large group
725225 people given these kinds of responsibilities with this kind of power at their fingertips we have to make sure that they are not likely to do harm to others or misuse that authority be it intentionally or be it because of some mental problem
725226 these kinds of situations cry out for reexamination of our standards
725227 been adjudicated as a mental defective or been committed to any mental institution
725228 hiding it from your co workers that would have been very very difficult
725229 universities are pretty sloppy its an academic setting not a security setting
725230 youre basically going to scare off any scientist from wanting to work in this field if it becomes even more stringent
725231 it is a balance its a policy decision about how stringent we want to be
725232 one of the complaints by people who work in safety and security is they cant get the time of day from people running the labs
725233 are viewed as deeply offensive by a lot of scientists as if their patriotism is being questioned
725234 though several agencies have a need to know no one agency knows the number and location of these labs in the united states

725246 starting off with vocals that reach back to guitarist alex dunhams previous band hoover as well as original hardcore like black flag abilene embarks on a strange jagged trip of an album that recasts shifting jazz as post hardcore
725247 were reaching the tenth anniversary of a very important record one where there probably wont be a special deluxe re release one that probably wont even get that much attention hoovers full length album
725248 abilene calls into question the darker elements encountered in life coupled with a positive aspect consequently both facets bind the music to a place centered on intensity and comfort abilene is essentially about ambient soundscapes
725249 formed in 1998 and originally consisting of alex dunham on guitar and vocals scott adamson behind drums and bassist craig ackerman abilene recorded and released a six song slow burner on the now defunct slowdime label before writing and recording two guns twin arrows fred erskine june of 44 hoover joined to play trumpet and the band evolved musically into something more dense equally brooding yet still ambient and subtle in nature abilenes members have a prestigious musical past which has included such bands as june of 44 hoover lustre king chisel drill hammer just a fire radio flyer and regulator watts scott adamson drums alex dunham guitar voice fred erskine trumpet craig ackerman bass riyl hoover the sorts fugazi lungfish johnboy 90 day men and karate
725250 abilenes second full length and first with fred erskine is the album for which some critics pined when reviewing its much more mellow spacious debut
725251 chicago based abilene offer a brooding dark and well constructed album incorporating the expected instruments alongside a more unexpected trumpet advantage
725252 and i believe fundamentally that in 1980 the election was all about ronald reagan
725253 people did not want another four years of jimmy carter but they were not clear or comfortable for much of the way with whether reagan got over the bar of acceptability to be commander in chief and president of the united states

725424 11 and jesus which is called justus who are of the circumcision these only are my fellowworkers unto the kingdom of god which have been a comfort unto me
725425 5 which is a manifest token of the righteous judgment of god that ye may be counted worthy of the kingdom of god for which ye also suffer
725426 12 that they all might be damned who believed not the truth but had pleasure in unrighteousness
725427 1 i charge thee therefore before god and the lord jesus christ who shall judge the quick and the dead at his appearing and his kingdom
725428 18 and the lord shall deliver me from every evil work and will preserve me unto his heavenly kingdom to whom be glory for ever and ever amen
725429 5 hearken my beloved brethren hath not god chosen the poor of this world rich in faith and heirs of the kingdom which he hath promised to them that love him
725430 9 i john who also am your brother and companion in tribulation and in the kingdom and patience of jesus christ was in the isle that is called patmos for the word of god and for the testimony of jesus christ
725431 20 which he wrought in christ when he raised him from the dead and set him at his own right hand in the heavenly places 21 far above all principality and power and might and dominion and every name that is named not only in this world but also in that which is to come 22 and hath put all things under his feet and gave him to be the head over all things to the church
725432 22 who is gone into heaven and is on the right hand of god angels and authorities and powers being made subject unto him
725433 36 therefore let all the house of israel know assuredly that god hath made the same jesus whom ye have crucified both lord and christ 37 now when they heard this they were pricked in their heart and said unto peter and to the rest of the apostles men and brethren what shall we do 38 then peter said unto them repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of jesus christ for the remission of sins and ye shall receive the gift of the holy ghost 39 for the promise is unto you and to your children and to all that are afar off even as many as the lord our god shall call 40 and with many other words did he testify and exhort saying save yourselves from this untoward generation 41 then they that gladly received his word were baptized and the same day there were added unto them about three thousand souls
725434 47 praising god and having favour with all the people and the lord added to the church daily such as should be saved
725435 13 who hath delivered us from the power of darkness and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear son
725436 9 i john who also am your brother and companion in tribulation and in the kingdom and patience of jesus christ was in the isle that is called patmos for the word of god and for the testimony of jesus christ
725437 22 confirming the souls of the disciples and exhorting them to continue in the faith and that we must through much tribulation enter into the kingdom of god
725438 10 wherefore the rather brethren give diligence to make your calling and election sure for if ye do these things ye shall never fall 11 for so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our lord and saviour jesus christ
725439 18 and jesus came and spake unto them saying all power is given unto me in heaven and in earth 19 go ye therefore and teach all nations baptizing them in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy ghost 20 teaching them to observe all things whatsoever i have commanded you and lo i am with you always even unto the end of the world amen
725440 all authority has been given to me in heaven and on earth
725441 21 not every one that saith unto me lord lord shall enter into the kingdom of heaven but he that doeth the will of my father which is in heaven 22 many will say to me in that day lord lord have we not prophesied in thy name and in thy name have cast out devils and in thy name done many wonderful works 23 and then will i profess unto them i never knew you depart from me ye that work iniquity
725442 13 who hath delivered us from the power of darkness and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear son

725453 12 now when jesus had heard that john was cast into prison he departed into galilee 13 and leaving nazareth he came and dwelt in capernaum which is upon the sea coast in the borders of zabulon and nephthalim 14 that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by esaias the prophet saying 15 the land of zabulon and the land of nephthalim by the way of the sea beyond jordan galilee of the gentiles 16 the people which sat in darkness saw great light and to them which sat in the region and shadow of death light is sprung up 17 from that time jesus began to preach and to say repent for the kingdom of heaven is at hand
725454 1 nevertheless the dimness shall not be such as was in her vexation when at the first he lightly afflicted the land of zebulun and the land of naphtali and afterward did more grievously afflict her by the way of the sea beyond jordan in galilee of the nations 2 the people that walked in darkness have seen a great light they that dwell in the land of the shadow of death upon them hath the light shined
725455 23 and jesus went about all galilee teaching in their synagogues and preaching the gospel of the kingdom and healing all manner of sickness and all manner of disease among the people
725456 17 from that time jesus began to preach and to say repent for the kingdom of heaven is at hand
725457 2 and saying repent ye for the kingdom of heaven is at hand
725458 13 but go ye and learn what that meaneth i will have mercy and not sacrifice for i am not come to call the righteous but sinners to repentance
725459 9 now i rejoice not that ye were made sorry but that ye sorrowed to repentance for ye were made sorry after a godly manner that ye might receive damage by us in nothing 10 for godly sorrow worketh repentance to salvation not to be repented of but the sorrow of the world worketh death
725460 involves both a turning from sin and a turning to god
725461 46 and said unto them thus it is written and thus it behooved christ to suffer and to rise from the dead the third day 47 and that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations beginning at jerusalem
725462 30 and the times of this ignorance god winked at but now commandeth all men every where to repent
725463 20 but shewed first unto them of damascus and at jerusalem and throughout all the coasts of judaea and then to the gentiles that they should repent and turn to god and do works meet for repentance
725464 20 but shewed first unto them of damascus and at jerusalem and throughout all the coasts of judaea and then to the gentiles that they should repent and turn to god and do works meet for repentance
725465 and saying repent ye for the kingdom of heaven is at hand
725466 23 and jesus went about all galilee teaching in their synagogues and preaching the gospel of the kingdom and healing all manner of sickness and all manner of disease among the people
725467 3 blessed are the poor in spirit for theirs is the kingdom of heaven
725468 10 blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness sake for theirs is the kingdom of heaven
725469 19 whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments and shall teach men so he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven but whosoever shall do and teach them the same shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven 20 for i say unto you that except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and pharisees ye shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven
725470 33 but seek ye first the kingdom of god and his righteousness and all these things shall be added unto you
725471 21 not every one that saith unto me lord lord shall enter into the kingdom of heaven but he that doeth the will of my father which is in heaven
725472 24 another parable put he forth unto them saying the kingdom of heaven is likened unto a man which sowed good seed in his field

725474 33 another parable spake he unto them the kingdom of heaven is like unto leaven which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal till the whole was leavened
725475 44 again the kingdom of heaven is like unto treasure hid in a field the which when a man hath found he hideth and for joy thereof goeth and selleth all that he hath and buyeth that field
725476 45 again the kingdom of heaven is like unto a merchant man seeking goodly pearls
725477 47 again the kingdom of heaven is like unto a net that was cast into the sea and gathered of every kind
725478 7 and as ye go preach saying the kingdom of heaven is at hand
725479 17 from that time jesus began to preach and to say repent for the kingdom of heaven is at hand
725480 14 now after that john was put in prison jesus came into galilee preaching the gospel of the kingdom of god 15 and saying the time is fulfilled and the kingdom of god is at hand repent ye and believe the gospel
725481 3 blessed are the poor in spirit for theirs is the kingdom of heaven
725482 20 and he lifted up his eyes on his disciples and said blessed be ye poor for yours is the kingdom of god
725483 31 another parable put he forth unto them saying the kingdom of heaven is like to a grain of mustard seed which a man took and sowed in his field
725484 30 and he said whereunto shall we liken the kingdom of god or with what comparison shall we compare it 31 it is like a grain of mustard seed which when it is sown in the earth is less than all the seeds that be in the earth
725485 10 thy kingdom come thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven
725486 36 jesus answered my kingdom is not of this world if my kingdom were of this world then would my servants fight that i should not be delivered to the jews but now is my kingdom not from hence
725487 17 for the kingdom of god is not meat and drink but righteousness and peace and joy in the holy ghost
725488 18 and i say also unto thee that thou art peter and upon this rock i will build my church and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it
725489 13 who hath delivered us from the power of darkness and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear son
725490 12 that ye would walk worthy of god who hath called you unto his kingdom and glory
725491 34 then shall the king say unto them on his right hand come ye blessed of my father inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world
725492 50 now this i say brethren that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of god neither doth corruption inherit incorruption
725493 18 and the lord shall deliver me from every evil work and will preserve me unto his heavenly kingdom to whom be glory for ever and ever amen
725494 10 wherefore the rather brethren give diligence to make your calling and election sure for if ye do these things ye shall never fall 11 for so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our lord and saviour jesus christ
725495 1 and when the day of pentecost was fully come they were all with one accord in one place 2 and suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind and it filled all the house where they were sitting 3 and there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as of fire and it sat upon each of them 4 and they were all filled with the holy ghost and began to speak with other tongues as the spirit gave them utterance 5 and there were dwelling at jerusalem jews devout men out of every nation under heaven 6 now when this was noised abroad the multitude came together and were confounded because that every man heard them speak in his own language 7 and they were all amazed and marvelled saying one to another behold are not all these which speak galilaeans 8 and how hear we every man in our own tongue wherein we were born 9 parthians and medes and elamites and the dwellers in mesopotamia and in judaea and cappadocia in pontus and asia 10 phrygia and pamphylia in egypt and in the parts of libya about cyrene and strangers of rome jews and proselytes 11 cretes and arabians we do hear them speak in our tongues the wonderful works of god 12 and they were all amazed and were in doubt saying one to another what meaneth this 13 others mocking said these men are full of new wine 14 but peter standing up with the eleven lifted up his voice and said unto them ye men of judaea and all ye that dwell at jerusalem be this known unto you and hearken to my words 15 for these are not drunken as ye suppose seeing it is but the third hour of the day 16 but this is that which was spoken by the prophet joel 17 and it shall come to pass in the last days saith god i will pour out of my spirit upon all flesh and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy and your young men shall see visions and your old men shall dream dreams 18 and on my servants and on my handmaidens i will pour out in those days of my spirit and they shall prophesy 19 and i will shew wonders in heaven above and signs in the earth beneath blood and fire and vapour of smoke 20 the sun shall be turned into darkness and the moon into blood before the great and notable day of the lord come 21 and it shall come to pass that whosoever shall call on the name of the lord shall be saved 22 ye men of israel hear these words jesus of nazareth a man approved of god among you by miracles and wonders and signs which god did by him in the midst of you as ye yourselves also know 23 him being delivered by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of god ye have taken and by wicked hands have crucified and slain 24 whom god hath raised up having loosed the pains of death because it was not possible that he should be holden of it 25 for david speaketh concerning him i foresaw the lord always before my face for he is on my right hand that i should not be moved 26 therefore did my heart rejoice and my tongue was glad moreover also my flesh shall rest in hope 27 because thou wilt not leave my soul in hell neither wilt thou suffer thine holy one to see corruption 28 thou hast made known to me the ways of life thou shalt make me full of joy with thy countenance 29 men and brethren let me freely speak unto you of the patriarch david that he is both dead and buried and his sepulchre is with us unto this day 30 therefore being a prophet and knowing that god had sworn with an oath to him that of the fruit of his loins according to the flesh he would raise up christ to sit on his throne 31 he seeing this before spake of the resurrection of christ that his soul was not left in hell neither his flesh did see corruption 32 this jesus hath god raised up whereof we all are witnesses 33 therefore being by the right hand of god exalted and having received of the father the promise of the holy ghost he hath shed forth this which ye now see and hear 34 for david is not ascended into the heavens but he saith himself the lord said unto my lord sit thou on my right hand 36 therefore let all the house of israel know assuredly that god hath made the same jesus whom ye have crucified both lord and christ 37 now when they heard this they were pricked in their heart and said unto peter and to the rest of the apostles men and brethren what shall we do 38 then peter said unto them repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of jesus christ for the remission of sins and ye shall receive the gift of the holy ghost 39 for the promise is unto you and to your children and to all that are afar off even as many as the lord our god shall call 40 and with many other words did he testify and exhort saying save yourselves from this untoward generation 41 then they that gladly received his word were baptized and the same day there were added unto them about three thousand souls 42 and they continued stedfastly in the apostles doctrine and fellowship and in breaking of bread and in prayers 43 and fear came upon every soul and many wonders and signs were done by the apostles 44 and all that believed were together and had all things common 45 and sold their possessions and goods and parted them to all men as every man had need 46 and they continuing daily with one accord in the temple and breaking bread from house to house did eat their meat with gladness and singleness of heart 47 praising god and having favour with all the people and the lord added to the church daily such as should be saved
725496 new heaven and a new earth in which righteousness dwells
725497 1 this second epistle beloved i now write unto you in both which i stir up your pure minds by way of remembrance 2 that ye may be mindful of the words which were spoken before by the holy prophets and of the commandment of us the apostles of the lord and saviour 3 knowing this first that there shall come in the last days scoffers walking after their own lusts 4 and saying where is the promise of his coming for since the fathers fell asleep all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation 5 for this they willingly are ignorant of that by the word of god the heavens were of old and the earth standing out of the water and in the water 6 whereby the world that then was being overflowed with water perished 7 but the heavens and the earth which are now by the same word are kept in store reserved unto fire against the day of judgment and perdition of ungodly men 8 but beloved be not ignorant of this one thing that one day is with the lord as a thousand years and a thousand years as one day 9 the lord is not slack concerning his promise as some men count slackness but is longsuffering to us ward not willing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance 10 but the day of the lord will come as a thief in the night in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise and the elements shall melt with fervent heat the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up 11 seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved what manner of persons ought ye to be in all holy conversation and godliness 12 looking for and hasting unto the coming of the day of god wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved and the elements shall melt with fervent heat 13 nevertheless we according to his promise look for new heavens and a new earth wherein dwelleth righteousness 14 wherefore beloved seeing that ye look for such things be diligent that ye may be found of him in peace without spot and blameless 15 and account that the longsuffering of our lord is salvation even as our beloved brother paul also according to the wisdom given unto him hath written unto you 16 as also in all his epistles speaking in them of these things in which are some things hard to be understood which they that are unlearned and unstable wrest as they do also the other scriptures unto their own destruction 17 ye therefore beloved seeing ye know these things before beware lest ye also being led away with the error of the wicked fall from your own stedfastness 18 but grow in grace and in the knowledge of our lord and saviour jesus christ to him be glory both now and for ever amen
725498 1 and i saw a new heaven and a new earth for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away and there was no more sea 2 and i john saw the holy city new jerusalem coming down from god out of heaven prepared as a bride adorned for her husband 3 and i heard a great voice out of heaven saying behold the tabernacle of god is with men and he will dwell with them and they shall be his people and god himself shall be with them and be their god 4 and god shall wipe away all tears from their eyes and there shall be no more death neither sorrow nor crying neither shall there be any more pain for the former things are passed away 5 and he that sat upon the throne said behold i make all things new and he said unto me write for these words are true and faithful 6 and he said unto me it is done i am alpha and omega the beginning and the end i will give unto him that is athirst of the fountain of the water of life freely 7 he that overcometh shall inherit all things and i will be his god and he shall be my son 8 but the fearful and unbelieving and the abominable and murderers and whoremongers and sorcerers and idolaters and all liars shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone which is the second death 9 and there came unto me one of the seven angels which had the seven vials full of the seven last plagues and talked with me saying come hither i will shew thee the bride the lambs wife 10 and he carried me away in the spirit to a great and high mountain and shewed me that great city the holy jerusalem descending out of heaven from god 11 having the glory of god and her light was like unto a stone most precious even like a jasper stone clear as crystal 12 and had a wall great and high and had twelve gates and at the gates twelve angels and names written thereon which are the names of the twelve tribes of the children of israel 13 on the east three gates on the north three gates on the south three gates and on the west three gates 14 and the wall of the city had twelve foundations and in them the names of the twelve apostles of the lamb 15 and he that talked with me had a golden reed to measure the city and the gates thereof and the wall thereof 16 and the city lieth foursquare and the length is as large as the breadth and he measured the city with the reed twelve thousand furlongs the length and the breadth and the height of it are equal 17 and he measured the wall thereof an hundred and forty and four cubits according to the measure of a man that is of the angel 18 and the building of the wall of it was of jasper and the city was pure gold like unto clear glass 19 and the foundations of the wall of the city were garnished with all manner of precious stones the first foundation was jasper the second sapphire the third a chalcedony the fourth an emerald 20 the fifth sardonyx the sixth sardius the seventh chrysolyte the eighth beryl the ninth a topaz the tenth a chrysoprasus the eleventh a jacinth the twelfth an amethyst 21 and the twelve gates were twelve pearls every several gate was of one pearl and the street of the city was pure gold as it were transparent glass 22 and i saw no temple therein for the lord god almighty and the lamb are the temple of it 23 and the city had no need of the sun neither of the moon to shine in it for the glory of god did lighten it and the lamb is the light thereof 24 and the nations of them which are saved shall walk in the light of it and the kings of the earth do bring their glory and honour into it 25 and the gates of it shall not be shut at all by day for there shall be no night there 26 and they shall bring the glory and honour of the nations into it 27 and there shall in no wise enter into it any thing that defileth neither whatsoever worketh abomination or maketh a lie but they which are written in the lambs book of life
725499 1 and he shewed me a pure river of water of life clear as crystal proceeding out of the throne of god and of the lamb 2 in the midst of the street of it and on either side of the river was there the tree of life which bare twelve manner of fruits and yielded her fruit every month and the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations 3 and there shall be no more curse but the throne of god and of the lamb shall be in it and his servants shall serve him 4 and they shall see his face and his name shall be in their foreheads 5 and there shall be no night there and they need no candle neither light of the sun for the lord god giveth them light and they shall reign for ever and ever 6 and he said unto me these sayings are faithful and true and the lord god of the holy prophets sent his angel to shew unto his servants the things which must shortly be done 7 behold i come quickly blessed is he that keepeth the sayings of the prophecy of this book 8 and i john saw these things and heard them and when i had heard and seen i fell down to worship before the feet of the angel which shewed me these things 9 then saith he unto me see thou do it not for i am thy fellowservant and of thy brethren the prophets and of them which keep the sayings of this book worship god 10 and he saith unto me seal not the sayings of the prophecy of this book for the time is at hand 11 he that is unjust let him be unjust still and he which is filthy let him be filthy still and he that is righteous let him be righteous still and he that is holy let him be holy still 12 and behold i come quickly and my reward is with me to give every man according as his work shall be 13 i am alpha and omega the beginning and the end the first and the last 14 blessed are they that do his commandments that they may have right to the tree of life and may enter in through the gates into the city 15 for without are dogs and sorcerers and whoremongers and murderers and idolaters and whosoever loveth and maketh a lie 16 i jesus have sent mine angel to testify unto you these things in the churches i am the root and the offspring of david and the bright and morning star 17 and the spirit and the bride say come and let him that heareth say come and let him that is athirst come and whosoever will let him take the water of life freely 18 for i testify unto every man that heareth the words of the prophecy of this book if any man shall add unto these things god shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book 19 and if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy god shall take away his part out of the book of life and out of the holy city and from the things which are written in this book 20 he which testifieth these things saith surely i come quickly amen even so come lord jesus 21 the grace of our lord jesus christ be with you all amen
725500 21 not every one that saith unto me lord lord shall enter into the kingdom of heaven but he that doeth the will of my father which is in heaven 22 many will say to me in that day lord lord have we not prophesied in thy name and in thy name have cast out devils and in thy name done many wonderful works 23 and then will i profess unto them i never knew you depart from me ye that work iniquity
725501 13 nevertheless we according to his promise look for new heavens and a new earth wherein dwelleth righteousness 14 wherefore beloved seeing that ye look for such things be diligent that ye may be found of him in peace without spot and blameless

725508 24 then cometh the end when he shall have delivered up the kingdom to god even the father when he shall have put down all rule and all authority and power 25 for he must reign till he hath put all enemies under his feet 26 the last enemy that shall be destroyed is death

725640 far from ignoring climate change chinese leaders have already committed to improving energy efficiency and scaling up the growthof low carbon industries china is beginning to pull its weight on climate change and the targetsand policies in place are in line with those being taken by leading countries like the uk andgermany
725641 chinas current trajectory will ensure it remains a strategic global hub for lowcarbon investment innovation and growth over coming decades

725668 and in the months ahead it will be important to invite those absent from lambeth to be involved in these next stages
725669 our communion longs to stay together but not only as an association of polite friends
725670 it is seeking a deeper entry into the place where christ stands to find its unity there
725671 some people are for the very first time now accepting that there is a crisis
725672 promise to our fellow human beings the generosity god has shown us
725673 i hope that if part of the message of lambeth 08 is that we need to develop covenantal commitments and that one aspect of this might be what you call covenanted restraint this will be seen in the context of a unity not enforced but given in christ
725674 to embrace deeper and more solid ways of recognizing and trusting each other can be a grace not a burden and when trust is deepened more responsible and prayerful discussions can follow
725675 in these days together we have not overcome our problems or reinvented our structures that will still take time
725676 we have quite a strong degree of support for a pastoral forum to support minorities a strong consensus on the need to examine how the instruments of communion will best work and a recognition though still with many questions that a covenant is needed

725682 rates of pelvic pain in australia are high yet our findings suggest only about a third of women who experience it seek advice from their health professional

725684 no matter how sophisticated you make these automated systems youre not going to make them perfect and all you can really strive for is to tune them as you go along

725733 the most important message id like to send right now is that spacex will not skip a beat in execution going forward we have flight four of falcon 1 almost ready for flight and flight five right behind that
725734 as a precautionary measure to guard against the possibility of flight three not reaching orbit spacex recently accepted a significant investment

725796 we believe there are energy alternatives that do not jeopardize the worlds food provisions that do not sacrifice agriculture
725797 our country has enough natural gas as an alternative and the responsibility is to use that resource in order to avoid agriculture competing with energy resources
725798 president garcia thank you for your vision and leadership to make this possible peru is certainly doing the right thing to harness its own clean natural resource to clean the air reduce global warming and help grow the economy
725799 this station is unique because it can fill 32 natural gas vehicles simultaneously including filling five transit buses at the same time or thousands of vehicles per day it has the capacity to deliver over 40 000 gallons of natural gas daily

725802 gee dad doesnt that metal building reflect a lot of heat on the thermometer thing
725803 the best british political libertarian blog on the web consistently excellent but not for the squeamish
725804 but for all that he is a brilliant writer incisive fisker extraordinaire and with an over developed sense of humour and he can back up his sometimes extraordinary views with some good old fashioned intellectual rigour im promoting him on my blogroll to a daily read
725805 the glorious devils kitchen not for the squeamish or easily offended
725806 a very smart article takes a pretty firm libertarian line on the matter
725807 by the way dk seems to be on fucking good form at the moment
725808 devils kitchen is the big name on the free market libertarian strand of the british blogosphere profane rants are the immediate stand out feature of dks blog but the ranting is backed up by some formidable argument on a wide range of issues particularly relating to british and european parliamentary politics economics and civil liberties
725809 an excellent intelligent uk political blog which includes a great deal of swearing
725810 i like the devils kitchen i think its one of the best written and funniest blogs in the business
725811 for sheer intelligence erudition and fun iain dales diary cranmer and devils kitchen are so far ahead of the rest i dont see how they can figure in a top ten they are the beatles stones and who of the blog world the astair bogart and marlon brando of the blog world the gerswin porter and novello of the blog world the dot cotton pat butcher bette lynch of the blog world
725812 its the blogging equivalent of someone eating ostrich vindaloo washed down by ten bottles of jamaican hot pepper sauce and then proceeding to breathe very close to your face while talking about how lovely our politicians are but theres much more to his writing than four letter words
725813 the devils kitchen is a life affirming life enhancing blog this particular post will also lead you to some of the best soldiers in the army of swearbloggers of which he is field marshal
725814 underneath all the ranting and swearing dk s a very intelligent and thoughtful writer whom many people take seriously despite disagreeing with much of what he says
725815 the most foul mouthed of bloggers devils kitchen was always likely to provoke sometimes disgust but more often admiration
725816 i dont mean it literally or even metaphorically i just find that his atheism aside i agree with everything the devil of kitchen fame says i particularly enjoy his well crafted and sharp swearing especially when addressed at self righteous lefties
725817 spot on accurate and delightful in its simplicity devils kitchen is one of the reasons that were not ready to write off euroweenie land just yet at least not until we get done evacuating the ones with brains
725818 this hugely entertaining articulate witty scottish commentator is also one of the most foul mouthed bloggers around gird up your loins and have a look essential reading
725819 the devils kitchen is one of the foremost blogs in the uk the dk is bawdy foul mouthed tasteless vulgar offensive and frequently goes beyond all boundaries of taste and decency so why on earth does dr crippen read the dk because he reduces me to a state of quivering helpless laughter
725820 dk is a take no prisoners sort of libertarian his blog is renowned for its propensity for foul mouthed invective which can be both amusing and tiresome by turns nevertheless he is usually lucid often scintillating and sometimes illuminating
725821 if you enjoy a superior anti left rant albeit one with a heavy dash of cursing you could do worse than visit the devils kitchen the devil is an astute observer of the evils of nulabour thats for sure i for one stand converted to the devil and all his works
725822 this fellow is sharp as a tack funny as hell and when something pisses him off meaner than a badger with a case of the bullhead clap
725823 foul mouthed eloquence of the highest standard in bad taste offensive immoderate and slanderous f ing brilliant
725824 i tend to enjoy devils kitchen not only because i disagree with him quite a lot of the time but because i actually have to use my brain to articulate why
725825 this blog is currently slamming politics certainly aint all my own but style and prose is tight fierce provocative and funny ok i am a child swear words still crack a laugh
725826 10 000 words per hour blogging output prolific or obsessive compulsive i have yet to decide
725827 anyone can cuss but to curse in an imaginative fashion takes work
725828 ive been laffing fit to burst at the unashamed sweariness of the devils kitchen certainly my favourite place recently
725829 god bless the devils kitchen colourful as his invective is i cannot fault his accuracy
725830 it made me laugh out loud and laugh so hard and i dont even get all the references i hope his politics dont offend you but he is very funny
725831 dk himself is unashamedly right wing vitriolic and foul mouthed liberally scattering his posts with four letter words not to be read if youre easily offended but highly entertaining and very much tongue in cheek
725832 this blog is absolutely wasted here and should be on the front page of one of the broadsheets
725833 this labour government is the most mendacious dishonest endemically corrupt power hungry incompetent illiberal fucking shower of shits that has ruled this country

725843 the good thing about all of our newcomers is that they all are good chemistry guys
725844 none of them are me first they are all easy to play with we have been playing pick up and they have been doing real well we are excited to have all of them
725845 we are getting along real good we are all good together that is a good sign

725853 i could care less if i win or finish second its definitely about the points to finish second is a non issue to take the points lead by how much we have is huge
725854 if john mccain feels that i can help his candidacy which i think its so important to elect him our next president i will do it
725855 im not going to go to that convention the republican convention and spend my time attacking barack obama im going to go there really talking about why i support john mccain and why i hope a lot of other independents and democrats will do that and frankly im going to go to a partisan convention and tell them if i go why its so important that we start to act like americans and not as partisan mud slingers
725856 how much for this and then how much for this what about this
725857 paul mccartney cold cuts secret garden sgcd 02 03 04 05
725858 rolling stones hold on tight dog n cat dac 083
725859 to say that barack obama did not intentionally inject the idea of his name and his race is a lie
725860 there is no doubt in my mind that sen obama is trying to suggest that he is the victim of something
725861 doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
725862 to say that that is not trying to inject the idea that you are a victim of john mccain trying to make fun of your name and your racial background is a lie
725863 what he was saying all along is that he has a different kind of resume
725864 what he was saying is that he is a different kind of candidate a different kind of leader
725865 meet the press 2004 democratic presidential nominee sen john f kerry said obama was not trying to inject race into the contest
725866 what obama was saying is they are trying to scare you and they are trying to scare the american people
725867 doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
725868 but did so by linking it with a special place
725869 the great panathenaea was an ancient procession that wove together the sacred and the secular as it wound up the acropolis to the parthenon where a new robe was offered to the gold and ivory statue of athena

725875 at one point they were calling my dreams a lost cause it was too negative it was too much additional stress on my life i had already lost my job my car broke down and i was about to get evicted i didnt know what the hell was going on in my life all i knew is that i wanted to fight
725876 its an amazing feeling to stick with your goals and dreams and have everyone eventually come around
725877 the christmas after the show aired was probably the best holiday ive had in my life it was the first time everyone in my family was proud of me and accepted what i do
725878 when i was 10 years old my best friend and i saw an ad in black belt magazine for the first ufc event
725879 his dad ordered it for us and by the end i was convinced that it was the most amazing thing i had ever seen in my life
725880 throughout middle school and high school you have teachers asking what you want to be id say a professional fighter and they thought i was completely insane throughout my entire life ive been told that fighting is not a real job and that i ought to consider a different profession but i dont live with a backup plan short of being damn near paralyzed this is all that i want to do
725881 i convinced my father that i would also go to college
725882 this was in 2001 and fighters werent making any money back then i earned only three hundred dollars from my first pro fight and there was no one to help support me
725883 its funny i never really looked into getting on the show
725884 but when i flew in for the interviews i really started to sell myself living in the house sucked at times but id do it all over again being on a reality show didnt change my life but being with the ufc has definitely helped my career dramatically
725885 i respect barrera for going the distance but i would have respected him a lot more if he had tkod me
725886 the whole time i was so relaxed and of course smiling but it was one of the most boring frustrating fights of my career i went three five minute rounds and there wasnt a mark on me
725887 the next time im looking to fight in an aggressive fashion and give the crowd some excitement
725888 i can tell you that im going to shoot in pick him up and launch him upside down like a cartwheel and kick him in the head mid flight exactly three minutes into the first round
725889 but the truth is you never know my strategy is simply to win by any means all i can say is that im definitely not looking to go the distance and if i lose the only thing id want is to lose in perfect fashion that said ive had nine months to work on my entire arsenal and i expect to go to war
725890 some people have to get angry and hype themselves up to get into fight mode
725891 they believe in the intimidation aspect of the sport but for me mma is a game i have no reason to think about the fight until im warming up i know every position possible so theres nothing you can to do scare me the more serious my opponent gets the more i smile

725893 of course i feel a little bit sorry for felipe i know how he feels with what happened to him today ive had similar moments to him this year
725894 i just tried to put pressure on massa hoping something would happen
725895 it worked out for me im very very glad to secure the victory
725896 we had the speed in the race its qualifying where we must sort it out
725897 we need to get something sorted my car is fast and we need to just get in the front to use it
725898 i feel i could have had a go at passing him but the damaged tire halted my progress
725899 i dont yet know what happened but at least i scored four points and maintained my lead in the championship so this result is not too bad for me
725900 when i saw the car on fire on the straight the smoke i thought it could be felipe but couldnt believe it
725901 i just tried not to do any mistakes and stay in front of him
725902 i didnt expect the podium its just the perfect weekend
725903 you said i killed you haunt me then be with me always drive me mad only do not leave me in this abyss where i cannot find you i cannot live without my life without my soul

725911 usually i would win a tournament and the next week i would lose in the first round
725912 so i was happy when i won the first match and then i was just taking it one match at a time
725913 sweat the small stuff so i just told everyone and everyone laughed at me and now i am telling you go ahead and laugh i wont be mad

725936 muchas de las materias que el pueblo venezolano rechaz el 2 de diciembre
725937 it certainly has not been abused it may be underutilized
725938 in every case i was involved in i thought it was an abuse
725939 we dont know how many guns were actually confiscated or returned to their owners
725940 in fact the firearms were found in a locked safe when the officers executed the warrant
725941 the whole point was to make sure it was limited and constitutional
725942 the bottom line from our perspective is it may very well have saved lives
725943 of course the u s government should pay compensation its the u s militarys fault
725944 we feel detailed investigation should be done by the u s government itself
725945 the no gun ri incident became one of the milestones to take on this kind of incident in the future
725946 u s forces napalmed numerous small buildings and strafed children women and old people in the open area
725947 there were many similar incidents refugees gathered in certain places and there were air strikes
725948 everybody came out of their houses to see these low flying planes and everyone was hit
725949 the u s air force regarded all people in white as possible enemy
725950 civilians in villages cannot normally be identified as either north koreans south koreans or guerrillas
725951 i ran forward and all i could hear were people coughing and screaming and some were probably already dead
725952 how could they not tell the cows the pieces of furniture
725953 this is a matter of deep concern to the korean people
725954 the killings of korean civilians were extensive intentional and indiscriminate
725955 echt schlagt ihn von mir jeder zweimal nein besser dreimal und sagt ihm er ist ne schwuchtel er is so schwul schwul schwul schwul
725956 theyve decided they cant win on the issues so now theyre going to try to destroy his character
725957 no he obama was talking what he was talking about is this campaign to scare about the person and thats what they do they try to scare about the person they try to attack the character they cant win on health care they cant win on the economy eighty five percent of the people in the nation know the countrys moving in the wrong direction
725958 first off you know we all ought to relax a little bit
725959 pintemos el cielo de rosario 2007 un encuentro que se consolida a o tras a o como el suceso de barriletes m s importante y convocante del pa s
725960 one of the tasks of the conference is to address the fact that there are three million people who now get the drugs but another nine million who do not
725961 as we prepare to come together in denver however we must be and will be united in our determination to change the course of our nation
725962 to that end democrats in florida and michigan must know that they are full partners and colleagues in our historic mission to reshape washington and lead our country in a new direction
725963 accordingly i ask that the credentials committee pass a resolution that would entitle each delegate from florida and michigan to cast a full vote
725964 we deeply appreciate and value senator obamas perspective on this important issue
725965 this matter will be the top priority for the credentials committee when we meet on august 24th as always our goal is to ensure a fair process and a unified democratic party so that we can win in november
725966 many great intelligent talented academy winning actors standing by awaiting a major press conference to show their support
725967 the ad is a bit ironic given that mccain has been the most pop culture savvy republican candidate in quite some time
725968 barack obama may be the one but is he ready to lead
725969 johns been a celebrity ever since he was shot down
725970 obama has almost transcended that and has become famous as a famous person which is why they are comparing him to paris hilton
725971 you can definitely makes the case that mccain stands out among republicans for his associations with hollywood and his celebrity status
725972 the fact that he was in wedding crashers it underscores the fact that he does have a lot of friends in the entertainment industry that bush cant claim
725973 john mccain is a widely respected and admired political leader in our country and the world
725974 who else could get 200 000 people in berlin those arent voters those are fans
725975 and the reality that this guy has entered tom cruise type of fame
725976 these new figures should bring new focus to our efforts to address aids and hiv here at home
725977 combating hiv aids also demands closing the gaps in opportunity that exist in our society so that we can strengthen our public health we must also overcome the stigma that surrounds hiv aids a stigma that is too often tied to homophobia
725978 we need to encourage folks to get tested and accelerate hiv aids research toward an effective cure because we have a moral obligation to join together to meet this challenge and to do so with the urgency this epidemic demands
725979 work closely with non profit government and private sector stakeholders to continue the fight against hiv aids
725980 by focusing efforts on reducing drug costs through greater market competition promoting prevention efforts encouraging testing targeting communities with high infection rates strengthening research and reducing disparities through effective public outreach we as a nation can make great progress in fighting hiv aids
725981 these are odious assaults on individuals and on the principles of free inquiry by which we live
725982 what do you mean you dont have a new math book what did you do with it
725983 did you realize i forgot to get you a math book
725984 i cant wait to get started and do all of this cool stuff
725985 the primary focus is the safety of the detainees as well as the detainee guard force and thats why we have this intelligence activity
725986 guantanamo has become little more than a holding center for hundreds of men most of whom will never be charged with a crime and have nothing to offer the u s government in the way of actionable intelligence
725987 you always want to make sure you understand the mood of the camp
725988 if i see a change in behavior my question then will be well is this because of a new procedure ive implemented or is this just because its hot outside or ive got a new rotation of detainee guards
725989 you will hardly get to play a football match on mount everest
725990 the explorers flight mission appears not to have reached orbit tonight
725991 spacex will not skip a beat in execution going forward
725992 i was hitting the ball incredibly well all day especially my iron shots
725993 my driver is my favorite club and i didnt miss many fairways
725994 i played with him the last two rounds in qualifying and against him today and believe me hes so good
725995 i think i conceded four putts to him on the front side and i dont usually concede putts he was that close
725996 i made some bogeys and you cant do that against someone as good as danny
725997 i never could put any pressure on him because he played so well
725998 i shot 70 the first round of qualifying and then had seven rounds under par so i feel pretty good about that
725999 at faith amp family magazine and faith amp family live our goal is to be a source of support for catholic women seeking information inspiration resources and encouragement as they embrace their vocations to marriage and motherhood our aim is to share personal struggles and triumphs challenges and joys and also the lighter side of catholic living
726000 a complete waste of the countrys time and attention at the very moment when millions of people are losing their homes and their jobs

726009 regardless of the criminals place of birth is they should be punished severely
726010 each year the united states the united kingdom and canada deport thousands of people convicted of various crimes to their countries of citizenship in the caribbean

726012 they are sending back these violent guys some left here as babies they come back as criminals after their graduation from american prison
726013 these people dont know anyone they dont know our culture most dont have family here or if they do say have an aunt here she doesnt want to take them in because of their criminality crime is entirely out of control
726014 wed never seen such bad mindedness its beyond control its our home but we feel like moving away

726018 as far back as the year 2000 the respondent has actually attempted to murder several other people either through poisoning he is a revenge killer when he feels that hes been slighted or has had especially toward women he plots and actually tries to carry out revenge killings
726019 has been forensically diagnosed by several top psychiatrists as a sociopathic homicidal killer i have that in evidence and through my working with him i also believe that to be very true
726020 very important that the fbi present their case against bruce and not just state that the investigation was over because it was him and hes gone
726021 im concerned about what closing this case without conclusive evidence might do to harm our life sciences enterprise i think we as americans need to see the proof
726022 its a shame the man is not here with us we might have known more
726023 i think the fbi owes us a complete accounting of their investigation and ought to be able to tell us at some point how were going to bring this to closure

726108 they did their homework on what they wanted to achieve in terms of putting pressure on us
726109 they certainly targeted certain areas and got a good result out of it when youre a bit off and theyre putting on a bit of pressure it makes for a hard night
726110 you cant go from having a very good lineout to a debacle in one game
726111 what it does is refocus us in that area weve been going quite well in the lineouts until now and im sure that will be the case from here on as well
726112 the disappointing thing for us is that we didnt respond to it well enough
726113 its not one we will look back on with a lot of pride
726114 the all blacks grew an arm and a leg and were prepared to have a crack and get up and they closed the gap and did it successfully

726123 we would have had a much bigger tax cut if it were not for john mccain
726124 its amazing to hear what john mccain is trying to convince the voters he is all about the bottom line is i served 12 years with him six years in the senate as one of the leaders of the senate trying to put together the conservative agenda and almost at every turn on domestic policy john mccain was not only against us but leading the charge on the other side
726125 an affront to personal freedom and liberty in this country and what weve seen as a result of this misguided attempt to placate the new york times and to help his stature within that community is that special interests have absolutely taken over the political process and individual candidates unless youre a billionaire and parties have very little voice in the process
726126 its a shame but he was obviously out front on that
726127 the reduction in tax rates and lowering the rates on capital gains and dividends did so much to get this economy up and going but we would have had a much bigger tax cut if it were not for john mccain

726137 the bourgeoisie wherever it has got the upper hand has put an end to all feudal patriarchal idyllic relations
726138 it has pitilessly torn asunder the motley fuedal ties that bound man to his natural superiors
726139 and has left remaining no other nexus between man and man than naked self interest than callous cash payment it has drowned the most heavenly ecstasies of religious fervour of chivalrous enthusiasm of philistine sentimentalism in the icy water of egotistical calculation
726140 it has resolved personal worth into exchange value and in place of the numberless indefeasible chartered freedoms has set up that single unconscionable freedom free trade
726141 in one word for exploitation veiled by religious and political illusions it has substituted naked shameless direct brutal exploration
726142 constant revolutionizing of production everlasting uncertainty and agitation distinguish the bourgeois epoch from all earlier ones
726143 the need of a constantly expanding market for its products chases the bourgeoisie over the whole surface of the globe

726146 in place of the old local and national seclusion and self sufficiency we have intercourse in every direction universal interdependence of nations and as in material so also in intellectual production the intellectual creations of individual nations become common property national one sidedness and narrow mindedness become more and more impossible and from the numerous national and local literatures there arises a world literature

726192 it seems that a number of groups of clergy have voted for a ban on gay bishops and church blessings for homosexual couples as part of a long term plan to preserve at least the core of the communion
726193 bullies always come back for more and the one thing that i think the archbishop is blind to is the fact that nothing short of total victory will satisfy these guys

726195 in these days together we have not overcome our problems or reinvented our structures that will still take time
726196 and in the months ahead it will be important to invite those absent from lambeth to be involved in these next stages

726198 they criticize themselves constantly interrupt themselves continually in their own course come back to the apparently accomplished in order to begin it afresh deride with unmerciful thoroughness the inadequacies weaknesses and paltrinesses of their first attempts seem to throw down their adversary only in order that he may draw new strength from the earth and rise again more gigantic before them recoil even and anon from the indefinite prodigiousness of their own aims

726428 up to date pdas has powerful processors has dozens megabytes of memory however there is no handy method of entering texts on such computers yes you can type several words using graffiti but what would you do if you need to type a whole page the keys on a system virtual keyboard are too small and drawing thousands of squiggles with the help of graffiti is very tiresome furthermore you have to constantly correct errors you certainly wanted to write something voluminous on your palm handheld but you always were confused by typesetting difficulties quite often when you travel you want to write an e mail to your old friend or to exchange a few words with a colleague by sms but when traveling by train or by bus using of graffiti becomes problematic however there is a way of typing other than graffiti you can type faster and more accurately with the help of the truly innovative onscreen keyboard this keyboard has large keys and qwerty layout is there anything more you would need for text typing its interface looks quite uncustomary but youll not need to learn how to use it all keys are located at their usual places though they have original form and are displaced vertically you will quickly adapt to these distinctions and will be able to type text almost as easily as when using an external keyboard you will be convinced of it

726461 i encourage all rio grande valley residents who have been impacted by hurricane dolly to contact fema and see if they qualify for disaster assistance
726462 with fema individuals may be able to find get the assistance necessary to help them back onto their feet
726463 we are working to make sure our residents questions are answered
726464 all of us need to be on the same page so we can help each other through this difficult time
726465 the rma and our contractors are taking every step necessary to make sure the loop project meets the highest of engineering and environmental standards
726466 we all realize how important the loop is to the future of transportation and commerce in hidalgo county and beyond so we are determined to make this an exemplary project on engineering environment and finance
726467 the state of texas and our state delegation especially sen
726468 with recent instances of dengue across the border and the 13 cases of west nile virus reported here in 2004 we must take all preventative measures to avert long term medical and health problems
726469 aerial spraying has shown to significantly reduce the mosquito population although it will not rid us of the problem completely in cameron county we are just happy that we can get some relief
726470 we still urge people to take steps to reduce the mosquito population around their homes by getting rid of standing water and keeping drains and ditches clear of debris so water will recede quicker
726471 hurricane dolly has prevented many individuals from returning to work
726472 now individuals can apply to receive compensation for their lost wages i strongly encourage that all impacted individuals who qualify under this assistance program apply as soon as possible
726473 a re appraisal of this property will help the people impacted by the hurricane save money we dont anticipate that the re appraisal which will be prorated for the year will impact the countys tax base by a significant amount but it will help these residents get back on their feet
726474 the district is willing to re appraise if authorized by the hidalgo county commissioners court or any other governmental entity
726475 we are doing all we can to get our residents back on their feet after hurricane dolly
726476 though some areas in south texas have incurred significant damage preparedness efforts on the part of our local state and federal officials and private sector partners ensured that our number one priority protecting lives was successfully met
726477 as damage assessments begin the state stands ready to help south texas residents rebuild and restore their homes businesses and communities
726478 the levee system of the rio grande valley intended to protect homes and businesses from flooding is outdated and repairs are long overdue i introduced legislation earlier this year that would allow local government entities in the valley to begin making repairs to the levees to protect texas families and businesses against flooding the most important component of this bill is that it enables local officials to proceed with immediate repairs yet with hurricane dollys arrival and hurricane season upon us this important bill remains stalled in the senate im hopeful the majority leader will grant my request and call this bill to the floor so we can prevent serious damage and harm to homes businesses and residents in the valley
726479 hidalgo county is working diligently to document damages related to this storm
726480 we are grateful for the federal governments quick reaction to the needs of our residents
726481 after slowing for several hours to a near standstill about 35 miles offshore the eyewall of hurricane dolly finally crossed south padre island at around 1 00 pm edt wednesday as a category 2 hurricane with winds of 100 mph
726482 one hour later winds had diminished to 95 mph as dolly hovered just onshore over laguna madre texas
726483 the closest distance between the center of hurricane dolly and the sister cities of brownsville and matamoros mexico was roughly 30 32 miles and because the storm tracked to the north both cities were spared the storms strongest winds nevertheless at landfall tropical storm force winds extended outward some 140 miles from the eye lashing a broad swath of the coast near the texas mexico border with strong winds and heavy rain
726484 in brownsville downed trees and shredded roofing materials litter the ground today and some homes are flooded
726485 insured residential properties in mexico are overwhelmingly of confined masonry construction insured commercial properties are dominated by confined masonry and reinforced concrete both construction types should fare well in the face of wind speeds of the kind generated by hurricane dolly and structural damage is therefore expected to be minimal still many homes are likely to have suffered damage to roof shingles non structural elements such as signs and awnings are likely to have been blown off and there may be also damage to unprotected windows from the wind borne debris informally constructed and typically uninsured houses particularly those in fishing villages along the coast have not fared so well
726486 when we were contacted by the department of state health services on thursday for assistance our physical plant employees immediately readied the fieldhouse for the national guard while here guardsmen were also afforded the use of the universitys wellness and recreation center as well as the laundry facilities at unity hall
726487 our cooling plant employees for example were fighting electrical surges to keep the chillers that cool the campus on during the event our utpa police provided surveillance before and after the storm the officers and guards were here during the duration
726488 what i thought was most impressive was the fact that none of the team members said no to any of the challenges before and after the storm
726489 i am especially grateful to our outstanding physical plant staff whose meticulous preparation of the campus and their response to the related storm damage was without a doubt responsible for the very low level of disturbance to any of our facilities
726490 dolly proved that we should never underestimate the potential power of any storm in the gulf of mexico
726491 we are grateful to gov rick perry and his emergency response team to offer immediate assistance to willacy county his office and steve mccraw state director of homeland security recognize the significant damage and safety hazard our region faces
726492 we truly appreciate the enormous coordinated state federal and private sector partners who directed emergency protective measures before during and after the hurricane disaster as elected officials we take our leadership serious and are appreciative to get additional help when a natural disaster occurs
726493 south texas is fortunate to have escaped the widespread catastrophic impact a hurricane can bring to the texas coast
726494 many homes and businesses did suffer significant damage however and postponing taxes for people who need time to focus on recovery is one way the state can help taxpayers in counties where the governor has issued a disaster declaration
726495 we are very proud of our continued accomplishment and i must thank our entire board of trustees administration faculty and staff for their support of our mission and vision
726496 we are focused on creating a college going culture in the rio grande valley and our continued high rankings prove that we are headed in the right direction
726497 this bill is crucial to the health of our economy and will ensure that more students graduate prepared for the 21st century workplace
726498 it puts smart strategies in place to improve our student aid process restore confidence in our student loan programs and provide more low income first generation and minority students the chance to pursue a college education
726499 if we do not invest in advanced education and training for this emerging population we put our nations economic foundation at risk
726500 it has been 10 years since i started fighting for the creation of a graduate program for hsis and with presidents signature we will finally achieve this long overdue initiative
726501 this agreement demonstrates the hard work and good faith that were brought forth when the parties finally sat down at the table and talked about what solution would best serve the mutual interests
726502 i am particularly pleased at what this agreement means for our educational mission and the continued safety of our students
726503 we are gratified that these public entities representing local state and federal interests have arrived at an amicable solution that preserves utb tsc campus life while enhancing border security for the nation
726504 persons with disabilities are living longer than ever and yet they have accumulated more social and health related problems than people in general
726505 some women have equal degrees of impairment and yet some have more problems functioning and performing in their work social and family roles
726506 i want to explore what it is that is different in their lives are there factors such as attitude socioeconomic class or culture that make impairment worse
726507 the public continues to be extremely downbeat about the national economy
726508 while rising costs are clearly the top economic problem in the publics view it is far from their only concern
726509 multiple economic concerns are taking a toll on public optimism
726510 about half of americans 51 percent expect their personal financial situation to improve over the next year down from 55 percent in march and 60 percent in january yet despite the worsening economic perceptions the public does not see the economy as beyond repair nor do they believe that the government is incapable of fixing the economy in an era of global economic interdependence
726511 ich freue mich dass sich au erdem mittlerweile 100 praxen freiwillig haben zertifizieren lassen
726512 spacex will not skip a beat in execution going forward we have flight 004 of the falcon 1 almost ready for flight and flight 005 right behind that
726513 thus it is precisely because we are torah believing jews that we have come here today to protest the destruction and confiscation of individuals homes in historic palestine
726514 tragically this is not an isolated incident over the years the nazionists government has plunged itself ever deeper into the abyss of moral blindness performing acts of senseless cruelty that have only fanned the fires of hate in the middle east
726515 what a very different world it would be if all jews would seek to emulate the traits of abraham our forefather then respect would begat respect and love would yield love and peoples would once again live as true neighbors as we did in the decades before zionism sought the dispossession of people
726516 torah jewry condemns the illegitimate occupation of palestinian land and the subjugation of palestinians throughout the holy land
726517 we beseech international human rights organizations to intervene immediately to rescue our palestinian brothers from zionists captivity
726518 we all hope and pray for the day to come that we all may yet live in peace in the land of our mutual forefather abraham under the moral laws of the almighty
726519 whered you go how long were you there bringing back lots of money alright have a good one

726525 quiero terminar mi gesti n como ministro de turismo y me queda hasta junio del a o que viene luego me quiero dedicar a otras cosas como la arqueolog a una de mis aficiones y creo que en mi pa s hay muchas cosas por descubrir
726526 estas lloviznas son generalizadas en casi todos los distritos es algo que seguir unos d as m s y luego de ello el clima tender a mejorar un poco
726527 este fen meno se ha dirigido m s hacia la costa sur del pa s e incluso se ha registrado gran humedad en chosica
726528 eso es mentira absurdo cualquier persona que razone y vea la distribuci n pol tica del parlamento sabe que est hecho de tal manera que no puede haber una sola oposici n frente al gobierno
726529 c mo se une unidad nacional con humala imposible porque pierden los dos c mo se une humala con los fujimoristas tampoco pueden porque pierden los dos por consiguiente no hab a la necesidad de tomar una medida oculta bajo la mesa ni visitas subrepticias
726530 lamento que otros partidos se desdibujen se pasen unos a otro lado quiz s por razones justas por discusiones tambi n es democr tico pero lo deseable es que los partidos sean los que permanezcan como referencia para el elector
726531 lo criticable ser a que se viole la ley y los reglamentos
726532 iniciar las acciones judiciales a que hubiere lugar contra los terceros que resultes responsables en el caso de la denuncia period stica
726533 asimismo dispuso que la comisi n de tica del congreso de inmediato investigue los hechos que se observan en el reportaje del mencionado programa period stico

726539 repatriation is pretty much a death sentence in some of these cases
726540 ive seen patients bundled onto the plane and out of the country and once that person is out of sight hes out of mind
726541 what that does for us it puts a strain on our system where were unable to provide adequate care for our own citizens
726542 an alternative choice for the care of the unfunded latin american nationals
726543 oooh you got the x13750 version 3 hows the infrared transfer rate on that doombangle
726544 the hebrew writer of the bible was not so well acquainted with egypt as has often been imagined
726545 d they sold joseph to the ishmaelites for 20 pieces of silver and they brought joseph to egypt
726546 and josephs master took him and put him in the prison a place where the kings prisoners were confined
726547 then pharaoh sent and called joseph and they brought him hastily out of the dungeon and he shaved himself and changed his garment and came in to pharaoh
726548 and pharaoh took off his ring from his hand and put it upon josephs hand and arrayed him in garments of fine linen and put a gold collar about his neck
726549 and pharaoh charged all his people saying every son who is born you shall throw into the river and every daughter you shall let live
726550 and joseph ordered his servants the physicians to embalm his father
726551 and these are the names of the sons of israel who came to egypt
726552 but god made me joseph a father to pharaoh and lord of all his house and a ruler throughout all the land of egypt
726553 go yourselves and take for yourselves straw where you can find it but do not diminish from your work anything
726554 the lord god of the hebrews has met with us moses and aaron and now let us go we beseech you three days journey into the wilderness that we may sacrifice to the lord our god
726555 but god made me joseph a father to pharaoh and lord of all his house and a ruler throughout all the land of egypt
726556 and the egyptians made the people of israel serve with rigor and they made their lives bitter with hard slavery in mortar and in brick and in all kinds of service in the field all their service which they made them serve was with rigor
726557 something to think about extraordinary reflections about ordinary events mesorah
726558 obviously weve got to go out there and do it we have to take it day by day through this training camp and get better each day
726559 if the north american churches dont accept the need for moratoria then to say the least we are no further forward
726560 the idea of a covenant which includes as many of them as possible becomes more fragile and that means that as a communion we continue to be in grave peril
726561 thats an assumption i cant accept because i think the issue about what conditions a church lays down for a blessing have to be shaped by its own thinking and its own praying
726562 in these days together we have not overcome our problems or reinvented our structures that will still take time
726563 its a large building with patients but thats not important right now
726564 celebrity in the ilk of paris hilton and britney spears was all in fun

726566 cynical attempt to distract voters from the real issues in the race
726567 playing the race card by suggesting that opponents are trying to scare voters about obama who in obamas terms has not come out of
726568 williams will be in toulon on monday or tuesday we have discussed things with his agents and we are going to try and complete the move
726569 if everything goes well he will have his medical on tuesday and could make his debut in a friendly match on friday
726570 in just a few weeks our party will convene in denver for our national convention obama wrote to his partys credentials committee today
726571 this will be an historic event that will showcase our vision for changing the direction of our country
726572 the delegates and alternates who gather on monday august 25 will reflect the talent energy and rich diversity of our democratic party
726573 top priority as always our goal is to ensure a fair process and a unified democratic party so that we can win in november
726574 as a candidate for the nomination i supported the dncs efforts to establish and enforce a schedule for primaries and caucuses that would broaden the opportunity for democrats from all regions of the country and all backgrounds and walks of life to have a meaningful voice
726575 obama started the year by selling hope but now he s selling audacity
726576 fmg shares have been subject to an aggressive and co ordinated shorting campaign from a high of 13 15
726577 its a sluggish economy and its difficulties are felt all over
726578 that does suggest those folks are important for the spending outlook and the overall economic outlook
726579 consumer spending makes up 70 per cent of gross domestic product and when one group accounts for a very substantial share of consumer spending they also account for a large share of the economic activity that creates jobs
726580 a lot of our clients stop by a deli on the way to the airport rather than have a catered meal on the plane
726581 were down to a total of two crews for three airplanes
726582 we face a very different environment for luxury indulgence in 2008 as compared to 2007
726583 a very difficult marketplace for luxury goods over the next five years
726584 people are examining do you keep the yacht do you go to the classic car auction do you take the private jet
726585 those sound like nice problems to have but at the same time they are issues
726586 the high end buyers out there are maybe more selective now but im willing to wait out the storm
726587 knowing the local incidence should allow australian health planners to allocate clinical and social services accordingly
726588 no matter how sophisticated you make these automated systems youre not going to make them perfect and all you can really strive for is to tune them as you go along
726589 its pretty clear there was a lapse in terms of the quality control of yahoos keyword list
726590 leverages a combination of algorithmic and editorial processes to identify current relevant and popular terms
726591 we are really only in the infancy of this kind of automated analysis
726592 im sure its going to be expanding greatly not just in volume but in sophistication
726593 the quality of the content and the information is paramount
726594 you want to make sure youre striking the right balance between giving your readers everything the web has to offer with making sure theyre getting the right information and the relevant information
726595 if it does succeed its going to be done in a way thats subtle enough that its there for people who want it
726596 but its not going to be intrusive for people who dont
726597 this condition can clearly be considered to be the norm for australian women
726598 rates of pelvic pain in australia are high yet our findings suggest only about a third of women who experience it seek advice from their health professional
726599 women who fail to respond to these treatments should be referred to a gynaecologist earlier rather than later especially if they wish to conceive in the future
726600 we may not have put an end to all our problems but the pieces are on the board
726601 and in the months ahead it will be important to invite those absent from lambeth to be involved in these next stages
726602 our communion longs to stay together but not only as an association of polite friends
726603 it is seeking a deeper entry into the place where christ stands to find its unity there
726604 some people are for the very first time now accepting that there is a crisis
726605 promise to our fellow human beings the generosity god has shown us
726606 i hope that if part of the message of lambeth 08 is that we need to develop covenantal commitments and that one aspect of this might be what you call covenanted restraint this will be seen in the context of a unity not enforced but given in christ
726607 to embrace deeper and more solid ways of recognizing and trusting each other can be a grace not a burden and when trust is deepened more responsible and prayerful discussions can follow
726608 in these days together we have not overcome our problems or reinvented our structures that will still take time
726609 we have quite a strong degree of support for a pastoral forum to support minorities a strong consensus on the need to examine how the instruments of communion will best work and a recognition though still with many questions that a covenant is needed
726610 i have no interest in being a martyr im just trying to be a good bishop
726611 of course i feel a little bit sorry for felipe i know how he feels with what happened to him today ive had similar moments to him this year
726612 i just tried to put pressure on massa hoping something would happen
726613 it worked out for me im very very glad to secure the victory
726614 we had the speed in the race its qualifying where we must sort it out
726615 we need to get something sorted my car is fast and we need to just get in the front to use it
726616 when i saw the car on fire on the straight the smoke i thought it could be felipe but couldnt believe it
726617 i just tried not to do any mistakes and stay in front of him
726618 i didnt expect the podium its just the perfect weekend
726619 i tried my best and im very impressed by how the low scores have been this week it was a great win for ji yai
726620 i kept it together pretty well today but i was emotional on the first tee and coming up the final few holes
726621 i was pleased to play well and to break 70 for the first time this week i just wish the birdie putt at the last had been for the championship
726622 i saw a sign on the scoreboard saying annika you will be missed and then i was greeted with all the applause
726623 its been 15 great years of golf and i just really enjoyed the moment it was also nice to share it with my caddie terry mcnamara weve been together for nine years and we are great friends so i wanted him to enjoy it too
726624 we believe that we have a strong economic course of action to take australia through these difficult global economic times
726625 for the past two months there have been radically different figures such as the rise in oil prices or interest rates that give us the idea that the economic situation is worse than any of us had thought
726626 mit nackten br sten l sst sich alles verkaufen auch unsere schmiere
726627 its fortuitous that this diagnostic test could be applied to horse flu as its highly unlikely that a similar test could have been developed in a timely manner once the outbreak had been detected
726628 the use of the test supported the decision to try for eventual eradication
726629 a few months ago we announced a new web authoring tool called knol well today weve announced its public launch and we wanted to tell you a little bit more about it and how you might use it to complement your blog blogs are great for quickly and easily getting your latest writing out to your readers while knols are better for when you want to write an authoritative article on a single topic the tone is more formal and while its easy to update the content and keep it fresh knols arent designed for continuously posting new content or threading know how to fix a leaky toilet but dont want to write a blog about fixing up your house in that case knol is for you except for the different format youll get all the things youve come to expect from blogger in knol like blogger knol has simple web authoring tools that make it easy to collaborate co author and publish it has community features as well your readers will be able to add comments and rate your article and if you want theyll be able to suggest edits that you can then either accept or reject and just like in blogger you can also choose to include ads from adsense in your knols to perhaps make a little money one other important difference between knol and blogger is that knol encourages you to reveal your true identity knols are meant to be authoritative articles and therefore they have a strong focus on authors and their credentials we feel that this focus will help ensure that authors get credit for their work make the content more credible all in all we think knol will be a great new way for you to share what you know inform people about an issue that is important to you raise your profile as an expert in your field and maybe even make some money from ads create your knol right now for free

726666 i was born and baptized and bred in a pretty staunch catholic upbringing
726667 its when you get into conversations with mom and you ask why is the sky blue
726668 i asked whats going to happen to howie goldstein when he dies
726669 im thinking wait a minute they seem like a pretty nice family
726670 why would god create a bunch of people and just because they have different beliefs punish them forever
726671 the last thing i want is to make a bunch of converts to atheism
726672 it doesnt bother me that people are religious or spiritual up until it moves them to do something that harms others
726673 the number just keeps going up or at least the number of people willing to come out of the closet is going up
726674 i had a friend who was very religious and said im going to pray for you
726675 i said its okay you dont need to pray for me
726676 and i am a good person im a very caring person i care for my cats and other people
726677 justification for the assumption in the proposal that the theory of evolution and not intelligent design theory was correct
726678 i did ask him to reconsider and it came back immediately with no this is what he wants you to do
726679 when i got here i found out that things were worse than i had feared
726680 there are still major issues facing us as a catholic community not just the state of our schools and our hospitals but how will we have viable vibrant parishes with the decreasing numbers of priests and the sense of alienation among people who were baptized catholics those are huge challenges facing us
726681 but when i think about where we were as a community five years ago and where we are now things are much calmer and theres a sense of direction at the leadership level of the archdiocese
726682 theyve been very challenging times but i think that there has been motion forward
726683 if i had my druthers i would prefer to be living in greater simplicity
726684 i see the bishops role as being a pastor more than being a celebrity and i suppose thats what im uncomfortable with
726685 he clearly was surprised by the degree of public scrutiny of the church that went on here
726686 he reversed eight to 10 decisions and got a lot of criticism from some insiders on it but he did it

726747 i was terrified that he would pull us all off the cliff and screamed to him to use his ice axe but he lost his grip and plummeted off a 300 metre cliff
726748 we had a feeling this would not turn out well and decided to turn around the accident could have been prevented these mountains lure out way too inexperienced and naive people

726752 and made it reasonable with only one sentence its the ultimate storybook and by this i most certainly dont mean to say that this duology is meant for children only its more like a book for children of all ages orphans tales
726753 the brave princes are often stupid pretty princesses turn out to be half monsters and your friend in need is the ugliest most savage beest in the whole forest
726754 where classical tales are turned upside down and modernised sometimes even made fun of orphans tales
726755 i think that everyone that lives in british columbia hopefully will take a moment to think about how lucky we are to live here
726756 i cant think of a place in the world where id rather live than british columbia
726757 an act to provide for the government of british columbia
726758 you just have to travel to other parts of the country let alone other parts of the world to recognize that we are really really fortunate to call ourselves citizens of british columbia
726759 i believe party unity calls for the delegates from florida and michigan to be able to participate fully alongside the delegates from the other states and territories accordingly i ask that the credentials committee when it meets on august 24 to approve the delegates for the national convention pass a resolution that would entitle each delegate from florida and michigan to cast a full vote
726760 as a candidate for the nomination i supported the dncs efforts to establish and enforce a schedule for primaries and caucuses that would broaden the opportunity for democrats from all regions of the country and all backgrounds and walks of life to have a meaningful voice
726761 as we prepare to come together in denver however we must be and will be united in our determination to change the course of our nation to that end democrats in florida and michigan must know that they are full partners and colleagues in our historic mission to reshape washington and lead our country in a new direction
726762 we deeply appreciate and value senator obamas perspective on this important issue this matter will be the top priority for the credentials committee when we meet on august 24th
726763 as always our goal is to ensure a fair process and a unified democratic party so that we can win in november
726764 we are giving it a more festive atmosphere for sure

726767 sidewalk sale typically means thats the end of the season

726770 memmel is still expected to compete in the olympic games
726771 its serious and its the worst news we could get he has at the very least torn his internal ligament he is very upset crying because it is a serious problem and very painful
726772 hes in a lot of pain theyve got to do a lot of tests and right now it doesnt look good
726773 hes ahead of what he was doing last year at the same period
726774 i am confident in theo but its down to performances
726775 his first touch is much better he moves the ball quicker and his penetration his final ball is better
726776 his goal scoring potential is in him and i hope we get that out of him
726777 for now he is not a link player between midfield and the strikers like robin van persie can be and he is maybe at the moment a fraction short physically to play as a real target man
726778 he can play wide on the right wide on the left as well
726779 it had to do with the very specific characteristics in the dna of the letters and what was in bruces labs
726780 no rules so we could do the best and most compelling approaches
726781 clearly the most expensive case fbis ever undertaken and the most scientifically compelling case
726782 there are some groups that are going to be here just because this is a big stage
726783 but i think the majority of groups are here because they really want to demonstrate to the delegates that they want to see some sort of changes in the party platform
726784 these groups have said we cant survive four more years of this
726785 it is something that really gets people out in the streets
726786 its not directed specifically against the republicans thats for certain
726787 its against the warmakers but even people marching dont necessarily have to see things as broadly as i do
726788 tiene una lesi n de ligamentos en la rodilla izquierda seguro que tiene roto el ligamento lateral interno y posiblemente el cruzado vamos a esperar a ma ana a los resultados de las pruebas para confirmar y dar un pron stico y el tiempo de recuperaci n y si debe pasar por el quir fano o no
726789 si fuese solo el ligamento lateral interno podr a esquivar el quir fano pero si adem s tuviese roto el cruzado por supuesto que tendr que ser intervenido
726790 ha notado como se le ha girado la rodilla y ha sentido un chasquido lo que indica gravedad lo ha pasado mal porque desde primer momento se ha dado cuenta de la gravedad ha pasado un momento muy duro en el vestuario pero ahora hemos conseguido tranquilizarle
726791 many great intelligent talented academy winning actors standing by awaiting a major press conference to show their support
726792 the ad is a bit ironic given that mccain has been the most pop culture savvy republican candidate in quite some time
726793 barack obama may be the one but is he ready to lead
726794 johns been a celebrity ever since he was shot down
726795 obama has almost transcended that and has become famous as a famous person which is why they are comparing him to paris hilton
726796 you can definitely makes the case that mccain stands out among republicans for his associations with hollywood and his celebrity status
726797 the fact that he was in wedding crashers it underscores the fact that he does have a lot of friends in the entertainment industry that bush cant claim
726798 john mccain is a widely respected and admired political leader in our country and the world
726799 who else could get 200 000 people in berlin those arent voters those are fans
726800 and the reality that this guy has entered tom cruise type of fame
726801 the movies about one third fact one third legend which if you think about it is truer than true in many ways and one third just honest lamentation its all various species of honesty but i dont think there are any real whoppers in it

726804 it is a complete waste of the countrys time and attention at the very moment when millions of people are losing their homes and their jobs

726827 these new figures should bring new focus to our efforts to address aids and hiv here at home
726828 combating hiv aids also demands closing the gaps in opportunity that exist in our society so that we can strengthen our public health we must also overcome the stigma that surrounds hiv aids a stigma that is too often tied to homophobia
726829 we need to encourage folks to get tested and accelerate hiv aids research toward an effective cure because we have a moral obligation to join together to meet this challenge and to do so with the urgency this epidemic demands
726830 work closely with non profit government and private sector stakeholders to continue the fight against hiv aids
726831 by focusing efforts on reducing drug costs through greater market competition promoting prevention efforts encouraging testing targeting communities with high infection rates strengthening research and reducing disparities through effective public outreach we as a nation can make great progress in fighting hiv aids
726832 one of the tasks of the conference is to address the fact that there are three million people who now get the drugs but another nine million who do not

726897 a fellow christian may believe they have a profound fresh insight they seek to persuade others about it a healthy church gives space for such exchanges

727039 introducing agile after a little disruption can make them awesome by removing impediments
727040 most thats scientific i know shops are floundering and introducing agile can make them learn about why they suck and hopefully suck less
727041 i disagree with the assertion that developers are largely happy with their salaries
727042 companies work hard to keep their cash and typically only invest in the risky business of software when theres a lot more money to be made
727043 why put up with rubbish wages when you can earn more in another profession
727044 1 the reason most projects fail is down to the individual developers
727045 a real large chunk of em would do a bloody good job of it too
727046 its probably about right in terms of payment vs effort
727047 as for the roi argument i have to say there is a major management problem with the companies that behave the way youve described
727048 companies that undertake software projects with no thought to profits and then overpay developers to the point that theyre fat and happy are either doomed or up to something that we dont understand
727049 the fundamental problem ive seen in most projects is management
727050 if only they didnt have to write a quick fix for the release on friday and then once thats done theres another quick fix and another

727055 the incompetent programmers move on to become managers of some sort
727056 if you would run iq tests of everyone in a company and then compare them to salary i can guarantee that the programmers will turn out to be underpaid rather than overpaid
727057 programmers deserve blame though and they do so because they will accept doing dumb changes that lead to bad applications

727075 you fly all the way to portland and youre not going to sleep with him i mean get real
727076 well to be honest i wasnt sure how id feel or if he would even be able to open himself up to me again
727077 i know how it sounds but you dont know simon a big part of me really thought this weekend was going to be about closure
727078 just hear me out simon convinces the girl who broke his heart to fly up to see him years after the fact hears that she still has feelings for him that despite the fact that she broke it off shes never gotten over him and then sleeps with her but still manages to avert any sort of where are we going talk by playing the you hurt me card if that doesnt give a guy closure then i dont know what does
727079 hes probably just waiting until he has some clarity on the situation before he gets back in touch
727080 but based on my own experiences it doesnt look good
727081 it looks like im the fool who was checking the virgin atlantic site for getaway deals the night i got home it looks like im the girl who met a barbizon rep at the mall and quit high school to launch a modeling career with the money shes waiting to receive from a lucrative deal with a nigerian civil servant but knowing simon the way i do i cant honestly believe hed let me think we had a future if he didnt genuinely feel it too
727082 and i hope youre right but people change especially when people they love hurt them and whether or not simon intended it you have to be open to the possibility that this really was just meant to be one last great weekend
727083 a lot of that comes from the fact that many of the alt net crowd have made a living over the years cleaning up the aftermath of a mort attack i know i have i know firsthand that jeremy jeffrey scott and several others have also
727084 i think today ill accuse agilists of having an arrogance problem
727085 no i didnt hear her im sure it was just a mistake since the girl next to us is pregnant
727086 i honestly dont understand how kids find the energy and complete random behaviors that they do
727087 lord you seem to be having a lot of trouble with this one whats wrong with the standard model
727088 have you seen the specs on this order she has to be completely independent possess the qualities of both father and mother be a perfect hostess to four or forty with an hours notice run on black coffee handle every emergency imaginable without a manual be able to carry on cheerfully even if she is pregnant and has the flu and she must be willing to move to a new location ten times in seventeen years and oh yes she must have six pairs of hands
727089 dont worry we will make other military wives to help her
727090 i understand when she doesnt and say i love you regardless
727091 go to bed and get some rest you can finish tomorrow
727092 i am so close to creating something unique already this model heals herself when she is sick can put up six unexpected guests for the weekend wave goodbye to her husband from a pier a runway or a depot and understand why its important that he leave
727093 but she has the strength of a lion you would not believe what she can endure
727094 something is wrong with the construction i am not surprised that it has cracked you are trying to put too much into this model
727095 its for joy sadness pain disappointment loneliness pride and dedication to all the values that she and her husband hold dear

727107 we said prayers for them both at services this morning perry said
727108 you cannot persuade me there are not more disturbed or disgruntled persons with a political agenda in such a large group
727109 people given these kinds of responsibilities with this kind of power at their fingertips we have to make sure that they are not likely to do harm to others or misuse that authority be it intentionally or be it because of some mental problem
727110 these kinds of situations cry out for reexamination of our standards
727111 been adjudicated as a mental defective or been committed to any mental institution
727112 hiding it from your co workers that would have been very very difficult
727113 youre basically going to scare off any scientist from wanting to work in this field if it becomes even more stringent
727114 it is a balance its a policy decision about how stringent we want to be
727115 one of the complaints by people who work in safety and security is they cant get the time of day from people running the labs
727116 are viewed as deeply offensive by a lot of scientists as if their patriotism is being questioned
727117 though several agencies have a need to know no one agency knows the number and location of these labs in the united states
727118 the last few days have been a roller coaster of emotions as we celebrated with joy his historic achievement and now must try to come to terms with the untimely loss of a great son brother and friend
727119 my thoughts today are with the mcdonnell family as they come to terms with their great loss
727120 following so closely on their righteous pride and that of the country at gerard becoming the first irish person to scale k2 it is truly heartbreaking that they must now contemplate the loss of a beloved son and brother
727121 everyone knows that if we allow people to leave the gaza strip almost all the residents living there would try to cross the border into israel

727128 expand your ideas particularly in the areas of aging and immortality about who you can be
727129 in this time of energy acceleration it would behoove each and every one of you to add more oxygen to your being there are many ways to do this the most simplistic is to become consciously aware of your breath through the breath you can do many things you can activate the crystalline structures or deactivate the crystalline structures you can activate your own self you can clear energy that is coming between two beings purely by inhaling and releasing you can bring about a state of great calmness you can bring about a state of altered consciousness you can bring about a state of healing you can bring about eventually a state of teleportation and bi location and dematerialization this is all something that you are working towards
727130 thats the gayest thing you have ever sent me dont even do that again
727131 you are gay for taking a shirtless picture of john mayer real gay
727132 he was going to go out in a blaze of glory that he was going to take everybody out with him
727133 he did not seem to have any particular grudges or idiosyncrasies
727134 he was the last person you would have suspected to be involved in something like this
727135 when he feels that he has been slighted and especially towards women he plots and actually tries to carry out revenge killings

727143 in times of downturn ad spends are the first to be axed but this time because of increased competition firms dont want to lose their consumers to rivals
727144 also with inflation and interest rates going up firms were fearing consumers might trade their favourite brands with cheaper products to prevent such eventuality companies upped their spends to keep their connect with consumers intact
727145 in percentage terms we spent 10 of our consolidated net sales on media this year against 6 last year
727146 we thought other companies would be going slow on advertising because of the current market challenges and hence it will be a good time for us to reach out to consumers
727147 despite all the cost cutting we have not cut down on advertising expenses instead we increased our focus on out of home media this year
727148 the relaunch of cinthol was followed with aggressive ad campaigns increase in spends was essential not only to catch consumer attention for new products but to retain our market share in the existing categories as well
727149 if we look back at the best time to get into elan and biogen it was when the product was withdrawn in 2005
727150 as unrealistic as it might sound right now i think this could ultimately be a positive for the company
727151 ultimately it may help in valuing biogen as a potential take out candidate
727152 the challenge with investing in this stock is that it is now a potential time bomb

727264 it is clear that the government of iran has not complied with the international communitys demand to stop enriching uranium and isnt even interested in trying
727265 they leave the security council no choice but to increase the sanctions as called for in the last resolution passed

727289 i believe party unity calls for the delegates from florida and michigan to be able to participate fully alongside the delegates from the other states and territories
727290 today is a proud day for all of us who fought so hard to ensure floridians votes are fully counted
727291 his commitment to uniting the party and ending the uncertainty surrounding the process

727357 its good for everyone involved at the club to not only make the final but also to be hosting it its a first for a new zealand based professional club in this competition and i think thats great for football here and for the competition in general
727358 im sure the fans will really enjoy seeing another game at westpac stadium on wednesday evening
727359 we actually played pretty well there were no real concerns but it was just a couple of blips that resulted in goals but in the second half we were excellent we were pretty much all over them
727360 given that they really only had two training sessions together i thought the back four went well
727361 there was a little bit of miscommunication at times that led to goals but i cant blame them for that what impressed me most is that they got stronger and stronger and grew in stature as the match went on
727362 jeremy got a solid 90 minutes under his belt manny who has never played at a league level before did a good job and siggy was solid from there we were able to create a lot of pressure and we had lots of ball in the second half overall it was very pleasing
727363 weve still got some decisions to make and its important that we dont get too caught up in the emotion of making the final
727364 these are odious assaults on individuals and on the principles of free inquiry by which we live
727365 the primary focus is the safety of the detainees as well as the detainee guard force and thats why we have this intelligence activity
727366 guantanamo has become little more than a holding center for hundreds of men most of whom will never be charged with a crime and have nothing to offer the u s government in the way of actionable intelligence
727367 you always want to make sure you understand the mood of the camp
727368 if i see a change in behavior my question then will be well is this because of a new procedure ive implemented or is this just because its hot outside or ive got a new rotation of detainee guards
727369 i heard a couple girls screaming so i didnt get up cause it was dark
727370 then i heard a speed boat pulling out going really fast
727371 i saw one person who walked off the boat and everybody else was taken off by stretcher from there
727372 i think its horrible how anybody could do that and take off
727373 we need barrels and people to be aware that they need to slow down
727374 its a sluggish economy and its difficulties are felt all over
727375 that does suggest those folks are important for the spending outlook and the overall economic outlook
727376 consumer spending makes up 70 percent of gross domestic product and when one group accounts for a very substantial share of consumer spending they also account for a large share of the economic activity that creates jobs
727377 a lot of our clients stop by a deli on the way to the airport rather than have a catered meal on the plane
727378 were down to a total of two crews for three airplanes
727379 we face a very different environment for luxury indulgence in 2008 as compared to 2007
727380 a very difficult marketplace for luxury goods over the next five years
727381 people are examining do you keep the yacht do you go to the classic car auction do you take the private jet
727382 those sound like nice problems to have but at the same time they are issues
727383 the high end buyers out there are maybe more selective now but im willing to wait out the storm
727384 it had to do with the very specific characteristics in the dna of the letters and what was in bruces labs
727385 no rules so we could do the best and most compelling approaches
727386 clearly the most expensive case fbis ever undertaken and the most scientifically compelling case
727387 when you lose billy wagner thats very critical for us
727388 it got to the point where i couldnt locate the ball inside
727389 its a situation where were at this part of the season where you have time to take some time off
727390 i dont want to hamper the team and continuously fight an uphill battle when weve got it close in the division theres no use going out there and hurting the team by being something that youre not right now
727391 the more rest we give him the better off hell be
727392 its just precautionary i still feel it a little bit but its 100 times better than it was before
727393 i think he could use a day to catch his breath
727394 i wish i can explain it or someone can explain that to me its hard seeing tremendous defense tremendous pitching you go in there and dont do the job its disappointing
727395 no matter how sophisticated you make these automated systems youre not going to make them perfect and all you can really strive for is to tune them as you go along
727396 its pretty clear there was a lapse in terms of the quality control of yahoos keyword list
727397 leverages a combination of algorithmic and editorial processes to identify current relevant and popular terms
727398 we are really only in the infancy of this kind of automated analysis
727399 im sure its going to be expanding greatly not just in volume but in sophistication
727400 the quality of the content and the information is paramount
727401 you want to make sure youre striking the right balance between giving your readers everything the web has to offer with making sure theyre getting the right information and the relevant information
727402 if it does succeed its going to be done in a way thats subtle enough that its there for people who want it
727403 but its not going to be intrusive for people who dont
727404 its nice to not have the hiccups off your front foot when encountering nooks and crannies ripe for slapping

727444 if you dont stop hanging out back here ill have to put you to work
727445 a fellow christian may believe they have a profound fresh insight they seek to persuade others about it a healthy church gives space for such exchanges
727446 but the christian with the new insight cant claim straight away that this is now what the church of god believes or intends
727447 there is no theological defense for sacrificing a minority of the baptized
727448 we may not have put an end to all our problems
727449 it had to do with the very specific characteristics in the dna of the letters and what was in bruces labs
727450 no rules so we could do the best and most compelling approaches
727451 clearly the most expensive case fbis ever undertaken and the most scientifically compelling case
727452 is opposed to any change in our naturalization laws or any state legislation by which the rights of our citizenship hitherto accorded to immigrants from foreign lands shall be abridged or impaired and in favor of giving a full and efficient protection to the rights of all classes of citizens whether native or naturalized both at home and abroad
727453 we therefore call for the elimination of all restrictions on immigration the abolition of the immigration and naturalization service and the border patrol and a declaration of full amnesty for all people who have entered the country illegally
727454 youve heard of mental depression this is a mental recession we may have a recession we havent had one yet you just hear this constant whining complaining about a loss of our competitiveness america in decline weve never been more dominant weve never hard more natural advantages than we have today weve sort of become a nation of whiners
727455 a major export boom that is the primary reason that growth continues in the economy

727460 chevron views free trade and free trade agreements as extremely positive for countries throughout the world including
727461 these agreements lower the cost of doing business and provide greater access to more goods and materials
727462 this would add efficiencies and cut costs for development favorably influencing challenges in todays global energy market
727463 further by enhancing us exports it strengthens the currently most solid leg of a difficult domestic economy
727464 it will attract new investments that are already coming demanding due local talent benefiting a very healthy growth of our business
727465 the fta in colombia will allow the country to compete with practices of other countries promote investment in infrastructure of all kinds and generate international demand that can be supplied by local products or services
727466 it will bring more and better employment opportunities and the consequent poverty reduction
727467 the proposed us colombia fta should bring significant changes to the structure of colombias pharmaceutical market
727468 the us is already the largest source of imports for colombias pharmaceutical market meanwhile many colombian firms continue to struggle to meet the quality standards required to win export orders in the us the fta is likely to involve short term pain for many local drug makers as they are forced to increase manufacturing standards and take greater steps to improve the bioequivalence of their products however the longer term benefits of greater foreign investment should make these goals easier to achieve
727469 our forecast has been marginally downgraded due to slow progress on the ratification of the us colombia free trade agreement
727470 over time all colombian tariffs are eliminated creating substantial new economic opportunity for our exporters
727471 equally important this agreement will significantly advance our security interests in a region beset with instability and anti americanism
727472 looking ahead i do think we should begin by passing the post your comments
727473 for many years we thought our wines were the best
727474 then we got independence and we started to travel abroad we found that our wines werent the best
727475 the legislature to end censorship of discussion of religion in our founding documents
727476 any attempt to undermine or fundamentally change the ideals of the organization
727477 return to the original intent of the first amendment and toward dispelling the myth of separation of church and state
727478 america is a nation under god founded on judeo christian principles
727479 the public acknowledgment of god is undeniable in our history and is vital to our freedom
727480 a return to the original intent of the first amendment and toward dispelling the myth of separation of church and state
727481 theres more evidence in this section of a very confused reading of the constitution and of our history with a demand that we return to the original intent of the first amendment and toward dispelling the myth of separation of church and state i wonder what other constitutional amendments they think are mythical
727482 we are also thinking of sending two teams but we still dont know as so far we have not seen the details
727483 you want to know who theyre blaming for women voters breaking for hillary clinton over barack obama
727484 theyre blaming chris matthews people are citing specifically chris not only for his own views but also as a symbol of what the mainstream media has done to hillary clinton
727485 i didnt mean it in a mean way at all
727486 but i knew that it was just going to blow his mind
727487 trying to do it as if im keith isnt the best way to go
727488 and i feel like ive got a learning curve thats like the matterhorn holy mackerel
727489 you mean when i started working on aids in prisons was this where i thought it would end up yeah this is pretty much it phase forty seven of my master plan
727490 i knew like two women total who were doing treatment activism and i didnt totally get it im not like barbie math is hard but it was a techie world and i didnt feel like i could be all that helpful
727491 wicked expensive and wicked stupid and also mean so lets make the hospices get what they want and also do the right thing
727492 and i have no interest in new england hate winter dont like the country not fond of animals
727493 as it turned out it worked out for them i mean i hope it did i hope theyre happy
727494 we hope and expect to have her continue hosting a radio show on air america for a long time
727495 if oreilly hannity and beck can do that so can i
727496 weve seen the potential for greatness in rachel for years
727497 whats so remarkable is that now its coming so quickly this election cycle has propelled it forward in a meteoric fashion
727498 but his war policy stuff now is bullshit its total bullshit and ive never been impressed by it one or two brigades a month you want your son to be in the last brigade
727499 i have never and still dont think of myself as an obama supporter either professionally or actually
727500 liberated by having a professional role in which its probably better for me not to take sides
727501 she wants to talk about aids in prison and the constitution and the war in iraq policy is her main focus not winning elections
727502 im fascinated by the evil child actor twins that run poland
727503 how many bails of hundred dollar bills does it take to buy bread today in zimbabwe
727504 thats the most satisfying thing about being able to do my own story selection
727505 you get to pick that stuff and whoever is president or in control in congress is not going to affect that
727506 i love the idea that i am the voice of woman
727507 look at me its like really the one woman in the room is really mannish
727508 the only reason i get these opportunities is because of my sensibility
727509 im not being invited to do these things because of my looks or my facility with language what theyre after is the thing youre saying i have to trade off
727510 my instinct sometimes is to trade it off like oh im in the big leagues now so i better dial it back but they dont want it dialed back they are booking me or asking me to host because they like what they see
727511 avian flu weaponized nsf has found startling evidence that h5n1 virus may already have been genetically engineered to create a man made pandemic
727512 the world is in a constant conspiracy against the brave its the age old struggle the roar of the crowd on the one side and the voice of your conscience on the other
727513 qualsec is creating a hand held electronic device that can detect explosives communicable diseases and hazardous materials in real time with instant read out of the threat and its level of concentration in ambient air
727514 it does not require a majority to prevail but rather an irate tireless minority keen to set brush fires in peoples minds
727515 four weeks ago we gave the commodore the names of those we have enlisted and a full report of our work
727516 i assured him our team was ready to assemble the gcc and that wed completed the task he set us
727517 we have the names from the four provinces plus the remainder of the council to come from the minister of fijian affairs own selection
727518 we are confident we can get support from other provinces
727519 the council membership expired in march and we have taken up selection from here and other matters involving the council
727520 theyve damaged the cassava dalo and vegetables that were planted there
727521 tomorrow today a full scale survey will be carried out to verify the grievances raised
727522 some plants may have been damaged in the process of work but we will ensure that remedial action is taken to resolve the matter
727523 some have called to make appointments for oral submissions and others have called to say that their submissions are on the way
727524 the submissions were received in confidence and will be treated as such this was the guarantee given by government to those who would be making public submissions
727525 what is important is to ensure the work is done
727526 i fear this could happen again unless the court takes effective action against people who commit these crimes
727527 when they broke down a second door i woke up and locked the door to my bedroom where my wife was sleeping
727528 i did not fall but they punched me and my nose started bleeding so i had to sit down
727529 they demanded the key but i refused to give it
727530 so they simply opened the drawer got the money and jewellery and took off
727531 it is tiring but my mother told me i have no choice so i have to go and i like going to school being with my friends and learning something new every day
727532 in the afternoon they walk back the same four kilometres they reach home by dark are so tired and sometimes dont even feel like having dinner
727533 we cant send them because we fear they could slip and fall down the ravines we also worry they could get sick walking for long in the rain
727534 some days some of the children never make it to school they have their picnic somewhere in the jungle play around and come home as if they returned from school
727535 they pay a heavy price to get education walking long distances all we want is the six kilometre road from lakeba to naduru that used to be here years before to be upgraded
727536 for this medevac the message came through the us embassy
727537 he is going to china and will participate in the opening ceremony
727538 china invited the pm as well as leaders of other participating countries the minister for youth and sports normally attends the opening ceremony and the interim minister filipe bole will be attending
727539 you should note that all of the prime ministers trips are important in nature and there is a proper budget provision for them
727540 the commission interviewed the child who said she did not want to visit her father
727541 the commission then advised the director of social welfare who was directed by the magistrates court to write a report on the progress of visitation between the child and her father
727542 the commission informed the director about article 3 1 of the convention of the rights of the child
727543 in all actions concerning whether undertaken by public or private social or welfare institutions courts of law administrative authorities or legislative bodies the best interests of the child shall be the primary consideration we advised that the child be given a few visits
727544 however if the situation does not improve the director would need to submit a report to the court
727545 when we tested the residue we found traces of lsd but the consignment was empty
727546 the reality of these situations show we are no longer a paradise
727547 not all asians are bad and there are only some who do things behind our backs while most are law abiding citizens
727548 we were called in by teachers who discovered the state they were in
727549 when i asked the students why they were sniffing glue they said they were experimenting
727550 one of the students was vomiting and anothers nose was bleeding
727551 the next one will be held in labasa next week
727552 the overall theme of the convention is guided by gods spirit and each day had its own theme which linked to the main theme
727553 we are looking forward to meeting the mayor as it will be a meeting of resolutions and not one of confrontation
727554 the bags they still want to use no country in this side of the hemisphere uses them
727555 i will give a four point win win situation for the ratepayers council the environment and the private sector
727556 if you have a dirty town or city then that is tantamount to supporting the devil
727557 the nature of the evidence is equivocal it is clear from the learned magistrates judgment that he assumed the alleged offences were part of a joint enterprise
727558 however in such cases there will definitely be an investigation
727559 they have done their investigation maybe theyll be completing it early this week
727560 i never said anything like that i only said that i have a contract until the end of next year and then somebody made up that i will stop at the end of this year or the end of next year but i never said that
727561 the board strongly believes in the power of consultation and negotiations to resolve disputes but the same has not been reciprocated by the association
727562 as a commercial company afl will not be in a position to accept terms and conditions to which it was never a party and one it will not be able to sustain
727563 the state argued that the proceedings were properly sanctioned consideration is being given to an appeal against that ruling
727564 it is not an impediment to the laying of fresh charges of abuse of office against peli kete doviyaroi and josefa tiko tapele
727565 once the current trial has been completed and the outcome of the balance of the current charges is known the dpp will consider whether fresh charges should be laid
727566 this is just too much its been real hard for us coastal villagers because we rely a lot on fuel we basically need boats to move around from one village to the next
727567 the alternative is walking miles through the bushes and it can be a problem especially in times of emergency or when we need to get quickly to our destinations but because many cannot afford to buy fuel movement is pretty minimal now
727568 some who cant buy premix just fish around the mangrove area not far from shore but that is only for the familys meal to fetch fish good enough to sell would mean going further out to sea beyond the reef and for that one would need fuel for the outboard
727569 when people cannot fish to sell then they cannot buy other necessary staples for the family nor pay for their childrens education there is no other source of income
727570 the village soil is suited to planting yaqona or other commercial crops so we really have little choice in the matter except suffer out the difficulties brought about by increased fuel prices
727571 amid other responsibilities of oral hygiene the simplest responsibilities of oral hygiene is not negotiable and needs to be constantly observed to ensure we maintain the quality of life for the population
727572 we all accept the fact that we live in an evolving world which also brings with it ever evolving lifestyles and habits relating to every sphere of our lives in particular oral hygiene
727573 unfortunately the general public is so engrossed with other changes that it has forgotten the responsibilities associated with our well being and individual hygiene has not changed in fact if we were to change it would be towards an increasing demand to raise awareness to a higher level because of the ever dietary choices on hand
727574 thats an assumption i cant accept because i think the issue about what conditions a church lays down for a blessing have to be shaped by its own thinking and its own praying
727575 in these days together we have not overcome our problems or reinvented our structures that will still take time
727576 theres a big policy debate we should be having in addition to talking about the leadership
727577 junked the tb tony blair policy agenda but had nothing to put in its place
727578 remember therefore from whence thou art fallen repent and do the first works
727579 one thing i did wrong let segregation stay too long hold on
727580 the tour of world capitals and hot spots represented a test that was necessary to pass it looks as if hes done far better than just passing hes aced this tour if there was any doubt of his stature on the world stage i think hes more than answered that he hasnt put a foot wrong in any of these places
727581 it was this spirit that led airlift planes to appear in the sky above our heads
727582 at first truman was almost alone in thinking that an airlift would work as an effective response to the soviets
727583 inside the church gives the impression that it goes on praying night and day whether there are people in it or not
727584 christopher smart was a friend of samuel johnson see comments who died raving in a madhouse
727585 president bush has been working with the iraqis to encourage them to work out their differences and get the provincial elections law passed
727586 the struggle in the country is now turning from a sectarian to an ethnic one due to the kurdish behavior which poses a danger on the country
727587 there are efforts and wishes to end this crisis but they always fail due to the obstinacy of the kurdish parties that want to annex kirkuk at any price
727588 i hope they can reach a solution that fits all parties and prevents the situation from deteriorating further
727589 the mistakes of politicians brought us to this stage our social fabric was torn up in kirkuk and this is very dangerous for all of iraq
727590 it had to do with the very specific characteristics in the dna of the letters and what was in bruces labs
727591 no rules so we could do the best and most compelling approaches
727592 clearly the most expensive case fbis ever undertaken and the most scientifically compelling case
727593 when you lose billy wagner thats very critical for us
727594 it got to the point where i couldnt locate the ball inside
727595 its a situation where were at this part of the season where you have time to take some time off
727596 i dont want to hamper the team and continuously fight an uphill battle when weve got it close in the division theres no use going out there and hurting the team by being something that youre not right now
727597 the more rest we give him the better off hell be
727598 its just precautionary i still feel it a little bit but its 100 times better than it was before
727599 paris hiltons mother blasted john mccains presidential campaign sunday for an ad that likened to hilton saying the ad was a waste of of public money and time
727600 a completely frivolous way to choose the next president of the united states

727610 some people are for the very first time now accepting that there is a crisis

727614 in these days together we have not overcome our problems or reinvented our structures that will still take time

727870 benayoun contento in inghilterra se la roma contattasse il liverpool si potrebbe valutare la roma una grande squadra ma non c stato nessun contatto il mio assistito sta bene dove mai dire mai comunque
727871 la dirigenza del liverpool contenta di yossi e al momento non ci sono state richieste certo se il liverpool decidesse di venderlo la roma un grande club e sarebbe una soluzione gradita anche il calcio italiano importante
727872 so che vorrebbero prelevare un giocatore dallaston villa e forse qualcuno ritiene che prima di acquistare sia necessario vendere infatti xavi alonso sul mercato al contrario di benayoun fino ad ora
727873 lets see how many interesting event we can squeeze into one day
727874 ze wordt daar nauwelijks herkend het weer is geweldig en de omgeving prachtig
727875 het is alles wat ze wil ze wil het huwelijksfeest laten beginnen in het formentera hotel haar bruiloftplanners zijn boten aan het regelen om de gasten te brengen en ze zullen worden verwend met champagne cocktails en lekkere hapjes de receptie moet plaatsvinden in hotel can talaias
727876 dat is natuurlijk niet de bedoeling dus die hebben we ook opgepakt
727877 how many players on the team have a super bowl ring

727880 the business meritocracy is in vogue if meritocrats believe as more and more of them are encouraged to that their advancement comes from their own merits they can feel they deserve whatever they can get
727881 women are more likely to make an impact on negotiations when they convene as a constituency of women with a common agenda for peace
727882 the nearly 14 000 boys and girls who actually sign up for military service represent only a tiny fraction of the youths targeted annually by military recruiters who have become an ominous presence in elementary schools junior and high schools across the country where students as young as 11 can participate in cadet and training corps
727883 as our report documents it starts in movie theaters shopping malls and in public middle and high schools often undermining a communitys own norms or subverting the wishes of parents the militarization of community life affects not only the life prospects of those young people who actually enlist for military service but the educational and employment opportunities available to all youth it affects family life and inevitably changes the norms of civil society
727884 corporations like coca cola nestl suez and others that have joined the ceo water mandate have drawn criticism from around the world for practices that threaten peoples access to water
727885 although the stated purpose of the ceo water mandate is to make progress toward protecting water resources
727886 we are concerned that it is really a thinly veiled public relations effort by for profit corporations to gain greater control over water resources and services around the world this is a prime example of greenwashing and the u n should not be giving it credibility and support
727887 the united nations should play a vital and active role toward protecting water as a human right and ecological trust
727888 instead through the ceo water mandate the u n is helping to advance corporate control of water

727891 mass production and the attendant need to induce consumption on a mass scale has fooled marketers and manufcaturers alike into thinking that the best way to sell people things is to play to their sense of individuality you should buy this item because you deserve it you are special you alone matter an army of one snip we seem to take for granted taht everyone simply wants a bigger piece of the pie as the saying goes he who dies with the most toys wins but this logic just doesnt square with peoples behaviors sure there will always be customers who buy the supersized meal or grotesquely proportioned suv and there will always be employees who leave a job for nothing except a bigger paycheck but to put it simply these arent the happiest or most productive people around and catering to the survivalist impulse by which they live is no path to innovation its a road to isolation obesity and some of the worst attributes associated with american consumption

727914 that made it the hardest part of the whole thing for me it wasnt about how hard it was to fight the disease it wasnt about letting down my family and it was about letting down my fans the day that i got arrested and i had to wake up and see it all over the news
727915 i was just heartbroken because here i was an advocate for just say no and for all sorts of things that were positive and beneficial for children and i thought man look what ive done ive destroyed them and thats really unhealthy

727917 you know if im not working how anybody else can expect me to work for them if im not working i mean physically working my brain wasnt working

727976 wrva 1140 state and regional news at the top of the hour the special west virginia task force against civil unrest commanded by jay wilkes has swooped down on a secret mountain hideaway believed to be one of the many mountain bases of the ccc just within the last hour
727977 the wowk tv13 rapid response eye in the sky just moments ago showed live coverage of several wounded task force members being attended to on the ground and are unsure at this time of the number of opposing ccc now engaged in this gun battle with the specially trained task force
727978 there is no indication so far that the wife of the slain congressman lisianna rockefeller is present at this possible ccc compound lisianna rockefeller is wanted on charges of civil unrest from crooked county her many publications appearing in wv newspapers and national magazines speaking out about the deterioration of the middle class and the common citizens loss of rights she revealed were due to greedy public officials hording all the states and counties resources keeping control of industry for themselves she accused elected officials of controlling the political agenda of the courts and political parties and using their influence for only self gain and self involvement her numerous speeches about individuals being personally responsible by making themselves aware and active in change has led to a public demand for change at the voting booth but also made lisianna unpopular with state and local public officials her united we stand statement being of course her signature statement

727996 south carolina is to be the first of the united southern states of america
727997 but we are americans that believe in the rights of individuals with individual freedoms not lost people enslaved and controlled by corporations
727998 today you are not to fire your weapon unless fired on
727999 however if any plow boys are captured the rules will change and you are to use any means possible to achieve the objective of getting everyone out and back to the rendezvous area
728000 in eight hours all the mobile units traveling up from south carolina will be here to get you out if in fact this engagement goes long our number one objective is to get our refugees out safe
728001 communications gentleman our key to success is our communications so dont get that radio gear shot up
728002 captain lefsted will be in command of this operation and will out rank any ccc on the field today you are to take orders from him only
728003 our objective is to get our guys out of the area safely

728020 lieutenant pike you need to haul ass back here on the double one of the prisoners went for my gun and both tried to escape
728021 get your second lieutenant to allow the press down to the bridge then get the medical units to come clean this mess up
728022 listen gentleman there is no time to waste john here is going to go over with all of us exactly where we are and exactly where we are going on this map so just in case we all get separated you will have some idea of where our destination is
728023 we are currently at these coordinates according to the gps then we are going to try to find our way to this small access bridge on this private property about 2 5 klicks west of us then cut across the crooked river go south a ways then cut back headed east therefore traveling 180 degrees from our current course traveling through mostly private property then take a main road close to our ccc camp destination only having to walk the last 1 8 klicks to rendezvous with our troops
728024 looks to me like he was trying to set us up when he was found out he ran he had a tracker on him too
728025 i was going to ask you what happened but now i dont care and yes think youre right the man was a plant your correct about the tracker too i found it then heard some gunfire not long ago so one can only hope some of that hostile fire found him
728026 commander wilkes we already heard a report over the police band that two prisoners were dead is that true
728027 well im not going to stand here and answer a bunch of high pressure questions today im just going to report on this mornings unfortunate incident
728028 im not going to answer questions or give a press conference now im simply going to make a statement
728029 this morning a congressman of the united states was aiding and abetting those that our country feels are part of an organization determined to support the state of south carolina and other states in their threat of seceding from these united states of america during a time of war
728030 that organization is the ccc in which we are convinced that the congressmans wife lisianna rockefeller is not only a member but also an outspoken leader spewing forth with talk about individual rights and individual freedoms suggesting a new government for the state of west virginia by and for the common man which is nothing more than ridiculous rhetoric and communist propaganda
728031 a leading lawyer in which the task force issued a warrant for late last night joseph dickey a former crooked county commissioner was shot dead a short while ago while attempting to escape a short time later during a struggle in which the congressman attacked me in an effort to take my weapon the congressman was also shot dead both men are believed to be covert members of the ccc
728032 did the congressman really attack you are you sure he was a member of the ccc
728033 i told you all there would be no questions only that statement that is all wilkes informed the press again
728034 well you see it was about betsy no not another girl betsy is a c 47 thats been fully restored by the confederate air force in midland texas and col updike is flying her here with all the seasoned veterans in my company as we speak

728036 the state of south carolina your people man are making a statement today and youve been in the bush too long to know whats going on i just didnt want to tell you until it was time to
728037 inform commander wilkes we located the tracking device that comm center charleston monitored earlier this morning and we found light truck off road tracks that led further up into the woods away from the river less than one hundred yards away we need our 4 by units about 1 8 klicks east north east of the bridge pike out
728038 a vote will be heard tomorrow in the states of alabama and mississippi its predicted that alabama and possibly both states will pass their secession resolutions
728039 world news updates on the quarter hour heard only on richmonds news radio wrva 1140
728040 weve got our own problems john lets focus on that right now
728041 obviously you both know you have been promised renewed lives as good or better than the ones you had thats what youre doing here so just keep that in mind while you wait here
728042 i want you to stay hidden up in those trees

728044 see whats he got in the bag that you can make into a bandage and put some pressure on that wound
728045 ah ive seen worse keep some pressure on it and wrap it up for now
728046 if im not back in a short amount of time or if you hear a lot of gunfire you need to go up and beyond that point
728047 then get as far away as you can in that direction find a comfortable spot and stay put and well find you
728048 sgt have your men create another detour further up the road that will route all traffic away from this area
728049 also have detours set up further in town beyond the home of raymond randolph and instruct everyone to withdraw all the road blocks keeping officers on the scene to direct traffic but out and away from this area
728050 see to it that all those orders are carried out to my satisfaction
728051 also make sure that this area is completely closed off and get the proper vehicles to this location
728052 if there was anything else i would have told you about it now move your ass captain
728053 yes congressman jennings rockefeller is being held at gunpoint just on the west side of the bridge
728054 this is sylvia stanhope reporting from in front of the home of respected business man and financier raymond randolph owner of the concord hotel and the man responsible for planning and building the new randolph agri energy airport in central west virginia
728055 just opened for commuter flights the new airport is serving some of the more remote areas of west virginia
728056 having done some earlier interviews at the hotel by phone information was provided by a yet to be confirmed source that jennings rockefeller attended a formal dinner just last night at this very home
728057 the ccc is an underground group based in south carolina also is calling for secession from the united states of the government of south carolina
728058 the covert consolidated citizens corp that is partially made up of civilian militia has been smuggling out various individuals sympathetic to the southern cause
728059 some of the people that are reportedly involved have been singled out for various white collar and political offenses as we have seen brought to trial right here in crooked county
728060 it is believed that at this very moment congressman jennings rockefeller is being held at gunpoint about a quarter mile south of this location
728061 many believe that the wife of jennings rockefeller charleston journalist
728062 maybe we will know that information for sure by the end of the day

728083 its gonna be sad really rocky because you just might have to get divorced now that you are gonna be locked up and just think lisianna could be all mine yes rocky mine at last
728084 now dont these beat all where did you get this
728085 this was my ride home last night now get in show me where ya got those folks stashed john
728086 well ya know i really dont know those guys and was gettin kinda lonely
728087 but really i had to tell ya that lawyer guy dickey was getting on my nerves i think he has gotta be in with them crooked county boys since i saw him give the task force goons the nod just before they ordered us to pull it over
728088 well i would say were a little pressed for time now too ya know our job is not about getting information john
728089 our goal here is all about getting gone and gone quick
728090 sure is and now i think theyre possibly headed n ne into the woods so lets see how this little heep of a jeep does off road we need to head off that way also it looks like our mole had a tracker in his luggage and our guys found it
728091 lieutenant we lost your signal for a short time then it started coming in but very weak then went out again now it is broadcasting again but from a slightly different location but the signal is still weak
728092 also lieutenant aciss triangulated a call and were pretty sure it was the one researched that was placed to a pennsylvania cell phone from another location 6 klicks due west of the bridge
728093 roger that comm control i am returning to the bridge area with a prisoner thanks for the info keep me updated
728094 please take these handcuffs off me im on your side
728095 yeah yeah whatever tell it to commander wilkes yourself but i doubt that hell believe this tall tale lieutenant pike told the prisoner while leading him back to jay wilkes
728096 commander commander its lieutenant pike he has got one of the fugitives in custody
728097 looks likes one of your friends has been caught rocky
728098 i mean is she really as good as she looks
728099 since im hoping to find her soon and your going to be shall we say a little tied up
728100 i dont care what you do to me but if you ever lay one hand on her
728101 it seems to me that she isnt all that interested in you rocky or she would be living in that house right over there
728102 oh no i think she is more fond of the outgoing type like myself but you know it really doesnt matter what she thinks because soon she will be in my hands
728103 ill be sure to tell her that i saw you and even recently enjoyed your company for dinner
728104 in fact i plan on having your pretty little lisianna for dinner at my house if you know what i mean
728105 its lieutenant pike sir he wants to talk to you
728106 very good lieutenant keep two of your men in place and bring back your prisoner on the double
728107 get your second lieutenant doing something like moving those trucks to a command area so we can conduct this exercise in a professional manner
728108 clear that bridge at once i dont want to see anybody up there i can handle these two prisoners by myself
728109 our fugitives are obviously close by so close in lieutenant im going to be doing some interrogations and leave me your radio
728110 i couldnt set the tracking device until after we had already crashed in this suv because because when the ccc first picked me up i didnt have time then
728111 did you discover who the leader of the ccc was mr dickey
728112 i thought the driver was this x person you were looking for but then that man said something about being mr y and sang the mickey mouse song to me
728113 now i will ask it again mr dickey did you discover who the leader of the ccc was or not
728114 well i thought it was the driver of the suv but then i thought it could be mr johnson he sat up front and was a definite member of the ccc but i dont think he was the leader
728115 mr johnson ah yes we met mr johnson last night didnt we rocky
728116 in fact we had a wonderful dinner served by beautiful young women and then i was attacked by the most polite mr johnson
728117 so dickey you say that mr johnson was in the suv
728118 yes commander wilkes but i dont think he was the leader because he didnt really act like a leader of the ccc would act the driver was the one really running the show
728119 mr dickey did you or did you not find out who the leader of the ccc is yes or no
728120 you know rocky i often thought if only that pretty wife of yours wasnt married oh boy what i could do with that
728121 captain sgt purdy here we have two wounded task force on the ground and jt lt intact sir along with the ccc communications guy what do you want us to do with the wounded prisoners and what instructions do you have for the lieutenant sir
728122 listen purdy we went over this in the briefings you get jt lt and that ccc guy out of there and wrap those prisoners up and move it out now
728123 weve got attack atv 1 and 2 setting up our over run plan now you may have some retreating troops headed your way soon get that cargo back to betsy and have colonel updike give you our current position we are trying to extract big edi and blondie now
728124 yes sir but boutwell and his refugees are still out there captain
728125 you have your orders now you move your ass sgt
728126 i aint no sir yankee im a staff sgt in the 38 infantry division alabama plow boys and youre a wearing an american flag on your shoulder to us that means your an american nothing personal but you had somebody prisoner i came here to fetch and i aim to fetch him so your out of this now soldier now if you were a foreign nato troop im afraid this may all go a little different
728127 weve got to move and move now lieutenant so your on atv 4 and your ccc guy is with me on atv 5 as soon as we clear out of here ill explain
728128 very good sgt cage now zero in with those mortars and make sure no more choppers can get close to that lz
728129 you dont want to get near the camp colonel boutwell its been over run according to the last report i am under orders to get everyone back to the plane asap
728130 much obliged sgt and thanks for being here must have been some crazy deal getting called out in the middle of the night last night
728131 we need to get these men to safety sgt along with jr there
728132 colonel sir big edi and lisianna rockefeller are on that ridge in those pine thickets they were spotted by a task force chopper captain lefsted squads over there
728133 be careful man now go get your girl and try not to get killed doing it
728134 they must have moved out in a hurry commander all their equipment is still intact and appears they left a lot of gear in their comm shack
728135 it used to really get on my nerves when you always told me that i had nothing to worry about that i was in good hands you know back before we left that house we were stuck in for weeks i was mean to you back then but i was scared then too i just didnt want to show it i was really mean and im sorry
728136 forget about it lil lissi none of that matters now
728137 edi could you tell me could you tell me now dont worry everything is going to be ok and that im in good hands
728138 lisianna dig deep and grab a hold of yourself because if i start shooting i need you to run as soon as you hear the first shot get through this pine thicket and try to climb as high as you can where we stowed our provisions and gear
728139 this is re con 2 to commander wilkes youve got an e vac trying to land close to the camp but they are taking on some heavy fire so are unable to land at this time e vac is requesting permission for mobile units to be sent thats the bad news the good news is ive got a positive image of your fugitives on my topaz f l i r i can walk ya right in over
728140 roger that commander wilkes youre very close less than two hundred yards
728141 obviously there must be another ccc camp around here and find out what in the hell happened to pike
728142 joint west virginia and government task force troops are engaged in a bitter battle today at an undisclosed location with members of the secreted ccc based in the state of south carolina we reported earlier today the vote of representatives from south carolina declaring secession from the united states over the disagreement of a declared war by americas first black president and the decreasing rights for individuals in the us the lower standard of living for the middle class being the root cause
728143 at least 27 wounded have been flown to a local riverview west virginia hospital and an undetermined amount of dead and wounded are still on the battlefield one of the walking wounded being treated at the hospital expressed concern that the task force is facing at least platoon strength or maybe company strength hostile forces your listening to wrva 1140 state and regional news at the top of the hour every hour
728144 i arranged with my accountant to have checks delivered to both of your families that will make things comfortable for them while were gone we have no choice but to leave considering the fact we would eventually have to face mr wilkes if we all stayed you will still be paid your regular salary and more while were gone so try not to worry in a few hours we will be staying in columbia south carolina and well just enjoy a nice paid vacation
728145 it was reported earlier today that congressman jennings rockefeller was killed helping ccc members escaping crooked county with william parker and sam gray both businessman were wanted on special task force warrants also on that most wanted list was former crooked county commissioner joseph dickey who was killed earlier today along with the congressman many others including the congressmans wife lisianna rockefeller had fled the area prior to todays surprising and chilling fugitive chase and gun battle
728146 it was asserted that these escapes were organized by a band of ccc whose daring seems to be unparalleled and who from sheer desire to be involved in fighting for individual rights and freedoms have a dedicated purpose in snatching away lawful victims destined for bad ends at the hands of an elite group of public officials that lisianna rockefeller refers to as crooked county crooks
728147 these rumors of the magnificent ccc soon grew with outrageous fervor there is no doubt that this band of the ccc does exist moreover they seem to be under the leadership of someone whose pluck and fearlessness are almost famous astonishing reports are now unmoored of how the ccc and those whom rescued became suddenly invisible as they broke through barricades and escaped down the crooked river by sheer phantom alliance
728148 just hours ago an entire specially trained task force detachment of over 20 men were held at bay at the edge of the secret ccc encampment by just one man within that same hour that man simply vanished from the prisoner guard escort that had taken him into custody
728149 the rebel angels of the ccc according to intercepted task force broadcasts are currently guarding the sweetheart of the south the dynamic darling fighting for the rights of the common man lisianna rockefeller
728150 all the news all the time only on wrva 1140am
728151 the man you had for dinner last night his name was johnson he was from the ccc wasnt he mr randolph
728152 when i start firing you run just like i told you
728153 commander wilkes one fugitive on the run headed south through the pine thicket one fugitive firing from previously disclosed location
728154 colonel put me in touch with captain lefsted i know the lay out of that terrain almost as good as colonel boutwell ill show you everyones position on my map of black horse 2 and the surrounding area
728155 you mean you need to get right back out there sir
728156 i got a better idea lieutenant how about i start everything off on the right foot
728157 so hows this good to see you lieutenant i heard all about your rescue of the ccc communications man you did a fine job out there son
728158 thank you sir but with all due respect ive got something very important to convey to all in the field so i would like for you to try to show me the position of lisianna along with lefsteds attack squad and purdy sir
728159 i can do that lieutenant now you need to slow down so i can assimilate all of this intelligence correctly then against my better judgment im gonna let you back in the field just as long as you dont go doing something stupid like getting yourself killed
728160 please keep her safe and tell her that i love her
728161 shes just below that jutting rock ledge on the dark side need to get out of here and refuel
728162 welcome to my web looks like you ran yourself right into it and now your all mine to do with what i will
728163 youre single because i killed your husband this morning just so wouldnt have the burden of being married when i finally caught up to you
728164 the last thing he said just before i shot him was your name
728165 jennings saved my life lil lissi without him i wouldnt be here he pulled me out of a wreck on the river and told me to tell you that he loved you and asked me to keep you safe
728166 i think so i think he knew last night after dinner but that may take some time to explain
728167 a west virgina mountain lion must have got him from the looks of it
728168 were taking you to jt lt sir and then were all double timing it back to betsy so its radio silence from here on in
728169 thats a pretty long story im afraid it will have to wait
728170 we all really do call him x but what i want to know lisianna is what are you gonna call the baby
728171 if its a boy were going to call him jennings and if its a girl her name will be jenny and

728197 you say he had no choice but to try to nearly strangle mr wilkes to death
728198 no i didnt say that all i meant was that he was protecting the the girl the waitress uh the caterer nicolette i believe her name was
728199 that is all i have to say about the incident i need to get to my office on time this morning
728200 ok mr rockefeller sorry to bother you at such an early hour however i may want to further verify some facts at some point in the future once i gather more information
728201 oh have you heard any news about your wife lisianna anyone try to contact you or disclose her possible whereabouts
728202 my father the senator has any updated information about the disappearance of lisianna i assure you sgt

728204 now if you can please excuse me i have a very busy day ahead of me
728205 yes its me please tell everyone ill be in the office later this afternoon
728206 looks like the police have formed a road block up ahead
728207 well we cant turn around or we will certainly draw attention to ourselves usually one person is assigned the duty of looking for just that we need to bs our way through this and get past that bridge and across the crooked river then we deal with what comes our way next
728208 would you pull your vehicle over to the side of the road please sir
728209 yes this is mr randolph staying in the vip suite is a mr binder and an associate of his named mr johnson also staying in the adjoining executive suite will be checking out before six am an urgent business matter needs some immediate attention would you be so good as to connect me with their room
728210 yes sir ill try but its only a few minutes before 5am
728211 ya know i noticed you didnt take that off until you were here in camp for awhile guess you found a better use for it
728212 it was my security blanket i guess and now its my pillow hey hope you dont mind if i hang out in here for awhile
728213 i was hoping we would get some word on whats up
728214 hello this is the front desk is a mr binder or mr johnson available i have a call waiting from raymond randolph
728215 you and your buddies i noticed seem to have a catch phrase going of
728216 that deplorable wilkes will wake up any minute now and all of us will pay the price for whats happened you need to call off your plans and get out
728217 is your end buttoned down and are you ready to get our guys out of here
728218 well nothing is as planned now we dont have the truck were suppose to be painters what the
728219 well take the rented vehicle pick up the first two refugees at the bar as arranged then pick up your mickey mouse buddy by 0700 then plow right down the middle of town and out of crooked county like nothing is wrong
728220 listen im getting both of you out of here for awhile we may all be gone for a long time but tell no one for now
728221 this was hardly worth it i know but i will more than make this up to you later today now go use the van just bring it back to the concord later this afternoon
728222 get over here right now what do you mean where am i
728223 i am in the same place you saw me last night and somebody assaulted me
728224 black horse two this is ground base one listen for my short count 5 4 3 2 1 repeat 5 4 3 2 1
728225 wxyz jtlt repeat wxyz jtlt three amigos es que pasa su casa
728226 why dont you talk to haines longer and find out whats going on
728227 john t and x are on the way with the contraband they must have just checked in with haines so they are on their way obviously their plan is to come here and we will all get out of here together at least that was what i heard in the radio message
728228 i know you heard about the road blocks but these guys have done this before this is not their first rodeo plus jt is lucky
728229 his whole unit was wounded once and he came out clean without a scratch not even a bruise hes real lucky thats why x is using him for this last trip
728230 we heard all we need to hear these task force guys have helicopters that fly out of charleston and they have rdf which means we have to keep it short or they will beam in on us
728231 youve go to do it now and thats an order
728232 i had guests last night jay got a little drunk and scooped up one of the servers onto his lap she started screaming one of my guests came to her aid and thats all there was to it
728233 and you said that the congressman was here and he also witnessed this
728234 ill bring both servers down to courthouse to make statements later
728235 ok then i guess im free to go to talk to the congressman
728236 oh and before i forget sir the hotel doesnt cover anything other than local calls and you made a call to midland texas
728237 also mr randolph asked me to give you this from the kitchen
728238 please tell mr randolph thank you well certainly be looking forward to our foursome at the shore next weekend
728239 john get me out of here and now and texas texas who the hell did you call in texas
728240 you better not have called any of those damn plow boys
728241 im really getting tired of hearing that every ten minutes
728242 yes but you werent and i brought you something to eat
728243 ya know my father is a jewish guy from new york
728244 i dont think this is what he had in mind for his daughter
728245 well i dont think he wanted his daughter hung by the neck on a crooked county tree either so maybe you better find jesus and listen to everything i say because this is one trip we have to do in daylight
728246 very difficult water ahead and im no sailor in fact i get sea sick
728247 just do as i say and we should be fine as i am going to take the path of least resistance
728248 were headed down river and we need to get to our rendezvous point before it gets dark after our guide takes us to the camp then we can rest for a few days
728249 paddle when i say to paddle and dont screw up your right from your left
728250 just shut up and paddle no left left god damn it
728251 well at last the famous jr the mighty ranger himself
728252 ive waited a long time for this day but hurry there is no time to waste we need to make the camp before dawn
728253 hey kemo sabe were going to have to stow some of your gear underground until we can come back and get it as only smokey and i here he pointed to the horse could make it this trip
728254 whose stupid idea was this and they were gonna get us all killed
728255 shut up you big paluka just get this done so we can get out of here
728256 now why do all you boys from alabama think us west virginny boys are yankees i never could figure that out we aint no yankees thats for sure
728257 im not sure but if i was sure im not certain that you would believe me so ill just say i dont know
728258 i saw your man alone for a few minutes at the base camp a couple of days ago
728259 x had just smuggled out three more formerly prominent people from crooked county just the day before
728260 but none of them carried a bounty such as you lisianna you certainly seem to be the prize that everybody wants
728261 you talk too much yankee maybe its time just to keep rolling along
728262 it seems the crooks have grown rather tired of us and have brought in a hired gun an assassin if you will
728263 looks like you got that gal of yours out of crooked county just in time
728264 take a load off weve got less than an hour to go and well be going just beyond that peak
728265 ive got to talk to you as soon as we get to camp
728266 here this is from x i wanted to wait for the right time to give it to you we havent really had a chance to talk ya know
728267 hey lil lissi is everything ok just like a wild animal lisianna jumped on edi and hit him as hard as she could with both fists and screamed
728268 dont you ever go off and leave me by myself again
728269 until x has finished all reconnaissance and tested the strength of the immediate threat of our adversary he thought it best that all ccc should meet as seldom as possible involving any business of the ccc and on no account should talk to each other in public places until more information was gathered
728270 when x wants to speak to us he will let us know
728271 and that was delivered the morning before you and lissi arrived at black horse two
728272 down among the south carolina pines you spent most of your time in deep thought
728273 so now to be or not to be is the question ive got a feeling about you then changes come about and i never get the chance to tell you so hopefully we will soon find ourselves down by the crooked river again
728274 im used to seeing your face from the crowd and i remember that day when you thought you saw me i knew then that i only wanted to be with you and if only we could be free
728275 ill go to see randolph tonight and youll have to make sure everyone is ready by 7am tomorrow make contact asap and secure the departure
728276 its the new gps global positioning indicator when we get back this afternoon you need to memorize some coordinates
728277 you need to make sure everyone knows that i will secure the vehicle tonight from randolph and well be disguised as painters the refugees will be in the back of the truck under tarps we should look like a couple of guys just going about our regular business so dont bother shaving tonight and try to scruff yourself up a bit tomorrow
728278 also thanks for being here its hard to know who to trust anymore
728279 hey man you always knew you could count on me besides i still owe you money
728280 you got the number for haines just north of us right
728281 as you know cell phones are a no no but keep yours to use only in a dire situation then if you have to use it throw it away because that phone can be used to track you get a message to haines so he can get the word out always if something happens just do your best to get back to black horse two and then well go from there
728282 whats the other coordinate that i need to know about
728283 its a place where i asked jr to stow some of the camps provisions and of course the main camp now john
728284 im going to see randolph im walking the back way and i should be back in about an hour or so make sure you get word to haines and keep it brief just say my friend says to pack up old smokey tonight
728285 haines will get word to the camp so they know its all a go then its south carolina here we come
728286 you would know better than me as to the safety of the beautiful lisianna but i do have to tell you i cant help you any longer
728287 you see jay wilkes came by my office today he must have asked me twenty questions and bragged about capturing the infamous x and lisianna rockefeller and all of the ccc from south carolina
728288 wilkes seems to know something only i dont know exactly what so i wont be able to let you use that work truck and im afraid other than the funds ive given you its altogether become a bit of a bad situation
728289 so i need you to have one last drink and all i can say is i wish you the best of luck im expecting jennings for dinner this evening and im sure you may feel uncomfortable in his company given the situation
728290 is there anyway we can somehow blend in with one of your other businesss while we work out some other solution
728291 but now im moving into investment banking and was maybe going to try to talk my friend raymond here into letting me get in on that new shopping mall and grocery store that hes breaking ground on i heard about some plans to put in a nice family restaurant too
728292 so thats where you worked in the insurance business charleston
728293 the insurance business has been getting hit hard lately with all the tornados hurricanes floods and general bad weather in fact i would think as a whole the insurance business was doing badly
728294 what was the name of that ceo that killed himself you know that one where the company lost all its assets and all of the employees benefits were lost the dominant nature of wilkes permeated the entire room so
728295 actually that was davidson mr wilkes b p davidson i should know he was my boss for many years
728296 thats most likely jennings hes expected for dinner would you all like to stay
728297 good evening jennings please come in youre just in time
728298 of course youve met jay wilkes the commander of the special task force
728299 dont mind them gentleman please report back to the courthouse and then you can go for the evening
728300 my friend says to pack up old smokey tonight w y z at 2 5 ground base out
728301 when haines said eyes up head down indicates that we might be up against it this time
728302 the lamb shank is slow simmered in rosemary mint sauce and served with creamy spinach and artichokes
728303 the coffee is a european blend and the tea is organic
728304 how about a romantic dinner for two there little nicky
728305 we can have some leftovers after everyone has turned in for the night
728306 its all very wonderful and i havent seen this much food even at christmas
728307 im really glad you all could come tonight and as you can see i was able to arrange a very special dinner for us its a bit of an experiment really we are planning on catering a rather large party for the private republican party conference meeting so i guess you should all consider yourself guinea pigs really
728308 i love being part of your experiment raymond in fact i may volunteer for this more often
728309 speaking of guinea pigs and experiments i heard your father offered a reward that is 250 000 more than the bounty on your wife rocky
728310 well mr wilkes it is my belief and the belief of my family that lisianna has actually very possibly been kidnapped
728311 we are fully aware of the warrant for her arrest and are offering a reward for her safe return so that we may prepare a proper defense we feel confidant she is innocent and that we can defeat these charges
728312 what you really mean is your daddy is gonna try and buy her back for you isnt that right rocky
728313 she is innocent mr wilkes i assure you i have lived with her for over two years i should know
728314 i bet she not so innocent at all rocky i bet shes waking up the neighbors where ever shes hiding with loud sensuous moans from some sort of illicit sexual liaison there mr high and mighty
728315 most certainly not mr wilkes and i will not have you talking like that about my wife
728316 ill bet someone is having a nice meal tonight and i bet it s rockies wife
728317 thats enough mr wilkes i will not be talked to this way
728318 excuse me gentleman ill be right back and maybe we can start this conversation all over
728319 maybe we can change the topic of conversation i would like to hear more about mr wilkes exploits after all raymond myself and even you jennings are all really quite boring
728320 when i return to the table i am hoping to enjoy some of that european coffee that lovely nicolette suggested x added
728321 after coffee we will be serving champagne that jennings brought me that was left over from his parents 50th wedding anniversary if youre all still in the mood
728322 i do say lisianna looked especially stunning that night jennings that dress was an original wasnt it
728323 with all honesty rocky your wife looked as delicious that night as this rack of lamb
728324 if she were my wife i would have had my head buried in that cleavage all night
728325 in fact i almost have to wonder about something it seems to me youve been married for some time now i would have thought you would have conceived of a baby rocky by now
728326 weve thought about children but i dont see how that is any of your business mr wilkes
728327 now you dont have to get snippy with me rocky just so you know everything that goes on in this town is my business and now with a half million dollar bounty on your pretty wife with the ample cleavage shes my business too
728328 certainly sir and would you like some after dinner candy too
728329 expect the unexpected thats the number one rule of the ccc
728330 its part of a call sign really it makes a lot of sense to those in the know but the popular take is the obvious anonymous innuendo
728331 so let people think what they want but the truth of the matter is my friends really do call me x its the short version of my military call sign
728332 well now i see what you mean about expect the unexpected
728333 i never expected to meet someone known as just x
728334 i want to thank you mr johnson for teaching that barbarian a lesson
728335 mr wilkes is by far the most wretched human being ive ever had the disservice of dining with
728336 were going to have to stop by my house first mr johnson as i live so close i decided it would be better just to walk over in fact i think i will take this opportunity to take the jeep out for a test drive as it was just returned from the shop today
728337 its lisiannas jeep actually she likes to travel far back onto our property to think and read she says and wont let me come with her i hate to say i have to go along with her wishes as she is quite a talented journalist if i do say so myself
728338 wait here a moment while i go inside to get the keys to the jeep
728339 hop in mr johnson and oh by the way where are you staying
728340 the concord hotel just out a little ways on the north side of town
728341 well yes its just that i forgot something thats all
728342 the level of radar interference on the 440 mhz band suddenly became worse than its ever been making our 445 20 repeater temporarily useless
728343 hold on there yankee i have no idea what youre talking about explain things so that a plow boy like me can understand it
728344 we need to huddle up here and hopefully get word then make sure we are ready to head em out soon as john t and x get here with the walking contraband
728345 we still need 2 meters as a viable backup option to 222 and 440 mhz
728346 our 224 08 system worked fine but jam haines and myself do not have reliable 222 mhz capability hence the need for 440 or 2 meters
728347 440 mhz is usually preferred over 2 meters due to the penetration situation and lesser amount of intentional qrm problems on 440
728348 it means that the new private airport with all of its high band ils and its modern radar screw with us because of the their transmit power and the fact that its just five miles over that hill and were just a little higher than their tower
728349 not since we last heard guess all we can do is sit here and wait hopefully well have time to get the word out and were on our way
728350 we should plan to activate this station on a more regular basis maybe every first monday to keep the equipment in place and in ready to operate condition
728351 whatever man im getting some bunk time let me know whats up
728352 have you heard of the ccc the consolidated citizens corp
728353 its no bother really we have shared quite an exciting night this is the least i can do
728354 oh by the way i appreciate the ride that was very thoughtful of you to ask
728355 i really think raymond was much to upset with me to drive me back here himself
728356 some people say that lisianna is now a full fledged member of the ccc and she may indeed be one of them
728357 you mean like patty hearst and the sla i was just a kid when i had to study the subject in high school
728358 they are nothing like the sla was jennings immediate response the sla were all criminals with guns its been said that the ccc never use weapons unless in self defense
728359 the ccc are a dedicated congregation of individuals fighting for their rights and the rights of others really i think they arent very far off in the thinking of the people that founded this country
728360 im sure wherever lisianna is she is safe and being well taken care of
728361 well i do tonight was all that was said as x sat in the chair and contemplated the moment
728362 let every nation know whether it wishes us well or ill that we shall pay any price bear any burden meet any hardship support any friend oppose any foe to assure the survival and success of freedom
728363 we will not waver we will not tire we will not falter we will not fail
728364 we confide in our strength without boasting of it we respect that of others without fearing it
728365 well you need to know its up to you to figure which one of these would fit best on my headstone
728366 ok lay it on me an dont hold nothing back
728367 guess who knocks on the door of that big fancy home i showed you earlier in the day within seconds of hearing randolph cant help us
728368 from the look on your face i see its true
728369 but it even gets better than that who do you think showed up minutes later
728370 however that was the correct answer instead of jim hendrix earlier
728371 yea we had dinner and he gave me a ride home
728372 well ya know i figured i could sit here and count the minutes and be tense and nervous or i could just hope that time would go by quick and before ya know it you would be back so i got the message to haines but i waited until after i thought you would already be back and then headed back to the bar
728373 thats good but we need to send another tonight or maybe not because its not gonna be a good one
728374 did you get with our refugees john did you work everything out
728375 yes the bar owner i spoke with him again tonight he and the lumber dude will be in the bar but now that you say the deal with randolph is off what the heck do i tell them
728376 i havent worked that out yet john we cant use the truck that whole deal is off
728377 met him in the library parking lot and just as i was leaving he asked me if i was the man some people call x
728378 i just said y but he mistakenly thought i said why so he answered
728379 then i cleared the matter up by saying no i said y because i like you
728380 thats where i ran into my cousin in fact thats the line i used to introduce myself i started the conversation with hey arent we related ha ha
728381 actually i did but i just said john no last names nobody knows me around here ive seen those wilkes dudes all over town they have no idea that im anybody they should be talking to
728382 oh yeah then why is it randolph says its hot now
728383 because he is convinced our situation is much too hot
728384 how did it go with jay wilkes the big shot law man himself
728385 well you could say hes a bit choked up right now
728386 oh but i did i figure it takes about 4 minutes to asphyxiate someone im not really sure but i think i had him at a good three before i let go of him
728387 were gonna do our job john and were gonna get out of here
728388 if anyone approaches that suv without me being there ill shoot them myself
728389 thats the only direction you need to be thinking about and if you dont get me to that vehicle quick ill shoot you too
728390 get away from the vehicle get away from the vehicle
728391 driver put your hands up and step away from the vehicle
728392 dont mind him hes just in a bad mood he hasnt had a date in over a year can you help with this
728393 is mr johnson ok please please see about mr johnson
728394 john t confirms after a quick check of the mans condition then says to sam gray

728400 you know sir some of the sheriffs were concerned this morning during the questioning of raymond randolph that you may have assaulted a young woman at his home last night
728401 thats a lie and if any of the crooked county sheriff s ever think about mentioning something that ridiculous again ill have them all shot
728402 that guy cant hit anything with that shotgun from where hes at
728403 youre the only member of the plow boys that has less rank than when he joined why do you think that is
728404 go john and go now thats an order pick up your weapon and get out of here soldier

728436 widespread death destruction and terrorization of millions upon millions of the earths inhabitants
728437 proprio da quelli che oggi sono in prima fila contro il suo
728438 september 11 has become the catch all excuse for virtually every proposed expansion of government power
728439 one example is a national identification card and data base long desired by some in government and which was mandated by legislation passed by the congress in 2005 with the support of both senators mccain and obama although i was no longer in the congress when this bad legislation was passed i had vigorously opposed it in the years since it became law just as i led the successful effort to rescind a previous mandate for a national id card
728440 the real id act establishes a new and privacy invasive national id card program by forcing states to standardize their drivers licenses and creating a vast national data base of private information on the citizenry the law establishes through the back door something americans would never have accepted directly a national identification card
728441 there was no open and honest vote on real id the mandate was slipped into a supplemental appropriations bill discouraging any real debate over the issue
728442 creating anything close to a national id card threatens americans basic civil liberties and privacy while doing little or nothing to make us more secure
728443 means higher fees longer lines and greater inconvenience for americans getting a drivers license the burden on states which have to redesign and remake state licenses and include all manner of information on citizens applying for new drivers licenses would be extremely high and immensely costly since they would have to restructure computer databases security systems verification measures and more
728444 technically no one has to have a federally approved license
728445 that is unless you want to get on an airplane or visit a u s courthouse a veterans affairs hospital a social security office or any other federal building americans once could live their lives with minimal contact with the federal government but that is impossible today
728446 but the onus for dealing with real id falls on congress
728447 as president i would submit legislation to repeal the law i also would use my authority as president to limit the laws impact to the extent allowed by law establishing privacy safeguards extending compliance deadlines and relaxing license requirements protecting the peoples liberties and privacy is central to governments role not an afterthought factors obviously not important to my opponents in both the republican and democratic parties who supported the real id act

728450 if you look at this table iv b7 youll see that past present participants have received 17 4 trillion more in benefits than they paid in taxes
728451 but another way of measuring things is by birth cohort how did all the taxes paid by individuals born in a given year compare to all the benefits they have or will receive
728452 3 we know that early cohorts received more in benefits than they paid in taxes and current future retirees will receive less in benefits than they pay in taxes therefore we can conclude 4 that the infinite horizon shortfall is entirely attributable to the fact that early cohorts of retirees received far more in benefits than they paid in taxes

728469 unlike some of his followers at least he admits that his motivation is technological advancement and not promotion of the four freedoms

728503 although the market may get off to a sluggish start a number of companies will benefit from a weaker australian dollar and talk that the reserve bank may cut rates in the coming months
728504 in fact with the market pricing in rate cuts the ride for the australian dollar could be pretty rough over the next six months

728511 we formed the group around the year of 2001 me and s1 were in a group called symbolic elementz while myone was a solo artist we were working with on several collaborations
728512 there was a female by the name of lysoul who i went to high school with and we were also collaborating with her anyway since we were all working together we decided to join forces and put out something creative and soulful
728513 i would have to say that we always try to just do us not saying that other independent artists dont but whenever we do us its a certain sound that we bring that separates us from others
728514 our management team hooked up that up for us based on their relationships in the industry and things turned out well we are grateful and thankful to have been on a track with such a well known and talented emcee as ghost
728515 too many artists to name laughs nah seriously i would say artists like prince stevie wonder lenny kravitz red hot chili peppers rakim redman a tribe called quest outkast and dungeon family de la soul the roots nas pharcyde hieroglyphics krs one pete rock and c l smooth gangstarr boot camp click busta rhymes miles davis charles mingus and many jazz greats really im influenced by so many i know i have left off quite a few
728516 weve worked with erykah badu little brother darien brockington yahzarah toby and kay from foundation and our whole aeonz crew on production theres ninth wonder vitamin d jake one illmind foundation and myself it was a blessing to work with all these artist when we began the project we started building with them and it was only right for us to start working together because we all loved respected each others work
728517 just yesterday i laughed just because no particular reason happy to be alive thankful for my sfp brothers and just blessed to work on my music
728518 we dont know where to start cause so much has changed but we will say their needs to be more of a balanced platform it seems so one sided in the mainstream its kind of sick depressing but hopefully we can have more people take risks and give more opportunities for new artists to breakthrough
728519 during my teenage years i played sports and just normal teen stuff although i noticed my tastes in music and over all mentality was quite different from most of my peers so i was kind of like an out kast in a sort of way and i was real observant of my surroundings but i was very proud of the music i listened to music became my art my way of expressing my feelings and life in general
728520 somewhat i do actually i hear a lot of elements from the first record in love rain down i think that there has been a lot of growth musically
728521 i had the pleasure of working with myron davis and rodney jones again additionally musicians james penn pete tokar and tony pulizzi were in on my set
728522 moja music which consists of josh honigstock and myron davis hooked the whole dome situation up they are great
728523 i write about what i feel at that time if i choose to focus on life matters then ill write about it im definitely aware of life matters i can only share whats through my lens
728524 i was always a musician growing up i was surrounded by music and i remember continuously having family gatherings where i would show case my voice
728525 id like to work with dj jazzy jeff stevie wonder prince chico debarge frank mccomb dangelo lauryn hill and many more
728526 i enjoy the freedom of creating whatever i feel and not being pigeonholed i am accountable for what i do music and people inspire me when listeners receive me it inspires me
728527 i try to surround myself by positive people i dont like a lot of negativity no set dates but were working on it
728528 the deal is in a process as in a sense im working with these guys they liked the music and thats the most important thing that they are willing to invest money accordingly to help people hear the music i think jake had heard some of my music through a dj friend of his called nick the record initially my first contact with jake was when he invited me to do a gig in hastings which is where hes based i went up with a five piece and did some tracks from the album and played some new material that id written he liked it and proposed a deal
728529 the vinyl deal is very different from your standard deals jake believed in the music and frankly the position that i was in i was like i need to get this music out people need to hear it so let me just go with this ride the waves and see what other fish come up the ep is more of a compilation two tracks have been taken from the twisted blue folk album which i recorded but jake had heard that and the live things so he put a proposal together for the ep
728530 eska mtungwazi and heidi vogel got invited down to the studio but people where showing up at different times of the day i intended to record four tunes which is really quite a big deal for the amount of time that we had its very live its not over mixed and it is what it is its like a back in the day kind of recording
728531 thats how forefathers came about it was written about my first trip back to south africa which is where my fathers from i met all my family out there and realized id been having a bit of an identity crisis growing up in london im surrounded by a lot of culture and multi racial people but yet not really understanding where i sort of fit in but in the scheme of it all i realized its actually about who you are and not where youre from or the colour of your skin but ultimately im from britain it was great to go back and meet my forefathers or my four bears and where they came from what my forefathers background are like and also to discover why im here today
728532 i knew i wanted to sing from the age of seven it was always very clear to me but how i was going to do it if it was going to happen was a dream that i had as a child but somehow it manifested itself in the right way for me i call it grace the fact that i happened to be exposed to so much music at such a young age and to such a variety of music especially the folk music scene growing up i went to scotland a lot because that is where my mother is from i was introduced to chinese folk music and japanese folk music
728533 i had been influenced by african artists like miriam makeba also being exposed to african drumming and things like that they all influenced me
728534 ive had the chance to work with some of them were very much all the same we hang out together we grew up doing the same rounds
728535 oh yeah i know her music one thing that i heard was the live in newport album where she sings the song sweet georgia brown shes got a lovely voice i grew up listening to her but i wouldnt say that shes been my main influence a lot of the time i get compared to many people such as sade or randy crawford but because of the schooling i had i can use my voice like an instrument i can do a lot of different things with it and create a lot of different sounds
728536 im into scatting ive always been really into that the voice is malleable it can mimic it can do things and growing up i used to do all the r amp b licks after a while it became clear to me that it wasnt about doing those things it was about doing me doing my song my voice and how im going to phrase this lyric or can i keep doing me or am i going to have to go the american styles
728537 when youre young someone needs to show you everything its the same in music as we get older i think we can take for granted knowing that we have the capacity to be intelligent and to be creative we start to feel that we own it but we dont the older we become the more well forget but we have to let it all go we cant take everything with us whatever i do its coming through me and i just feel very grateful for the people that have influenced me all the jazz greats like billie holiday nina simon sarah vaughan and all those people all the blues women bessie smith memphis minnie then dinah washington aretha franklin all the great jazz and r amp b singers im a musician so im going to like good music and being introduced to all these genres such as south african music jazz music asian music you know i love it im born in the 20th century so i cant help but be exposed to all these genres id be interested to see how marshan music sounds if any ones got any recordings from mars send them my way
728538 i have a teacher that helps me get through life and its many twists and turns he makes me aware of my breath and what a gift it is to be alive to have a breath we couldnt see to have the breath we couldnt hear we couldnt feel we couldnt work or play ive actually written a song about that which im going to record soon
728539 the biggest source of inspiration for me is the infinite humility that you have to have for life that im still learning im still growing im still a baby as a singer but put me in a room with one of the younger ones and i have to be a mamma so for me my inspiration is life itself the ups and downs and the journey of it
728540 i basically gave a friend of mine my cd but she was like oh ive got a friend who i could play this to and i didnt know who she was talking about i was just like oh cool shes just given away a cd then about two months later i got a call saying gilles had heard it and he wanted to sign me to his label i think they had some good sound systems
728541 its quite eclectic and its quite diverse as far as the area i come from it also represents me from the past but ive already got it going out on vinyl and everything so they are a good label its out today actually
728542 you might see a few bits or a couple of tracks from professor green and do some producing probably me and digz are going to be doing a hip hop album and im working on my second album as we speak
728543 well see what happens were going to try and get some more live elements involved but you know well see how it goes
728544 straight outta compton by nwa is a great record ltj bukem atlantis a lot of rock n roll music a tribe called quest the roots dangelo and old singers like curtis mayfield otis redding and stevie wonder
728545 i really like omar i think hes a great soul artist he really did it for me back in the day you know when theres nothing like this came out and his new record as well actually
728546 amy winehouse is good because shes kind of soul i think shes doing a really good thing
728547 just the freedom of being able to create what i want to create without being pressurized by major labels or companies i think thats the best thing about being an independent i think
728548 id probably stay with the underground i dont really want to go down that major route i think its a bit of a worry when people go down that they also get ruined so i think ill stick with the independent
728549 just a lot of live shows trying to get out to a lot more fans places like south port soul weekender glastonbury and a few art clubs yeah were just trying to promote the album and get people to see the live band thats what were doing right now
728550 i love toronto for its multiculturalism theres nowhere that i know of where you can travel the world in one city i know it made an impact on my music what i hear and what i create
728551 i sing dance and play piano act and paint create art
728552 alternative soul was the closest thing that i could find on my space to describe what i feel i do i mean i feel soul in rock country jazz and classical music so i draw on the inspiration of the emotion that im trying to convey i have a hard time putting a label on what i do because what i do is about feeling and whatever comes out is what comes out i cant classify feeling
728553 i studied at claude watson school for the arts for grades 7 amp 8 and then went onto high school at earl haig in the claude watson program at mini claude as we so endearingly call it the students were immersed in all aspects of the arts we had majors but it really wasnt until high school where it really became majors and minors so i had art mime ballet jazz modern band theory choir and drama classes at mini claude but when i went haig i majored in dance and my minors were always art and band in which i played tuba why i studied the arts well i am a product of the tv show fame and i always wanted to go to a school where i could dance in the halls sing create just create so i got that opportunity
728554 oh yes a few my mother salome bey her brother and sister andy bey amp geraldine de haas had a group back in the day called andy bey amp the bey sisters my older sister tuku is a singer songwriter my aunt gerry have two kids aisha amp darius de haas who are accomplished singers on the new york broadway scene darius has worked with vanessa l williams and aisha has worked with oleta adams my cousin ronnell bey sings as well and was working with the late spoken word artist sekou sundiata my cousin denese matthews is a dancer singer my cousin cara page is also a performance spoken word artist and my cousin marvin jefferson is an actor so creativity runs in my family
728555 i have sung back ups for enrique iglesias roger hodgson supertramp dennis deyoung styx hero darpmalone amp e dot divine brown maestro fresh wes by divine right alannah myles damhnait doyle zaki ibrahim syreeta neal saukrates jully black marc jordan redman and res
728556 ive had the opportunity to sing back up for some of these people because im currently on canadian idol as a back up singer for my second season and what i love about singing is not being stuck in one genre of music but id have to say singing with roger hodgson was a huge treat
728557 i will be in october though and im looking forward to it
728558 europe thu 18th oct cargo london fri 19th oct paard the hague holland thu 25th oct porgy amp bess vienna austria weds 31st oct sugar club dublin ireland thu 1st nov mint lounge manchester uk fri 2nd nov trouble
728559 well im just finishing up my debut ep tentatively called random notes and once that is done onto the full length album the future holds more growth and with that growth sharing id like incorporating more movement into my live performances more experimentation with instrumentation sounds more stories of love found broken hearts but all raw emotion
728560 ive been working on this new project that will be released either the third or fourth quarter of 2007 i also have an ep that i want to get put out its just an ep of the first album of some remixes and its house down tempo and drum and bass music
728561 actually there remixes by some different guys ron trent earnie g and other guys that dont really have a name for themselves yet it should be real exciting as far as this ep were doing it just because its something fun before i put the next album out
728562 it was pretty hard man to be honest with you the fact is if you havent ever really made an album be fore you really dont know what to do if your trying to make a good album you have a lot of mistakes to be made which is basically what i did but we tried to create a different vibe and different ideas i think we did a great job i dont know if you got a chance to get the album
728563 well ive actually been producing professionally for about three years but ive been making music for about twelve years i am currently involved in the music industry working with t v commercials and mtv basically that album pushed the envelope for me you know what im saying it kind of helped me get out on to other things ive been doing music the whole of my life but professionally id say for about three years
728564 i played the french horn from when i was in 8th grade all the way to musical theory other than that man it was pretty much just natural i began being in church choirs but its mostly natural you know most people say they went to this or that university but i went to university but i didnt even study music there all for the art you know what i mean
728565 yeah its changed tromendously like i say i im not trying to be like a john legend or one of those big cats like that
728566 laughs im like one of the underground scene artists that people should know about
728567 this latest album has had a really big change since what i did back in the day things are changing id say from the first album i am more comfortable where i am now ive gone through things but i am able to also challenge and express myself more about things that were going on back then as well so it should be a good album this next album
728568 yeah the next album is going to be called the naked truth
728569 we havent got a record label for it yet but you know how we do on the underground laughs we do have our own company though called chocolate soul entertainment and if i dont get a label to distribute it ill be distributing it like i did with the first album with chocolate soul well just distribute it again because we got some pretty good love all the way out there
728570 ive had a lot of people saying i have great stage presence i havent had the challenge yet to really show case that ive performed for some opening acts and people are like wow i didnt know you could perform like that and im like yeah well i can and im trying to get more shows laughs once i get more shows i think my popularity will expand and ill get the chance to showcase my talent
728571 in general i mean i was just inspired to make something that was soothing but fun and also not too sleepy but still very relaxing so i just wanted to make a listening experience from beginning to end that was consistent and took you on a bit of a journey but didnt really make you too excited or make you too mellow you know just finding a couple of different moods to play with was really the goal
728572 its hard to say because i dont really have a formula for creating i just kind of go with the flow some of them i did with other people and some of them i didnt theyre all personal meaning that theyre all based on a thought or an idea of mine its just expanded upon by either the musicians what im doing or going through its really difficult for me to go back in time to paint a picture of each record over all it was just a process of being honest at that moment
728573 well i didnt really set out to be a singer in my career
728574 i was really a dj producer songwriter at first as i was recording songs for people to sing the other artists were like yeah your kind of cool you should develop it that type of thing so actually i give the other artists props for recognizing that there was potential in what i was doing i think the validation from a record i did with the masters at work called the messengers was the beginning of recognizing that people liked how i sounded and then i continued to explore after that
728575 yeah they were all good because you always learn from something or someone im the type of person anyway who learns from every experience from personal experiences like earth wind and fire to doing things with jazzanova at the time they hadnt really worked with any artist they were only programmers i was the first actual artist they produced so it was definitely a learning experience for both of us because they were so used to being in front of laptops i had never really been used to working with people who were exclusive to that it was like a meaning of the mind so to speak
728576 oh it was great i like them as people i got a chance to go to berlin it was a beautiful experience and they are a great bunch of guys i really appreciate what they bring to world music culture
728577 laughs you mean in terms of when i wake up in the morning
728578 i look forward to every single breath until i take my last thats my objective in life enjoy it as i go through it
728579 well my lifestyle is very demanding but i do capoeira which is weight training and other stuff like that that is what i do for my physical side mentally i just like to hang out be normal and go to movies not really think about too much or too hard all the time
728580 i love london minus the fact that the dollar doesnt really work that well laughs
728581 but the music scene is great its not even just the music scene its the over all perspective of art culture and how they work together i think england in general is still very appreciative of soulful things
728582 yeah i wish there was a radio format or a mainstream radio format that was more exclusive of new things and took more chances its very very repetitive and thats very boring and it makes the social culture very boring
728583 i get inspired by good people and beautiful experiences im just typically paying attention to everything thats going on around me i try to be somewhat of a reporter in my music and i try to sing what ive experienced through sound
728584 oh ive had so many people help me through out the years kenny gamble king britt jazzanova 4 hero the west london crew bbe guys so many people ive been very fortunate in lots of ways
728585 well hopefully ill go over there in spring when i get a lot more work do a few remixes and keep the ball rolling forward
728586 laughs it was such a long time ago my love
728587 yes it was a bit of a culture shock but in time how can i say it was an adventure it really was just that i was just as excited as i was afraid you know as time went by you sort of started to reminice about home you know so you have more of an understanding
728588 when i got my recording contract to be honest other than that i was just out having a good time getting some drinks and literally just enjoying the gift and the experience
728589 it was only until i had the contract that it became more serious and more compitative you realize your in a race of some sort you know what i mean
728590 creativity is what really drives me i have no motions about fame or fortune i was just absolutely enjoying the art really
728591 not at all my dear i have no intensions about nothing i was like a kid in a sweet shop and i was having the best time with it you know
728592 up until this point i worked five years on the road i had my own band doing session work and session work with culture club which was fantastic they were the biggest pop band going and i was apart of it so it was quite an exciting time for someone starting out and i was having a hard time myself but then i wasnt having a hard time it was just a question of getting a deal and that was kind of hard to come by so the distraction was to work with somebody else which is a great distraction
728593 i got looked after well which was fantastic i got to play at madison square gardens and wembley so it was just fantastic then i came back home and the record deal happened and i was really happy about that because i was years on the road looking for a recording contract and it came about
728594 then my life changed again because i became an artist in my own right and then it all took off from there really
728595 the recording contract instigated the idea really jiva was the insight and foresight and had the concept of the album where by you team up with other people and focus on one style of music the initial idea was my idea to work with the other motown artists i was a big fan of motown and i didnt want to touch these songs because you cant better them
728596 if you cover a song and cant do it as well then you shouldnt touch it my thing was if they get some of the motown artists to appear then i was able to pull it off and they did so it was great
728597 because it was a great song and it sounded relevant to the american market and the american people i went over there and promoted the single for about three weeks while i was there the song was getting heavy air play and doing well in the charts
728598 what i wasnt expecting was how positive the song was and how they could relate to it and it was just one of those things it was a great song to that market
728599 yes when you can hold me was a hit i had a couple of hits more recently stay with me baby was a top 40 hit so yeah ive had quite a few in this country
728600 sweet heart if i knew id be a million air im a lyricist so thats where i go i can get off on a groove but its the lyrics that reach my ears first
728601 it is visual and its a beat so there you have it i must be one of my own then
728602 i have my views but they are quite irrelevent who wants to hear my views and further more as a musician myself there is no weight you know what i mean so its kind of wrong for another artist to criticize another artist for what they do im no pioneer i came in this industry and there were people before me and there were people behind me as long as you make your contribution to life whos to say your right or wrong
728603 right now the industry is going through a stage because where now in this time but when we rap back to the 60s it was the industry of there time just like it was the music of there time
728604 oh good friends good health genuwin friendships you know they are hard to find
728605 aah deeply saddened because i spent a lot of time listening to her records and she has been a great inspiration over the years
728606 i grew up listening to a lot of music and studied a lot of different music things just come out and i just try to see if things work
728607 if anybody likes me enough to compare me to artists they think a lot of great i am flattered and appreciative
728608 i creatively try to explore the sounds i hear and write lyrics that speak to me i do music because i am kind of corny but true
728609 my shows are an experience you dont know whos going to show up diva blue or me i just like to sing the diva goes a little crazy you just have to come to find out
728610 i hope i have i have continued to study and work on all aspects of myself as an artist hopefully the public thinks ive done a good job i have seen and worked with king we just did a sylk 130 re union in philly this past summer
728611 i also am a sci fi reader i use tv to kind of zone out im a law and order kind of gal
728612 i think its my perfect song or as perfect as i can get
728613 i always had a big voice but i had no range and ability to control it i was a pianist first and basically couldnt blend it with anyone
728614 pure insanity musical vision is not always the way to easy success i just had to for real i have something to say ive never been one to keep my mouth shut
728615 perseverance is the only way to make it in this business go after what you want and keep at it there is no specific advice to give as much as i wish i could go after your dreams and enjoy your life
728616 were from uppsala north of stockholm we also made an album back in ninety seven called sons for koop we met at a students place magnus was dj ing jazz and i w as playing jazz in a quintet we decided to make a tune together where we mixed debussy with jazz
728617 sometimes everything sometimes nothing but mostly jazz from 1917 to 1961 or the freshest beat on the dance floor
728618 it started out with a photo we did together with a photographer that later became the album cover for waltz for koop and now we cant stop doing it
728619 its irritating when artists try to be manly and good looking on album covers weve passed all that but it also reflects the music its all a bit illusion
728620 weve gone from creating experimental sampler soundscapes to discovering a way to produce classic songs via samplers and are now focusing on song writing we are grateful to all the singers and musicians that have blessed our albums with their talent and life outside of koop is nothing i want to talk about
728621 hyper modern music is always developing with the technical inventions our music couldnt be made fifteen years ago
728622 yeah previous dates have been great crowds use to be up for it and lots of friends in the back room
728623 the illusion worked its maybe forty percent live and the rest are samples our vision is to create the best environment for the vocals make them shine
728624 its music from koop islands we try not to think too much and just grab whats around us of course much of the eclecticism comes from the use of samples and on this album it was from the 40s and 50s the use of marimba is significant for the album as well
728625 after a while you become a very boring person that can only talk about airports or hotel standards after a year on the road youre hopefully just numb

728629 our hope is that a compromise can be reached soon and that the law can be passed soon so that the iraqi people can move forward in preparation for the elections
728630 i hope they can reach a solution that fits all parties and prevents the situation from deteriorating further
728631 the mistakes of politicians brought us to this stage our social fabric was torn up in kirkuk and this is very dangerous for all of iraq
728632 they have to settle all their differences otherwise it will lead to a crisis in all iraqi cities
728633 it was a democratic process why did they reject it
728634 we arabs are against any new resolution that could affect our presence in this city

728708 how to decide when you have to make a tough choice
728709 i think he could use a day to catch his breath
728710 just a towering towering figure in new york city handball which is the best handball in the world
728711 guys would die to have vics left hand which was just as good as his right
728712 cdcs new incidence estimates reveal that the hiv epidemic is and has been worse than previously known
728713 hiv prevention has been underfunded and too often hindered by politics and ideology
728714 waxman said he would soon hold hearings on why health officials had
728715 governments to focus on reaching the marginalized populations that are most affected by the epidemic
728716 we face a bit of a crisis in this area in the industrialised world transmission of hiv among men who have sex with men is not declining and in some places has increased
728717 in the developing world it has been neglected we have only recently started looking for it and when we look we find it and when we examine
728718 any revision of the threat was liable to be seized on by those who rejected hiv as the cause of the disease or who used the disease as a weapon to stigmatise high risk groups he said
728719 aku tidak tahu apa yang akan terjadi dimasa depan tetapi aku tahu apa siapa yang akan mampu menggengam masa depan
728720 the new estimates confirm that a vast majority of new infections in the u s occur in gay and bisexual men and that blacks are significantly more heavily impacted than other racial ethnic categories however the data fail to clearly link the two perpetuating a longstanding damaging polarization
728721 we need cdc to clearly show the hiv incidence numbers in gay men and other msm of color
728722 a substantial number of black people infected every year are gay or bisexual and a substantial proportion of gay and bisexual men infected are black in fact the heaviest impact is at the nexus of the two being both black and a man who has sex with men yet this population is significantly marginalized even stigmatized within both larger populations of which it is an integral part a national aids strategy must tackle this fundamental challenge
728723 the rising incidence in our communities is a direct result of years of policies and programs that demonize and ignore the sexual health needs of gay men especially african american and latino gay men who bear the brunt of the epidemic in the united states gay men of all colors face significant health disparities that directly compound chances of becoming hiv positive
728724 we must prioritize a holistic asset based gay mens health agenda that goes well beyond a navel to knee focus we must also address their physical mental emotional and spiritual health needs that when neglected foster conditions in which hiv thrives
728725 if this socially conservative country with far fewer resources than its wealthy neighbor to the north can ambitiously confront homophobia with government sponsorship and funding why cant the united states
728726 cdc talks of the need to develop more and better prevention messages including more prevention interventions for black gay men and gay men of all races but such strategies will never be sufficiently effective or taken up by those most at risk until and unless homophobia is directly confronted
728727 instead politicians of both parties and the department of health and human services have caved into pressure from right wing politicians squelching not only sexuality research but anti homophobia and pro sexual diversity messages in hiv prevention and general health promotion alike will our next administration buck this trend or will it be more of the business as usual thats decimating my community
728728 it s not a gay disease anymore the face of aids has changed
728729 theres also steering cable right there my main weights front and rear axles
728730 its been a blast but nature is calling and we have been invited back to the forest to become teachers for a whole new generation of spokecritters
728731 it was time for a change the beavers have served us well they were very well known and quite popular and well known but its time to move on
728732 han r en man som lyssnar han beter sig inte som n gon intellektuell kung
728733 teachers are bending over backwards to respect home prejudices that children have been brought up with the government could do more but it doesnt want to because it is fanatical about multiculturalism and the need to respect the different traditions from which these children come
728734 its political daddyism and its as old as demagogues and despotism
728735 the rights that we have under the constitution covers anything we want to do as long as its not harmful i cant see any way in the world that being a gay can cause damage to somebody else
728736 i have little interest in streamlining government or in making it more efficient for i mean to reduce its size
728737 i would remind you that extremism in the defense of liberty is no vice and let me remind you also that moderation in the pursuit of justice is no virtue
728738 remember that a government big enough to give you everything you want is also big enough to take away everything you have
728739 the income tax created more criminals than any other single act of government
728740 to insist on strength is not war mongering it is peace mongering

728745 one group of stocks that has always intrigued us are those whose symbols have one letter
728746 odd as this idea may at first seem it actually makes some sense for a deep value investor these are often old line companies with well known brand names in some cases the single letter symbols were awarded many decades ago
728747 but the company subsequently suffered along with its customers in the communications and technology sectors
728748 however the financials are sound and management has been restructuring and realigning operations for long term growth
728749 citigroup has struggled in the new credit environment that began a year ago the new management team will probably divest many businesses but they have a good core on which to rebuild
728750 ford looked like it was beginning to rebound when spiraling gas prices battered sales of the companys trucks and suvs management has been quick to react laying off workers and shutting down plants
728751 as a result the stock trades near levels reached in 1997 this may be an opportunity to get an iconic brand at a bargain price
728752 fearful of rising inflation and constrained consumer spending investors have sold the stock off to a nearly 5 year low macys has the financial strength to ultimately prevail and at current valuations 0 4x sales and below book value it could be cheap
728753 the provider of on demand business management software went public in late 2007 while its operating history is short netsuites products look interesting and with 170 million in cash the company has time to prove itself
728754 is at a disadvantage to some of its peers because it doesnt have its own wireless business that said the old wireline franchise still has a lot of value as they figure out how to send more data and video over the phone lines
728755 sprint has struggled since the acquisition of nextel in 2005 but there are some indications that the business may be at least leveling off
728756 services some 60 million local phone lines 15 million broadband subscribers and 71 million wireless customers as merger related charges begin to wane and synergies begin to payoff operating results should begin to improve
728757 however giants are not particularly nimble and citicorp has struggled in the new credit environment that began a year ago the new management team will probably divest many businesses but they have a good core on which to rebuild
728758 management has been quick to react laying off workers and shutting down plants we think the brand is strong enough to survive and so does legendary investor kirk kerkorian who has been buying ford shares as they drop
728759 but the headwinds of rising costs for corn and wheat have spooked investors leading to a sharp selloff in the shares earlier this year as a result the stock trades near levels reached in 1997 this may be an opportunity to get an iconic brand at a bargain price
728760 and now fearful of rising inflation and constrained consumer spending investors have sold the stock off to a nearly 5 year low macys has the financial strength to ultimately prevail and at current valuations 0 4x sales and below book value it could be cheap
728761 after rallying to nearly 46 in its first few weeks the stock declined sharply and has bounced around the 20 level for the last several months while its operating history is short netsuites products look interesting and with 170 million in cash the company has time to prove itself
728762 qwest provides telephone services in 14 western and midwestern states the company is at a disadvantage to some of its peers because it doesnt have its own wireless business
728763 but that said the old wireline franchise still has a lot of value as they figure out how to send more data and video over the phone lines
728764 a new management team is aggressively pursuing new marketing schemes as well new technology such as wimax if results dont improve some or all of the company could be sold
728765 the company services some 60 million local phone lines 15 million broadband subscribers and 71 million wireless customers
728766 as merger related charges begin to wane and synergies begin to payoff operating results should begin to improve the companys financials are sound quite capable of supporting a share repurchase program and attractive dividend

728769 what makes kiva unique is that you can choose the individual that you would like to support through a small loan

728771 in a given year about two percent of the same sex couples who were formally recognized dissolve their relationships and among heterosexual married couples about two percent of them each year divorce
728772 i love latitude its in the stars but longitude its about time time and clocks and all the rest of that have always been a fascination for me
728773 im trying to save the planet im trying to save the planet
728774 i respect the office that i hold and when you win the election you win the majority and what is the power of the speaker to set the agenda the power of recognition and i am not giving the gavel away to anyone
728775 we could save all the oil that theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires and getting regular tune ups you could save just as much
728776 we started the decade with surpluses and we had good federal revenues but instead because of the fiscal policies put in place we had deficits through all this period
728777 what senator obama has said is that he is committed to restoring sound long term fiscal conditions
728778 i think thats essential if were going to have a good and strong economy he said hell pay for everything hes going to do with respect to social security and medicare
728779 he has promised he would veto every bill that has them barack obama has voted for bills that are laden with pork whether its the 2005 bush cheney energy bill the 2008 agricultural subsidy bill both of those john mccain voted against because they were laden with pork both of those barack obama voted for
728780 john mccain has been very explicit in saying he does not support an increase in payroll taxes particularly because they impact small businesses and sole proprietorships more greatly than any other part of our economy
728781 his record is very clear on that and he has a number of economists who support his assertion that we can solve the social security and medicare crisis but particularly social security without raising payroll taxes
728782 i think that the current difficulties the current duress i think the most likely scenario with respect to all of that is that it will likely to continue for quite some period of time could get a little bit worse
728783 theres always some chance that matters could get better more rapidly but i think thats very low probability and theres some chance and hopefully its a low probability that things could get considerably worse
728784 i certainly agree with him that the situation could get worse
728785 and there are a couple of things that will make it worse one is to raise taxes which is what senator obama proposes to do another is to massively increase government spending which is what senator obama would propose to do over 1 5 trillion in increased government spending and the third is to become isolationist and protectionist which senator obama would also propose to do
728786 what senator obama said is that hell have a middle class tax cut and that tax cut will go to roughly 95 percent of all the people whose incomes are under 250 000
728787 for people whose incomes are in excess of 250 000 their income tax rates will go back to the rates we had under president clinton their capital gains rate will go up to some rate less than the rate we had during most of the time president clinton was in office taxes on dividends will go up to the rate that will apply to capital gains and that will be substantially below the rate that was in place when president clinton was elected
728788 what he said with respect to offshore drilling is its going to have no effect in the short term zero that its going to take years for this to come on board
728789 on the other hand youre referring to the proposal that came up friday in which offshore drilling was a piece of a much larger piece of legislation
728790 what he basically said as i understand it and i think this is right is that theres a lot in there that he thinks could be constructive
728791 and if it means doing something that he has a lot of reservations about in order to accomplish something much larger thats constructive then thats the way a legislative process should work in a democracy
728792 what rotates around the earth the sun moon mars or venus
728793 thats kind of what our guys said he could do for us when we picked him up
728794 it was nice to throw a good game not only for me personally but more importantly for the team
728795 we have two months left and we have to get wins
728796 elf dagen voor een toernooi uitsluitend in het olympisch dorp verblijven is niet goed voor het toernooi begint ben je het daar dan al zo beu als wat
728797 yantai is ideaal voor wat mentale rust en bovendien is het goed om de andere belgische atleten te ontmoeten
728798 het verblijf in peking was wel al uitstekend met een perfecte accomodatie
728799 minds are like parachutes they only function when they are open
728800 ik denk dat wij dit jaar een hele grote stap zullen zetten
728801 these new figures should bring new focus to our efforts to address aids and hiv here at home
728802 combating hiv aids also demands closing the gaps in opportunity that exist in our society so that we can strengthen our public health we must also overcome the stigma that surrounds hiv aids a stigma that is too often tied to homophobia
728803 we need to encourage folks to get tested and accelerate hiv aids research toward an effective cure because we have a moral obligation to join together to meet this challenge and to do so with the urgency this epidemic demands
728804 work closely with non profit government and private sector stakeholders to continue the fight against hiv aids
728805 by focusing efforts on reducing drug costs through greater market competition promoting prevention efforts encouraging testing targeting communities with high infection rates strengthening research and reducing disparities through effective public outreach we as a nation can make great progress in fighting hiv aids

728808 fantastisch om te zien dat ook zoveel jonge mensen zijn teksten helemaal kunnen meezingen
728809 belangrijkste vaststelling is wellicht dat gemoedelijkheid dit festival blijft kenmerken ondanks de schaalvergroting van de voorbije jaren
728810 nu en dan kregen we wat regen te verwerken maar voor problemen zorgde dat niet
728811 hier en daar gooien we wat stro uit op modderige plekken

728815 and there is the disgraceful treatment of the rugby league code in france epitomised by the infamous vichy government ordinance 5285 signed by marshall
728816 earlier on in the week i asked the boys for a special effort for me today and they came through they really did come through
728817 sometimes these things go the reverse of what you want them to so i was just hoping the player group would be focused
728818 i didnt want them to go over the top they were cool calm and collected and in the first quarter pav matthew pavlich and luke mcpharlin just unloaded with three goals each and made my day a lot easier
728819 milestones and last games i havent got the stats on them but they can certainly go either way because of the fact youve got a lot of things to lose and the opposition prey on it
728820 its a day the fremantle football club will never forget its very important you send off your players in the right manner and we did that today
728821 it meant the world to me to be able to say goodbye to the fans
728822 they have been terrific they supported me through thick and thin
728823 probably retire it for life i would have thought or a week
728824 i was one of the people that when he hurt his knee for the second time thought that was going to curtail his career
728825 to see him out there today is an amazing effort of what hes done and how hes gone about it
728826 i havent seen the letter i havent got any comment
728827 i am still committed to the raiders however i am appealing the process of these events in the hope that i can be back on the field in the lime green as soon as possible if the club allows it
728828 beating st george isnt necessarily going to assure us of a semi final and losing wont mean we wont but at the end of the day if we lose it just puts us under the pump
728829 my mother left me a lot of money when she died but i gave it to charity when i was seventeen i wanted to prove that i could accomplish anything i wanted starting from absolutely nothing also i wanted to free myself of concern for money consequently its never been a problem for me to answer your question you get to be a superhero by believing in the hero within you and summoning him or her forth by an act of will believing in yourself and your own potential is the first step to realizing that potential alternately you could do as jon did fall into a nuclear reactor and hope for the best on the whole i think i prefer to stick to my own methods
728830 youll forgive me for saying so but isnt that philosophy a little norman vincent peale that self realization stuff how exactly do you exploit that potential to the degree that you obviously have
728831 the disciplines of physical exercise meditation and study arent terribly esoteric the means to attain a capability far beyond that of the so called ordinary person are within reach of everyone if their desire and their will are strong enough i have studied science art religion and a hundred different philosophies anyone could do as much by applying what you learn and ordering your thoughts in an intelligent manner it is possible to accomplish almost anything possible for the ordinary person theres a notion id like to see buried the ordinary person ridculous there is no ordinary person

728835 the movie has grown in terms of its base audience from primarily what was conceived as a young male movie to a movie for everybody from 8 to 80
728836 theyre going to see it because of the reviews theyre going to see it because of the word of mouth theyre going just to see what its all about and they all like it
728837 it looked like we could do somewhere between 45 and 50 million but no one could have foreseen the juggernaut the dark knight has become
728838 it wont be over for either club obviously because mathematically youre still a chance of getting there
728839 were both in the same situation were in the same situation we were last week before we played souths and nothings going to change with a win this weekend its just that a loss will make it very very difficult
728840 hes a man of few words but his track record and physical presence on the field is a huge boost for everybody
728841 we want a home semi we want a top four spot
728842 we will be playing semi final football but we want to make sure we give ourselves the best shot at it by being in the top four
728843 we were in that position last year when we were worried about what team was going to win or lose or what points they were on
728844 if we keep thinking about that next week and worrying about our own footy and just make sure were slowly improving in areas of our game and winning those games that just keep punching us up the table a bit thats the most comfortable position you can be in
728845 have fun with your wii enjoy the rest of your summer nice to talk to you etc

728853 it is cases like those that really bug me when people say parents who choose to home school should just be trying harder to make the schools better how exactly not only can we not change the teacher student ratio or the curriculum or the hours or the politics or any other number of the negative things we also cannot fire the bad teachers
728854 i try to get a little exercise in every day and eat only organic food grown by pygmies in the south sahara its just the socially responsible thing to do
728855 when the writings were discovered there were some islamic scholars who come and eat here and they all commented that it was a sign to show that islam is the only true religion for mankind
728856 whats funny is you actually expect me to believe that
728857 ill be right back im gonna go get the nurse

728862 these three men are walking outside when my son is lying dead
728863 in my religious tradition we would say that that person had been living in a hell here on earth for years
728864 ya know todays probably the last time well see each other in who knows how long
728865 well neither of us can drive and i dont think our parents would let us stay with each other in georgia or west virginia
728866 there is for me a special significance in signing this pledge and it will give me a peace of mind and heart that i have not experienced since 1968 in 1968 i was a young franciscan priest studying in the graduate school of religious education at catholic university
728867 since they as well as many other professors and graduate students were signing the protest document i went along and did so also
728868 in 1975 for personal reasons not related to any doubts or questions about the faith or the church or the religious life i requested and obtained a dispensation from pope paul vi returning me to the lay state later i was married in the church and raised my two children in the faith i have had many conversations with my pastor and with his assistant who is my spiritual director about my days as a franciscan priest and have been active in many of our parishs lay apostolate and ministries
728869 but i have always regretted having signed the protest document against pope pauls teaching in 1968 and having learned a few years ago that fr faricy had publicly repudiated signing the protest i had wished that i too could repudiate in some official way having signed the protest and so your pledge document offers me an opportunity to correct my mistake and find healing and telling you about all this helps me to feel that my repudiation of the protest is now known and accepted in a kind of semi official sort of way by an authority in the church
728870 and thank you for reading this thereby humoring an old man who despite everything else knows that he is a priest forever according to the order of melchizedek
728871 in christs kingdom it is never too late even after forty years to fully embrace the truth all of us make mistakes and all of us sin but he gives us all a chance to be reconciled with him and turn our sorrow into joy
728872 priests desire to let his repudiation be a public testimony to others
728873 j tais un peu nerv mais cest la vie javais gagn comme a en 2003 chacun son tour

729161 both parties are talking the green bay packers and brett
729162 and i think the discussions are moving ahead i would hope that we would have something resolved by monday
729163 i think its come to the point where there need to be some decisions made on behalf of the packers on behalf of brett on behalf of all the fans
729164 primarily it starts with the fact does brett want to play football
729165 the second is do the packers want him to play for the packers those are the two principal points that have to be resolved and only two parties can make that determination not me
729166 i was interjected into it because there was a tampering charge initially
729167 im not looking for things to interject myself into its an issue that needs to be addressed because of the competing interests you want to make sure its done properly and within our rules this is an issue that ultimately has to be decided between brett and the packers
729168 whats going on between brett and the organization is something that the players and coaches we cannot handle
729169 were not involved in it i think they did a good job from a responsibility standpoint dealing with it for about two days but the focus has been on improving

729172 protecting children from smoking is a government priority and taking away temptation is one way to do this
729173 if banning brightly colored packets removing cigarettes from display and removing the cheap option of a pack of 10 helps save lives then that is what we should do but we want to hear everyones views first
729174 banning point of sale display will make smoking even more attractive to teenagers worse it will drive many smokers towards cheaper counterfeit and smuggled cigarettes
729175 yet again freedom of choice and personal responsibility are being sacrificed by politicians who think they know best what next are they going to ban the display of alcohol and confectionery
729176 the best way to tackle youth smoking is through education and proper enforcement of the legal age limit
729177 smoking is a habit which is passed down from generation to generation and this pattern can only be broken by fresh thinking and a comprehensive cross government strategy

729216 kami baru takut terhadap umat islam jika mereka telah melaksanakan salat subuh seperti melaksanakan salat jumat
729217 sungguh masjid masjid di seluruh penjuru dunia ini merintih pedih dan mengeluh kepada allah karena dijauhi oleh mayoritas kaum muslimin ketika salat subuh tengah dilaksanakan kalau bukan karena ketentuan allah bahwa benda benda mati itu tidak bisa bicara tentu manusia dapat mendengar suara rintihan dan gemuruh tangis masjid masjid itu mengadu kepada rabbnya yang agung
729218 berpagi pagilah kamu mencari segala keperluan atau hajat karena sesungguhnya diwaktu pagi itulah terdapat berkah
729219 salat yang paling berat bagi orang orang munafik adalah salat isya dan salat subuh
729220 seorang dai yang tidak menjaga salat subuh dalam berjemaah tetapi dia berbicara dan berceramah dalam sebuah majelis tentang tegaknya agama allah dimuka bumi naif
729221 rasulullah saw pernah salat subuh kemudian berkata apakah kalian menyaksikan bahwa si fulan salat
729222 sesungguhnya dua salat ini subuh dan isya adalah salat yang berat bagi orang orang munafik
729223 ketika kami tidak melihat seseorang dalam salat subuh atau isya kami langsung berperasangka buruk kepadanya
729224 batas antara kita dengan orang orang muanfik adalah menghadiri salat isya dan subuh sebab orang orang munafik tidak sanggup menghadiri kedua salat tersebut
729225 hai fatimah bangun dan saksikanlah rezeki robbmu karena allah swt membagi bagi rezeki para hamba antara salat subuh dan terbitnya matahari
729226 salat subuh yang dilakukan secara berjemaah di masjid lebih bagus daripada ibadah yang dilakukan seseorang sepanjang malam di rumah

729246 there have also been positive results in parts of canada the us and england when homosexual people are accepted as gods children are treated with dignity and choose to give their lives to christ and to live in the community of faith as disciples of jesus christ with fidelity and commitment

729280 let there be lights in the expanse of the sky to separate the day from the night and let them serve as signs to mark seasons and days and years god is orderly and he likes separating things so that we do not get confused as human beings for instance when he separated the darkness and the light on the first day of creation the darkness he called night and the light he called day and he separated the day form the night god is thinking of us light one hour and darkness the next hour just would not work we would be very strange because of our lack of sleep in our attitudes god did make the light the first day the darkness was before the first day and then he separated them he did not make the lights yet to govern the day and the night but he was going to and we know those two great lights and what they are but never heard it put like that the great lights hmm they would serve as signs to mark seasons and days and years when the sun is directly above us then what it is at a 90 degree angle from where we are and we know that to be summer when it is at a 60 degree angle it is either autumn or spring and a 45 degree angle it is winter someone had to think of this and it was god who thought of that and did it to a lesser degree when the sun rises and then goes down and when the moon comes out then goes down it is a 24 hour period of time and we call it one day when this happens 365 times one calls it one year the earth rotates 365 times and that is one rotation around the sun 15 and let them be lights in the expanse of the sky to give light on the earth

729368 over the past two months the actions and words of hillary clinton have gone from being merely disappointing to downright disgusting
729369 he had his hands in a lot of different things
729370 he was involved with projects that were approved at the highest levels
729371 it seems like he was setting up a life down there
729372 i have no doubt that he would have been right back in high society circles
729373 his identity is still a big focus of our investigation
729374 its in such bad shape he would come out to see if it was still floating
729375 the kids were drinking bottles of guinness i remember they would point their guns at you they wanted money we paid
729376 you could see the chaos hear the shots hear the screaming you could smell it
729377 i remember having to step over the decomposing body of an infant covered with white powder lime i guess to get into one building
729378 and never since when i came home i couldnt put it into words for my husband
729379 is that most people are reconciling a woman i met was gang raped during the genocide her throat was slit she lost her whole family but was willing to forgive the reason this will be a successful country is the women some of the strongest most inspiring women i have ever met
729380 it is not about me it never has been i felt it was important that i had to do it i never took government money it was my own and i am not ashamed of it
729381 as soon as i got a phone call from tna it totally revitalized me
729382 i would never think backward and everything happens for a reason im now glad the company wwe let me go
729383 then i got hired by a big wrestling company wwe and they cut me off in about a year and that was the roughest fall ive taken so far only because they took away my passion
729384 i was actually done with wrestling during that time i thought ill go back to school finish my degree which im still doing i just thought thats enough i tried no hard feelings i still loved it but my passion continued to subside
729385 it was a rough period because i didnt know where to go from there now i know everything happens for a reason and i dont regret that experience at all because it made me a much tougher person and taught me life in general how to deal with people in business it was a good experience and now i couldnt be happier
729386 yes of course you are now we got to buckle down and save planet express
729387 i never said that i was definitely going to be in the public financing system
729388 barack will support a filibuster of any bill that includes retroactive immunity
729389 to let president bush put protections for special interests ahead of our security and our liberty
729390 i have always believed that the second amendment protects the right of individuals to bear arms
729391 but i also identify with the need for crime ravaged communities to save their children from the violence that plagues our streets through commonsense effective safety measures
729392 does obama believe that the dc handgun ban was constitutional or unconstitutional we cant tell and he wont say
729393 i have said repeatedly that i think that the death penalty should be applied in very narrow circumstances for the most egregious of crimes
729394 offered a clear road map for the kind of candidate he is likely to become an ambitious gamer of the electoral map a ruthless fundraiser and a scrupulous manager of his own biography in the face of persistent concerns about how he is perceived
729395 determination to press his financial advantage even at the cost of handing his republican opponent the opportunity to raise questions about the sincerity of his rhetoric on reform
729396 bankrupt the intellectual and moral bankruptcy of todays democratic party
729397 its more than that she danielle allen subscribes to the notion that the congregation of folks on the internet who adhere to one political philosophy almost always conservative is dangerous and should be opposed
729398 if the proliferation of computers in the country continues as it is now it will destroy the country meaning the regime within three years
729399 sanctions on insurance and maritime and air transportation would raise the cost of irans doing business but effective sanctions on the import of refined petroleum products could be a game changer
729400 should not sell gasoline that is used by irans nuclear scientists and its terror chiefs to drive to work
729401 the bill that obama wanted didnt have the military part in it
729402 at the bottom when the other honolulu birth certificate on the same form that we found says
729403 the bill that obama wanted didnt have the military part in it
729404 before it was like an option that an islamic judge could decide to use or not to use but now it will become an automatic thing and from the language of the legislation it seems like something that cannot be appealed
729405 there are large numbers of conversions from islam maybe even in the tens of thousands every year and this is causing concern in the islamic circles in iran
729406 yes it does a bit because we do know that under islamic law of iran there was always this option of issuing death penalties for any conversions from islam so this was already available but it looks like they just want to escalate persecution making the death penalty almost automatic for anyone who converts from islam
729407 i dont write this stuff i cherry pick it and publish it here every attempt is made to provide attribution and or links to the original source if you dont like the writers viewpoint send them an email not me
729408 and i mean just that and i do just that i want the obama file to be able to withstand the type of attack that allen attempts in this article
729409 if 20 percent of whats on my web site is true this guy is a clear and present danger
729410 there was beckwith whom she pegged as a veteran from boston old enough to vote for john f kennedy in uniform by 1964 and host of a web site that devotes considerable space to an obama file that says the senator is by birth blood and training a muslim
729411 that statement is true just ask obamas sister maya in an
729412 my whole family was muslim and most of the people i knew were muslim
729413 in the muslim school the teacher wrote to tell mother i made faces during koranic studies
729414 his initial goal was to take swats at the liberal left then this new guy comes along called obama he said
729415 beckwith said he built a web site that features hundreds of pages of material intended to undermine obama
729416 the only connection ive had to islam is that my grandfather on my fathers side came from that country kenya but ive never practiced islam
729417 i have never been a muslim other than my name and the fact that i lived in a populous muslim country for 4 years when i was a child indonesia 1967 71 i have very little connection to the islamic religion
729418 my whole family was muslim and most of the people i knew were muslim
729419 all the relatives of barrys father were very devout muslims
729420 listed as a muslim on the registration form for the catholic school
729421 barack hussein obama was registered under the name barry soetoro serial number 203 and entered the franciscan asisi primary school on 1 january 1968 and sat in class 1b barrys religion was listed as islam
729422 was registered by his family as a muslim at both schools he attended
729423 three of his teachers have said he was enrolled as a muslim
729424 with the school records missing eaten by bugs one has to rely on peoples shifting memories
729425 recalled the opening lines of the arabic call to prayer reciting them to kristof with a first rate accent
729426 obama sometimes went to friday prayers at the local mosque
729427 obama occasionally followed his stepfather to the mosque for friday prayers
729428 was muslim he went to the mosque i remember him wearing a sarong
729429 i did not want to enter into competition with the other orders
729430 and i did not want it to be confined to one group of muslims or one aspect of islamic reform rather i sought that it be a general message based on learning education and jihad
729431 it is the nature of islam to dominate not to be dominated to impose its law on all nations and to extend its power to the entire planet
729432 allah ghayatuna al rasul zaimuna al qur an dusturuna al jihad sabiluna al mawt fi sabil allah asma amanina allah akbar allah akbar
729433 god is our goal the quran is our constitution the prophet is our leader struggle jihad is our way and death in the service of god is the loftiest of our wishes
729434 that the notion that somehow not talking to countries is punishment to them which has been the guiding principle of this administration is ridiculous
729435 even our european allies are concerned about obamas stance towards iran while it has been difficult to present a unified front on one point all agree no direct talks with tehran unless it first suspends its nuclear enrichment program

729451 the attention of the room by his fine tall person handsome features noble mien he was looked at with great admiration for about half the evening till his manners gave a disgust which turned the tide of his popularity for he was discovered to be proud to be above his company and above being pleased

729458 wing places are where people might go instead of applebees
729459 chicken companies have really boosted prices because of demand and there are only so many wings a chicken has

729468 a fellow christian may believe they have a profound fresh insight

729471 commerce bureau officials we interviewed were in agreement that all of the fy 2006 earmarks were consistent with the commerce mission and strategic goals
729472 we recognize that there is vigorous debate on the utility and advisability of earmarks as an appropriate exercise of congressional power
729473 a finding of lack of alignment between an earmark and nasa priorities is no more determinative of the appropriateness of congressional action than a finding of alignment in either instance congress or members thereof caused the redirection of budgetary resources or added specificity on how to apply those resources that was different from the executive branchs proposal

729488 i wish i wanted it as much as i used to but i dont
729489 ive been with her for 10 years a lot of wins she hit every green today it is the sign of a champion to come out when you dont have a chance of winning and play like that shes great nobodys done it better ill never forget this
729490 i think i was born to compete there were times i wish i didnt have it but i probably wouldnt have achieved what i have maybe there were times the last few months when i wish i had the desire and the motivation and the drive then i wouldnt step away
729491 but i just dont have that when you have the mind of a champion and the mind of a competitor but then theres a few pieces missing thats hard to accept sometimes
729492 i came up 18 made the corner turn and there was a sign saying annika you will be missed
729493 i thought that was very special i waved to the guys they clapped and then i came up 18 and everybody was cheering it just makes you feel good when you get that type of applause ive been out here for 15 years and ive experienced a lot of joy a few setbacks but overall its been great
729494 im going to miss it no doubt about it i love the majors i try to gear up for them and kind of be ready for them ive had happy tears there ive had unhappy tears this game and this championship just sucks everything out of you
729495 the competition the cheering being under the limelight to hit that perfect 6 iron and make that putt
729496 the bbfc should realize there are scenes of gratuitous violence in the dark knight to which i would certainly not take my 11 year old daughter
729497 but the only excursions offered were to the local mall where a wealth of unaffordable merchandise stared them in the face

729512 we talked about marriage and said no marriage of the same sex
729513 but still they went ahead and consecrated somebody who was gay
729514 what well see is the continued rise of the global south leadership the axis of power is shifting from the rich and the white to those who have less material resources but have the spiritual resources necessary to lead the communion further
729515 all these people brought christianity to us but now the church is growing here like wildfire
729516 its spreading everywhere while the church in england is withering while the church in the states is going away completely
729517 it is not an option to hope that we can somehow just carry on as we always have
729518 the interesting question still unanswered is how wide and deep will it grow
729519 the episcopal church as an organization is changing its teaching and theology and is moving away from the traditions of the church
729520 its been slowly accelerating over the years and it picked up steam when they began blessing same sex unions a few years back
729521 if it was a black person or women in robinsons place some may be upset but not say it out loud but because hes gay they say it out loud
729522 one of the greatest strengths about the episcopal church is the whole diversity of views
729523 the episcopal church in its history has not been a very dogmatic church its been a church thats allowed people to question to have doubts and fears and all that i think is a part of a healthy and mature faith
729524 we have never unlike most churches never defined ourselves by theology or doctrine we defined ourselves by how we worship
729525 i think well weather this a lot of people make a lot of noise and i think in the end people have a kind of attachment to the episcopal church
729526 there is no mechanism in the church to help us discipline a branch of our church that is teaching and practicing heresy
729527 fatah officials in gaza should stay in their posts and should not leave gaza to hamas

729567 although the market may get off to a sluggish start a number of companies will benefit from a weaker australian dollar and talk that the reserve bank may cut rates in the coming months

729581 these new figures should bring new focus to our efforts to address aids and hiv here at home
729582 combating hiv aids also demands closing the gaps in opportunity that exist in our society so that we can strengthen our public health we must also overcome the stigma that surrounds hiv aids a stigma that is too often tied to homophobia
729583 we need to encourage folks to get tested and accelerate hiv aids research toward an effective cure because we have a moral obligation to join together to meet this challenge and to do so with the urgency this epidemic demands
729584 work closely with non profit government and private sector stakeholders to continue the fight against hiv aids

729803 because he was a great pilgrim it is said that he journeyed between 14 000 to 16 000 kilometers 8 700 to 9 950 miles in his time and what does a pilgrim do during his journey as he walks a pilgrim evangelizes and this is what paul did
729804 he traveled preached the gospel was a witness of the resurrection in all the places he visited and i believe that we too who are trying to take man through the streets of the world also want our travel to be a form of evangelization
729805 because he was a person who like us did not know christ in the sense that he did not meet jesus while he was on earth he had the experience of the risen one and this experience transformed his life he lived it with a great explosion of freedom for us especially in the west where there is a certain exhaustion in the experience of faith to rediscover paul gives us enthusiasm to carry on
729806 any stroll in the himalayas or the andes maybe a dip in the ganges was going to leave the mysticism of the camino way back in the distance as far as i could tell i just wanted to go for a walk the idea of walking for weeks the appealing thing a bit of solitude and you can do that lots of places in the world and not have a pilgrim wake you from a doze in cow field to take a photo of him and his wife there was something we clearly didnt get but one thing was for sure i wasnt going to be doing it again galicia a sparsely populated state of spain in the far northwest had the lowest figures for tourism in the country that gets more tourists than anywhere else in europe so the lack of facilities should hardly have been surprising we could stay however in municipal albergues brand spanking new for 3 with disposable sheets and pillow cases expansive ktichens though no one in charge realised that kitchens really need saucepans fry pans cutlery and plates and maybe a nearby tienda that sold food but that of course was part of the charm maybe all the charm we walked into santiago seven hundred and seventy seven kilometres later 34 days did i feel good yes different fitter worth it if you have nothing better to do it was a hike for us and an achievement for sure
729807 dear children i beseech you to start changing your life in the family let the family be a harmonious flower that i wish to give to jesus dear children let every family be active in prayer for i wish that the fruits in the family be seen one day only that way shall i give you all like petals as a gift to jesus in fulfillment of gods plans thank you for having responded to my call

729816 cdcs new incidence estimates reveal that the hiv epidemic is and has been worse than previously known
729817 hiv prevention has been underfunded and too often hindered by politics and ideology
729818 since fiscal year 2002 when adjusted for inflation cdcs prevention budget has actually shrunk by 19 percent the president has recently requested decreases in funding for hiv prevention at cdc
729819 less and less money to actually get these programs to the communities that need them

729821 we face a bit of a crisis in this area in the industrialised world transmission of hiv among men who have sex with men is not declining and in some places has increased
729822 in the developing world it has been neglected we have only recently started looking for it and when we look we find it and when we examine hiv rates we find they are high
729823 any revision of the threat was liable to be seized on by those who rejected hiv as the cause of the disease or who used the disease as a weapon to stigmatise high risk groups he said
729824 now what is the reason why a one hundred percent raw vegetable diet exerts such a beneficial effect on civilised individuals first and foremost because the raw food is live food as it is handed to us by nature we all know that life on earth is completely dependent on our sun if we had no sun the earth would be without any life dark and icy cold vital force is therefore identifical with sun energy it is however only the plant with its widely unfolding thin green leaves that is able to catch the sunlight and to deposit it in the form of roots and tubers fruits and seeds we human beings and animals with massive bodies are not able to utilize it to a sufficiently high degree therefore both men and beast use plants as carriers between the sun and themselves a fresh raw vegetable diet is sunlight nourishment
729825 do you want your food with or without the nutrients
729826 we must learn to eat slowly chew well and avoid over indulgence by stopping just when the food tastes best if we still get a feeling of having eaten too much it is advisable to skip a meal then too we should think of what we eat by enjoying every mouthful we increase the flow of gastric juice and thus facilitate digestion when the feeling of satiety comes the gastric juice has been used up if we eat more than the gastric juice can digest we nourish our diseases instead of our health

729860 so whats the problem i have no idea what youre talking about
729861 i will not react because we want to keep our best players
729862 we are going in to a season now and we have to have everybody focused on our targets
729863 if we can bring in one more player we will do it if not we will go with the squad we have i am happy with that
729864 we have to now continue to be focused on our targets
729865 i feel adebayor felt people questioned his commitment a little bit and the best answer always is to give on the pitch
729866 you play well and show you are ready to fight for your shirt and your team he does that he is a man with character
729867 you know how it is if you score goals people forget quickly their frustration
729868 sixteen years after brett favre came to the packers he is returning for a seventeenth season
729869 he has had a great career with our organisation and although we built this year around the assumption that brett meant what he said about retiring brett is coming back we will welcome him back and turn this situation to our advantage
729870 frankly bretts change of mind put us in a very difficult spot
729871 we now will revise many actions and assumptions about our long term future all predicated on bretts decision last march to retire
729872 as a result of his decision we invested considerably in a new and different future without brett and we were obviously moving in that direction thats why this wasnt easy having crossed the rubicon once when brett decided to retire its very difficult to reorient our plans and cross it again in the opposite direction but well put this to our advantage
729873 although there has been uncertainty regarding bretts return general manager ted thompson and coach mike mccarthy had previously discussed this and have had a plan in place
729874 coach mccarthy will talk to the team and the quarterbacks about the plan moving forward and after he has done that we will share it publicly
729875 it starts primarily with does brett want to play football
729876 the second is do the packers want him to play for the packers those are the two principle points that have to be resolved and only the two parties can make those determinations not me
729877 no matter what i look forward to another successful season for the packers and our fans
729878 its a problem for the club for sporting director pedja mijatovic and the coach
729879 but now wesley sneijder is injured and hes an important player for us
729880 maybe tomorrow there will be a meeting with the people in the club and maybe then theres going to be news about this
729881 we know cristiano ronaldo is an incredible player and we dont have any problem with him joining us
729882 real madrid making an offer is normal manchester united and coach sir alex ferguson dont want this because he is a very important player at united and that is normal too
729883 i think theyre going to have to talk about this and if cristiano ronaldo is coming to real madrid the dressing room is waiting for him
729884 if he came of course the players and the fans would be excited the supporters are used to watching the best players in the world at the bernabeu and cristiano ronaldo is one of the best players in the world
729885 i feel the best of real madrid is the squad and the dressing room and if cristiano is coming here we dont have room for him in the team
729886 but as i said before maybe with the injury to wesley sneijder maybe we need someone else
729887 five years ago your typical wireless store was very small and there wasnt much to choose from
729888 now the trend is having a lot of space for displays where customers can see feel and touch the products
729889 this store is going to offer better customer service and we will have more products available than at the other stores
729890 the other store was so small some customers didnt know those services existed unless we told them about it

729905 the white house has been alerted by nasa about plans to make an announcement soon on major new phoenix lander discoveries concerning the
729906 sources say the new data do not indicate the discovery of existing or past life on mars
729907 heard about the recent news reports implying i may have found martian life those reports are incorrect
729908 reports claiming there was a white house briefing are also untrue and incorrect
729909 the reason that all this seems so hush hush is due to a future paper and press release that appears likely to pop out of the american association for the advancement of science aaas and its
729910 whatever the poop is from the scoop thats been studied by phoenix that information is purportedly going through peer review

729933 his mind slid away into the labyrinthine world of doublethink to know and not to know to be conscious of complete truthfulness while telling carefully constructed lies to hold simultaneously two opinions which cancelled out knowing them to be contradictory and believing in both of them to use logic against logic to repudiate morality while laying claim to it to believe that democracy was impossible and that the party was the guardian of democracy to forget whatever it was necessary to forget then to draw it back at the moment when it was needed and then promptly to forget it again and above all to apply the same process to the process itself that was the ultimate subtlety consciously to induce unconsciousness and then once again to become unconscious of the act of hypnosis you had just performed

729959 many believers who have had significant involvement in traditional church life have been wounded psychologically sexually emotionally spiritually or physically and many times a combination of these areas many have been hurt by other christians and have given up on the established church some see house churches as the answer to their problems and many house churches see themselves primarily as a place for such hurting believers as many believers turn to house churches for therapeutic reasons house churches will continue to increase
