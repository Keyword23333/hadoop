1160000 positively thrilled to see such unyielding dedication to creating a new generation of fat hating heteronormative holes
1160001 does it make it better or worse that the concept artist who designed the look characters everything is a girl
1160002 theres some good stuff in there but some very negative things also
1160003 i am very keen that there will be rules to ensure access for individuals with vision loss to all of the technology systems present and future that people use in their everyday lives
1160004 things like cellphones atm machines computer systems anything where there is an on screen display should be designed in a manner that would permit its use by an individual with limited eyesight
1160005 im so thankful to the one which is supporting people like me i feel lucky despite my disabilities because i have a job and a chance to prove that we too can work like normal people
1160006 there are only about five wheelchair accessible taxis only one of which actually works i have a motorised wheelchair but the streets are unsafe because there is nowhere for me to drive and hardly any ramps or even lifts
1160007 i am an accountancy graduate but i was told that working as an accountant needs mobility
1160008 i tried looking for jobs in other places i pass all qualification tests but when it comes to recruiting they raise the issue of their inability to make their workplace accessible to the disabled
1160009 it has been proved by studies in western countries that once a chance is given to people with disabilities they prove themselves worthy and sometimes exceed expectations
1160010 to recruit them i would have to make alterations to the work area
1160011 i need to profit out of my business by employing a person with a disability i would be spending more money and gaining nothing in return
1160012 i am qualified and i think i can handle the job
1160013 but they dont want me to get involved another person was assigned to do my work
1160014 so what are you gonna do about it home slice
1160015 as long as war is regarded as wicked it will always have its fascination when it is looked upon as vulgar it will cease to be popular
1160016 i tried just about everything then the last thing we tried seemed to work well it turned around in about three or four days
1160017 he should have a nice fresh arm between now and the end of the year
1160018 hopefully we can get it done the next couple of days every thing is fine
1160019 ive missed time before but its frustrating when its something as small as this you miss some games and not part of the action in a pennant race its no fun to just be watching
1160020 hes been dealing with this shoulder problem for a long time
1160021 going in to repair the problem is his best chance now to open up next year feeling 100 percent
1160022 the good news is his back feels great and his left shoulder is not a problem
1160023 it seems like those two issues have been addressed going through an offseason last year and rehabbing three different surgeries at once was not easy this time hell be able to focus on just one thing
1160024 anytime you have a player of his caliber youd always love him to be in your lineup
1160025 but looking at him getting this behind him and ready to contribute on a daily basis next year is exciting
1160026 so what are you gonna do about it home slice
1160027 many just never get the chance to actually get here
1160028 so what are you gonna do about it home slice
1160029 so what are you gonna do about it home slice
1160030 wichorus and its one open wimax partners are working to transform a traditionally closed wireless core into an open horizontal model that spurs innovation and competition and provides more choices for carriers
1160031 by working directly with major broadband technology suppliers like zyxel wichorus has facilitated the adoption of a single open r6 interface that gives operators the choice and flexibility needed to deploy profitable wimax networks
1160032 we open at 5am and on occasion there have been people hanging around for the shop to open
1160033 we chose to sell the alcohol prior to 9am at our own discretion but when we were approached by the liquor accord we were happy to oblige with the decision not to sell
1160034 we have to live and work in the area and while it is hard to determine what damage and other minor incidents are a direct result of alcohol consumption this can only improve the situation
1160035 police had been called to a number of incidents caused by the early availability of alcohol these are mainly domestic incidents and anything we can do to stop these types of incidents in the home is very positive
1160036 these bottle shops are all businesses and their decision to restrict alcohol sales until after 9am will mean a loss in sales to them their decision has shown an enormous amount of community sentiment and they should be applauded
1160037 those casuals would be basically sacked to make way for operators from walcha
1160038 come august 12 if matters havent been resolved they are going to meet again
1160039 we are of the understanding that the intention of the regional forests agreement which governs the use of state forests was to give
1160040 we find no strong objections to the discounting assumptions adopted in the stern review
1160041 the problem here unrecognized by dyson is that the business as usual hes defending would release almost as much carbon to the air by the end of the century as the entire reservoir of carbon stored on land in living things and in soils combined
1160042 farmers are now asking whether much of the outback that supported their forebears can still sustain them
1160043 dyson suffers from the same mental blinders as a lot of dreamers who can only dream of a better world
1160044 that the business as usual hes defending would release almost as much carbon to the air by the end of the century as the entire reservoir of carbon stored on land in living things and in soils combined the land carbon reservoir would have to double in size in order keep up with us
1160045 so i can now increase the size of my carbon footprint because its all offset
1160046 is it possible to sustain the increasing wealth of a growing world population and not damage the natural environment past the threshold where it can support life
1160047 it is hard to preach abstinance while sitting on a bar stool
1160048 the best allocation of resources belong to economists and politicians that represent the public balancing current and future human needs
1160049 the costs of mitigating climate change are the sacrifices the present generation will have to make to reduce ghgs
1160050 finally using the g econ data to estimate the impact of global warming we estimate that an equilibrium doubling of co2 equivalent greenhouse gas concentrations will have significantly more negative impacts than was found in earlier studies
1160051 24 john mashey the models do have finite resources of oil and coal if you look at page 20 you will see that in the reference case
1160052 standard economic projections appear to totally ignore peak oil gas
1160053 can we go all out on efficiency and renewables fast enough to keep world us real gdp at least flat and not end up out of desperation burning a lot more coal to keep the lights on and do ctl synfuels with bad results
1160054 why cant mitigating climate change and ghgs produce economic stimulus rather than be a drag on the economy
1160055 why cant mitigating climate change and ghgs produce economic stimulus rather than be a drag on the economy
1160056 a dollar saved by not mitigating today does indeed lead to greater wealth in the future
1160057 my argument is that the 500 worth of damage will increase with gdp since economic damage caused by gw will be proportionate to the total gdp whenever it occurs e g consider that stern discusses insurance losses in terms of total global gdp
1160058 extrapolated version of ipccs a2 scenario characterized by annual gdp per capita growth of about 1 9 annual average population growth is about 0 6
1160059 defending new orleans alone from flooding during a category 5 hurricane is expected to cost around 32b
1160060 correct me if im horribly wrong but dont you get increased economic activity from manufacturing and selling compact fluorescent solar panels and wind turbines
1160061 minimize the number of premature deaths over the next 200 years
1160062 is allowing x more people to die for sure over the next 20 years counterbalanced by models that lead us to believe we will thus save x y people over the next 200 years
1160063 do i value my suv more than 80 kids 100 years from now
1160064 it looks like between one and two thirds of all the total cdm offsets do not represent actual emission cuts
1160065 carbon eating trees could convert most of the carbon that they absorb from the atmosphere into some chemically stable form and bury it underground
1160066 biotechnology is enormously powerful capable of burying or transforming any molecule of carbon dioxide that comes into its grasp
1160067 there are billions of people who right now lack basic utilities like clean drinking water and dependable electricity if they are encouraged forced to try to leapfrog over fossil fuels and go right to solar or whatever their development will be hindered
1160068 personally i dont see why we should put any faith in these models they cant even tell me if its going to rain next week so when the time scale goes to hundreds or thousands of years
1160069 look even an mit expert on this stuff agrees with me these models are bunk
1160070 if you dont want to put a dollar value on lives or the environment thats fine but if you do then you need to discount
1160071 ok if the bomb is set to go off in one week versus one year
1160072 hang on a second dont make me pay it now make me pay the 35 when it actually kills someone
1160073 to convert from carbon units to the current convention of co2 units multiply the mass or divide the price by 3
1160074 100 tax per ton of carbon is equal to a tax of 27 per ton of co2
1160075 the longer we wait the more painful and expensive the consequences will be
1160076 most of the debate we expect will be about how much it will cost to implement the bill this report provides the other side of the ledger how much it will cost if we dont act
1160077 a many colored glass reflections on the place of life in the universe
1160078 quantity regulation is better than price regulation if the marginal benefit curve to reducing climate change is steeper than the marginal cost curve of mitigation measures
1160079 release a slug of co2 and you will increase the co2 concentration in the atmosphere for hundreds of thousands of years
1160080 record minimum inflows to streams and rivers in the south including to the entire murray darling basin which is in a parless state
1160081 quantity regulation is better than price regulation if the marginal benefit curve to reducing climate change is steeper than the marginal cost curve of mitigation measures
1160082 researchers are looking for patterns in oceanic and atmospheric conditions over and around australia that will provide clues to present and future climate change its impacts on water resources and lead to improvement in the quality of seasonal forecasts
1160083 it really is a pity that there is no site devoted to climate mitigation that has the calibre and hospitable nature of rc
1160084 since the middle of the 20th century australian temperatures have on average risen by about 1 c with an increase in the frequency of heatwaves and a decrease in the numbers of frosts and cold days rainfall patterns have also changed the northwest has seen an increase in rainfall over the last 50 years while much of eastern australia and the far southwest have experienced a decline
1160085 other scientists who also assumed 60 years ago that physicists like him would crack the nuclear fusion problem in a few years
1160086 this has held since 1845 but it would be interesting to see if it also extended into the past when animal power was dominant
1160087 climate changes temperature increases increasing co2 levels and altered patterns of precipitation are already affecting u s water resources agriculture land resources and biodiversity very likely
1160088 climate change has very likely increased the size and number of forest fires insect outbreaks and tree mortality in the interior west the southwest and alaska and will continue to do so

1160090 id be interested in hearing where people here would draw the line in spending to mitigate warming the number must be between 0 and 100 of global gdp
1160091 global warming could cost the world up to 20 trillion over two decades for cleaner energy sources un secretary general ban ki moon warns in a new report in his 52 page report ban says that global investments of 15 trillion to 20 trillion over the next 20 to 25 years may be required to place the world on a markedly different and sustainable energy trajectory
1160092 the hypoxia is caused by persistent upwelling that produces an over abundance of phytoplankton
1160093 when the system works the upwelling winds subside for a day or two every couple of weeks in what we call a relaxation event that allows that buildup of decomposing organic matter to be washed out to the deep ocean
1160094 but in recent years especially in 2002 and 2006 there were few if any of these relaxation breaks in the upwelling and the phytoplankton blooms were enormous
1160095 when the material produced by these blooms decomposes it puts more co2 into the system and increases the acidification
1160096 cant agree with you about economics there may be a lot of dispute in it but it is an empirical science eocnomists may not know how to perfectly control an economy but they know what will help and what will hurt the theory of marginal utility in the determination of commodity pricing was a real scientific advance and as a result a lot of things can be predicted which could not be predicted before i dont want to see people who accept climate science become deniers of economic science that would be as big a mistake as the reverse
1160097 whats appalling is the waste of about 95 of what the world came equipped with to turn five percent of it into money
1160098 why is it that dysons remarkably creative powers of vision carbon eating trees for example fail to come up with alternatives to the crude and ugly process of burning coal to generate electricity
1160099 when the time scales start to reach hundreds and thousands of years the people who pay in the future are not the same as the ones who benefit now
1160100 i often find myself contemptuous of efforts to misrepresent science to a lay audience ive got kids at home whose future i worry about
1160101 a 4 discount rate is hiding a bad case of circular reasoning
1160102 there is about 5000 gton c of coal compared with about 500 trees 1500 soils on land of oil and gas there are only a few hundred gton each coal is the real issue
1160103 the northwest has seen an increase in rainfall over the last 50 years while much of eastern australia and the far southwest have experienced a decline
1160104 worst drought in at least 600yrs occuring slap bang in the middle of our breadbasket does not make any sense
1160105 i dont mean to start an off topic controversy about the wisdom or value of military spending vs
1160106 do people especially the economists believe that us world gdp growth over the next century is essentially unaffected by peak oil gas
1160107 but of course you do with the obvious implication to stop military spending and put it into mitigation
1160108 there is about 5000 gton c of coal compared with about 500 trees 1500 soils on land of oil and gas there are only a few hundred gton each coal is the real issue
1160109 lignin land plants and fungi biological evolution affecting phanerozoic oxygen balance
1160110 the combination of record heat and widespread drought during the past five to ten years over large parts of southern and eastern australia is without historical precedent and is at least partly a result of climate change
1160111 except for a few academic studies of pre industrial economies all of our economic data come from an era of coal petroleum
1160112 oh did you just see that polar bear fall through the melting north pole
1160113 when did charcoal become thermodynamically less stable than diamond if the guileless dyson has left something out its the risk of forest fires
1160114 the fact of the matter is that climate scientists have been predicting this situation ever since the late 1970s there really wasnt that much more scientific doubt then than there is now and solar and wind technology was already poised to take off and then came 30 years of fossil fuel interests intervening in government to maintain the status quo
1160115 in theory theory and practice and the same but in practice they arent
1160116 most people get nobels for things they were looking for we got ours for finding something we were trying to get rid of
1160117 intensity tons of co2 per 2000 1000 i e divide 1000 by the energy intensity to get somewhat similar numbers to those in your list
1160118 surely you dont believe that the entire civilization is going to crumble from climate change
1160119 given that current models do not take into account feedback from co2 and methane outgassing from permafrost clathrates etc
1160120 every human monetizes death climate and destruction indirectly all the time people just deny this everybody knows that driving a car on a leisure trip or far riskier riding a bike presents increased death risk to their children compared to sitting at home but at a benefit of the trip experience rather than the concept of values of life years it is the discount rate that is the key point of contention between various mitigation spending scenarios
1160121 the limits of polymer formation in plants or the state of synthetic biology
1160122 other scientists who also assumed 60 years ago that physicists like him would crack the nuclear fusion problem in a few years
1160123 the market price or penalty that would be paid by those who use fossil fuels and thereby generate co2 emissions
1160124 you are at a realistic estimate of 100 trees per person per year
1160125 planting 100 trees per year isnt much of a feat some men make their living by replanting after clear cut harvests a quick calculation suggests that about 300 seedings are planted per hour
1160126 what monetary value should be applied to the risk of getting lung cancer
1160127 how does the economic damage from ruining the tobacco industry compare to the cost of medical treatment
1160128 i wouldnt write across the front page that the problem is solved but this will help we are in a hurry to deal with climate change and will be very hard pressed to stop the train before we get to 450ppm co2 in the atmosphere this can help stop the train
1160129 our project has reached the stage where it is quite clear we can do it we need to start dealing with all these emissions id rather have a technology that allows us to use fossil fuels without destroying the planet because people are going to use them anyway
1160130 we need to be harvesting and replanting a huge amount of fast growing vegetation every year and sequestering it somewhere it wont rot
1160131 the assumption that technology would save the day and not any sort of financial assumption secondly one way to read your reply would suggest nuclear fusion is up and running is it
1160132 harvesting and replanting a huge amount of fast growing vegetation every year and sequestering it somewhere it wont rot
1160133 when i saw it the first time i didnt believe it
1160134 co2 is a gas and if you want to store it permanently you have to stabilize it essentially that means turning it into a solid block of coal or a carbonate mineral that will take a good deal more energy
1160135 surely the ice is thinner and younger this year so it more than likely is this going to be a new record year
1160136 where to plant possibly on the canadian and siberian tundra which will be thawing out and releasing methane
1160137 unfortunately there are no trees on the tundra because conditions are not suitable even 500 miles south of the tundra well into the boreal forest zone growth is slow twenty years after a forest fire the trees are still not 20 feet tall there is also the problem of accessing these areas to plant and harvest the trees
1160138 nick correct there is no internal life to monetization calculator however you can infer the value people put on their life in indirect ways or you can actually infer values from government studies
1160139 there is already open water at the banks island end of the north west passage the ice in there is much thinner than previous years
1160140 as the winter extent numbers indicate new ice growth was strong over the winter nevertheless this new ice is probably fairly thin
1160141 a mechanism for the high rate of sea ice thinning in the arctic ocean
1160142 weather conditions in the arctic are variable for example in july of 2006 we were also on track to set a record minimum but a cooler and cloudier august slowed the rate of ice loss
1160143 i do wonder why coal in combination with ccs should be avoided
1160144 the love of money is the root of all evil
1160145 but i believe ipccs projections are realistic and should be our guide to the likely scenarios
1160146 i understand its thickness is solely dependent on how long and how cold the
1160147 in fact the ice surface returned far more rapidly that it disappeared
1160148 so one would not necessarily expect a rapid melt in places like hudson bay and the north west passage however the behaviour of ice that is more than one year old i know very little about
1160149 an unprecedentedly radical government grab for control of the american economy cloaked in reassuring rhetoric about the government merely creating a market but government actually would create a scarcity so government could sell what it has made scarce
1160150 it doesnt exist we dont know when or even if it will exist
1160151 using the possibility to rationalize building more coal fired plants is folly
1160152 however notably absent from any discussions of possible solutions has been any acknowledgement of our burgeoning population growth growth which sooner or later will have to reverse if we are to hold out any hope of saving the planet
1160153 tamino lets not get off on the wrong foot i would genuinely value your opinion as to whether you think that were you in a position to implement all of the policies that you could wish for you could prevent dangerous climate change while giving time for global population to level off naturally i would be delighted with a convincing and affirmative answer if you dont think such a benign outcome is possible then we are going to have to address some very unsavoury demographic solutions
1160154 but im a guy that accepts mainstream climate science and mainstream economic science
1160155 it is wonderfully ironic how much enthusiasm there is for supercomputer climate modelling while at the same time such aversion for the idea that supercomputer mitigation solutions are coming soon to a planet near us all
1160156 if you have a choice between a hypothetical situation and a real one choose the real one
1160157 nick gotts apparently knows how to accelerate the trend towards zero or negative population growth but the supposed efficacy of the methods he suggests have been subject to recent academic challenge
1160158 at the moment all i am trying to find out is whether we are just in time if we could overcome some of our possibly hard wired behaviours and cooperate
1160159 i have to wonder if these arent the very reasons george will favors a direct carbon tax nothing will change
1160160 wishing for a carbon tax is no apriori wish to actually do anything meaningful
1160161 the money from efficient power stations to give the money to the poor so they can inefficiently burn more fuel
1160162 for many species sunlight is not that important warmth combined with enough moisture is more important
1160163 yes we will have to drill anwr but i hope we dont do so until after we have improved efficiency since we would just waste it if we drilled now
1160164 joe the ipcc uses 3 degrees per doubling of co2 this is the most probable value not the extreme depending on the data used the value could be as high as 4 5 or even 6 degrees per doubling moreover while the ipcc scenarios do look at solubility of co2 in the oceans and so presumably outgassing they dont look at outgassing of permafrost or methane clathrates for the simple reason that we dont know how much this will contribute the costs if we see 6 degrees of warming are dire indeed as outlined by hank so with even 1 5 probability they dominate the risk so until we have better data we had better keep things under control
1160165 the winter maxima is largely set outside the arctic ocean basin itself as the arctic ocean is ice covered before the maxima is reached in that sense a record maxima is largely irrelevant ice conditions inside the arctic basin are more important for the summer minima
1160166 its elemantary that a heating effect exists in a pure primary sense but its not nearly so clear in nature
1160167 corporations often lead the pack in remediation of emerging problems so the public hardly hears of some
1160168 however he al bartlett contends that it is unclear whether what we are seeing is a true turning point in demographics or merely a transition from one rate of exponential growth to another
1160169 except that no one is proposing anything of the sort what was proposed was a moratorium on new coal plants go back and read it again
1160170 the winter maxima is largely set outside the arctic ocean basin itself as the arctic ocean is ice covered before the maxima is reached in that sense a record maxima is largely irrelevant ice conditions inside the arctic basin are more important for the summer minima
1160171 some say we should be preparing hydrogen powered cars because they emit mainly water but water is a ghg itself
1160172 so what can we buy with emission credits that is truly a gain
1160173 tell me please of a few activities that can be done with no ghg addition to the air
1160174 secondly free private enterprise will never damn near make investment in a large scale global efforts which have no assurance of a return or if there is a return they dont know how much but know it wont be realized for at least a couple of decades they might make such investments if governments give them some sort of assurance guarantee this does not make them bad citizens
1160175 it is wonderfully ironic how much enthusiasm there is for supercomputer climate modelling while at the same time such aversion for the idea that supercomputer mitigation solutions are coming soon to a planet near us all
1160176 gee we could cover the costs of building more energy efficient homes and buildings and retrofitting existing structures we could subsidise replacing older inefficient appliances and machinery with more efficient models we could produce more hybrid and pure electric vehicles and transit systems we could produce and install more solar cells and solar thermal collectors more windmill generators more ground source geothermal systems more deep water thermal systems develop working systems to harness tidal energy develop actual working ccs and heck even build more nuclear plants sure the production and installation of all of these will generate co2 but it will be more than offset over their useful service life plus as non fossil fuel electrical generation becomes a larger portion of the installed base fewer fossil carbon fuels will be used to manufacture and install future replacements if you cannot think of many worthy gains on which to spend emission credits you clearly havent thought much about the problem
1160177 wish in one hand and crap in the other see which fills up first
1160178 to avoid a tonne of co2 into the air using wind power is 1180
1160179 nick 372 but the corporations have no firm knowledge or belief that they are sacrificing people by not glomming onto the entire agw enterprise and likely going bankrupt in the near future
1160180 tell me please of a few activities that can be done with no ghg addition to the air
1160181 you are not going to get there by the uncritical acceptance of unfinished and unproven
1160182 im trying to drop in from time to time at a plane above the general discussion here
1160183 was for 20 years part of the management of the ranger uranium deposits and for some years visiting president of the nt chamber of mines and energy
1160184 as for myself now retired my career was spent in science and management of large resource developments like mines including uranium and paper making and printing without much prior knowledge of the above my hobby interests came to include stamps and coins photography computer imagery and design and i studied some aeronautics and joined the australia sceptics
1160185 actually nicks psychopath reference is not far off the mark although id say sociopathic a sociopath has no moral compass
1160186 the calculations are country specific because of the present generation mix but in australia the estimate is to avoid a tonne of co2 into the air using wind power is 1180
1160187 a quick google search turned up an estimate that us wind generation costs 4 to 6 cents per kwhr so gs is either wrong by nearly two orders of magnitude or australia has really poor electrical engineers
1160188 and you run around with bad people and your mother is ugly
1160189 but it is typical to factor in a variety of environmental and social factors in the interest of the greater good the good of employees and the prevailing cultural and ethical standards
1160190 recall that us corporations at the behest of the govt saved britains butt with equipment and supplies though i am not diminishing the efforts of britains corporation and especially their people in the least in a time that the population of the us overwhelmingly wanted no part of it
1160191 in the us a wind farm needs to be able to get about 13 to 14 per kwhr in order to get built since there is no market that pays anything close to this
1160192 the wind in denmark costs about 23 euros per kwhr or about 35 us
1160193 it would be expensive disastrous if the mirrors ever failed and leaves other issues un addressed such as ocean acidification
1160194 rates for electricity from wind plants being installed today are comparable to wholesale electric power prices of 2 5 to 3 5 kwh
1160195 2 wind energy requires a production tax credit ptc to achieve these economics
1160196 recall that us corporations at the behest of the govt saved britains butt with equipment and supplies
1160197 agw denialists believe that green transport is much less important than creating the new wave of nuclear plants
1160198 legally bound to only maximize shareholder value where in heavens did you get that can you find me any state statute that says such a thing ill help no your description of corporate mentality and ethos shows you read far too many comic books in all due respect
1160199 the directors and officers of a corporation shall exercise their powers and discharge their duties with a view to the interests of the corporation and of the shareholders
1160200 while allowing directors to give consideration to the interests of others the law compel s them to find some reasonable relationship to the long term interests of the shareholders when so doing
1160201 in most cases 9 of those 10 companies will pass both tests if you answer these rationally and reasonably without cherry picking from the companies or company histories as cl has done above
1160202 to beneficially affect the carbon equation you have to increase the mass of carbon per unit land area and you have to keep that increased mass in perpetuity otherwise if it reduces it will give off ghg and the whole exercise would be a transient bit of theft by smooth talking promoters
1160203 fisheries have removed at least 50 million tons of tuna and other top level predators from the pacific ocean pelagic ecosystem since 1950
1160204 can someone please educate me about ghg emission trading you take money from ghg emitters and give it to worthy causes the problem is i cannot think of many worthy causes almost all money that is spent on physical activity as opposed to share trading for example generates ghg almost by definition sure some emission trading can result in more efficient energy generation like closing brown coal power stations and replacing them with nuclear some say we should plant more trees but unless we manage their larger mass forever we have caused just a temporary blip in the cycle of nature so what can we buy with emission credits that is truly a gain at the moment it seems like the gates to scamland are wide open the flow of money is potentially incredibly large and the ways to spend it wisely incredibly small

1160208 california deregulated in 1998 but the deregulated market was not structured efficiently and allowed some companies to manipulate the market by sending the power out of california and then reselling it back into the state the utilities were not allowed long term contracts and were required to sell many of their existing plants californias experience is unique in fact when done well the success stories in pennsylvania ohio texas england and japan show the benefit to both consumers and sellers from electric utility deregulation deregulation has been successful in new york virginia and ontario by protecting the customers from price volatility by price caps by definition price caps are not effective in a deregulated market however a price cap i e a little regulation to protect consumers in the transition period to deregulation is good the price caps can be removed at a later date when the deregulated industry has matured like the power market in new jersey

1160216 the company has consistently treated the long term interests of humanity as largely irrelevant
1160217 wind and solar are a big part of the solution solar thermal power plants not photovoltaic power plants store excess heat in molten salt and release it at night some achieve nearly 24 7 operation that way and dont forget geothermal which is also available 24 7 and regional grids would level out local wind inconsistencies we need to build a direct current transmission system starting immediately and lets not forget ocean thermal power wave and tidal and sustainale biomass fuels not corn to ethanol obviously wind and solar cant do it all now but they can do it all eventually if we invest that way

1160224 you have gas emissions when you generate electricity after removing nitrogen oxide from the gas c02 is returned here for plants to inhale

1160229 we are a little disappointed that the new service still takes two hours to travel between inverell and armidale
1160230 this means that inverell passengers leave a little earlier than present and arrive home a little later nevertheless we are confident the benefits of making the transfer between coach and train at armidale instead of tamworth will outweigh the slightly longer overall journey time

1160292 there were about 20 police on our floor alone they came into our rooms and checked our cameras to see if we had taken any pictures of the incident

1160298 as the fight against aids nears the end of its third decade we are still facing a huge shortfall in resources
1160299 this is a stunning development for which we should all be grateful

1160360 while they are reaping record profits the saudis are concerned that todays record prices might eventually dampen economic growth and lead to lower oil demand as is already happening in the united states and other developed countries according to the new york times the current prices are also making alternative fuels more viable threatening the long term prospects of the oil based economy the paper said
1160361 lying to the media to the general public and to the court when it claims it supports pollard and his wife in various ways and supports them financially
1160362 if israel has given even a shekel to pollard or his wife then it should prove it
1160363 we know the truth it will come out in court
1160364 the word is out that its very important that naval aviation conserve its fuel resources
1160365 if you had asked me about my chances before the judge ruled id have had a neutral response
1160366 my family and i didnt know where to turn who to contact
1160367 we were sitting there talking and the next thing you know i reached up and choked jennifer
1160368 i did this on my own without any prior discussion with dustin turner he did not encourage me in any way and in fact i remember one instance while i was choking jennifer dustin trying to pull my hands away
1160369 were always concerned about what the other side has to say against us
1160370 but if you present credible testimony of the actual murderer its hard to say someone would have found turner guilty
1160371 my most anger has been toward billy brown he murdered an innocent young lady and sent me to prison and upset countless lives but im not so angry anymore i do still harbor some feeling toward the prosecutors but its not a hatred

1160377 im looking forward to some of my battle buddies to join me here in congress
1160378 i think they will have a unique perspective on war on terror but also on what it means to take care of our troops

1160380 there are discussions about withdrawal but nobody wants to talk about the consequences
1160381 even though we have been successful there are those in leadership in washington that dont seem to get it we need to keep that momentum going for the best interest of our country
1160382 when it comes to supporting our troops and their families congressman murtha takes a back seat to no one
1160383 his distinguished 37 year career in the marine corps is well documented and his 35 years in congress is well known
1160384 you could write an entire book on what he has done for our military
1160385 this is just another example of the tough position we put these candidates in
1160386 we have started an orderly shut down in preparation for the storm
1160387 the swell wont likely be big enough to do sustained damage
1160388 thats a lie i was right there with the guys like i always am under the tunnel with high fives after the game
1160389 someone said that i guess to try and make things feel a little better about what went on that was a lie i was there for those guys that day

1160396 i have no regrets and gave it all i could
1160397 the final decision was out of my hands im disappointed i would have liked the opportunity to have proven myself but felt i played well enough its a big business and theres lots of transactions going on
1160398 but my heads not in the nfl anymore im excited to play and im dying to get on the field and tackle maybe this week

1160406 the control of the idf and security forces in jericho is absolute and anyone who deviates from normative behavior and engages in criminal activity or terror will be removed from there quickly
1160407 i explained to them the difference between gaza and the west bank and how they will need to behave differently
1160408 none of them are saints but none of them are mega terrorists either and each and every one of them was checked by the shin bet
1160409 why do they always send these guys to our city
1160410 many fatah gunmen who were sent to jericho over the past few years gave us a very hard time i believe that the presence of the hilles people here wills scare away many tourists
1160411 we dont want to empty the gaza strip of its residents
1160412 if we start absorbing people from the gaza strip in the west bank we will see tens of thousands of palestinians run away from the hamas regime
1160413 the ongoing conflict between hamas and fatah only serves the interests of israel

1160423 evil speaking of the lords anointed is in a class by itself it is one thing to depreciate a person who exercises corporate power or even government power it is quite another thing to criticize or depreciate a person for the performance of an office to which he or she has been called of god it does not matter that the criticism is true
1160424 they needed someone high profile with engineering talent and certainly this guy fits the bill
1160425 the only downside is that he doesnt necessarily have any consumer products expertise
1160426 in terms of actual products hitting the street youre not going to see jhas impact before 2010
1160427 probably his biggest impact will be the level and type of engineering talent he will attract to the company over time
1160428 motorola will only be successful if this new team creates a complete solution that includes hardware software and services similar to apple
1160429 while the iphone is a great phone its real value comes from its software applications and services
1160430 although creating slick phones is one part of the success equation apples success will force even traditional handset makers to think harder about the software and services angle if they are to really compete with apple head on
1160431 theres a tremendous opportunity here to take this business to the next level
1160432 we do not believe that an rs dvr customer is sufficiently distinguishable from a vcr user to impose liability as a direct infringer on a different party for copies that are made automatically upon that customers command
1160433 cablevision has no control over what programs are made available on individual channels or when those programs will air if at all
1160434 in this respect cablevision possesses far less control over recordable content than it does in the vod context where it actively selects and makes available beforehand the individual programs available for viewing
1160435 this decision is a great victory for innovation technological progress and consumers rights
1160436 the content industry in suing cablevision once again overreached in its goal to limit the personal uses of increasingly popular technology
1160437 we hope this case will be another signal to hollywood to scale back its attacks on consumer friendly technologies
1160438 there is an evidentiary disconnect between charging etfs on a per line basis and the evidence presented on a per subscriber or per account basis
1160439 the fccs need for a hearing on the issue in june 2008 suggests the issue is unclear which in turn suggests that congress has no clear intent to preempt
1160440 that early termination fees are being used not as a means of recovering legitimate costs but as a means of locking consumers into a service provider
1160441 ive been fighting this for five years and when im now about to get my day in court the fcc proposes to step in and prevent me from doing this
1160442 wow youre already 7 centimeters dilated lets get you to the hospital young lady
1160443 look lady im not even going to need this appointment for next tuesday let alone the appointment for august 20 so why dont you just chill out im sure you can find a valium or a percoset to take the edge off
1160444 weve determined that these changes are needed to ensure a decent quality of life for all of our residents
1160445 these criteria look at the livability of a subdivision and say that certain conditions must be met before a project will move forward
1160446 there are areas now where you have dead ends and cul de sacs that are an impediment to sociability
1160447 the subdivisions are fragmented and isolated and not connected interiorly or to contiguous subdivisions
1160448 you have situations where people have to travel two miles to get to the person who lives right behind them
1160449 subdivisions are part of the modern movement and were fine in the 1950s 60s and 70s but as they have become exaggerated in exclusivity it has had negative ramifications
1160450 sense of community is a value that can hardly be quantified or legislated it can be cultivated
1160451 the idea is that more eyes on the street make a safer neighborhood for people particularly for children
1160452 in a lower end development or a starter home development where there is less of a profit margin developers are not as willing to create variety
1160453 you get a look thats more like a factory product the same home over and over
1160454 this one is about making sure that this is a development that can stick around and that isnt going to turn into something that has a lot of problems
1160455 when you look at a proposal like this you might think of an area like cary where they have been looking at these issues for 15 years
1160456 a move like this would certainly make new bern a pioneer in eastern north carolina it shapes the image of new bern for the future
1160457 even if it turns out to be a good change
1160458 the problem isnt so much proving the issue that there had been sexual contact
1160459 the bigger issue is proving who did it so unless the child testifies that she had sex with a mr a or mr b you dont have any proof who did it
1160460 all this is much less than beyond a reasonable doubt
1160461 class gt thats the other elegant part about this solution you can
1160462 he pietersen is a fine player and has confidence in bucket loads which he will probably take into his captaincy
1160463 but you dont want him to change he averages around 50 in both forms of the game and hes an unbelievable talent
1160464 he has got some very important attributes that you need in a captain
1160465 he can clearly lead by example by being a fantastic player
1160466 he is a very confident person and he is pretty decisive as well when tough decisions are there to be made he is going to make those decisions
1160467 bene arrivato il momento di dare una vera svolta a questa situazione
1160468 class gt thats the other elegant part about this solution you can

1160482 if 3 000 miles is a fair amount for mileage from a chain thats only been used on the road cannondale bikes are worthless excrement ive gotten better bikes from a dumpster to repair the damage that theyve done to that bike would cost twice as much as the bike pure foolishness is what you are talking and supporting consider that the bike company that replaces cannondale may be who i have to rely on to get a new bike

1160493 my word will not return to me empty but will accomplish what i desire and achieve the purpose for which i sent it
1160494 an onward sweeping tempest that will not turn back until he will have carried out the ideas of his heart
1160495 you must certainly put him to death your hand must be the first in putting him to death
1160496 let god hurry and do his work so we can see it
1160497 arise o lord deliver me o my god strike all my enemies on the jaw break the teeth of the wicked from the lord comes deliverance may your blessings be on your people

1160516 were all about wireless were not betting on handsets were betting on jobs
1160517 because of technology challenges in the u s the only other carrier the iphone is compatible with is t mobile
1160518 the wireless technology is so radically different that apple would have to come up with an entirely new phone in order to have a product that would work on
1160519 you wouldnt even be getting the full 3g experience with t mobile

1160524 we already examined it one way and i think head athletic trainer bud carpenter wants to get an mri just to make sure and then well take care of whatever that is and hopefully it will pass very quickly
1160525 the doctors are going to look at him here after practice so theyll know more about that too
1160526 right now bud carpenter doesnt feel that its real serious but he wants to make sure the doctors take a long look at it

1160538 held that no thing is bad in itself but only in proportion to others with proportionalism it was possible to think for some subjects one could also be pedophilia that in some proportion they could be a good thing now it must be stated clearly this was never catholic doctrine there are things which are always bad and pedophilia is always bad
1160539 the health sector has thus far largely avoided the effects of pro competitive regulation
1160540 improved information is a precursor to more market oriented reform initiatives

1160542 es irrefutable la existencia de armas de fuego y municiones provenientes de bolivia que operan en manos de criminales que act an en el estado de r o de janeiro

1160544 this has been a short intense five months in which perhaps some of the mourning has been diverted as we sought these changes

1160561 we the farmers of the four county area would like to let you know that we do appreciate all that you and your company has done in the past and hopefully the future we as farmers need competition in the cattle industry whether it is in the country selling our cattle or if it is in the sales barns without your buyers we can see a 3 to a 5 cent per pound difference for our cattle also without agri more than just the farmers feel the hurt it trickles down to everyone in the area so with this short note we hope you feel the support thank you

1160577 if someone who is unclean by contact with a dead body touches any of these does it bread stew wine oil etc become unclean
1160578 so is it with this people and with this nation before me declares the lord and so with every work of their hands and what they offer there is unclean this is not a pretty picture is it the people cannot be made holy by the sacrifices they make indeed the sacrifice itself is rendered unholy because it has been touched by those who are dead spiritually that is so making the sacrifices unholy hag 2 15 now then consider from this day onward before stone was placed upon stone in the temple of the lord hag 2 16 how did you fare when one came to a heap of twenty measures there were but ten when one came to the wine vat to draw fifty measures there were but twenty hag 2 17 i struck you and all the products of your toil with blight and with mildew and with hail yet you did not turn to me declares the lord hag 2 18 consider from this day onward from the twenty fourth day of the ninth month since the day that the foundation of the lords temple was laid consider hag 2 19 is the seed yet in the barn indeed the vine the fig tree the pomegranate and the olive tree have yielded nothing but from this day on i will bless you

1160630 three ways to mitigate the attention crash yet still feel informed
1160631 one of the most important skills executives need today is the know how to manage and harness their personal information flow
1160632 when in doubt let search tools either on your desktop or online do the work for you the time you invest to set up these systems can pay huge dividends
1160633 i have mastered how to stuff it into pockets of time that are normally

1160635 ackerman notes the fame from citation as being in part responsible for relative low risk projects

1160637 the federal law does not compel the states to impose criminal penalties for marijuana possession
1160638 the purpose of the federal law is to combat recreational drug use not to regulate a states medical practices
1160639 we think the court should have found that californias medical marijuana laws are pre empted by the federal law
1160640 we think the id card law requires us to issue cards in support of conduct that violates federal law
1160641 i hear that girls suffer not just physically but psychologically
1160642 but i am afraid i dont want my daughters to have uncontrollable demands for sex
1160643 i dont care what everyone thinks i was really harmed and i didnt want this for my daughters
1160644 when i talk about my experience many become convinced they also see how my daughters are good and religious
1160645 it is something we have grown up with and our ancestors have done
1160646 maybe i am 70 per cent for not doing it part of my change of heart is talking with fatma and others
1160647 theres a lot of people participating already in diving and with the olympics coming theres going to be of course a lot of interest in the sport
1160648 our numbers for learn to dive usually i wouldnt say double but certainly go up i would say maybe 30 to 40 per cent
1160649 the body regions that were most injured were the head and neck along with injuries to the face this accounts for about 60 per cent of all the diving related injuries
1160650 and specifically the types of injuries that we saw were lacerations soft tissue injuries were the most common diagnoses followed by strains and sprains and fractures
1160651 about 77 per cent were forward facing about 22 per cent were backward
1160652 more than 80 per cent of the dive injuries occurred from a dive height of less than or equal to a metre so thats not very high about 17 per cent were injured at a dive height of greater than one metre
1160653 once i slipped off the board i wasnt doing a dive i was just not paying attention and it was very early in the morning i scraped my shin but that was about it
1160654 if youre going to a country club pool or a recreational type pool or a backyard pool youre not going to have the same kind of safety that you would have at a training centre that is teaching the sport competitively
1160655 because if youre using the correct technique really the incidence of any kind of injury is quite rare
1160656 my first advice to them is youre not a trained diver like they are
1160657 so first and foremost if youre going to enter the water enter the water feet first thats the safest way to get into any kind of water even if its somewhere youve swam several times
1160658 often youve misjudged the depth of the water or you forget that things do change especially in a lake or a river or an open body of water where the bottom will change and where hazards will float through as a result of currents
1160659 we encourage people to go out and be healthy and active and hopefully safe while youre doing these activities
1160660 one of the things i remembered from when i was about 13 is i watched my first olympics and it was mexico city in 68 and it really had a profound effect on me
1160661 probably the biggest lie told in schools though is that the way to succeed is through following the rules
1160662 im pleased to see some of you with very solid focus here today
1160663 i know this subject can be hard and some of you are clearly frustrated but are keeping at it anyway and so special kudos to you
1160664 for those of you who have never done this before thank you for giving me and this subject your time and attention and willingness

1160677 we want to make sure he goes to a place thats well qualified to care for him

1160679 with zoos you only have so much space available we dont have a strong hippopotamus program right now
1160680 were looking at an animal that happens to be one of the most dangerous animals in africa
1160681 kill more people in africa a year than any other animal except mosquitoes
1160682 i think he knows my smell or when i come around i think so im one of the keepers thats scared to say yeah yeah the animal knows me then tomorrow get killed if i misjudge
1160683 weve raised concerns for years about primates being in peril but now we have solid data to show the situation is far more severe than we imagined
1160684 tropical forest destruction has always been the main cause but now it appears that hunting is just as serious a threat in some areas even where the habitat is still quite intact in many places primates are quite literally being eaten to extinction
1160685 to have a group of animals under such a high level of threat is quite frankly unlike anything we have recorded among any other group of species to date
1160686 among the african species the great apes such as gorillas and bonobos have always tended to grab the limelight and even though they are deeply threatened it is smaller primates such as the red colobus that could die out first

1160690 our dangerous dependence on foreign oil has been thirty years in the making and was caused by the failure of politicians in washington to think long term about the future of the country
1160691 this is one emergency we cant drill our way out of
1160692 any time you pick up a newspaper and see the terms climate change or global warming just think jobs for michigan

1160702 i have already had a question on whether this process will result in more economists on the board to which my answer was that as far as i knew the idea wasnt to change the nature of the board simply to ensure that the best people could be approached
1160703 the intention is not to change the composition of the board
1160704 reinforce among the public a perception that the universitys faculty lacks intellectual and ideological diversity
1160705 it is a right wing think tank being put in place
1160706 the long term consequences will be very severe this will be a flagship entity and it will attract a lot of money and a lot of attention and i think work at the university and the universitys reputation will take a serious rightward turn to the detriment of all
1160707 the credit crunch about which we hear so much but inflation
1160708 the conventional wisdom is that the period of exuberance during the boom period
1160709 it carries connotations of something fragile which was never quite real in the first place
1160710 the low cost of capital enabled risk taking people and companies to try out lots of new ideas simultaneously and on a large enough scale that they got a fair test
1160711 the future fund is clearly emerging as a future source of funding

1160739 although darwin gave us an essential component for the evolution of complexity it is not a sufficient theory
1160740 evolution on its own doesnt look like it can make the creative leaps that have occurred in the history of life
1160741 its a great process for refining tinkering and so on but self organisation is the process that is needed alongside natural selection before you get the kind of creative power that we see around us

1160776 amici share a concern that the injection of massive sums of money into judicial campaigns by litigants and lawyers can in certain circumstances threaten the integrity impartiality and independence of the courts and thereby deprive litigants appearing before those courts of due process of law
1160777 a line needs to be drawn somewhere to prevent a judge from hearing cases involving a person who has made massive campaign contributions to benefit the judge
1160778 this case perfectly illustrates how large contributions in judicial races can distort the judicial process providing at the very least the appearance of corruption

1160819 there were attacks that targeted senior officers and we thank god they failed and our colleagues are safe
1160820 investigations are still ongoing to see who was behind the attacks and it is too early to point out motives although they appeared to be of al qaeda style
1160821 on monday morning jul 21 we were startled by an explosion in the house of colonel issa al issawi who is known as the leader of the campaign against militants in fallujah and surroundings house
1160822 to our surprise the explosion took place on the roof where at least four guards were posted
1160823 one of them was warning his colleagues that the other was a suicide attacker and asking them to take cover then another policeman fired towards both of them
1160824 all of us ran away and then the second bomb went off many policemen were killed and injured in the two blasts these have again ended our dreams of security
1160825 col issawi has been a police officer for over 20 years meaning he is one of saddam husseins officers who agreed to continue although the country was occupied by the americans
1160826 people of fallujah know that he helped al qaeda worked with the islamic party and now is the right arm of the american occupation
1160827 we knew that many of the members of the awakening forces were members of al qaeda
1160828 it was said that about 100 young men were executed inside fallujah police station by the awakening militias in january and february 2007 it became clear later that the executioners were fallujah police leaders following orders issued by the u s military from the headquarters next door
1160829 it seems that we iraqis will all kill each other as long as this u s occupation is paying our leaders to widen the gap between us

1160845 this is a tremendous victory for consumers which will allow us to make dvrs available to many more people faster and less expensively than would otherwise be possible
1160846 we appreciate the courts perspective that from the standpoint of existing copyright law remote storage dvrs are the same as the traditional dvrs that are in use today
1160847 we are going to take advantage of both centralized and distributed approaches where it makes sense
1160848 we could develop a centralized service that is similar to cablevisions but it doesnt preclude us from also leveraging hard drives in the home to do other things

1160851 dreadfully guilty that guests hard earned money has been squandered on wrapits debts
1160852 i am so shocked i dont know what to say
1160853 theres about 3 000 worth of presents on our list bought for us by family and friends and we have received none of it
1160854 there was everything from vases to rugs to coffee makers it sounds prosaic but these are the sort of things we will spend the rest of our life using and would have provided memories of who was at our wedding now we will have to ask all of our guests to get their money back set up another list and go through it all again
1160855 i feel so sorry for the couples who are caught up in this
1160856 i am utterly disgusted with what has happened it is not what getting married is supposed to be like
1160857 hsbc now have it within their power to minimise the pain caused to 2 000 couples and probably 100 000 of their guests and ensure that no wrapit customer loses any money and as things stand they will not take it
1160858 the only thing that will change their minds is public pressure
1160859 we fully appreciate that the company moving into administration has caused great stress among wrapits customers and couples
1160860 however we are confident that hsbc has at all times acted appropriately given the circumstances and any suggestion that hsbc is responsible for wrapits problems is absolutely refuted

1160872 the type of aircraft involved is one thats been operating on the coast for a long time and was a workhorse for the rcmp for years
1160873 in addition to generating more than 1 billion in free cash flow we are very pleased with our production volumes for the quarter
1160874 we lost more than eight weeks of production from independence hub and we still met our guidance for the quarter factoring in the additional four million boe barrels of oil equivalent that would have been produced had the hub been fully operational we would have again shown solid sequential growth relative to the prior quarters outstanding results our strong quarterly operational performance is a reflection of the depth of anadarkos portfolio and our ability to grow organically we are confident that we will achieve our full year production guidance of 207 million to 212 million boe
1160875 our lower risk u s onshore assets continue to perform very well
1160876 in the rocky mountains our operations in the greater natural buttes area and the powder river basin set daily production records during the second quarter as a reminder we have actively managed our commodity price risk in the rockies with firm transportation commitments and attractive basis hedges at a differential to nymex of approximately 1 50 in 2008 and 1 25 in 2009 our southern region assets also performed well during the quarter and our gulf of mexico oil volumes were higher than anticipated all together these assets contributed nearly one million boe above our projections allowing us to meet our guidance for the quarter and largely offset the one month incremental loss at independence hub which was not accounted for in the guidance provided in the first quarter earnings release
1160877 we are extremely pleased with the strong and consistent production growth our core operating areas continue to deliver this strong performance and our investment discipline will result in the company generating free cash flow beginning this year pioneer is at a significant inflection point as we expect our 2009 discretionary cash flow to increase by approximately 50 and our earnings to double from 2008 levels based on current commodity prices and costs
1160878 as evidenced by our 28 increase in second quarter 2008 production compared to second quarter 2007 and our 19 increase in pdp reserves as of june 30 2008 compared to december 31 2007 we are achieving our stated goals of increasing our production and pdp reserves during 2008 the increases in production and pdp reserves are expected to continue as development drilling continues in the barnett shale and new mexico wolfcamp gas projects and infill development and waterflood implementation continue on the majority of our west texas permian basin oil projects
1160879 protecting the carbon in natural forests is preventing an additional emission of carbon from what we get from burning fossil fuel
1160880 there is much more carbon in our natural forests than we thought
1160881 this means the potential amount of avoided emissions is much larger and therefore theres much more to be gained from protecting them from logging
1160882 it means the risks of logging are bigger than we thought
1160883 to be fair to the ipcc and the greenhouse office these are their default volumes
1160884 they were calling for better local data and we have produced that
1160885 pressure build up in a small sealed sample bottle in a storage safe
1160886 all indications are that there was no release of radioactivity to the environment further monitoring around the laboratory will be undertaken
1160887 this pressure build up of toxic gases that plutonium produces could have happened in the most modern lab as well
1160888 the laboratory is equipped with multiple safety systems including an air filtering system to prevent the release of radioactivity to the environment
1160889 theres a free shot of it coming from the north
1160890 you look north and you dont see much getting in the way
1160891 it was shall we say somewhat of a godsend when we were picked to be the first major wind farm in nebraska
1160892 and to be honest with you i dont think ive heard anybody grumble about them as far as the looks
1160893 in fact the state ranks 6th in america for wind development potential
1160894 i think the fundamental thing is that we should be vaccinating someone to protect that person the fact that there is a spin off for the rest of the community is an added bonus
1160895 vaccination of children is important because it protects the kids and it will save lives as well
1160896 of course the cost of the vaccination in terms of the people to deliver it will be substantial but if it is done properly it will be worth it and i believe that it certainly could be done
1160897 there needs to be a lot of information given to parents to make them realise the benefits
1160898 this is good news in that it will stimulate the market it does sound very cheap but its only cheap if you can actually get to the destination
1160899 from northern ireland it is awkward because there are no no frills carriers operating direct to places like turkey or greece
1160900 there are only charter flights which means you have to go for a week or two weeks these deals are being offered in low season and some of the charters stop around october 20 or 25
1160901 it may be cheaper for those in the uk i would advise people to check flights first get all the information together to see if it really is a good deal
1160902 dont forget things like the transfer to the hotel which could cost a lot
1160903 very often a complete package deal works out cheaper its all about perception
1160904 like all businesses we occasionally run marketing initiatives to promote small pockets of availability
1160905 we want to give our customers the best deal we possibly can
1160906 well finally iphone firmware 2 0 1 has just been released by apple and were hoping it solves the myriad problems introduced by 2 0 crashing apps interminable keyboard delays choppy scrolling you know what were talking about were pulling down the 250mb file now well let you know how things turn out wont you do the same
1160907 samsung instinct gets its first firmware update too little too late
1160908 they came to us i think because this is a much bigger issue than just copyright
1160909 for example here in caicara del orinoco there are only three bank branches one is banfoandes another is banco industrial and the other is banco de guayana two of these are public and so there are many municipalities without bank branches one should copy good experiences adapting them to our particular situation
1160910 youre in range you are healthy go see a psychiatrist
1160911 massive use of tax havens to shift the burden to the general population and away from the rich
1160912 complicated devices for ensuring that the poor like 80 percent of the population pay off the rich
1160913 i dont apologize for putting aside money for my children and grandchildren
1160914 open to being commodified that is to being simply one of the many wares of a capitalist media market place in a way that the badly paid and overworked writers and journalists for the revolutionary parties could rarely be
1160915 all we have to do is put chomskys name on a book and it sells out immediately
1160916 if you look at the things i write articles mostly based on talks and meetings and that kind of thing but im kind of a parasite i mean im living off the activism of others im happy to do it
1160917 when property rights are granted to power and privilege it can be expected to be harmful to most

1160919 his image and the messages associated with the campaign resonate with me
1160920 just the way he emotes provides insight into his character
1160921 i think artists are drawn to obama because they are trained to express themselves with color and image obama too is a painter hes painting the future for us splashing color here and creating the image of a beautiful multicultural future
1160922 in ray noland you have a guy who essentially packed up his car and is driving city to city showing the work and donating what proceeds he can to the campaign
1160923 they are on ebay soon after selling for thousands of dollars
1160924 the new yorker cover of obama in muslim garb his wife michelle holding a rifle was auctioning for 20 when you could still get it at newsstands
1160925 the rainbow colored paint symbolizes all the diverse cultures and religions that make our country great that have been marginalized by previous leaders
1160926 obama when he is elected president will finally be the leader that symbolically adds the last few paint strokes on the top of the capitol building to make it truly represent all americans
1160927 we have people visiting galleries in chelsea who otherwise may have never come
1160928 americas artists are the guardians of the spirit of questioning of innovation of reaching across the barriers that fence us off from our neighbors from our allies and adversaries from the six billion other people with whom we share this dark and dazzling world
1160929 art increases the sense of our common humanity the imagination of the artist is therefore a profoundly moral imagination the easier it is for you to imagine walking in someone elses shoes the more difficult it then becomes to do that person harm
1160930 all i can say is one word his condition is serious
1160931 beer makes you feel as you ought to feel without beer
1160932 youre in range you are healthy go see a psychiatrist
1160933 we realize that we cant study to be rabbis in the modern world without knowing something about science so wed like to ask you some questions
1160934 in the talmud it says youre not supposed to make fire on a saturday so our question is can we use electrical things on saturdays
1160935 yes the boys here cant push the buttons on saturday so i have to do it for them you see im not jewish so its all right for me to push the buttons i stand near the elevator and they tell me what floor and i push the button for them
1160936 is the jewish viewpoint a viewpoint that any man can have because if it is not then its certainly not something that is truly valuable for humanity yak yak yak
1160937 is it ethical for a man to hire another man to do something which is unethical for him to do would you hire a man to rob for you for instance
1160938 electricity is not fire its not a chemical process as fire is
1160939 of course theres electricity in amongst the atoms in a fire
1160940 and in every other phenomenon that occurs in the world
1160941 if thats whats bothering you you can put a condensor across the switch so the electricity will go on and off without any spark whatsoever anywhere
1160942 i am trying to make a grey green and white garden
1160943 this is an experiment which i ardently hope may be successful though i doubt it
1160944 these three countries announced that they plan on attempting to kill iranian elements and a short time afterwards the blast occurred in shiraz
1160945 this is the very first operation and the signal to the criminal regime of iran to stop its oppression cruelty and injustice towards sunnis

1160949 its a shift not only of what consumers are spending but where theyre shopping
1160950 if youre a retailer almost your entire customer base is going to do something different and you dont know what its going to be
1160951 the season will be good for discounters and dollar stores and not good for everyone else
1160952 its almost as if weve entered into a new paradigm
1160953 have a new kid by friday revell 2008 this top 10 list is sure to get you and your children off on the right foot
1160954 what would my old self do in this situation what should the new me do
1160955 all right no more candy for life even the youngest child can figure out when theres no action or truth behind the threats
1160956 youre so stupid i have to tell you twice your goal is to get your children to listen listen once hear what you have to say and act on it
1160957 whose problem is this dont own what isnt yours and dont force the ownership on a sibling either you need to keep the ball in your childs court dont take over what she should be doing herself
1160958 parents have to navigate a minefield of calories fat and salt to find them
1160959 parents want to feed their children healthy meals but americas chain restaurants are setting parents up to fail
1160960 mcdonalds burger king kfc and other chains are conditioning kids to expect burgers fried chicken pizza french fries macaroni and cheese and soda in various combination at almost every lunch and dinner
1160961 proud to offer a variety of kids meals for those looking for lower calorie lower fat options
1160962 i think they shouldve included them in the original state quarter program
1160963 a lot of this is going back to the way our grandparents lived reusing things buying things that are sturdier glass containers cloth napkins and things that can be washed and reused
1160964 a large percentage of waste in a home is coming from food packaging
1160965 a lot of ties wire bits of plastic its a horrible thing that the industrys done
1160966 were encouraging people to bring those home and put them in the blue bin
1160967 any thrift store in town is going to have a huge selection of glass and plastic jars
1160968 every time you go out for fast food or to a restaurant
1160969 definitely when we go grocery shopping we focus really heavily on taking canvas bags
1160970 we havent quite solved the little plastic bags that you put produce in so we reuse them
1160971 you can adjust sprite flicker unlike the old games we purposely put some of those old school bugs into this game so it does recreate that feel
1160972 and then when its over thats it lunch and there you go theyre actors theres nothing to it theyre kissing for a couple minutes there and i watch and then its over and we move on to the next thing
1160973 you can easily see the effect of rapid population growth in developing countries
1160974 theres still a long way to go in the developing world
1160975 a lot of it does have to do with the education of women and the movement of women into the labor force
1160976 economist jeffrey d sachs thinks the science and technology of resource rich nations can abolish poverty sickness and other woes of the developing world
1160977 plans that encourage voluntary steep reductions in the fertility rates of poor nations pay dividends in sustainability for everyone
1160978 one of the worlds worst killers can be stopped soon if we make the investment
1160979 sound economic solutions not military ones offer the most reliable route to peace for undeveloped nations
1160980 dramatic immediate commitment to nurturing new technologies is essential to averting disastrous global warming
1160981 were in the second year and if were looking at a third year were talking about a serious problem
1160982 were facing some pretty grim circumstances that call for some bold action recycling water desalinating water
1160983 above and beyond that we have to invest in the sustainability of this system that our grandfathers constructed in the middle of the last century it was developed with the convenience of human beings in mind not aquatic beings
1160984 girls who lack self esteem and have a lack of love in their life
1160985 the common threat is the lack of self esteem and purpose in life and a lack of a sense of direction
1160986 theyre so excited to finally have someone to love them unconditionally
1160987 i try to explain its hard to feel loved when an infant is screaming to be fed at 3 a m
1160988 some girls seemed more upset when they werent pregnant than when they were
1160989 we found out one of the fathers is a 24 year old homeless guy
1160990 dr orr and ms daly have no right to decide this for our children
1160991 every newborn baby in australia represents a potent source of greenhouse gas emissions for an average of 80 years not simply by breathing but by the profligate consumption of resources typical of our society
1160992 far from showering financial booty on new mothers and thereby rewarding greenhouse unfriendly behaviour a baby levy in the form of a carbon tax should apply in line with the polluter pays principle
1160993 the fact that sheen and petersen both happen to be on cbs is coincidental
1160994 theyre at the very top of their game and are the best at what they do youd expect them to be at the top of the scale
1160995 katie courics contract with cbs is legendary youd expect to see her there on the list
1160996 these days there are homeowners groups all over the place
1160997 there are probably thousands of meetings a week with a small effort on their part our programs could make a big difference in the community
1160998 its easy to forget we live in a semi arid environment
1160999 portraying a victim of domestic violence has been the biggest challenge i have ever faced as an actress
1161000 just playing the role has taken a huge emotional toll on my life but it is nothing compared to the pain fear and torment experienced by the thousands of women refuge supports every day
1161001 i have no doubt this campaign will give strength to many women who may be experiencing abuse now or who may do so in the future to reach out and get help
1161002 its all too easy for women to excuse their partners possessive and jealous behaviour but in so doing they run the risk of the abuse increasing in frequency and severity over time
1161003 by understanding the signs early a woman is forewarned and forearmed

1161122 the strong version of the hedonic treadmill model was supported by three arguments a individuals have a long term happiness set point to which they readapt despite changing circumstances b this set point is largely genetically determined c societies happiness levels remain fixed over time recent research argues that the first two points should be re interpreted as strong tendencies and not iron laws the findings presented here support this reassessment and demonstrate that the third point also needs to be modified the happiness levels of nations can and do change
1161123 taken together these findings suggest that the hedonic treadmill model should be revised but not abandoned the twin studies provide convincing evidence that genetic factors have an important impact on subjective well being and there is abundant and equally convincing evidence that people adapt to development freedom happiness changes so that subjective well being levels tend to fluctuate around stable set points but these factors are not as dominant as earlier interpretations suggested the hedonic treadmill model is a tendency that prevails only when other factors are constant
1161124 we would not expect subjective well being to continue rising forever

1161248 counterfeit network hardware entering the marketplace raises significant public safety concerns and must be stopped this initiative shows that through collaboration among law enforcement agencies and prosecutors worldwide we can achieve dramatic enforcement results and protect public safety it is critically important that network administrators in both private sector and government perform due diligence in order to prevent counterfeit hardware from being installed on their networks
1161249 some months ago my contacts in the defense industry had alerted me to a startling development that has escalated to the point of near panick in nearly all corners of government security and it infrastructure the very real concern being investigated by the fbi is that either the chinese government or chinese hackers or both have had the benefit of undetectable back doors into highly secure government and military computer networks for months perhaps years the cause a high number of counterfeit cisco routers and switches installed in nearly all government networks that experienced upgrades and or new units within the past 18 months
1161250 malicious hardware is more problematic because it is more difficult to detect china is already using an early and simple version of malicious hardware in its massive military and industrial espionage campaign against western countries and companies we wrote last week about how chinese companies controlled by the chinese military have manufactured counterfeit cisco routers and switches and offered them at exceedingly low prices to u s vendors who had contracts to upgrade or replace u s government it systems
1161251 my suspicion is that i was targeted by chinese sources because of my long history of speaking out about chinas abysmal human rights record

1161257 we wanted to know whether a drug specific for ppar delta would have the same beneficial effects
1161258 genetic engineering in humans commonly known as gene doping when mentioned in connection with athletic performance is certainly feasible but very impractical
1161259 we got the expected benefits in lowering fatty acids and blood glucose levels but no effect absolutely none on exercise performance
1161260 that led us to consider whether ampk activation was the critical trigger that allowed ppar delta to work
1161261 it essentially puts a turbo charge on ppar delta which explains why exercise is so important
1161262 thats as much improvement as we get with regular exercise

1161267 went though the phases of death i was told to take notes and prepare a report for grand rounds at the hospital
1161268 would have come around anyway even without the ala therapy
1161269 although these types of recoveries were rare they sometimes occurred
1161270 once again hospital authorities told me that these people had no chance of living not with their laboratory results the patients were assigned to my service and i was ordered not to use ala the pharmacists had never heard of the drug before and it was not on the hospital list the chief doctor added that because alpha lipoic acid was not on the hospitals approved drug list and was not recognized by any organization that he was aware of i could not use it again i was told either to stand back and watch the patients die or face reprimand
1161271 but i was a doctor charged with saving lives and i couldnt do that i could not just sit helplessly and watch them die
1161272 not surprisingly the hospital administration was furious with me and branded me as a doctor who could not follow orders a person who was not a good team player
1161273 because i dont think we had exhausted all the medical approaches yet there were actually still other medications that we hadnt tried yet

1161284 is it replacing japan as the economic centre of asia probably not in my view will it soon challenge the us for global supremacy certainly not in my view however one of the less standard measures i am using to move my own mental abacus around is how many firms and media outlets are relocating their regional headquarters to china the sydney morning herald has shifted its asia economics correspondent to beijing and last week i met the executive vice president asia pacific of one of the worlds largest public relations firms who is now based in beijing i see motorola now has its north asia headquarters in beijing while alcatel lucent has consolidated its asia pacific headquarters in shanghai sorry singapore at the moment the numbers of such headquarters seem to be quite low and some think singapore and hong kong are not at risk yet of losing their hub status in the region as always within china there is quite a bit of competition between shanghai beijing and even guangzhou to capture these headquarters each offering a range of sweeteners from tax holidays to assistance with foreign exchange transactions how many top 500 non chinese companies especially those in services shift their regional headquarters to china may be a good measure of chinas growing economic importance globally and regionally whether shanghai or beijing snare more will also be a good measure of where the economic muscle is in china itself
1161285 china may want to shift influence away from the united states to create its own sphere of influence a kind of chinese monroe doctrine for southeast asia where countries would subordinate their interests to chinas

1161301 just read your column in niagara living about a parenting test i too think people are having children woefully unprepared for the experience people used to be around family a lot more when grandma and grandpa and maybe an aunt lived under the same roof we live in a society today that has us lugging babies around in 10 lb convertible carriers instead of picking the baby up and holding them close i can bet that physical therapist offices are filled with moms and dads with strained elbows due to lugging the extra weight wouldnt it be great if kids actually graduated from high school knowing the basics of child rearing and how to balance a check book

1161337 and if the republicans lose the texas house of representatives because there are a handful of people mad at them and vote for the libertarians instead then we could be in big trouble at the federal level
1161338 with control of the texas house in the balance of this election i wouldnt be surprised if republicans try any trick in the book to maintain their grasps of control

1161373 we can help alleviate shortages by drilling for oil and gas in our own country
1161374 we have got the opportunity to find more crude oil here at home
1161375 as a nation we can have more control over our energy destiny by supplying more of the oil and natural gas well be consuming from resources here at home
1161376 it doesnt look good to say we need more oil but then export the refined products that youre getting it doesnt seem to be consistent
1161377 the fact is that the united states participates in global markets for both crude and refined products and there are any number of variables that impact supply and prices in those markets

1161404 afghanistan is not primarily a military problem we cant and shouldnt abandon afghanistan as we did in the early 90s but our presence should be targeted tightly constrained and mostly economic and diplomatic theres a place for counterinsurgency there but not for tens of thousands more troops trying vainly to control hundreds of thousands of square miles of unfriendly territory
1161405 the amount of munitions dropped or fired by u s and other nato aircraft in afghanistan has climbed from an average of 5 000 pounds per month in 2005 to some 80 000 pounds the following year to an average of 168 000 pounds in december 2007

1161415 i have a deep suspicion of photography to the point where i do sometimes think it cannot accurately portray anything really and i particularly distrust portrait photography i mean do you honestly think a portrait can tell you anything about the subject and even if it did would you trust what it had to say
1161416 photographing people with or without permission usually leads to all sorts of ethical dilemmas it is unavoidable i do my best to be good i ask permission im honest about how i use the pictures and send everyone i photograph a print but the truth is that when i take a picture of a person i am using that person they are becoming material for my work and im turning them into an object a piece of paper that is a commodity it is all troubling all i can say is that on the long list of ethical crimes a misdemeanors photographing people in the name of art isnt the worst violation
1161417 it sounds extreme but for me to work at all as a photographer i have to be conscious always of the problems inherent in what i do i have to be conscious if you like of the impossibility of photography
1161418 my child didnt do anything wrong it was the others who did it and blamed him

1161424 hopefully we can get it done the next couple of days every thing is fine
1161425 ive missed time before but its frustrating when its something as small as this you miss some games and not part of the action in a pennant race its no fun to just be watching
1161426 americans appear bent on either launching a strike or steps of covert action to create dynamics that will make it impossible to avoid waging war against iran
1161427 the possibility of an israeli attack against iran is always
1161428 i can think of three reasons why george w bush will not attack iran the first reason is the economy the second reason is north korea the third reason is john mccain
1161429 iran will obtain nuclear arms and the world will as it did with pakistan effing well deal with it
1161430 its not the work that i enjoy so much but the people i run into
1161431 im making more out of this potential loss than it deserves it is not going to be as unpleasant as i am thinking it will be
1161432 this is just one of many trades the outcome of any single trade means nothing the big picture is all that counts
1161433 all warfare is based on deception when able to attack we must seem unable when using our forces we must seem inactive when we are near we must make the enemy believe we are far away
1161434 and here we see why irans behavior over the past six years has been neither irrational nor foolhardy but rather shrewd calculated and successful even while loudly repudiating allegations that it is pursuing a military program the regime has used every technique at its disposal to sow confusion and encourage divisions among its adversaries
1161435 if iran is telling the truth and desires solely nuclear energy which would be peculiar to say the least considering that under its sands rest the worlds second largest natural gas reserves and the worlds fifth largest crude oil reserves its behavior these past six years makes no sense the regime would seem to have had everything to gain from making it crystal clear to the world that it has no intentions of developing nuclear weapons instead it has rejected repeated and alluring incentives designed to seduce it into demonstrating the non existence of the efforts it continues to insist it is not undertaking in the process it has had to suffer painful economic sanctions imposed by the united nations and the united states its six years of defiance and stonewalling have led to increasing diplomatic isolation
1161436 as a matter of simple logic then it is only rational to conclude that iran is working and working very hard to become a nuclear power but there may be logic of a different and no less compelling kind behind its actions for at the end of these same six years many in the west remain fiercely committed to the idea that discussing the dangers of irans pursuit of nuclear power let alone discussing how to stop it represents a greater threat to the world than does the iranian pursuit itself
1161437 for a significant portion of the worlds foreign policy makers and intellectuals any confrontation with iran on the matter of its nuclear program is dangerously provocative and therefore to be avoided
1161438 last september i wrote a salon com article explaining the many reasons why despite neoconservative obsession with bombing iran president bush would not do so he had tacked a different direction part of my case though not all of it rested on the fact that one of vice president cheneys staff members had allegedly told a private group in washington that the vp himself was frustrated with the presidents tilt towards condi rice bob gates and others who emphasized a mix of diplomatic options over hard power gestures more recently however in the last six to eight weeks many of my sources in the state department the white house and the intelligence community tell me that the losers last summer and fall are winning again david addington vice president cheneys chief of staff is winning on virtually every battle he is fighting from not moving forward on new legal protocols that would be more internationally palatable on combat detainee rights to shelving the law of the seas treaty ratification but they say that the level of tension in the white house over iran is also growing and the diplomatic game plan that before was dominant seems to have deteriorated significantly particularly since the departure of former under secretary of state for political affairs r nicholas burns and the firing of admiral william fallon
1161439 diplomacy is eminently the best way to resolve conflicts but beyond a certain point the art of talleyrand becomes completely ineffective and to continue it with an irreconcilable determined enemy is not only a barren exercise but also extremely dangerous as one has to fight this enemy in the future when he will be much stronger at an immensely higher cost
1161440 in the case of iran diplomacy has reached its barren point
1161441 about to die and will soon be erased from the geographical scene
1161442 it is also true that in diplomacy no less than in war deception works because those being deceived prefer to live within the deception rather than to acknowledge the sobering facts
1161443 as a matter of simple logic then it is only rational to conclude that iran is working and working very hard to become a nuclear power try telling this to the lefty west haters my friend great work otto
1161444 many in the west remain fiercely committed to the idea that discussing the dangers of irans pursuit of nuclear power let alone discussing how to stop it represents a greater threat to the world than does the iranian pursuit itself
1161445 i think the neocon re emergence is timely and auspicious
1161446 does anyone really believe that the former cold war rules of nuclear balance namely m
1161447 about to die and will soon be erased from the geographical scene
1161448 it would be understandable for readers misconstrue my position on iran truth is i would much rather a diplomatic solution but for diplomacy to stand a chance both europe america and indeed the world must up the diplomatic ante quite considerably i might add
1161449 the realignment of cifas functions and resources into dia strengthens the close historical and operational relationship between counterintelligence and humint
1161450 integration under one organization will result in greater collaboration in operational and support areas where both disciplines overlap
1161451 the north koreans have 11 000 artillery tubes and rockets aimed at the south korean capital so any little thing that we do with north korea makes the south koreans very jittery
1161452 on the other hand the u s has to worry a great deal about where terrorists might get nuclear weapons or nuclear material
1161453 the more ive seen the more critical i see the need is for the world to pay attention to the people of burma and for the world to put pressure on the military regime
1161454 i think its best for u s chinas relations that i go i know its important for me to send a clear signal to the chinese people that we respect them
1161455 he will have to say something public which is always tricky how much he spotlights these issues
1161456 and i think he will not do it in an adversarial way
1161457 addiction to oil is one of the most dangerous and urgent threats this nation has ever faced
1161458 you wont hear me say this too often but i couldnt agree more with the explanation that sen
1161459 what sen mccain neglected to mention was that during those 30 years he was in washington for 26 of them and in all that time he did little to reduce our dependence on foreign oil
1161460 to do this we will invest 150 billion over the next decade and leverage billions more in private capital to build a new energy economy that harnesses american energy and creates 5 million new american jobs
1161461 so there is a real choice in this election a choice about what kind of future we want for this country and this planet
1161462 misguided policies would result in higher energy costs to american families and businesses and increase dependence on foreign oil
1161463 we have to drill here and drill now not wait and see whether theres areas to explore not wait and see whether theres a package that needs to be put together but drill here and drill now
1161464 he raised more than 1 million from big oil just last month
1161465 i have said and in fact supported a congressional resolution that said we should suspend putting more oil into the strategic oil reserve but the strategic oil reserve i think has to be reserved for a genuine emergency

1161471 ive always been an adventurer and this is the latest part of the adventure
1161472 i wanted to create a place where people could come and learn to surf we had an old ambulance called amy to take people and boards down to sennen cove and gwenver we advertised in custom car magazines oz time out and had an incredible response the times even sent a journalist down
1161473 by the time the summer was over and thousands of people had been through the place was a wreck
1161474 the bbc came and filmed an episode of holiday 76 which was great but suddenly after six or seven great years we started to attract the wrong crowd in 1977 all hell broke loose we werent trying to compete with the 18 30 type holidays but people wanting that kind of experience started turning up i carried on but it was with a heavy heart
1161475 i left chris south in charge of skewjack and bought a fishing boat the next chapter of our lives began then
1161476 skewjack was very much a part of me i was very sad to let it go
1161477 i was asked if id take some students from mencap i agreed and we had a ratio of three students to one instructor we filled all the chalets and i was told at the outset that i had to treat them just like id treat anyone staying on a surf holiday so thats what i did that week watching them get in the sea and love every minute of their surfing was the highlight of skewjack for me
1161478 the other day i was walking down causeway head in penzance when a man stopped me he asked if i remembered him i didnt but then he told me hed come to skewjack and gone on some cliff walks with us he said you know what ive been walking ever since thats a bit like my life too its like surfing youre always in search of the perfect wave
1161479 una de las organizaciones m s importantes del mundo en la defensa de la dignidad humana y los derechos fundamentales de todas las mujeres y los hombres
1161480 considero que la petici n del vaticano se enmarca en una lucha de poder es decir se trata de un claro intento de debilitar a una organizaci n tan importante e independiente como ai que adem s es premio nobel de la paz
1161481 en su firme apoyo al derecho de las mujeres a ejercer sus derechos sexuales y reproductivos sin sufrir amenazas fuerza o coacci n y desde luego defiendo el derecho de todas las mujeres del mundo a no sufrir amenaza o coacci n para hacer frente a las consecuencias de una violaci n o de otros graves abusos que se cometen contra ella en clara vulneraci n a sus derechos como seres humanos
1161482 me gustar a ver una condena contundente por parte de la jerarqu a vaticana hacia aquellos que amenazan fuerzan coaccionan o violan a las mujeres en vez de meterse con una organizaci n de reconocido prestigio internacional que lo que hace es defender a las mujeres

1161503 economic times there is now a growing discomfort about the role of speculative finance in the us the capital of global finance
1161504 twenty years ago 21 of oil contracts were purchased by speculators who trade oil on paper with no intention of ever taking delivery today oil speculators purchase 66 of all oil futures contracts and that reflects just the transactions that are known speculators buy up large amounts of oil and then sell it to each other again and again a barrel of oil may trade 20 plus times before it is delivered and used the price goes up with each trade and consumers pick up the final tab some market experts estimate that current prices reflect as much as 30 to 60 per barrel in unnecessary speculative costs

1161523 no governments are the peoples conscience outspoken it is through governments that people seek hope and determine to correct the ills of society
1161524 this is how it is here in america this is who americans are
1161525 in the best of cases perhaps but more often than not your laws are the announcements of what those in
1161526 whats wrong with that if there are a few of the brightest and best among us willing to look at the problems of society of the world and propose solutions does that not serve the many
1161527 you can grow and become great when you are constantly being told what to do by government
1161528 it could be argued that government by that i mean the law by which weve chosen to govern ourselves is a reflection of societys greatness or lack thereof that great societies pass great laws
1161529 and very few of them for in great societies very few laws are necessary
1161530 i am not suggesting a world with no codes of behavior no agreements i am suggesting that your agreements and codes be based on a higher understanding and a grander definition of self interest what most laws actually do say is what the most powerful among you have as their vested interest lets look at just one example smoking now the law says you cannot grow and use a certain kind of plant hemp because so the government tells you it is not good for you yet the same government says it is all right to grow and use another kind of plant tobacco not because it is good for you indeed the government itself says it is bad but presumably because youve always done so the real reason the first plant is outlawed and the second is not has nothing to do with health it has to do with economics and that is to say power your laws therefore do not reflect what your society thinks of itself and wishes to be your laws reflect where the power is
1161531 no fair you picked a situation where the contradictions are apparent most situations are not
1161532 to have as few laws which really are limits as possible
1161533 i dont mean the watch and chain only the charm im very fond of that charm it means a great deal to me take it near the window and read what is engraved on the back of it
1161534 presented to calvin coolidge speaker of the house by the massachusetts general court
1161535 yes i am and i dont want you to take that charm
1161536 how much will it take to pay your hotel bill and get you and your friend back to the campus sit down and lets talk this over
1161537 son youre a nice boy you are better than you are acting you are starting down the wrong road just remember who you are
1161538 there is more in us than we know if we can be made to see it perhaps for the rest of our lives we will be unwilling to settle for less
1161539 an ounce of action is worth a ton of theory
1161540 but i really must be going thank you for inviting me and for the coffee and the cookies
1161541 you make things sound pretty bad yet america has done more for the underprivileged and the unfortunate both here and abroad than any other nation on earth
1161542 america has done much that is observably true yet do you know that a percentage of gross national product the unites states provides proportionally less for foreign aid than many much smaller countries
1161543 u s foreign aid in comparison to other developed countries according to the most recent 2001 foreign aid figures from the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd the united states ranks 22nd in the world as a giver of foreign aid as a percentage of gross national product gnp the u s level is about one tenth of one percent of gnp which is about one fourth of the average effort of developed countries in absolute amount of foreign aid the united states ranks first for 2001 after ranking second to japan for several previous years
1161544 the point is that before you allow yourself to become too self congratulatory perhaps you should look at the world around you for if this is the best your world can do for the less fortunate you all have much to learn
1161545 it seems such a pathetic question to have to ask why cant we love the members of our family
1161546 how can the peoples of the earth change their world view
1161547 that depends on what you want to change it to
1161548 how can we eliminate more of the pain more of the suffering
1161549 by eliminating all separations between you by constructing a new model of the world by holding it within the framework of a
1161550 which is going to be a radical departure from the present world view
1161551 the worlds political machinery operates on self interest what else is new
1161552 that which is not serving you given who and what you choose to be
1161553 but just how effective is u s public diplomacy critics have suggested that it is simply a packaged ad campaign a critique that has some merit
1161554 systemic antagonism exaggeration of americas shortcomings for political ends or mischaracterizations of american society policies or goals as ridiculous or malevolent
1161555 u s promotion of the universality of democratic values like equality egalitarianism and rule of law human rights civil liberties and freedom are problematic particularly in the middle east
1161556 remember that america is a country not a product and that it cant be sold to the rest of mankind like a brand to be consumed leave marketing to the business sector listen to what they have to say
1161557 this advice to listen rather than simply push a product is central to salvaging the international reputation of the united states
1161558 most diplomats from other nations believe that the united states is the most arrogant nation in the world
1161559 the american habit of not listening to global criticism is related to impatience and arrogance
1161560 why should we listen carefully they ask we already know what is good for you and we will be pleased to tell you what your needs are and how we can fix those needs because we have not developed good listening skills which require patience american diplomats are perceived as superficial
1161561 listening is a sign of respect it is a sign that you actually value what the other person might have to say if you just listen to someone first it is amazing how much they will listen to you back
1161562 bol var despierta cada cien a os cuando despiertan los pueblos

1161564 patience is the ability to idle your motor when you feel like stripping your gears
1161565 theyre my brothers boots my mom made me wear them
1161566 a handful of patience is worth more than a bushel of brains
1161567 there was a person who needed to accomplish a task to do so that person needed to use a piece of software they had never heard of let alone knew enough about to functionally use it it would take months to learn it and complete the task instead of forging on they searched the blogs and found someone who mentioned that they did another project using the software this second person was contacted and asked to help within a matter of a few weeks the project was done now tell me how many blog posts was the efficiency gain worth add up not only the time saved by one individual but the advantages for a quicker time to market for this project
1161568 a valid source is a valid source forget which news organization came up with it in the linktribution environment you link to content
1161569 trying to secure full access for its staff to ensure that the food aid goes to those who need it most
1161570 these will be quiet days in our homes but i have had the experience over and over again that the quieter it is around me the clearer do i feel a connection to you it is as though in solitude the soul develops senses which we hardly know in everyday life therefore i have not felt lonely or abandoned for one moment
1161571 only in a quiet mind is adequate perception of the world
1161572 i can be alone without being lonely in fact those times of solitude are necessary respite for a beleaguered soul set upon by the pressures of life i need to take whatever moments i can to just be still
1161573 i admit to being a tad despondent about this global belief that obama would be better in managing world affairs lets be clear cut you want to talk to anyone including americas sworn enemies without pre conditions you want to pull back forces from overseas draw down the military move money away from military programs retire carrier battle groups pull away from hot spots and this will not impact americas and the worlds better interests dont think so
1161574 if the election was held today in the world obama would win
1161575 i dont think america would be in iraq if he were president
1161576 dumb war a war based not on reason but on passion not on principle but on politics
1161577 i began to suspect that i might have been wrong about the war
1161578 absolutely wants to make sure that the troops have sufficient support to be able to win
1161579 there are patriots who opposed the war in iraq and patriots who supported it
1161580 im not privy to senate intelligence reports what would i have done i dont know
1161581 im always careful to say that i was not in the senate so perhaps the reason i thought the war was such a bad idea was that i didnt have the benefit of u s intelligence
1161582 t heres not that much difference between my position on the war and george bushs position at this stage
1161583 it is arguable that the best politics going into 06 would be a clear succinct message lets bring our troops home but whether thats the best policy right now i dont feel comfortable saying it is
1161584 redeployment of u s forces no later than may 1 2007
1161585 remove all combat brigades from iraq by march 31 2008
1161586 presidential hopeful barack obama said thursday the united states cannot use its military to solve humanitarian problems and that preventing a potential genocide in iraq isnt a good enough reason to keep u s forces there
1161587 judgment is surely one of the qualities we need in our next president we are all called upon to make our own judgments in the months leading to the november election one judgment we need to make is whether we want the oval office to be the worlds most dangerous classroom
1161588 the latest pew report only confirms what i had suspected for over a year now the world loves obama and has little time understanding or even knowledge of mccain
1161589 there are two perfectly good reasons for there to be 32 bowl games gambling and gambling
1161590 thinking back over my life it seems to me that there are different ways of looking out and trying to understand the world around us theres a very clear scientific window and it does enable us to understand an awful lot about whats out there theres another window its the window through which the wise men the holy men the masters of the different and great religions look as they try to understand the meaning in the world my own preference is the window of the mystic
1161591 if endeavor had been an investor rather than an independent objective non profit enabler it would not have been trusted by the business elite or the entrepreneurs
1161592 at first we werent thrilled about letting steve go to the packers
1161593 but when mike packers head coach mccarthy promised not to actually have him run any routes or catch any passes we sort of saw it as a win win situation i mean we really need to let d j hackett get some time with the first team so hes ready for those two games when steve is suspended and i sure as hell didnt want to be the guy to tell him hed be running with the second team this week
1161594 exclusively paired with favre during his time in packers camp
1161595 im not going to go into too much detail but lets just say that mike and ted are basically putting an open flame next to a leaky gas line and hoping something blows up
1161596 brett doesnt really know steves history so the plan is to play it like theyve just brought in a good receiver to run some routes with him on the side while he gets up to speed physically tips on how to get along with steve you know just some things to say to break the ice so to speak only if he actually says some of those things well lets just say it makes ken lucas trash talk look like friendly ribbing
1161597 much needed distance from the more physically vulnerable members of our franchise
1161598 i have no reason to believe that the packers have any ulterior motives for bringing steve in to work with brett
1161599 that said speaking strictly in hypothetical terms if steve can get some of his extra aggression out by beating on people from
1161600 do you guys have any idea how much it costs to surgically repair a broken nose more than we wanted to spend on ken lucas i can tell you that
1161601 that it never does a boy much good to shoot him
1161602 this letter will certify that roswell mcintyre is to be readmitted into the new york cavalry when he serves out his required enlistment he will be freed of any charges of desertion

1161606 a good design is reusable but a great one is reusable in ways that you could never have imagined
1161607 sometimes i have nothing to write about and sometimes i have plenty to say the key is to write no matter what if you write often enough a strange thing starts to happen you stop lying so much and slowly some of the truth starts trickling in it turns out that it shockingly hard to maintain a stream of hype exaggeration and hyperbole without a trace of truth fear or regret
1161608 as a beauty i am not a great star there are others more handsome by far but my face i dont mind it for i am behind it its the people in front who get the jar

1161623 remember to be gentle with yourself and others we are all children of chance and none can say why some fields will blossom and others lay brown beneath the august sun care for those around you look past your differences their dreams are no less than yours their choices in life no more easily made and give give in any way that you can of whatever you possess to give is to love to withhold is to wither care less for your harvest than how it is shared and your life will have meaning and your heart will have peace

1161635 i know now what if feels like to be out of this world
1161636 i was overcome by the beauty of the earth below i dont think the words exist to convey what its like to see the earth from space the curve of the earth the swirling eddies the patterns of clouds marbling the surface above the brilliantly blue color of the water and the blue green of the land the sheer beauty of the earth and the excitement of being in a position to see it made this the greatest experience of my life using binoculars i once counted 22 discernible layers of blue in the band of sunrise color that would be seen from earth simply as blue

1161640 here is some evidence of the potential new commander in chief
1161641 the constitution gave the federal government certain responsibilities arbitrate disputes between the states provide for a common defense conduct foreign policy and collect the monies necessary to support those responsibilities
1161642 the comeback was if the story is true then why is it defamatory
1161643 as far as i know if you tell the truth it isnt slander
1161644 you better be more concerned about a muslim being president than a lesbian
1161645 the moral test of government is how that government treats those who are in the dawn of life the children those who are in the twilight of life the elderly and those who are in the shadows of life the sick the needy and the handicapped
1161646 i do not believe i have a responsibility for anybody except myself
1161647 thats a ridiculous statement i said nothing about abandoning the constitution
1161648 you conveniently ignored the rest of my post the bit about going back to the original purpose of the constitution you know arbitrate disputes between the states etc
1161649 we the people in order to form a more perfect union
1161650 as far as this board is concerned i thought we were on a debate and discussion board not a board thats controlled by a self appointed monitor if he doesnt like something it tattle tale time shrug i outgrew that behavior in junior high
1161651 youve been going to that park for over 30 years how could you get lost
1161652 i wasnt lost i was just too tired to walk home
1161653 ive reached the age where the warranty has expired on my remaining teeth and internal organs
1161654 the higher you get the more tired and breathless you become but your view becomes much more extensive
1161655 the detractors take pride in divorcing themselves from reality whenever it suits they view american capitalism as if something evil a mentality that forms part of a wider anti america mindset that i believe ought be characterized as an intellectually neglected cultural and social psychological phenomenon
1161656 our economies and our national security are irrevocably tied to a secure world order an order to which the present day united states is at the heart
1161657 that i believe ought be characterized as an intellectually neglected cultural and social psychological phenomenon
1161658 there never has been a time when the power of america was so necessary or so misunderstood or when except in the most general sense a study of history provides so little instruction for our present day
1161659 most of us need america they dont necessarily need us

1161675 almost everybody walks around with a vast burden of imaginary limitations inside his head
1161676 while the burden remains personal success is as difficult to achieve as the conquest of everest with a sack of rocks tied to your back

1161735 i die a horrible death so thats closure for me im joking well maybe i am no the final two episodes are perfect theres a lot of closure to a lot of the storylines but there are still some questions which are the way that things should be
1161736 this song is not only outrageously offensive to sen clinton rev jackson sen mccain and president bush it is offensive to all of us who are trying to raise our children with the values we hold dear while ludacris is a talented individual he should be ashamed of these lyrics
1161737 just because im black doesnt mean you can lump me in with thugs
1161738 insert serious question about writing for joss here and does elizas spine glow
1161739 for me for the last three years ive been feeling that the anti virus industry sucks if you have 5 5 million new viruses out there how can you claim this industry is doing the right job
1161740 we could use the tools we have to start a call for change we could look to set up a core set of principles for school reform that harnesses the best pedagogies and the new tools
1161741 this is the soviet standard ideology philosophy and above all soviet aesthetics of fear
1161742 the outgoing russian leader said that fridays parade to mark the end of world war ii would demonstrate russias growing defense capabilities
1161743 we do not threaten anyone and do not intend to do so
1161744 this is the soviet standard ideology philosophy and above all soviet aesthetics of fear what achievements can the semi totalitarian russian society show to the world one cannot parade an oil pipeline so instead this society shows off what it showed to the world throughout the soviet era
1161745 we do not threaten anyone and do not intend to do so
1161746 in times of crises politics ideology and rule are considered peripheral it matters little which nation is affected if it is deemed that the nation cannot even with good intentions provide for its people then a helping hand is extended burmas generals have little time for america or americans but for the u s the compelling need to provide humanitarian assistance to a shattered populace transcends this
1161747 acknowledge the scorecard the full spectrum of us hegemony from its brute military muscle to the soft seduction of american ideas has been an overwhelming force for good
1161748 the u s is increasingly dealing with a challenging world at a time where countries as china india russia and iran are vying for regional predominance where competition between liberalism and absolutism has re ignited where and nations are once again gradually lining up along ideological lines where the rift between tradition and modernity islamic fundamentalism verses modern secularism is widening and finally when anti americanism is pronounced it was timely to come across a common sense blog post opinion in yesterdays national papers
1161749 whenever a serious crisis erupts somewhere our dependence on the us becomes obvious and many hate the us because of it
1161750 the us has had isolationist periods in the past and it must be enormously tempted sometimes to have another one soon
1161751 on the verge of committing crime a crime against hum anity
1161752 one of the most visionary school administrators in the united states
1161753 while we have institutions in india such as the indian institute of technology where the facilities and quality of education match if not surpass the standards of some of the most renowned institutions in the world this story truly reflects on the internet access facilities and the attitude of the authorities in several schools colleges across india
1161754 so much for the guarantees given to the ioc about human rights back when the 2008 games were awarded where is the condemnation from sports bodies and the international olympic committee now that
1161755 saying americans help people overseas is pure bullshit americans help themselves to what other nations surrender to their military might they do nothing in the humanitarian fields without an ulterior motive of gain for themselves
1161756 its the least the us could do after all the destruction it leaves behind the americans ability to deploy its forces anywhere in the world is testament to its massive military infrastructure that spans the globe and why is it anti americanism to criticise the aggressive imperialist foreign policies of the us most of the world has a negative view of american foreign policy and with good reason but no lets ignore all the wars and trouble they have caused throughout the world and simply remember the good they do may i remind you that you do the exact opposite when criticising a nation such as china
1161757 the view of the great satan usa will disappear along with bush so you can come down from your go go podium its thanks to him that the un has been undermined on so many fronts and cant meet its potential the un and australia are also waiting on the sidelines of burma a lot of good that does whilst were talking about credit where credits due we should applaud chinas quick response to its own catastrophe in fact thats what i thought your column was going to be about remember the era of us influence is waning china is dominating the global community it is with the greatest respect that we applaud the good deeds of a communist regime which is striding quickly to become the worlds most powerful and influential nation lets hear it for china
1161758 i think that reading some of the anti american bile written here you have sort of proved your point
1161759 would a world without present day america be more peaceful stable prosperous secure and open
1161760 theyll carry on as programmed by their high school teachers their university professors and their news broadcasters like the everready bunny
1161761 amongst the many elements of american power that incites its detractors things like success imperialistic expansiveness and generosity see previous two posts democratic economics and capitalism are viewed as the both an enemy and disease the detractors take pride in divorcing themselves from reality whenever it suits and include the likes of anti modern greens islamists the intellectual and broad ranging left
1161762 the picture leads me to tell you that i am cautiously optimistic that there are challenges that indeed we need more forces and that our presence in afghanistan means sharing responsibilities and also sharing risks
1161763 imagine there is no us are the european nations threatened by radical islamism or not imagine there is no us does the european union depend on oil and gas imports from the greater middle east imagine there is no us is the acquisition of nuclear weapons by the khomeinist regime in tehran good or bad for france and the european union imagine there is no us isnt europe safer if afghanistan and iraq are transformed into friendly democracies rather than a safe haven for terrorists france responds to its friends this is a sign to all that france is participating in the stability of this region of the world
1161764 dont worry euros american boots are on the ground and as long as they are there it will be a
1161765 i want to dispense with the need for affirmations the call for absolute certainties and or unmitigated intelligence accuracy
1161766 now we assess that north korea has assisted syria with this reactor because one it uses north korean type technology the building resembles north koreas yongbyon plutonium power reactor thats yongbyon on the left thats that non descript building in the eastern syrian desert before the curtain walls and false roof were put on the top of it to hide its shape which without those curtain walls and false roofs seem to carry the telltale signatures similar to the facility at yongbyon internal photographs of the reactor vessel under construction shows that its a gas cooled graphite moderated reactor similar in technology and configuration to the yongbyon reactor
1161767 and you can see that more clearly in this photo that compares the control rods and the refuelingtube arrangements of both reactors thats internal imagery of al kibar on the left and yongbyon on the right
1161768 we obviously were looking very closely at options and we had looked at some approaches that involved a mix of diplomacy and the threat of military force with the goal of trying to ensure that the reactor was either dismantled or permanently disabled and therefore never became operational
1161769 we understand the israeli action we believe this clandestine reactor was a threat to regional peace and security and we have stated before that we cannot allow the worlds most dangerous regimes to acquire the worlds most dangerous weapons
1161770 ever notice that when a rogue state like syria is attacked to prevent them from causing massive harm to their neighbors and the world it is always the attacker that is condemned
1161771 software platforms will enable students to teach other students by developing tools and putting them into the user network isnt it better to have the professionals teach and the learners learn no not necessarily we often learn better when we teach than when we listen to a teacher
1161772 they provide us policymakers with 90 000 tons of deployable difficult to ignore cold steel persuasion at a time when it is increasingly difficult for the u
1161773 budget is tight programs are behind schedule and theyre trying to avoid sinking the fleets total of battle force ships below todays 279 hulls
1161774 during the cold war the 600 ship u s navy needed to be in only three places in force the atlantic and pacific flanks of the soviet union and the mediterranean we sometimes subcontracted out less important tropical sea lanes to other free world navies now we need to cover the earth with less than half that number of ships
1161775 a great navy is like oxygen you notice it only when it is gone
1161776 embolden potential adversaries more than one historically great naval power became a shadow of its former self much to its detriment
1161777 most of us really do think that all these warplanes bombs guns and nasty battleships are probably standing in the way of global peace and utopia
1161778 its no more reasonable to think that a hussein is a tyrant in the making than it is to assume that a schmidt wears black boots and marches the goose step or that johnsens and stensruds are likely to lead a band of raiders down the mississippi
1161779 all these warplanes bombs guns and nasty battleships are probably standing in the way of global peace and utopia
1161780 is that what theyre taught at school silly question for thats exactly what they are taught

1161799 make no mistake obtaining and smuggling a nuclear device into america remains extremely difficult my hope is that homeland security experts and those charged with policy creation in this matter will ensure it stays that way
1161800 where a nuclear attack once may have been beyond the capacities of stateless terrorists that is no longer the case one need only consider khalid sheik mohammed ksm mastermind of 9 11 and chief operating officer of al qaeda who revealed under intensive interrogation including the much maligned tactic of waterboarding that a nuclear attack against the united states was a top priority for al qaeda
1161801 according to the new york daily news and its sources the captive ksm told his interrogators that osama bin laden was planning a
1161802 details remain frightening and reveal names of the many participants involved including the father of the pakistan bomb
1161803 john loftus of wabc news reported on november 7 2003 that in the immediate wake of shukrijumah and his fellow travelers disappearance 180 pounds of uranium ended up
1161804 at more than 50 percent over the next decade that is two respected experts in the field believe that the nuclear destruction of one or more american urban centers is more probable than not in the very near future
1161805 while the mainstream media currently mostly ignore this story and the almost certain fact that a nuclear plot is ongoing today senator joseph lieberman has held at least three separate hearings in 2008 of his committee on homeland security and governmental affairs on this very subject the testimony from experts summoned to these hearings has been grim nobody doubts that once terrorists acquire fissile material which is either highly enriched uranium heu or plutonium a bomb is within there theoretical capacity and will to make and use a simple gun type device like that used for the atom bomb dropped on hiroshima is sufficient to yield a one to ten kiloton explosion
1161806 the international atomic energy agency iaea has documented 15 incidents of theft and smuggling of small amounts of separated plutonium or highly enriched uranium confirmed by the nations involved
1161807 nuclear weapons or their essential ingredients exist in hundreds of buildings in dozens of countries with security measures that range from excellent to appalling in some cases no more than a night watchman and a chain link fence
1161808 in recent months shadowy surveillance teams have been reported scoping out secret nuclear weapons facilities in russia
1161809 it is a sobering fact that nearly all of the stolen heu and plutonium that has been seized over the years had never been missed before it was seized
1161810 the washington post right before last christmas reported a strange story sometime in the night of november 8 2007 two coordinated teams of armed men attacked the pelindaba nuclear facility in south africa where hundreds of kilograms of weapon grade highly enriched uranium heu are stored one of the teams was chased off by the guards but the other team of four gunmen disabled the perimeter alarms went to the emergency control center and shot a worker in the chest bleeding out the worker was still able to sound the first alarm
1161811 he might not have bothered the attack team then spent 45 minutes inside the perimeter without anyone harassing them what they did next is unknown to the public the team promptly disappeared through the same hole they had cut in the fence south african officials later arrested three individuals but soon released them the south african government has since been close lipped about what really happened last november and it has refused earlier u s offers to remove the heu at pelindaba if indeed any remains after the attack we dont even know how much heu if any was spirited away
1161812 if the iraqi regime is able to produce buy or steal an amount of uranium a little bigger than a softball it could have a nuclear weapon in less than a year
1161813 today we face some of the greatest threats that any generation will ever know and we must not be slow in confronting them we must continue to emphasize integration across the community to better serve our customers provide frank unencumbered analysis and strengthen collection capabilities that continue to penetrate the seemingly impenetrable
1161814 the willingness of the autocrats in moscow and beijing to protect their fellow autocrats in pyongyang tehran and khartoum increases the chances that the connection between terrorists and nuclear weapons will eventually be made when it comes to iran syria and hizballah russia and china tend to see not terrorists but useful partners in a great global struggle
1161815 if they feel a lot of pain and discomfort because of it
1161816 the connection between terrorists and nuclear weapons will eventually be made

1161912 i dont think anyones going to argue with you if youre simply prioritizing real time traffic over non real time
1161913 id much rather have a neteqd open connection than a nated nonmanaged one thats for sure
1161914 netequalizer never opens up any customer data and thus cannot be accused of spying connections are treated as a metered resource
1161915 the isps that use netequalizer simply put a policy in their service contracts stating how many connections they support end of story bittorrent is still allowed to run albeit not as wide with unlimited connections
1161916 i am not a fan of bandwidth control the correct solution is for providers to build out more capacity by reinvesting their profits however ill concede a solution such as a netequalizer is much more palatable than redirecting or specially blocking bittorrent and also seems to be more acceptable to consumers than bandwidth caps or metered plans
1161917 there is a risk though who decides what the peaks times are how much bandwidth connections would that be let me reiterate i would rather see that isps invest in network capacity than network managing hardware
1161918 the internet is growing rapidly and if networks crash already they are clearly doing something wrong
1161919 but the new fiscal year forced dark myth management to closely examine each project within the dark myth organization its important that we spend our financial resources wisely

1161923 here in the south the highest utility bills would be in august
1161924 i am stunned as i stand there in the foyer
1161925 this bubba really isnt as stupid as i look oh did i say that out loud
1161926 this implies that there are bill killing seasons in the south and in most parts of the united states there are two primary bill killing seasons one occurs after summer when the heat has broken and the bitter cold of winter has not yet settled in the other bill killing season comes after winter when the cold has broken and the simmering heat of summer has not yet arrived because of the low utilities in these brief mild seasons you can pour extra fuel into your debt destruction engine and go all out to execute debt for someone in north dakota the highest combined cost of heating and cooling would probably occur in february if the north dakotan applies this strategy he adds extra fuel to his debt destroying locomotive 11 months a year he puts out cash as if his bills were the same amount they were at the beginning and as if his utilities were the same amount these were in february for the guy in alaska there might be a time of perhaps 3 months when the heating oil cost is less than the rest of the year from mid june to mid september this would be his one bill killing season he would pour extra fuel into his debt destruction engine during this mild season
1161927 and there is one other factor that gives us debt destroyers a little help its not a lot of help but we need all the assistance we can get im talking about free checks if you are paid weekly you generally have to think in terms of paying 1 4 of your monthly bills every week you get in the habit of paying each months bills with 4 checks with 12 months in the year you pay your bills with 12 x 4 48 checks you however receive 52 weekly checks a year there are 4 free checks then this gives you a little room to pull ahead or to catch up if youre behind if you are paid biweekly you get in the habit of paying each months bills with 2 checks with 12 months in the year you pay your bills with 12 x 2 24 checks you however receive 26 checks a year there are 2 free checks then these 2 checks help you to pull ahead or catch up so you can use the weather and these free checks to help you kill bills
1161928 the sweet guy is probably thanking me some more here
1161929 my name is not really bubba and i do not work for the lone star brewing company i

1161980 when effects step out of the background and become an active participant among the characters that changes the dynamic alters the drama that gives you something audiences hadnt seen before

1162021 lower global stock prices could impede the recapitalization of banks and other financial institutions debt issuance would also be suppressed as it leverages off the level of equity
1162022 the price of equities worldwide will determine whether the international financial system can maintain a modicum of stability as it eases out of its credit crunch or falls back into another period of angst and turmoil

1162028 there is no national male circumcision campaign to promote it more education is needed

1162049 txdot and their buddies continue to steamroll a plan the majority of texans dont want
1162050 if they dont end this public fleecing there wont be enough political cover for the consequences at the ballot box
1162051 critics say moving ahead right now is a slap in the face to the legislature
1162052 txdot is legally obligated to start its entire environmental study process over
1162053 txdots minute order does little to truly bind it in its future dealings
1162054 toll roads and private toll roads will continue to be on the states agenda
1162055 gov perry and the legislature have seen tolls as a way to avoid raising taxes to pay for roads a position that neither seem eager to change
1162056 the federal government has no business being partner to this outrageous plan
1162057 ttc 69 is not officially dead we need to take every step possible until it is officially dead
1162058 txdot has no obligation to make any changes just obligation to listen
1162059 txdot is working for a governor who is dead set on building a massive superhighway system that the texas public simply does not want
1162060 overwhelmingly to a staggering degree the reaction is negative against it
1162061 any resemblance to free market principles is more illusion than fact
1162062 we intend to continue turning over all the rocks to see what crawls out
1162063 foreign companies acquiring u s highways raising tolls and stopping competition through contracts
1162064 investors want to acquire large public assets here why thats a bad idea

1162074 in east texas a lot of people think i 69 is going to be a serious upgrade of u s 59 but if theyre going to build a whole new corridor watch out
1162075 cintra agreed to seek the contract with the understanding it would not have to compete against the ntta
1162076 budget would give legislators a tighter grip on the state department of transportation
1162077 theres no reason that texans must become slaves to toll roads
1162078 selling highways is not politically correct in this state i dont care how much you get for it
1162079 it is unnecessary and inappropriate to ask private entities to loan us money to build highways
1162080 the effort to halt private toll road deals is not over
1162081 we would forfeit billions with private partnership on sh 121
1162082 what a shame we dont have recall elections for the governor in texas
1162083 rmas can build roads outside the city outside the state and outside the country

1162087 its a big mistake for public officials to rush into a fire sale of the publics assets
1162088 leading the house through coercion and intimidation has not produced a better texas
1162089 one of the most dramatic coups in recent texas political history
1162090 politicians may love to sell roads but the public isnt buying
1162091 the wisest way to conquer an enemy isnt with bullets or bombs
1162092 the people of central texas need to be treated like valued constituents not just resources to be harvested
1162093 rational alternatives to txdots nutty toll road or no road sales pitch sen
1162094 its about making money for these foreign companies that will run the trans texas corridor
1162095 props 1 amp 9 simply allow perry to keep his tax raising bureaucrats and politicians in power longer
1162096 governments should avoid public private infrastructure deals led by investment banks
1162097 this is going to be an amendment to issue bonds and were the ones who will be holding the bank
1162098 kick out lackluster governor a few dozen incompetent special interest legislators and appointed officials
1162099 why do officials keep on trying to shove the ttc down our throats
1162100 the ploy is to move private rail into gov rick perrys texas corridor after he promised no public funds would be used
1162101 there seems to be an overemphasis on money and not on service
1162102 private toll roads would not be financially viable without the huge government subsidies
1162103 the only project more controversial than toll roads is ttc 35
1162104 it is imperative that texans recognize the truth and vote down propositions 1 amp 9 with a vengeance
1162105 the state is committing taxpayers to massive debt for generations while private special interest corporations profit
1162106 since some lawmakers serve on mpo boards there is no separation of powers between the legislative and executive branches of government
1162107 they have a plan for making free roads so slow that people would be forced to take the toll lanes
1162108 this road leads to three cities ones called political patronage the others called corruption and the others called graft
1162109 the citizens of texas have a right to know what theyre being obligated to
1162110 an earful with very little of the commentary being positive
1162111 the trans texas corridor will be owned by the people of texas
1162112 txdot could still condemn property for ancillary facilities with the approval of local county commisioners court
1162113 i dont want tolls on federal highways period end of statement
1162114 planned international corridor is a giant step towards the complete destruction of property rights in america
1162115 im not going to be run over from some guy with a big ego from txdot
1162116 i think what they need to do is widen the roads they have and make improvements
1162117 taxpayers should have a say about something as fundamental as our highway system
1162118 reminds me of the argument that the lotto would go toward paying for schools
1162119 private developers cant condemn private property for the trans texas corridor
1162120 private companies are not necessarily more efficient at running roads and their tolls amount to a regressive tax on highway building
1162121 local leaders didnt learn about the proposal until shortly after it was submitted to the state in april
1162122 the supreme court is telling us to trust our elected officials thats a nice idea in concept but a bad one in practice
1162123 cintra will not ask for local state or federal contributions
1162124 european foreign run toll roads will turn txdot into eurodot
1162125 people willing to sit around and compose recommendations that may or may not be heeded
1162126 well get a share of the tolls when they recover their investment
1162127 theres far more structure in this agreement than we were led to believe
1162128 governors motives are open to question in light of the large campaign contributions he received from interests boosting the privatized corridors
1162129 the whole nation is watching texas to see if we can pull it off
1162130 cintra will not ask for local state or federal contributions
1162131 we are about to witness eminent domain taken to a level unforeseen before
1162132 state officials as well as the news media need to do a far better job of educating the public
1162133 texas transportation commission voted unanimously to begin negotiations with spain based cintra
1162134 sweeping new policy became law without public demand or awareness
1162135 we could put 50 texans on the moon cheaper and ive got a list
1162136 i think its nothing but a scheme to raise money for the state of texas
1162137 we are getting a lot of double speak from the state on the project and that is destroying the level of trust
1162138 i havent seen any concern at all from rural areas
1162139 plenty of political muscle was flexed on behalf of proposition 15

1162155 i got a megaphone i yell out of and two 5 gallon water jugs with steel ball bearings that make noise

1162164 he broke his shoulder and arm but hes doing ok hes already laughing and joking around with the nurses
1162165 you trade places with this woman she cant seem to keep her big head outta my way and im gonna knock her head off
1162166 the reputation of this team has been damaged no question
1162167 i dont think its beyond repair and i dont think the reputation has been ruined but certainly it has taken some hits
1162168 you feel sad and sick that one of the guys youre an authority figure over and you care about got himself in trouble

1162185 if you just look at the main stage and say heres what the festival is about youre missing most of the festival
1162186 one of the things weve learned is that certain acts belong on certain stages you wouldnt put a chamber music ensemble in a football stadium were presenting more intimate acts and straight ahead bands in the rep were using the imax theatre for the smith dobson stage because those bands need a quieter and more intimate space

1162376 hes willing to throw anyone under the bus to save his own skin
1162377 there is no reason to think community supervision would not work
1162378 willing to do any treatment thats out there for me
1162379 the fact that mr burns did what he did to those children makes his case very grave
1162380 and i said chancellor if there is anything we can do to make that happen we want to make that happen
1162381 it really is a great day for the city of madison because this could be the spark that really makes the east rail corridor take off
1162382 i think this is great when we think about how are we going to rebrand the corridor for the next generation and i think incubators and start ups are something weve been doing for a long time and this will just step it up and create a real buzz and excitement
1162383 i think its really important that an older building is going to host new ideas
1162384 an increasing number of our students start out knowing or hoping that instead of just going to work for someone else when they finish their degree theyll go out and create their own job start their own company and be an entrepreneur
1162385 especially in some fields and it is one of them they see an opportunity for very quickly growing their own business from home
1162386 whether its computer gaming or internet security issues individuals see markets for their ideas and think hey i can do that on my own why should i go work for somebody else and make them rich
1162387 not every company that starts out in an incubator grows into a big company
1162388 but there is a track record in the madison area in particular around incubators and their success third wave tomotherapy and mirus are all examples of businesses that started out at university research park in the incubator
1162389 i think this is really an ideal fit for this area
1162390 when you look at madison now and all the research park space thats available its largely around the edges whether its on the east side or south side or west side but there is nothing downtown like this
1162391 we have substantial additional space that will allow us to grow over time and expand the urban incubator
1162392 our findings offer a new way to think about the pricing controversy
1162393 charging higher prices for health products does have an obvious downside which is that fewer people will get access but the benefit is in targeting the distribution of the product to the people most likely to use it as well as greater revenue for social programs these issues need to be weighed against each other when making policy decisions about setting prices
1162394 the engines fuel tank can crack and leak posing a risk of fire or explosion the log splitters with the recalled engines were sold at outdoor power equipment dealers and tractor supply stores nationwide from january 2007 through june 2008 for between 1 150 and 1 500

1162401 two pounds of wheat for a days wages and six pounds of barley for a days wages and do not damage the oil and the wine
1162402 has been the main argument for why bubbles could not happen
1162403 there is no evidence that hedge funds as a whole exerted a correcting force on prices during the technology bubble
1162404 among the few large hedge funds that did resist the bubble the manager with the least exposure to technology stocks tiger management did not survive until the bubble burst
1162405 the key to this is that if you feel you can predict what the irrational guys are doing then it may be entirely rational to buy irrationally priced stocks
1162406 it seems that the hedge funds did exploit such a predictability during the bubble
1162407 if you asked most economists how they would produce more trust in a game they would say change the payoffs or get the participants to play the game repeatedly those are the standard tools if you said try spraying oxytocin in the nostrils they would say i dont know what youre talking about youre tricking the brain and it seems to work
1162408 why would anybody put money into a savings account that offers zero interest and imposes a penalty if you withdraw cash early
1162409 it simply doesnt make sense in terms of a traditional rational economic model the reason is that there is this limbic system that produces a strong drive when it sees something it likes it wants it now so you need some type of pre commitment device to make people save
1162410 asymmetric paternalism helps those whose rationality is bounded from making a costly mistake and harms more rational folks very little
1162411 such policies should appeal to everyone across the political spectrum

1162438 they deliberately piled up an everest of debt in order to force the government into crisis the ruination they have wrought has been thorough it has been a professional job washington itself has been remade into a golden landscape of super wealthy suburbs and gleaming lobbyist headquarters the wages of government by entrepreneurship practiced so outrageously by figures such as jack abramoff it is no coincidence frank argues that the same politicians who guffaw at the idea of effective government have installed a regime in which incompetence is the rule nor will the country easily shake off the consequences of deliberate misgovernment through the usual election remedies obsessed with achieving a lasting victory conservatives have taken pains to enshrine the free market as the permanent creed of state
1162439 democrats for their part have tried to explain the flood of misgovernment as part of a
1162440 sees that banks are safe places for people to keep their money
1162441 that old dime was all about service about the things government could do for us but the new dime is about profit about the superiority of private enterprise about the huge sums that can be squeezed out of federal operations instead of symbolizing good government the dime now shows us the wrecking crew in full swing
1162442 there are huge corporations that make obscene profits from human misery they run our health care industry they run our oil and gas companies they run our bloated weapons industry they run wall street and the major investment firms they run our manufacturing firms they also ominously run our government
1162443 there is an evidentiary disconnect between charging etfs on a per line basis and the evidence presented on a per subscriber or per account basis
1162444 the fccs need for a hearing on the issue in june 2008 suggests the issue is unclear which in turn suggests that congress has no clear intent to preempt
1162445 that early termination fees are being used not as a means of recovering legitimate costs but as a means of locking consumers into a service provider

1162454 the new products are a natural progression of blue sparks printed electronics manufacturing and engineering capabilities design engineers and system integrators frequently turn to us to customize our standard green printed batteries to meet their unique product design specifications this customization combined with our rapid prototyping and expert technical support typically helps them realize lower production costs and faster time to market
1162455 this is a fundamental advance in how nanotube circuits are made
1162456 these findings represent the culmination of four years of collaborative efforts between the illinois and purdue groups
1162457 the work established the fundamental scientific knowledge that led to this particular breakthrough and the ability to make circuits
1162458 instead we found a very nice way of essentially removing the effect of these metallic nanotubes without actually eliminating them
1162459 now there is no fundamental reason why we couldnt develop nanonet technologies
1162460 if you can make a flexible circuit with 100 transistors you can make circuits with 10 000 or more transistors
1162461 now electronics are flat which limits their utility since most objects in real life are not flat
1162462 for these types of applications manufacturers might literally print or stamp circuits onto plastic sheets like the roll to roll printing used to print newspapers
1162463 the theory and simulation work done at purdue shows there is always a way to break the metallic path and still keep the semi conducting carbon nanotube path intact
1162464 the teams at illinois and purdue continuously provide insights about why things work the way they do and how to make them work better through combined modeling and experimental efforts
1162465 in todays movement towards eco friendly technology blue represents the sustainability and earth friendliness that is built into all of our printed battery products spark is the innovation that is realized by our customers to invent products never before possible with existing battery technology our firms commitment to powering innovation provides the information and technical support necessary to stimulate new product concepts that are unachievable using any other power source technology and then enables their realization by supporting applications from prototype through high volume manufacturing

1162472 they are endowed with a supply of positive charge carrying holes that for years have been the missing ingredients that prevented engineers from building leds from zno nanowires
1162473 zinc oxide nanostructures are incredibly well studied because they are so easy to make now that we have p type zinc oxide nanowires the opportunities for leds and beyond are endless
1162474 p type doping in nanowires would make complementary zno nanowire transistors possible
1162475 the story is what he says in his sworn testimony if its truthful it would support mr simpsons defense

1162479 i got here this morning to play and there wasnt a soul out here
1162480 it was a lot different from the last time i walked off this golf course
1162481 it was one of the most memorable weeks ive ever had certainly on that golf course
1162482 and it will be nice to go back to a golf course that i know that ive played well on and refresh and rekindle your mind with those good thoughts that certainly is a golf course ive got a lot of good memories around
1162483 i havent seen it since i played it in 04
1162484 its just an incredibly tough golf course from what i remember it requires all the shots youve got to move the ball left to right right to left you need to hit it long you need to hit it straight you need to putt well these are just some of the most difficult greens ive ever seen so it takes absolutely everything
1162485 we just lost our first match and the first question mark rolfing of nbc sports asked me was how can you explain not making any birdies

1162493 none of those conversations suggest that favre was soliciting a job or that other teams were soliciting his services
1162494 based on the information that we had the packers thought it was appropriate to bring this matter to the leagues attention
1162495 we respect the commissioners investigation of this matter and we now consider it closed
1162496 we provided the league with all information requested so they could be comprehensive in their decision making
1162497 our focus has been and continues to be on our football team and having a successful season
1162498 i know if they do open it up to competition not a lot of people give me a chance but i believe in myself and im going to be the best i can be and let coach decide from there
1162499 if he is i might go see him when im done here
1162500 we respect the commissioners decision and the thoroughness of the process
1162501 we provided the league with all information requested so they could be comprehensive in their decision making our focus has been and continues to be on our football team and having a successful season
1162502 i have a pretty good idea how that article went down but you can shape the environment however you want one way or the other
1162503 ive just got to go out and do my part if it happens it happens if it dont it dont
1162504 it wasnt like i was looking for a day off im just doing what the coaches are telling me to do
1162505 if i was hurt id be in the training room somewhere or be out working with the trainers but i feel fine i feel good
1162506 i could have gone these days had they not given me a day off i would have been out there like everybody else
1162507 wade has done this over the years i think it really has shown not just on the practice field but even on game day that everybodys a little bit livelier
1162508 its just like racing horses you cant run them every day and expect them go out there on race day and perform at their best
1162509 the same with cars you run them to a certain point then you put them in the shop and go through the diagnostics thats what im going through right now
1162510 i knew id be able to run around out here this morning just taking those shots i feel like i did fine
1162511 you dont know until you start taking hits how its really going to react
1162512 no issues no flare up it didnt bother me at all
1162513 hopefully ill have no more problems from here on out
1162514 thatll probably be the biggest thing when i wake up tomorrow morning hopefully it wont be stiff and ill be all right
1162515 as long as were winning everybodys going to be happy with whatever role they have
1162516 ive played in running back by committee roles before whoever gets hot thats who its going to be
1162517 high performance zno thin film transistor zno tft fabricated by rf magnetron sputtering at room temperature with a bottom gate configuration the zno tft operates in the enhancement mode with a threshold voltage of 19 v a field effect mobility of 28 cm2 vs a gate voltage swing of 1 39 v decade and an on off ratio of 3x105 the zno tft present an average optical transmission including the glass substrate of 80 in the visible part of the spectrum the combination of transparency high field effect mobility and room temperature processing makes the zno tft a very promising low cost optoelectronic device for the next generation of invisible and flexible electronics
1162518 big supermarket chains across the world can range from 100 to a few thousand stores this would mean that we are looking at 1 10 million units of labels that need to be supplied per customer and in these volumes the cost of ownership of rich content esls labels made with our displays rich content esl is a trademark of nemoptic sa can compete successfully with lower priced tn tags the cost competitiveness is due to improved labor productivity more efficient pricing promotional sales management and improved customer loyalty and satisfaction
1162519 automation of this process also leads to better use of human resources across chain stores as wails as price agreement
1162520 price mismatch a direct loss for retailers can be up to 0 5 or more for large stores and if it can be avoided thats a big saving
1162521 colour displays are already available the challenge is to achieve multi colour displays with higher brightness so that market acceptance can become easier
1162522 interest could arise out of the possibility of r2r processing and the use of additive processes
1162523 so we might be looking into further developing flexible tags in the future when expanding to other markets

1162538 the significance of this is for other groups of patients with neurological impairment
1162539 do all of these patients have the same mechanism for reflux and swallowing disorders if not performing a fundoplication anti reflux surgery may not help in fact it may make things worse like it did in the rett girls
1162540 this issue is of particular interest to pediatricians who refer these patients for their reflux problems
1162541 if we develop a better understanding of the mechanisms behind the problems being experienced by these children we just might be able to find a way to make life a little more comfortable for them
1162542 one of the great strengths of this campaign from the very beginning has been the cohesion the sense of camaraderie and the lack of drama
1162543 and one of the challenges moving forward is to expand and bring in more talent people from other campaigns and other places and still maintain that culture we began with
1162544 specifically sought out people who are going to play by those rules
1162545 will certainly discuss the free trade agreement and their strategies for getting it through their respective legislatures
1162546 and of course theyll discuss the visa waiver program that the south koreans are very interested in having with the united states
1162547 we have a voluntary agreement between our beef exporters and korean beef importers
1162548 we certainly are in close contact with the north koreans about what they need to do we are hopeful that we will be able to reach an understanding with the north koreans but were not at that juncture yet
1162549 it is up to the north koreans now to come back to us and accept a verification protocol
1162550 we think it is unconscionable that congress has gone on vacation before we have addressed the high gas prices that are crippling our economy and hurting millions of families
1162551 we are asking that you reconvene the house from your five week vacation and schedule a vote on legislation to increase american energy production
1162552 this is an important step in the development of our business it is a huge endorsement for g24 innovations that 4rae is investing in the company and we are delighted that mr groenink has accepted a position on the board of directors his extensive experience will be a significant addition to the strength of the company i greatly look forward to working with 4rae as we continue towards our objective of revolutionising personal energy
1162553 it is very difficult to predict how the current market will play out and the full extent of its impact on the economy
1162554 in the meantime it will continue to be difficult for all of us in the industry
1162555 in new zealand the short term market continues to look challenging and this has obviously not been helped by the investment market volatility
1162556 i think heath deserves everything he cops in all ways from the club but the one thing about it the lying part theres no doubt theres an unwritten law within footy clubs that you look after your mates and unless they do something that physically harms someone or something against the law
1162557 i think alan didak should have come out straight away and said he was part of it
1162558 last year alan didak did his press conference about taking a wild car ride with cbd killer christopher hudson days before hudson murdered
1162559 i the clubs just trying to make an example and they havent set the scene prior to this eddie mcguire will tell you ive rung him a number of times about different players doing different things off the field for nearly four to five years and i think that the protectionism that eddies trying to give the club to save their image in fact is detrimental to the very thing that you try to build and thats the culture tony shaw said
1162560 he loves the club hes got passion for the club but this has been behind the scenes and theyve always said they can handle it well this is four times in the last two years that things have happened they arent handling it well at all
1162561 i just thought it should have been nipped in the bud with alan didak

1162568 if all incompatible donors and recipients were simply listed in one common pool the problems related to incompatible and poorly matched donors and recipients would be a thing of the past
1162569 newyork presbyterian weill cornell introduced the registry to ucla a few months ago prompting ucla to join the innovative program
1162570 this is a rare instance of a living donor kidney being shipped across the country to initiate a chain
1162571 if we can become comfortable shipping living donor kidneys like we do with deceased donor kidneys then thousands of patients will have the opportunity to receive a kidney who otherwise would have been forced to remain on dialysis
1162572 the hope is that this marks the first of many such collaborations among the nations transplant centers
1162573 donor chains have enormous potential to expand the donor pool and to provide better matched organs for the many individuals who are in desperate need of lifesaving transplants
1162574 kidney donor chains could have a significant impact on the countrys organ donor shortage
1162575 whereas the chain involves an extra donor in the beginning so you can initiate a self propagating cascade
1162576 but in this case ucla received a live donor kidney from new york which hasnt been done before
1162577 living donor exchange represents the pinnacle of teamwork and professional and personal trust and good faith that ideally epitomizes the organ transplant endeavor
1162578 the team consists of surgeons physicians nurses coordinators patients and donors all working together toward the same goal
1162579 patients can wait up to eight years for a deceased donor transplant
1162580 this donor chain may enable hundreds of patients to receive a kidney thanks to one generous altruistic donor rather than in the past where only one patient benefited from an altruistic donor this could significantly decrease the waiting list for kidney transplantation
1162581 i have had the incredibly sad experience of having a colleague die while waiting for a kidney transplant
1162582 i have a close friend who donated a kidney to her brother and i have a close friend who received a kidney more than a decade ago and i see the terrific experiences shes had since
1162583 when i started thinking about it i thought im able and healthy at this point in my life to do this to help someone have more years of a better life why not donate the beauty of this partnership between excellent doctors transplant coordinators and staff at newyork presbyterian weill cornell ucla and a group of seven people a partnership connecting both coasts is that a chain of people have better lives and the chain goes on
1162584 if we can get this exchange program going its going to be the answer to lots of peoples situations
1162585 this is going to help so many people down the line
1162586 pam couldnt sit on the transplant wait list for several years something needed to be done im glad i could do my part to help
1162587 everyone would benefit if more donated today its me tomorrow its someone else
1162588 it was like a closed door that is now being opened again
1162589 randy and i talked about it and we said ok hes willing to give to somebody else and i wont have to take as many medications after the surgery
1162590 while the story was full of inaccuracies the cover was especially troubling because it may lead people who are safely and beneficially taking vitamins to stop actually putting their health at greater risk
1162591 proper nutrition continues to be a huge health challenge for america with one of every four americans over 75 million including children not getting the recommended daily allowance of nutrition in their daily diets likewise only 23 percent of americans get the recommended five servings of fruits and vegetables per day that they need sure we all wish we could eat pyramid perfect diets but the reality is far different and thats where nutritional supplements play a very important role
1162592 if a true mortality risk had become apparent in any of these clinical studies those studies would have been halted
1162593 they were not on the contrary surveys show repeatedly that in general people who use dietary supplements are healthier than those who dont
1162594 for too long now the dietary supplement industry has been the convenient scapegoat no 1 on the excuse list of a number of professional athletes who get caught taking banned substances to the extent it is blatant
1162595 mr camerons confession is the latest but follows a similar refrain blame tainted supplements in the abstract but withhold the specific name of the product manufacturer label or where the supplement was purchased the bottom line here is that dietary supplements are regulated by the federal government and they are not permitted to contain banned substances period
1162596 that is not only absurd it is especially astonishing coming from an academic who should know better

1162602 ive heard that acupuncture is good for stress how can that be
1162603 the syndrome of heart blood and spleen qi deficiency often caused by overwork mental preoccupation or excessive deliberation
1162604 the fdas regulatory decisions affect the health of millions of americans and we dont make those decisions in a vacuum
1162605 its imperative that we seek advice from independent experts and that we do so in a way that is public open and transparent todays announcement strengthens our processes
1162606 ive made the decision today to resign as leader of the parliamentary liberal party because i believe its in the best interests of the west australian liberal party
1162607 there is a massive political opportunity at the next state election and i think that i owe it to our candidates to my fellow members of parliament and to the liberal party to make sure that we have every opportunity to win government at that election
1162608 i give an assurance today that whoever replaces me as the leader of the parliamentary liberal party will have my 100 per cent support both on the record and off the record
1162609 let me put it to you this way i have formed a view a very strong view that we have a far better chance of election victory if theres a change
1162610 theres no doubt that those issues have made it difficult for us as a political party to obtain the clear air that we need to focus on the issues that we need to focus on i acknowledge and recognise that
1162611 do those issues mean that i am incapable or unfit to lead the state of wa i dont think so however i have an obligation to the liberal party and i think a broader obligation to the people of wa to do everything i can to rid them of this rotten government
1162612 ive made mistakes and done things which in hindsight i had never have done
1162613 ive never kicked a quokka i hasten to add and ive got to say thats probably the only regret is the way that most scurrilous useless piece of information was bandied around as if it was a truism thats about the only thing
1162614 all the other stuff youve got to accept it you know youre in public office youre subject to public scrutiny and no one could ever accuse of me of attempting to shoot the messenger
1162615 although if i had found a few people on that day i mightve but anyway time life marches on
1162616 we always planned to run this election on the basis of policy of making sure that we were making all the right provisions for the future of the public of wa
1162617 that wont change whoever the liberal party throw up is a choice for them troy buswell obviously had his difficulties and so does colin barnett but well wait and see
1162618 its a matter now for the liberal party to decide who they want to lead them
1162619 we wanted features such as outdoor sunlight readability 180 degree viewing angle extremely thin rugged flexible display that consumed very little power
1162620 e inks electrophoretic display technology provided all that and more something we could not get from other display technologies
1162621 e ink offers a smart surface that changes the design and brings mobile phones to the fashion forefront of technology
1162622 is the worlds leader in development of advanced technology from deep water and ultra deep water oil production
1162623 if youre not spending your money finding and developing new oil then theres no new oil

1162626 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
1162627 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
1162628 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
1162629 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
1162630 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
1162631 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
1162632 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
1162633 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
1162634 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
1162635 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
1162636 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
1162637 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
1162638 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
1162639 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
1162640 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
1162641 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
1162642 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
1162643 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
1162644 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
1162645 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
1162646 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
1162647 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
1162648 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
1162649 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
1162650 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
1162651 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
1162652 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
1162653 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
1162654 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
1162655 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
1162656 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
1162657 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
1162658 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
1162659 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
1162660 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
1162661 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
1162662 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
1162663 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
1162664 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
1162665 i love drinking coke but i quit about a year ago and it was best for my he
1162666 i swear by v8 essential antioxidents juice only 35 calories in a small can
1162667 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
1162668 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
1162669 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
1162670 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
1162671 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
1162672 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
1162673 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
1162674 a press o sobre as commodities como uma classe de ativos parece continuar e dada a desacelera o que estamos vendo no crescimento dos estados unidos duvidamos que haja uma recupera o imediata em algum momento do curto prazo

1162706 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
1162707 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
1162708 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
1162709 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors

1162714 the price of gasoline is one of the most critical issues facing floridians right now its adversely affecting families and businesses alike we need a comprehensive solution to address this crisis
1162715 this bill will do a great deal to put our nation on a path to cleaner renewable energy alternatives while also addressing current needs americans want and deserve real solutions to lower fuel costs our bill is a step in that direction
1162716 while this allows the development of offshore oil and natural gas exploration by states wishing to do so this measure protects floridas moratorium in the gulf of mexico
1162717 i asked that this bill include protections for floridas wishes and those protections are included in this bill

1162724 this demonstrates a long term u s commitment to the people of our hemisphere it will further develop and promote cooperative relationships with friendly countries to ensure we continue economic development and the growth and promotion of democratic institutions
1162725 we must work in a bipartisan manner to avoid any negative influence of nations that seek to increase false democracies and prop up existing dictatorships this is an important effort that will fund programs to improve education reduce poverty promote better healthcare and provide improved housing i commend members of the committee for approving this bill and urge senate leadership to bring the bill to the full senate for consideration
1162726 this initiative aims to make the united states safer stronger and more prosperous by making our hemisphere more stable and more affluent
1162727 our lack of engagement in latin america has created a vacuum that has allowed some to sell an anti american agenda which simply has no place in the region this type of commitment to the development of latin american nations and their institutions helps fill that vacuum and make our nation more secure a strong social and economic backbone is a foundation upon which democracies can prosper this will enable stable communities and a stable region
1162728 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
1162729 the space program is an essential cornerstone of floridas economy
1162730 i understand that this is a challenging and uncertain time i believe we can and will transition smoothly into the constellation program and i look forward to working with the good people of nasa and all those involved in the space program as we begin to chart americas future in space flight
1162731 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
1162732 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
1162733 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
1162734 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages

1162840 i believe that unarmed truth and unconditional love will have the final word in reality
1162841 its an election year which is basically christmas for stand up comics
1162842 and i figured i should get my ass on the road while the shrub is still in office a lot has happened in the world and in my life since i last did this six years ago and theres no better thrill and no better therapy than getting on that high wire in front of a live audience
1162843 i dont have all the facts it has to be something that makes sense if i just say to you would you rather have aaron rodgers and brett favre as your quarterbacks in any order or would you rather have aaron rodgers and two rookies of course you want favre in just to compete if something happened to aaron rodgers the way they are now and they had to go to a rookie their season would be lost
1162844 i wouldnt like to see him play for anyone else really
1162845 i will step back from my day to day producing work on american idol and will be devoting my time
1162846 he is an extraordinarily talented producer whose creative contributions to the no 1 show on television have been immeasurable
1162847 i asked barack obama what he wanted for his birthday
1162848 as a white sox fan this hurts a little bit
1162849 the reputation of this team has been damaged no question
1162850 i dont think its beyond repair and i dont think the reputation has been ruined but certainly it has taken some hits
1162851 you feel sad and sick that one of the guys youre an authority figure over and you care about got himself in trouble
1162852 you also hate the fact those guys do represent this program and this program represents this university and this university represents this state it represents anybody who claims to be a bulldog i feel sick about that
1162853 i mean theres no way you can say it hasnt been a distraction because it has been
1162854 if a guy has a first time offense i dont believe in throwing that guy under the bus to try to stave off the wolves so to speak
1162855 i dont think its fair to the guy dewberry for example i dont think i should throw dewberry off the football team ive never had a problem with darius dewberry
1162856 we will look into other ways of making sure we do a better job
1162857 i dont know if i would blame him for it with whats gone on this offseason
1162858 downtown that can be fun for a lot of guys but the team and what were able to do this season is a lot more important than going out and having fun with college students
1162859 we dont want to be looked at as bad guys or thugs
1162860 we just have to move forward we understand what was done and we understand we cant afford to have those mistakes in the future
1162861 the rasmussen reports daily presidential tracking poll for monday shows the race for the white house is tied with barack obama and john mccain each attracting 44 of the vote
1162862 this new tracking poll which seems to match other polls such as gallup as it shows a slow but steady deterioration in barack obamas position should be of great concern to the barack obama campaign

1162864 making sure your tires are properly inflated simple thing but we could save all the oil that theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires and getting regular tuneups
1162865 the only thing ive heard him say is that we should inflate our tires
1162866 so he has no plan for addressing the energy challenges that we face

1162873 if you just look at the main stage and say heres what the festival is about youre missing most of the festival
1162874 one of the things weve learned is that certain acts belong on certain stages you wouldnt put a chamber music ensemble in a football stadium were presenting more intimate acts and straight ahead bands in the rep were using the imax theatre for the smith dobson stage because those bands need a quieter and more intimate space
1162875 people would say the musics over at 8 or 9 what do i do now
1162876 its a chance to show off what a great town san jose can be at night
1162877 weve got almost 1 000 volunteers and we want to keep this a community event were expecting 100 000 people so its pretty well attended if we spent a lot of money to get a big name act would it make the festival that much more enjoyable i dont know if it would
1162878 monterey and the san francisco jazz festival do that kind of thing really well were a very different event in a lot of ways

1162880 es una muestra de que me esfuerzo para sacar buenas notas
1162881 y ello se debe en parte a nuestro programa de incentivos porque le muestran a los alumnos lo que esperamos de ellos y que van a ser recompensados
1162882 pronto habremos repartido m s de un mill n de d lares
1162883 qu diferencia hay entre darle a esto a un estudiante y que los padres le den una mensualidad por cumplir con sus responsabilidades
1162884 este programa le permite a los chicos experimentar lo que es la vida cuando uno tiene otras oportunidades
1162885 la motivaci n que tienen para hacer sus tareas y estudiar tendr un impacto positivo cuando se suspendan las recompensas creo que la respuesta es un no rotundo

1162899 he got his name on a lot of these publications because he was providing the spores
1162900 that is one of the reasons he was on so many publications so many of the studies were conducted with his spores
1162901 he was not a lone wolf kind of guy he liked to work with other people and solve technical problems
1162902 really critical in identifying better methods of spore production and in refining the qualities of these spore lots so they had consistent characteristics in terms of concentration and viability

1162932 when i tell people that i played in the olympics there is much more of an ooh and aah factor than when i tell them that i played in the world cup
1162933 the olympic experience for an american is an amazing accomplishment
1162934 has a vested interest in the olympics not becoming another world cup
1162935 and yet because of what the olympics are theres a need to give it the due that it deserves in doing that weve created a very interesting and at times sticky situation
1162936 we are iraqis and you shouldnt say such a thing
1162937 in many places primates are quite literally being eaten to extinction
1162938 tropical forest destruction has always been the main cause but now it appears that hunting is just as serious a threat in some areas even where the habitat is still quite intact
1162939 it is quite spectacular we are just wiping out primates
1162940 the problem with these species is that they have long lives so it takes time to reverse the decline it is quite depressing
1162941 this creates access allowing people to go to places that they could not go in the past
1162942 primates are relatively easy to hunt because they are diurnal live in groups and are noisy they are really easy targets
1162943 many of the asian primates like langurs are 5 10kg so they are a good target generally you find that what is big and easy to get disappears very quickly
1162944 if you kill seven 10 or 20 mountain gorillas it has a devastating impact on the entire population
1162945 within the red list criteria you are allowed to anticipate what will happen in the future as well as look at what has happened in the past
1162946 so it was decided not to change the mountain gorillas listing because of the sudden deaths and we do not know when it is going to stop
1162947 the lion tamarins were almost extinct in the wild but they were very popular in zoos so there was a large captive population
1162948 so zoos around the world decided to join forces to introduce a captive breeding programme to reintroduce the tamarins in brazil
1162949 they were not exposed to eagles or snakes and they did not know how to find food so a lot of them died but some did survive and slowly the numbers began to increase
1162950 it took time money and effort at all levels from the politicians to scientists and volunteers on the ground for just two species

1162959 the only reason why we would weigh passengers is to help determine the overall weight of the aircraft
1162960 this idea is about maximising ancillary revenue streams by working out how much additional freight can be carried per flight which will help to keep fares as low as possible for guests
1162961 if we had a more accurate indication of what the total weight of our passengers was we could determine how much extra in freight our aircraft could take which therefore could increase revenue
1162962 triple whammy of factors was paving the way for a boom once interest rates were cut again
1162963 not only is the rental market super tight but population growth continues to strengthen and speculation has shifted to rate cuts mr james said

1162983 the policy can no longer be blind to the green carbon thats in these natural forests he said
1162984 we need to start factoring in the carbon value of these forests when deciding what to do with them
1162985 for businesses of all sizes viruses hacker intrusions spyware and spam can lead to lost or stolen data computer downtime decreased productivity compliance issues lost sales and even loss of reputation
1162986 just because a business is small does not mean it is immune to security threats
1162987 security is job one when youre defining a business strategy
1162988 its not just a reactionary tactic or something to get proactive about when there are threats but a necessity
1162989 for those of us who breathe infosec everyday its a no brainer to devote resources into the remediation and risk reduction strategies surrounding threats
1162990 and it should be a no brainer to people in it circles everywhere and outside of it at the executive level
1162991 were hoping to help evolve the way humans interact with machines
1162992 after star wars came out i wanted to use the force to make my cereal box float into my hands
1162993 for now were focused on the video game application for epoc but we see possibilities beyond this such as market research or health care
1162994 often when companies make products that are comfortable and easy to use by the public interesting applications on the medical side
1162995 anything like that would require approval from the food and drug administration which takes years
1162996 but the possibility is there if simply from a cost standpoint our product is in the hundreds whereas most eeg machines cost between 50 000 and 250 000
1162997 im not sure its at the point of being as precise as it would need to be
1162998 i dont see it being a mainstream device in this form that said its certainly beyond a gimmick game issues aside its uncanny
1162999 when the item on screen did what i thought it to do it was surreal
1163000 this is science fiction stuff emotiv has jumped the first hurdle in simply making the device now they have to make it work with most games if they do this could hit the jackpot
1163001 i spoke to john wall a few minutes ago and at this point hes still undecided and hes going to be talking to some schools that have expressed interest in him
1163002 his options are still open and we have done that by talking to some coaches that know that its not a done deal where hes going ill just say that
1163003 however if he decides that itll be later then that will be fine as well
1163004 when he got a no 1 ranking the first thing i told john is hes going to have to grow up
1163005 hes going to have to start being a little more vocal about what he wants to do
1163006 the thing that i have tried to impress upon john is you go where you want to go
1163007 i am hugely confident that we are going to get the funding for the stand
1163008 we could go on with things the way they are but to be honest the infrastructure is now over 30 years old it takes six months to build the stand and take it down
1163009 that i think is inappropriate and unacceptable in the 21st century sitting as we do right at the heart of our capital city en fete in august

1163011 a proposed state constitutional amendment offers what sounds like a simple and painless remedy for improving public education in florida require every school district to spend at least 65 percent of its money on classroom instruction but nearly every school district already does that the real impact of amendment 9 which a leon county circuit court judge will consider knocking off the fall ballot today could be a second mandate that public school advocates say could have a far greater impact on district budgets legalized taxpayer support for private school tuition

1163069 today i found the site of my dreams supposedly most of the greatest new documentaries can be watched online
1163070 the worlds most compelling documentaries whether from established heavyweights or first time filmmakers and mak es them available to the wide audience these titles deserve
1163071 because its an election year the government is trying to make sure the statistics look really good
1163072 youre dealing probably with the most disengaged group or in north canterbury with young men who have got really good job opportunities and can earn really good money and they dont see the reason for staying at school
1163073 the thing that i cant understand is the double standard its against the law to have marijuana and yet schools are expected to do something other than what the law dictates
1163074 there has to be a line in the sand for things like drugs because of the safety of students
1163075 schools need to ensure that their policies are flexible and reflect the needs of the situation
1163076 it is important that student support needs are assessed on a case by case basis to ensure actions are appropriate to the circumstances and take into account the background of the student not just the incident at issue
1163077 if you go and say that those kids cannot leave school and then you dont fund alternative programmes principals like me effectively have to invent programmes and staff them and do that out of an existing budget and thats virtually impossible to do
1163078 every principal you talk to will have stories to tell you of kids who should not be at school who when they come to school cause merry hell and because they dont meet the absurdly high criteria for early leaving exemptions they cant get one
1163079 they almost invariably are behavioural issues in some cases you get a kid who just cant cope in school and therefore they get bored to tears and the behaviour starts to disrupt
1163080 theres no doubt about it that the ministry as agents of the government want to have the rates as low as possible its a good news story for them if they have lower rates
1163081 its a farce really its made a nonsense of things
1163082 in days gone by if somebody was involved in smoking marijuana at school the schools zero tolerance to that would have ended up with that kid being kicked out of school
1163083 what do you do when a student decides to assault another student and this is the third time
1163084 schools generally try lots of things we try the educative response first of all

1163105 theres just a lot to love about this series and its endearing characters and i think it would make a great live action movie that will probably take three films just to get the complete picture it has just about everything you can ask for in a series

1163112 i dont know what that is but im new to the area
1163113 this sensor doesnt resemble any other light sensors previously discovered
1163114 that doesnt mean shining an ultraviolet light on people in wheelchairs will suddenly allow them to walk
1163115 but it does give us a tool that we can use to solve the mysteries of nerve cell communication and could ultimately help us understand the biology of everything from sleep and memory to depression
1163116 the new work from ken millers lab has identified a new way that organisms can sense light distinct from the previously known light sensing mechanism used in the eye
1163117 it will be interesting to see whether the lite 1 light sensing mechanism will also lead to new insights into human sensory perception

1163143 when i saw that 156 000 people had become fans of ticketmaster on facebook i got suspicious their fan page is now the 5th most popular on facebook they have more fans than hillary clinton come on there are not 156 000 people who would willingly display that they were fans of an evil corporation that bilks its customers for massive inexplicable fees i thought
1163144 for a while when you became a fan of ticketmaster they would give you a code for 5 free itunes downloads im assuming people just made fake profiles to take advantage of the situation
1163145 correct many people i know made fake facebook profiles it takes less than 2 minutes to make an email and facebook profile then joined the group you received 5 free songs so the amount of songs you could get were pretty much limitless im guessing they caught on and stopped the offer
1163146 thats hilarious i think comcast should do the same thing im sure they only have fake friends too

1163162 sinceramente esto no hab a sido visto en la historia canadiense y no estoy seguro que se haya visto tampoco en la historia anglicana
1163163 con el tama o tan considerable de estos grupos disidentes y el apoyo internacional que tienen podemos ver dos diferentes rganos en un mismo territorio geogr fico

1163165 es importante que la gente entienda que las sagradas escrituras tienen muchos matices creo que tenemos dar espacio para que la gente lleuge a un entendimiento no siempre fui de la opini n que relaciones entre parejas del mismo sexo fuesen coherentes con el evangelio de jesucristo pero ahora creo que si pueden ser coherentes
1163166 soy de por s un anglicano chapado a la antigua

1163170 the democratic congress should be held in contempt for voting to skip town without dealing with americas energy crisis
1163171 democrats are out of touch out of excuses out of support and out of time
1163172 its time democrats put their boarding passes back in their pockets and get to work by voting on the american energy act
1163173 my name is raul reyes and for the last 26 years my wife chris and i have worked on behalf of
1163174 during our last 7 years we have worked to promote sexual integrity including abstinence before marriage and to help mothers and unborn babies in el paso county

1163176 jeff is a pro life champion and has my strong support in the upcoming elections
1163177 on the narrow issue of currency manipulation your a constituent position is opposed by the wall street journal and i respect the wall street journal because they have a good business sense i have not yet come over to your side because i am still trying to figure out where the wall streeet journals analysis of this is wrong and i just havent com to that point linda
1163178 the voting question was whether we take it dog fighting out of the hands of the states and put in to the federal governments hands you know our fbi has important things to do like fighting the war on terrorism and things like that and the states are already doing a good job and im glad they are going against dog fighting its a felony in colorado so for someone to say that i dont think its a crime because of that vote is simply misrepresenting the facts
1163179 my funding requests are different from that in three major respects
1163180 earmarking is the practice by which members of congress divert taxpayer funding to special projects outside of the normal competitive and merit based review process
1163181 im happy to defend my position we all have a set budget other people have expensive staffs expensive offices i have bare bones on those things and i put a lot of my emphasis on communication taxpayer funded junk mail
1163182 if it wouldnt have got spent it would go back to nancy pelosi in the current congress or someone could have higher salaries or have bigger offices
1163183 i said i would support a severance tax on gas and oil but only if it would be used entirely to offset other taxes such as property tax kansas 1982
1163184 lamborn said he supported a financial plan that would reduce state agency budgets excluding the regents system the severance tax could be helpful lamborn said were going to need to take a look at slightly raising existing taxes as well as cultivating newer less established taxes
1163185 lamborn said he would favor alternative measures such as increases in alcohol cigarette and motor vehicle taxes if a severance tax is defeated
1163186 republican doug lamborn is opposing incumbent democrat betty jo charlton charlton 59 has served three yeas in the house and has a masters degree in political science from the university of kansas lamborn 28 is a lawrence paint contractor and has a bachelors degree in journalism from the university of kansas both candidates support a severance tax and programs for the elderly

1163338 it is very difficult to predict how the current market will play out and the full extent of its impact on the economy chief executive andrew penn said
1163339 in the meantime it will continue to be difficult for all of us in our industry
1163340 it is our job to focus on the long term because the long term trends in our industry continue to be attractive

1163349 in such extreme forms and in men of such pre eminent intellectual ability that it is impossible not to regard it as having a real association with such ability
1163350 this is really a fun time to be back we kind of kicked this thing off is los angeles a couple of weeks ago but this is the first time we get an opportunity to do it at home
1163351 its really the first time youre kind of back with football again weve been through the phases of winter conditioning spring practice and summer training and now its back to being football again we get an opportunity to put our hands on our young men and have that day to day interaction that really makes it special i think our team is eager to be back i think theyre eager to get going and see if we can do some very positive things this season
1163352 i think to some degree it has to because our young people are a part of the community a part of the world so its kind of hard to restrict them from all the things they hear read what people are saying around them but the real key for anybody that wants to be able to achieve is your ability to focus on your task and not let the outside influences dominate your mindset your thinking your ability to get done what you need to get done
1163353 the major key is to get your team to focus because usually those that are older have the ability to focus on the task at hand theyre not easily distracted certain things dont enter into their thought process they can eliminate those things and stay on task can you stay on track can you stay focused can you eliminate all the things that take you away from allowing yourself to be your best thats what well start at try to get them to be older
1163354 i think everyone with the oregon game being the first one recognizes the impact that it can have and the intensity that it brings because this is a conference game it catches the intensity and the focus of people a lot different
1163355 youve got to come out of the blocks ready to go i would probably say weve been putting some things in place for them since january we both start with this being our first ball game so a level playing field is not bad
1163356 we need jake to keep doing what he does well hes a super all around athlete that has the ability to pass it and run it which is rare skill in most quarterbacks he puts a great deal of pressure on a defense just knowing that he can run with the football a quarterback that is a dual threat is probably as great of a threat as youll have to defense in a football game obviously what i need him to do is just to grow in his mastering of the system because its that development that will allow him to respond to situations even quicker than he did his freshman year
1163357 i think the game dictates what he will do what his role will be it would be wonderful if we had the ability to hand it off 70 plays and that decide the game for us that would be great but if we needed to throw it 70 to win lets do it i want him to be smart theres a time and place for everything i just want him to be smart thats something that playing a year and having that experience under your belt makes you that much better
1163358 obviously i think theres a great concern as to how well hes progressing we think its excellent to this day but now we begin practices and thats a different issue
1163359 so the first posture that we will take is we will be very guarded with him what we do how we structure him to try to ensure the best case scenario for him
1163360 i think there always as a coach becomes a point where the one is not greater than the many some would say thats in the beginning but ive always said that there is an i in team obviously its not spelled with an i but it takes individuals to make it come together as a team its the commitment of each individual that does in fact make the team with that in mind i do think you have to do things to some degree in regards to the individual but always keeping the team at heart
1163361 my thing will never to be frustrated with anyone because were all different you cant look at any of them the same their lives are all different its all part of hopefully my awareness and understanding that allows me not to be frustrated with the young men the term i would use is youre always disappointed when those things happen because you dont want them to happen with anyone
1163362 obviously donald will be a tremendous factor in our defense first of all and also in the leadership ive been one thats always been very excited about i tell a story of when we had young men in camp in the summer of his senior year he walks in and we had a conglomeration of all stars on a particular team and he steps right in the huddle and takes charge of all of them
1163363 it was very clear and you could see his leadership skills see his speed and see his ability to hit and lead those things ive always been a fan of i think its not that hes grown into that i think its always been there but its now becoming more his time
1163364 the one thing is we didnt make the plays that we had to make when you have to make them in every football game theres opportunities for the defense to get itself off of the field and youve got to make those plays we gave up too many big plays and did not get ourselves off the field when we had opportunities to
1163365 the first thing that this football team in my opinion has to do and i think theyre aware of this we have to play older our freshman cant play as freshman our sophomores cant be sophomores nor can our juniors be juniors everybodys got to step it up a couple of grades which means play with more maturity more focus to be a good team in this league a great team in this league youve got to have some great defense and that has been one of the areas that has probably been our weakest in the last couple of years weve given up a lot more points than any good defense gives up so weve got to change that if we can do that than it takes a lot of pressure off of your offense and gives your offense a lot more opportunities and hopefully our offense can be even more productive than its been in the past
1163366 you have to look at every aspect of the football game and see how you can get better the first thing in looking at those close ballgames is one whats your conditioning were we in good enough shape to win those football games two did we put our players in the right spots as coaches to give us that opportunity to win those games three what is the confidence level of our football team and how do they feel about themselves when youre at that moment
1163367 because if theres any reservation any hesitation then you dont make those plays and then its all of the sudden youre sitting around thinking when is the shoe going to fall and thats a mentality that you cant have if youre going to be successful
1163368 we felt chris was an explosive athlete that could have some impact it was delightful to see some of the things he did this spring hes one of those players that i said makes you say wow
1163369 that all of the sudden you see something and you just go wow thats that kind of explosiveness that seems like very special players have
1163370 that is such a big plus for him first of all it establishes a comfort level with everything around him number one he knows where hes going he knows where his meetings are that sounds like nothing that sounds like something you can pick up in a day or so but its just a comfort level
1163371 he starts ahead of those guys with the offense knowing whats going on he knows his coach and he has an idea about him he doesnt have to go through that process of learning of growing i think its a huge advantage anytime you can spend time in the system it puts you head and shoulders i think above all of the other guys
1163372 obviously there are certain places that we have some needs obviously our defensive line turned over so therefore theres an opportunity for some of those guys to step up and have some immediate impact
1163373 our running back situation our receiver situation those are areas that traditionally guys can come in and not have the nature of experience that are needed at some of the other positions and step right in of course we have some needs there so i think you can anticipate someone in those positions having an opportunity to have some impact
1163374 that up front group has to be the first group to play older they really have to step it up step the game up step the play up step their execution up when you often have inexperience usually they borderline on youth most of the time
1163375 if that is the case theres one ingredient that they really bring to the game thats usually different and thats a little bit more passion if they can bring that to the game even though they may not have experience than weve got a chance to get something done
1163376 but anytime you lose a 1 000 yard rusher youre always looking for someone to try and fill those shoes and hopefully we can get someone in that group to step up and do it if not do it by committee so we will be open to any positive input that that group can have to help get where we want to go
1163377 patients who get blood transfusions tend to be pretty sick if they spike a fever post transfusion no one is likely to suspect that the blood caused it
1163378 connect with our customers share our information allow us to develop deep targeted meaningful individual relationships and sell our products with less friction all at the same time
1163379 every parent here believes that we are entitled to a bus and having one would automatically take away a lot of the issues we have with parking and safety
1163380 when our numbers dropped we lost the service but now we are experiencing a continual increase in student numbers but not having a bus is keeping families away from the school
1163381 we have people in our area not sending children to the school because of the bus issue
1163382 the committee really needs to look at the viability of the bus
1163383 the school is rising in numbers and we need to look at that having a bus service may mean the difference between parents sending their children to this school or not
1163384 there is virtually a flood plain in the car park and the children now have to cross the road to access the school which is very dangerous
1163385 we solicited council about the issues and they said that because the school owns the land then it was our problem we have it as our top priority on our capital works program but who knows if it will ever be funded we need some money desperately to fix this
1163386 this situation basically makes the front of the school inaccessible which is a huge occupational health and safety issue
1163387 weve had the rta roads and traffic authority and the council out here but nobody wants to do anything about it weve even paid for gravel out of own funds which we could have been redirected to learning
1163388 i dont like the thought of parents having to park on the opposite side of the school and kids having to cross the road
1163389 the history and nature of and threats to free institutions
1163390 weve made significant progress not that we dont have a lot more to do
1163391 if you dont have enough resources to take care of all the patients who are critical how do you make the decisions about standard of care
1163392 it does impact the environment but is it severely disturbing our life no
1163393 the plants load is the same every day summer and winter
1163394 in natural gas the more you buy in the summer results in a better price in the winter
1163395 of our 60 million budget 25 million comes from the ethanol plant
1163396 but its not a significant amount like the gas usage
1163397 were glad to have a customer like the ethanol plant thats helping to pay for it
1163398 with the difficult economic times of the last couple of years watertowns economy has been stable
1163399 i would remind you that extremism in the defense of liberty is no vice
1163400 the two men who killed 16 policemen in the kashgar massacre were today identified as members of an ethic group engaged in a shadowy insurgency in chinas north western xinjiang region
1163401 i would remind you that extremism in the defense of liberty is no vice

1163406 oh she tricked him and then he freaked out and killed her
1163407 she wouldnt let me touch her but she gave me a blow job
1163408 we want to make singing and being part of a choir more accessible to people whether they have sung before or not its about bringing people together
1163409 we also hope to increase awareness of the enormous benefits of being in a choir not only for the singing of course but for social and health reasons as well
1163410 we obviously transformed from a classical choir to rock choir but there was no pretence here it was a real transformation interestingly this has fed back into the choirs classical style they are certainly freer in approach and embody the music more a great result
1163411 its about using existing public space not spending a lot of money on land
1163412 once mapped the routes would be available to the whole community
1163413 there could also be smaller trails within the main trail for shorter trips and younger or frailer people
1163414 its simply a matter of getting people on board to do it i dont think its going to be that hard
1163415 the only thing the council has done since then has been cycling lanes but they are not off road
1163416 we believe that finally completing the 9km section of recreation trail from four mile creek to maitland park is achievable in this coming four year term
1163417 of course its missing persons week again now mrs leape said when contacted by the maitland mercury yesterday
1163418 the news for us is the same as it always is no information about my son
1163419 but at this time of year i also spare a lot of thought for the family of that man at metford
1163420 in a strange way i feel our two families are somehow linked by the same heartache of having someone we love who has never come home
1163421 even though nobody knows the identify of the man at metford out there somewhere his family are sharing my grief even though they dont know me
1163422 in my own sadness i am grateful i can still spare a prayer for that mans family too who have probably been grieving for their long lost relative just as i have been grieving for my son
1163423 as to richard he has never been declared dead and i keep living in hope that he may still be found one day
1163424 at the time we last saw him he had been suffering from mental illness
1163425 there was a bed available for him in a sydney hospital but richard declined it saying he would work things out
1163426 but even in our anguish i feel i have links with another family through this man found at metford
1163427 i believe there will be an answer one day even though i may not be here to learn the end of the story
1163428 this is a great initiative and partnership between alliance and the army reserve
1163429 there are dual benefits of training and employment opportunities life experience and will hopefully encourage young people to become an army reservist
1163430 it helped me get into the work force after finishing school because it offers on the job training and practical work with some theory components
1163431 this is the first recruitment program of this nature the army reserve has participated in and we have targeted people aged 17 to 27 years of age
1163432 it works out to be approximately 16 weeks of paid tax free service per year
1163433 simply means punishing the successful and redistributing their wealth by government fiat its a euphemism for socialism
1163434 nearly doubling the tax rates on capital gains and dividends to 28 is a terrible idea
1163435 with high traffic levels i do not feel safe with my children riding on cycleways close to roads
1163436 you like to be able to see them at all times and with a small circuit they are always riding past you they can also have educational mini traffic signs such as keep left and give way signs
1163437 maitland park would be an ideal spot as it appears to have enough room and it would compliment the facilities already there
1163438 the vpa with the council for stage one would possibly include a neighbourhood centre neighbourhood parks and the early stages of cycleways
1163439 we would also look at contributions to upgrade the local road network including old north road and rothbury road
1163440 we are not asking for or accepting any contributions from developers the party or private individuals
1163441 we are not getting one cent from anybody so that when we make a decision in the chamber were not bound by any strings that could be seen to influence our decision
1163442 well vote with a clear conscience with no obligation to anybody well consider each matter on its merits
1163443 my team of young and enthusiastic candidates knows this as an issue of integrity
1163444 to make the council work better and to revitalise our city in a meaningful way we need to make sure the agenda is run for the whole community not any special interests groups
1163445 were totally against development donations from a federal level right down to a local level
1163446 maitland is a boom town and is open to that kind of scrutiny
1163447 we certainly welcome what the labor team is doing and i would call on other candidates to follow our lead
1163448 i can assure everybody that all members of my team will strictly adhere to the new act that has been brought in in regard to contributions to candidates
1163449 thats the only source of funding we have at this stage and we dont intend to sell any tickets to developers
1163450 wpf cross thread collection binding part 4 the grand solution
1163451 how the heck do you get a control for invoking that deep in the execution and far away from the ui code and more importantly why does it have to be this way there has to be a better way
1163452 i do know hes very remorseful for what he did and hes going to pay the price
1163453 if you miss you give other guys opportunities thats what you do
1163454 so the other guy is getting an opportunity to play and hes doing a good job with it
1163455 moneys good moneys a necessity but its not everything i cant put a price tag on my mental state
1163456 the couch or more generally long term psychoanalytic psychotherapy was for so long a hallmark of the practice of psychiatry it no longer is
1163457 by contrast theres almost no marketing for psychotherapy which has comparable if not better outcomes
1163458 the couch turns out to be an effective 21st century treatment
1163459 speculation that i just dont want to go to camp
1163460 im willing to admit that ive been going through a very bad time with depression
1163461 ive finally decided to get professional help its not something that blossomed up overnight im on medication trying to get better
1163462 ive really had a lot on my mind really been contemplating a lot of things
1163463 in the state that im in had he reported i would be at training camp physically but mentally i could have gotten myself hurt or gotten one of my teammates hurt
1163464 but i have a meeting with my doc on thursday and hopefully ill be up that way on friday
1163465 football is important its a means to an end but my mental health i feel like is a lot more important
1163466 thats a helluva lot of money moneys good moneys a necessity but its not everything i cant put a price tag on my mental state
1163467 i know there are harsh people in this world but dang that made me feel low i do care what people think about me to an extent
1163468 i just want to look em in the eye and let em all know this wasnt bs this was for the mental health of me i could have gone out there and gotten any one of you hurt
1163469 i think one of the things that makes the lenhard shooting so interesting is that murders of any kind were probably not that common in regina in the 1920s and 1930s and being killed with a gun was even less common and of course hes a policeman
1163470 maybe the remarkable thing is there wasnt more violence assuming that at least some of the violence that we associate with the 1930s maybe including lenhards murder was a product of the depression and part of me thinks thats a long stretch but assuming that this kind of violence acting out against people in positions of authority maybe the remarkable thing is there wasnt more of it
1163471 the file is placed in our cold case unit which means its still active
1163472 just because its a cold case it means its more challenging but having said that we still are pursuing who would be responsible and obviously well continue to do so its important i think to bring closure to these matters and it would be important in this case as well not only for our service it would be important for the community and im sure most importantly for his descendants his family the suspects may or may not be alive but having said that once again to the point of trying to bring some closure to this case would be important
1163473 i would expect the impact would have been very similar to any death of an officer in a policing environment today anywhere
1163474 it would have obviously had significant impacts in terms of having members feeling obviously a great sense of loss under tragic circumstances and it would have been difficult im sure on the members and having attended police funerals in other jurisdictions throughout my tenure as a police officer i know and ive sensed the loss not only within the specific police service that unfortunately was affected but also the sense of loss throughout the policing community throughout north america
1163475 reginas been very fortunate that in over 100 years of history that our police service has only lost two officers in the line of duty
1163476 thats actually quite remarkable in this day and age its a dangerous occupation you go into situations as a police officer unaware of whats going to happen to you you can take all the safety precautions you want but you just never know whats lying around the corner just like in lenhards case
1163477 remind both the police service members and the general public that the life of a police officer can be dangerous and often is resulting in two murders within our own service
1163478 that hasnt changed whether there are more risks today than before its a difficult question because there are so many things that have changed over time our communication systems our training our equipment our preparation and advancements in technology in terms of preparing officers for confronting potentially dangerous situations
1163479 when two people die in the line of duty for the citizens of their city they should never be forgotten
1163480 public service can be thankless in terms of you can lose your life doing your job in this case both murders not accidental things but both purposeful murders they shouldnt be forgotten these people were individuals who had a life that was cut short
1163481 the federal open market committee fomc holds eight regularly scheduled meetings per year at these meetings the committee reviews economic and financial conditions determines the appropriate stance of monetary policy and assesses the risks to its long run goals of price stability and sustainable economic growth changes in the federal funds rate trigger a chain of events that affect other short term interest rates foreign exchange rates long term interest rates the amount of money and credit and ultimately a range of economic variables including employment output and prices of goods and services
1163482 they had been actively looking at that possibility for at least a couple of years
1163483 after a preliminary review i wasnt that excited about it
1163484 it just didnt look like it would justify that kind of a purchase price
1163485 the city does not have enough officers to handle this we dont have enough it wont get better unless we work together
1163486 we need some public discussion about this people say they dont see their police officers my plan is community policing
1163487 i have a concern if your intentions are pure ill accept that your intentions are pure but my one reaction is that this is an attempt to circumvent the administration
1163488 dont expect me to swallow this in a big bite we all know whats going on it seems political
1163489 please use public transit bicycling or other climate friendly means
1163490 have to go back 15 years to find ice expansion so far south
1163491 em nome do pai do filho e do esp rito santo livra me senhor meu deus dos meu inimigos defendendo me dos que se levantam contra mim
1163492 interferes with the issue which is who should be elected in november
1163493 do you personally have any regrets about what you did campaigning for your wife
1163494 yes but not the ones you think and it would be counterproductive for me to talk about
1163495 there are things that i wish id urged her to do things i wish id said things i wish i hadnt said
1163496 ive never made a racist comment and i never attacked him obama personally
1163497 you know i am sorry if anyone was offended it was certainly not meant in any way to be offensive
1163498 yeah that may be by the time he got through working on it that was probably true
1163499 you know he hit her hard a couple of times and they hit us a few times a week before she ever responded in kind the only thing i ever got mad about was people in your line of work pretending that she somehow started the negative stuff its a contact sport
1163500 the only deadline we have is we want to be playing this winter
1163501 there are a lot of guys who had houses and families who are waiting to see what the leagues going to do so limbo is a weak word
1163502 its easy to say well play again but we wont until those differences are bridged
1163503 if you look at our core competency as a league we had no problems putting a good product on the field it was everything else including attendance and sponsorship i still believe we could call everyone in september and they would be ready to go because of that competency the problem is that competency doesnt keep our doors open
1163504 the decision was not driven over spending six dollars vs nine dollars it was driven by why you would pursue what is a foolhardy option financially we need to decide where our teams should be how long the season needs to be and when it should begin and end
1163505 there was some discussion but not as much as you would think
1163506 everyone including myself was talking to molasses we needed to pull back and open our eyes as to why we started owning a team
1163507 every issue that ever came up in a board meeting was cantankerous
1163508 you sat in a room and you didnt know who had a right to vote and who didnt
1163509 the real tough calls havent been made so it is easy to say im going to play again
1163510 how much power will the commissioners office have is the league bigger than the teams or are teams bigger than the league the league has to be the bigger entity
1163511 if you take for granted that many if not most sports franchises dont make money year to year then whether you are single entity or an amalgam of individual owners is driven in part by the mood of the group
1163512 i dont really know where everyone wants to go but regardless of structure i believe it will be much more regionalized
1163513 you want to concentrate your growth in areas that are proximate to create natural rivalries and economical ways of getting to games on a bus as opposed to dealing with the long distance travel ramifications of a 135 barrel of oil
1163514 you cant have a league with eight or nine cities
1163515 you cant go to a b vice president of global media and sports marketing tony ponturo and say lets do a deal
1163516 im not worried about a timeline because one thing we do well is put on indoor soccer matches
1163517 but if we owners arent on the same sheet of music i dont think that matters
1163518 quando a nau da p tria se acha combatida por ventos embravecidos quando pelo furor das ondas ela ora se sobe s nuvens ora se submerge nos abismos quando levada do furor dos euripos feita o lud brio dos mares ela amea a naufr gio e morte todo cidad o marinheiro
1163519 how can you tell when a politician is gt lying
1163520 how can you tell when a politician is gt lying
1163521 how can you tell when a politician is gt lying
1163522 how can you tell when a politician is gt lying
1163523 hah you told people to dump me but im having a great second half
1163524 congratulations robbie im very happy to have been wrong about you
1163525 why im not on any of your teams you know since the all star break im batting 514 with three home runs and ten rbi

1163527 small businesses are one of the strongest forces driving our economy today and cardinal bank has made a concerted effort to focus on the business needs of small companies

1163531 ich habe die entwicklung von adva optical networking in der vergangenheit verfolgt dabei haben mich insbesondere die produktneuentwicklungen und die erfolgreiche zusammenarbeit mit weltweit aufgestellten kunden beeindruckt die neuzug nge im management team der j ngsten vergangenheit zeigen die entschlossenheit des unternehmens ein herausragender anbieter in seinem feld zu werden und hochqualifizierte f hrungspers nlichkeiten f r sich zu gewinnen ich freue mich darauf das wachstum weiter voranzutreiben und k nftig am nachhaltigen erfolg des unternehmens teilzuhaben
1163532 our excellent year to date results continue to be driven by our progress in achieving key strategic objectives that support our outlook for sharply improved fiscal year results
1163533 a supportive regulatory framework that rewards shareholders and customers customer growth operational excellence initiatives that improve service and lower costs and contributions from our unregulated business will continue to drive fiscal year 2008 and long term earnings growth
1163534 reconciliation of gaap earnings guidance to non gaap earnings guidance
1163535 while patient volumes in the second quarter declined we believe the changes were due in part to short term issues that we have begun to address
1163536 and we minimized the impact upon earnings and cash flow through focused managerial discipline
1163537 i am particularly encouraged by the unambiguous progress we are making toward achieving our new vision to lead the industry in quality and satisfaction within two to three years we had a long way to go in a number of our markets when we launched the companys new direction on january 1 2008 but we have made sizable improvements to quality and patient satisfaction as we continue to improve in quality and patient satisfaction we expect to earn stronger patient and physician loyalty to our hospitals resulting in meaningful volume growth beginning within one to two years possibly sooner
1163538 csonka had the utmost respect of every player on the team offense and defense
1163539 its not the collision that gets you its what happens after you tackle him his legs are just so strong he keeps moving he carries you hes a movable weight
1163540 when csonka goes on safari the lions roll up their windows
1163541 the line got him the start he got the finish and it added up to 4 or 5 yards every time
1163542 and i heard him say that he has a vendetta against the u s government and that if anything happens to him he told his sons to carry on
1163543 campaign contributions from oil industry executives to sen john mccain rose dramatically in the last half of june after the senator from arizona made a high profile split with environmentalists and reversed his opposition to the federal ban on offshore drilling
1163544 none of those conversations suggest that favre was soliciting a job or that other teams were soliciting his services
1163545 based on the information that we had the packers thought it was appropriate to bring this matter to the leagues attention
1163546 we respect the commissioners investigation of this matter and we now consider it closed
1163547 i know if they do open it up to competition not a lot of people give me a chance but i believe in myself and im going to be the best i can be and let coach decide from there
1163548 if he is i might go see him when im done here
1163549 nnpc hitherto had been lumbered with responsibilities that are not really the role of a national oil company and to the extent that they have to do with regulations and non commercial activities their functions have been compromised what we have done in the law in the case of the nnpc is to clearly define what a truly national oil company should do and put it in a way that it can operate as a profitable centre and a commercial organisation that is designed to make profit like any other oil company but more importantly to help the country realise its aspirations in the oil and gas sector
1163550 failure to vacate its staff from construction sites and halt ongoing projects in abuja on the deadline will result in unprecedented deadly attacks on the expatriate staff of julius berger
1163551 it the policy would be dead on arrival because there is nothing that suggests that banks should be dictated to on their choice of when to report their financials
1163552 a decree that smacks of the military era dictating how and when we report to our shareholders our financials for the year
1163553 as soon as he spoke up it was like opening a pandoras box of complaints and misgivings against what they say is an unbridled interference
1163554 except for ghana which is such a small economy we have not found this practice of dictating financial year end to corporate institutions to be what those economies we are aspiring to emulate apply we have to be careful how we bring about policies especially when it is piling pressure on the management of the economy
1163555 now that we have asked all banks to have a common year end let us see those who will truly be number one in this industry nobody will be able to claim number one today only for us to have another number one tomorrow
1163556 from now till december 31 2009 when all banks in the country are expected to have a uniform financial year end interest rates are expected to keep rising as banks continue to bolster there balance sheets in the race to determine the industry leaders
1163557 currently the average lending rate which hovered between 13 and 16 over the last three months has nudged upwards to 23 percent minus fees and commission if other costs are added the lending rate may stretch to 29 or 30
1163558 they had to use the jaws of life to extract him from the vehicle
1163559 he was lucid conscious he was talking joking with some of the rescue workers at one point
1163560 the economic development of our great country and indeed our region can only be championed by direct beneficiaries such as us
1163561 thinking about how we listen to music today i wondered why it is that ringtones have so far been treated as unfit for creative music who says ringtones have to be bad
1163562 its going to be a stormy old day tomorrow for some parts and later ill tell you where
1163563 hey guess what theres going to be a major earthquake followed by a tsunami tomorrow see if you can guess where
1163564 its not wellington but it begins with a w phwar thats a real head scratcher eh put the jug on and see if you and dad can figure it out but hey some of you had better be packing an overnight bag and heading for the hills spot ya later
1163565 before you get in the shower tonight you might want to do these ones
1163566 one of the things were looking at for the next update is the creation of a new type of environment for our levels to be built in
1163567 were pretty happy with the way our environments have turned out so far but as we create more and more maps with these achievement packs we want our level designers to have more to work with in terms of giving their settings a unique look
1163568 we need to ask tough questions about the instant hit hedonism celebrated by the modern mens magazines targeted at younger males
1163569 titles such as nuts and zoo paint a picture of women as permanently lasciviously uncomplicatedly available
1163570 the images they use and project reinforce a very narrow conception of beauty and a shallow approach towards women
1163571 they celebrate thrill seeking and instant gratification without ever allowing any thought of responsibility towards others or commitment to intrude
1163572 we should ask those who make profits out of reveling in or encouraging selfish irresponsibility among young men what they think theyre doing
1163573 the relationship between these titles and their readers is a relationship in which the rest of us have an interest
1163574 looks more like a beautiful piece of art than a monitor
1163575 the damage has been done here whether intentional or not
1163576 if you want to see the future imagine someones boot stamping on the human face forever
1163577 in 1992 20 000 men were sent to sicily alone
1163578 quelle tait ta position par rapport ton 2e roman sachant que le premier na pas t publi te dis tu que le premier tait un essai dans le genre mais qui finalement na pas vocation tre rendu public comme sil sagissait dun exercice attends tu au contraire la publication dun de tes romans le 2e jesp re pour publier ceux ou celui qui lont la pr c d
1163579 mais je pense qu un moment il faut pouvoir tourner la page et se dire quon peut encore am liorer son criture
1163580 contrary to what was recorded from four different angles by the hospitals video cameras the patients medical records say that at 6 a m she got up and went to the bathroom and at 6 20 a m she was sitting quietly in waiting room more than 10 minutes since she last moved and 48 minutes after she fell to the floor
1163581 shocked and distressed by this situation it is clear that some of our employees failed to act based on our compassionate standards of care
1163582 including staff involved with the direct care of the patient as well as managers of security and clinical services
1163583 the minimal requirements of basic cleanliness space privacy and personal hygiene that are constitutionally guaranteed even to convicted felons
1163584 whats happening in kings county hospital is an affront to human dignity
1163585 in 2008 in new york city nobody should be subjected to this kind of treatment it should not take the death of a patient to get the city to make changes that everyone knows are long overdue
1163586 but the culture of abuse and neglect remains and as evidenced by the june death the situation is too dire to wait for the justice department to act
1163587 look i saw the film like everybody else did and i was horrified is much too nice a word disgusted i think is a better word i cant explain what happened there
1163588 mr freeman is listed in serious condition but we have no information on the condition of his passenger
1163589 he broke his shoulder and arm but hes doing ok hes already laughing and joking around with the nurses
1163590 are you or any of your family a public servant
1163591 we believe perhaps the wholesale investors are in a good position to understand the value of the bonds the quality of the assets and the good position the funds in
1163592 the retail investors may be responding to the difficult market conditions and the emotional drivers around how difficult things are now so by leaving it open for them if they do require emergency funds or do need to leave the fund they can still do that

1163615 theres been no stone left unturned in terms of the detail and in terms of traversing the evidence that was presented and the validity of that evidence
1163616 in a softening economy people are going to be very hesitant about price increases and things like that so thats given us enough room to cut

1163621 in fact the bit that tv3 didnt play has me saying that while some of our supporters worry about kiwibank its actually working
1163622 so no theres no issues of public trust our positions quite clear
1163623 if theres any change to that position and were not working on that but if theres any change to that position we will go out with a mandate we will go out to seek that mandate by going out and asking the voters of new zealand whether they support a particular policy or not
1163624 are you or any of your family a public servant

1163631 honey youre doing a great job on the shampooing so two thumbs up there but the rest of you needs improvement you wash your face with this poured on a washcloth
1163632 you use the bar of soap to wash the rest of your body including what
1163633 your pits and your willie have you been washing your penis
1163634 ye gods honey what do you do in there you take the longest showers of anyone in this house
1163635 okay while youre thinking about songs you need to wash all your parts when you get out of the shower you rub this on your face all over your chin your cheeks your forehead
1163636 then you put deodorant on at night when you get out of the shower and in the morning before school you cant go around smelling like a dirty monkey
1163637 im giving you one week and if that pimple isnt clearing up and your pits arent smelling better im going to put on my bathing suit and walk you through it just like i did with porter
1163638 now go take a shower immediately doing everything i just said when youre done i want to smell you
1163639 some things are best left in the 80s this isnt one of them
1163640 since one voice is seldom heard in our hectic world the big wild is a collective voice that will be heard across canada and hopefully around the world
1163641 i mean 68 years old would be viewed by some people as being old but to me thats young
1163642 its a tremendous loss to the city of atlanta and to the atlanta braves i mean he loved the atlanta braves he loved being on the job he worked right up until he passed away
1163643 he was smart enough to distance himself from his dad
1163644 he and his dad were close i mean but skip made as much of a mark for himself in atlanta as harry made for himself in chicago and before that in st louis
1163645 i think skip was smart enough to realize if he was going to create a career for himself and a successful career thats the route that he had to go and he did it
1163646 he could turn a phrase at the drop of a hat that would be applicable to something that was going on on the field or something that happened elsewhere in baseball or to some individual
1163647 he could stick a verbal barb into someone with the best of em
1163648 but at the same time he could do it to himself and i think that was one of the things that created the kind of appeal that he had and the kind of following that he had in atlanta
1163649 like i said theres a generation that doesnt even know this all they know is skip caray the baseball announcer they dont know skip caray the basketball announcer
1163650 but given the fact that he was harrys son skip forged for himself a tremendous career
1163651 thats where i hit in the minor leagues thats where i hit my whole life basically
1163652 for me to know that he has confidence in his player is pretty reassuring its not just me its confidence in everybody
1163653 i mean im excited for it im ready for it
1163654 its really whoever makes adjustments quicker are going to be the people that are far more successful
1163655 ive been waiting a long time to come back and it seems like something thats going to happen so im pretty excited about that
1163656 i dont really know how im going to feel when i get back out there i know its been a long time im just excited to get back out there its been a long time coming
1163657 there were probably days when i didnt know if i would be coming back and it was really difficult physically mentally and psychologically
1163658 its been a difficult period of time im not back yet so i dont want to get ahead of myself like i said im really looking forward to this on a lot of different levels
1163659 well talk to him again tomorrow about where its at we did have a discussion about how we would use him what the parameters would be
1163660 if youre only seeing righties do you want to sit him on the bench that long without participating
1163661 all these little different things pretty much started up the conversation
1163662 that was pretty much the crux of the conversation today the variable situations
1163663 it was just a nice exchange trying to figure out where everybody was at right now i was good with the whole thing i feel comfortable about what hes doing today and well talk about it again tomorrow
1163664 the next couple weeks are kind of crucial i guess in determining whether ill be coming back
1163665 thats pretty much my same speech ever since ive been getting hurt
1163666 it was kind of nice seeing some of the guys i told them ive been following them since the start of the season i met a lot of guys last year made friendships and i want to see guys succeed even though i couldnt be a part of it i just want to see guys play well
1163667 im thrilled to be where im at now being with this group of guys here with the way things worked out i couldnt be happier it was nice to run into some old friends though
1163668 were trying to see what we can do to get him back on track
1163669 hes my closer if i put somebody else out there that doesnt mean hes not my closer
1163670 c j is working on some mechanics thats all there is to it
1163671 c j is the closer that hasnt changed were going to work on a couple of things and get him back out there hes got some mechanical issues to work out but hes our closer and will be our closer
1163672 i dont like talking about my health issues in the media
1163673 im going out there the best i can some of you have seen me at 100 percent some of you have seen me at less than 100 percent use your deductive reasoning sometimes you have to do whats best for the team
1163674 if he wasnt healthy we wouldnt send him out there
1163675 its just normal stuff this is his first year as a closer and it takes its toll its not easy but if hes not healthy enough to pitch wed shut him down
1163676 im taking some lumps but i was told i was going to take some lumps i was told that i would be allowed to take some lumps obviously im mentally resilient its a humbling experience competing against the best players in the game if youre not on top of your game youre going to take your lumps
1163677 theyre taking all the precautions they can to get ready for it
1163678 the last time it was predicted to be more than 100 miles an hour
1163679 they dont think it will get 60 80 miles an hour this time everybodys concern in houston the biggest problem could be flooding
1163680 ive been playing on it the last three days and its been sore
1163681 yesterday it got to the point where i couldnt deal with it anymore so today i decided to rest it
1163682 ive asked the guys to do that all year because one of the things i want us to do is play with intensity and play hard every night and if you cant just come say something and im ok with that and he did and im good with that
1163683 i just felt like myself for the first time i think i might have pushed it a little too much because it was feeling too good
1163684 every time i take a step i feel like its about to pull
1163685 being on the turf is not going to help that
1163686 and then when you think about it everybody is the same you just go around in the order its the same thing as any other time
1163687 you dont have to have prototypical players in all your spots
1163688 well hit him wherever we think its the best matchup for our team to be successful
1163689 we look to activate him in the next few days
1163690 i think itll probably be quicker than that but well see
1163691 im going to do what he says i just want to get back out there and pitch
1163692 the chances are the people who are saying that have never picked up a baseball or thrown one
1163693 i cant worry about what people say people in the game have had it before know what im doing thats all that matters to me im looking forward to getting back out there
1163694 i got a little longer break i didnt want one but i did get one
1163695 any time you miss games and youre not part of the action and youre in a pennant race its no fun to sit and watch i guess it made it a little easier because of the way we were playing
1163696 they told me to run with my injured hand in my pocket
1163697 it feels a lot better today and hopefully it will feel even better tomorrow
1163698 based on whats transpired this year where longoria has arrived at as a professional right now its in our best interests to leave him alone
1163699 we need to get him as close to where the ball is going to be hit
1163700 i guess tomorrow will be the big day to see how it feels all im worried about is how my groin feels
1163701 he pitched his bullpen today and said it felt good
1163702 hell throw again wednesday when he throws wednesday well know for sure what were going to do
1163703 i want to get back as soon as possible but i dont want to put myself in position to miss the rest of the season
1163704 you definitely want to be able to help the team win
1163705 i thought i did a few things in the offseason to keep this from happening
1163706 he went out and worked today and it was better than it was yesterday
1163707 he was available to pinch hit last night and hes available to pinch hit tonight
1163708 hes kind of brought a new life to our team
1163709 everybody is kind of a little bit looser having more fun and we just know were going to put runs on the board with him in the lineup
1163710 hes one of the easiest guys that ive ever known to get along with
1163711 hes a superstar player but he acts like hes 12 if you cant get along with him then shame on you i knew this all along having played with him for so many years that his reputation and actually who he is couldnt be any farther apart so its been great
1163712 when we added him just l a and all the fans and you just felt the excitement in the air
1163713 it gives us a spark thats what itll take to maybe get us deep into the playoffs so obviously having him in the lineup changes how the opposing teams approach us he just makes us better all around
1163714 hes such a good hitter and hes got such a basic approach to the game through the middle
1163715 you can see where he hits the ball that usually helps you offset the fact that you dont know these guys very well he stays in the strike zone a long time
1163716 he hit a home run i hit a home run so there was a little hype this game is exciting having him on our team is great and were just having a lot of fun right now
1163717 everybodys excited everybodys playing hard having fun and thats what the games all about
1163718 if youre having fun that means youre playing well and youre doing the right things
1163719 when you play loose thats when you play the best i feel and when a teams loose and confident theyre tough to beat

1163722 god als u echt bestaat en hier in deze kamer bent wilt u dan nu de lamp aandoen als ik dan mijn ogen open en de lamp aan zie weet ik dat u er bent
1163723 ok misschien wordt ik dan vannacht wakker en is dan het licht aan of is de kamer gehuld in een verblindend licht van god
1163724 doe dat licht zelf maar aan jij moet zelf een licht zijn voor je omgeving mijn licht laten zien in de wereld dan kun je anderen laten zien dat ik er wel degelijk ben
1163725 en we hebben dus zee n van tijd om er samen van te genieten een goede investering voor onze marriage time zullen we maar zeggen
1163726 ik heb toch zo vaak gevraagd of u het aan het licht wilde brengen als er iets niet goed was in onze relatie waarom is het dan zo lang door gegaan
1163727 im happy i hope this will solve things and eliminate part of the crime
1163728 it is not appropriate to discuss anything now but we will reveal the results of our investigation later
1163729 the ploy of the bloody crime resembles some previous terrorist attempts carried out by eastern turkistan separatists which were foiled by chinese police
1163730 we are going to make sure that zuma becomes president of this country no matter what no zuma no country
1163731 he said he wanted to find out if it was as easy in real life to rob a taxi as it was in the game
1163732 this time bomb has already exploded and the situation could get worse
1163733 he wanted to die in the summer and he died in the summer he wanted to die at home and he died at home in general i should say that alexander isaevich lived a difficult but happy life
1163734 will remain for us an example of genuine devotion and selfless serving to the people fatherland and the ideals of freedom justice and humanism
1163735 solzhenitsyns fate as well as the fate of millions of the countrys citizens was befallen by severe trials he was one of the first who spoke aloud about the inhuman stalinist regime and about the people who experienced it but were not broken
1163736 the attitude to solzhenitsyn in russia resembles a pendulum and i can feel it from my conversations with young writers there was huge interest in the 1970s and 1980s when he was banned and exiled there was a kind of disillusionment in the 1990s when he returned to the country which was absorbed in its daily problems and had no time for his preachings then finally there was a rebirth of interest and respect during his last years
1163737 we admired solzhenitsyn because in the late 1960s he stood alone against the totalitarian state we worried for him sincerely i knew people who hid his portrait in their apartments in order to show it to friends as some sort of a status symbol
1163738 even if solzhenitsyn was not the author of an anti semitic brochure which was ascribed to him in the 1960s a lot of the views which he expressed in the last years of his life basically match the lies of that brochure
1163739 as a thinker he was sometimes controversial for example he lambasted gorbachev and yeltsin the very people who made his return to russia in 1994 possible and he was friendly with putin who undid a lot of things established under gorbachev and yeltsin how can one understand this
1163740 until the end of his days he fought for russia not only to move away from its totalitarian past but also to have a worthy future to become a truly free and democratic country we owe him a lot
1163741 we will remember him as a strong brave person with enormous dignity
1163742 his intransigence his ideals and his long eventful life make of solzhenitsyn a hero from a novel an heir to dostoyevsky he belongs to the pantheon of world history
1163743 rasmussen is the most handsome prime minister in europe i think i will introduce him to my wife because he is even more handsome than cacciari
1163744 we see all sorts of people the thing that links them is that they have no money worries accountants doctors even footballers and politicians
1163745 cultivating whatever gave pleasure to my senses was always the chief business of my life i never found any occupation more important
1163746 marco is being accompanied by four rescuers and most probably hell be brought tonight to the advance base camp at an altitude of 6 000 metres
1163747 of course of course ill keep going imagine if i gave up now
1163748 they were thinking of my gas my rope whatever everybody was fighting for himself and i still do not understand why everybody was leaving each other
1163749 people didnt know where to go so a lot of people were lost on the mountain on the wrong side wrong route and then you have a big problem and then things like that happen
1163750 the biggest mistake we made was that we tried to make agreements everybody had his own responsibility and then some people did not do what they promised
1163751 as i started seeing all the media on barack obama i started realising that john mccain didnt have that rally song or fight song something that can get everybody together to fight so i took it upon myself to try to write the theme song for his campaign
1163752 john mccain has been a prisoner of war and a true american hero hes been through pains and injuries and has the scars to prove it so i thought ive got to write a song that reflects that and shows how this guy is a steel rod of a patriot how hes unbendable and has always put his country before himself
1163753 the maverick spirit of the song sells particularly well to all americans even obama supporters
1163754 if i can make them understand about where john mccain has come from and the journey hes been on theres no way they cannot respect him for that
1163755 the more you get to know john mccain the more you respect the fact that hes both a patriot and an independent thinker a rebel when it means staying true to what he believes in hopefully my song will help those people out there who are starting to pay attention to him to realise what kind of guy he is
1163756 how can i protect my life protect my wife protect my rights
1163757 that of course took many many hours some people turned back because they did not trust the rope any more
1163758 its enormous very high incredibly steep and much further north than everest which means it attracts notoriously bad weather
1163759 no matter which route you take its a technically difficult climb much harder than everest the weather can change incredibly quickly and in recent years the storms have become more violent people who have recently been there have told me that the snow conditions are also getting worse
1163760 its a very long summit day the climb is technically demanding and even once you get past the bottleneck theres still a long way to go to the top you only have to look at the list of those who have died on k2 to see that it contains some very accomplished climbers
1163761 the vehicle went off the edge of the road and flipped several times
1163762 he was lucid and conscious he was talking joking with some of the rescue workers at one point
1163763 it is chaos but we are managing it and having a wonderful time shiloh calls them her babies she and zee pick their clothes and help change and hold them its sweet they are little mummies
1163764 viv is proving to resemble ang in spirit attitude and physicality and knox hes a bit of me
1163765 this is mads fourth fifth time becoming an older bro hes asking us when we can have more
1163766 we have been fortunate never to have had fertility problems
1163767 marco is being accompanied by four rescuers and most probably hell be brought tonight to the advance base camp at an altitude of 6 000 metres
1163768 of course of course ill keep going imagine if i gave up now
1163769 they were thinking of my gas my rope whatever everybody was fighting for himself and i still do not understand why everybody was leaving each other
1163770 people didnt know where to go so a lot of people were lost on the mountain on the wrong side wrong route and then you have a big problem and then things like that happen
1163771 the biggest mistake we made was that we tried to make agreements everybody had his own responsibility and then some people did not do what they promised
1163772 marco is being accompanied by four rescuers and most probably hell be brought tonight to the advance base camp at an altitude of 6 000 metres
1163773 of course of course ill keep going imagine if i gave up now
1163774 they were thinking of my gas my rope whatever everybody was fighting for himself and i still do not understand why everybody was leaving each other
1163775 people didnt know where to go so a lot of people were lost on the mountain on the wrong side wrong route and then you have a big problem and then things like that happen
1163776 the biggest mistake we made was that we tried to make agreements everybody had his own responsibility and then some people did not do what they promised
1163777 this has been a short intense five months in which perhaps some of the mourning has been diverted as we sought these changes
1163778 we realize there are going to have to be several things to reduce and eradicate domestic violence
1163779 this in and of itself will not be the total solution
1163780 theres been no stone left unturned in terms of the detail and in terms of traversing the evidence that was presented and the validity of that evidence
1163781 we believe perhaps the wholesale investors are in a good position to understand the value of the bonds the quality of the assets and the good position the funds in
1163782 the retail investors may be responding to the difficult market conditions and the emotional drivers around how difficult things are now so by leaving it open for them if they do require emergency funds or do need to leave the fund they can still do that
1163783 need to make the point though that if a large number of retail investors more than normal do decide to leave we may be forced to close the a class as well but certainly hope thats not the case
1163784 in fact the bit that tv3 didnt play has me saying that while some of our supporters worry about kiwibank its actually working
1163785 so no theres no issues of public trust our positions quite clear
1163786 if theres any change to that position and were not working on that but if theres any change to that position we will go out with a mandate we will go out to seek that mandate by going out and asking the voters of new zealand whether they support a particular policy or not
1163787 are you or any of your family a public servant
1163788 it reflects the objectives that we want to be met which is that new zealanders get to keep more of their own money while facing the right incentives
1163789 it has and will be funded by national making clear choices and having a clear sense of priorities
1163790 in a softening economy people are going to be very hesitant about price increases and things like that so thats given us enough room to cut
1163791 the author of works without which the history of the 20th century is unthinkable
1163792 gives a certain hope and alexander isayevich solzhenitsyn would be glad if that hope came to life a hope our country will learn the lesson of its self destruction in the 20th century and not repeat it
1163793 we are not supporting some things the current government is and we are supporting a bigger tax cut programme
1163794 its quite simple if were borrowing and if were reckless theyre borrowing and theyre reckless were borrowing for infrastructure were not borrowing for tax cuts
1163795 its about addressing the infrastructure crisis its about pulling back on nanny state its about delivering on the gearshift that john key wants in new zealands economic performance
1163796 we believe perhaps the wholesale investors are in a good position to understand the value of the bonds the quality of the assets and the good position the funds in
1163797 the retail investors may be responding to the difficult market conditions and the emotional drivers around how difficult things are now so by leaving it open for them if they do require emergency funds or do need to leave the fund they can still do that
1163798 need to make the point though that if a large number of retail investors more than normal do decide to leave we may be forced to close the a class as well but certainly hope thats not the case
1163799 y guarda con los gallegos que hablan de otra manera cuenta
1163800 the author of works without which the history of the 20th century is unthinkable

1163802 in a softening economy people are going to be very hesitant about price increases and things like that so thats given us enough room to cut
1163803 in fact the bit that tv3 didnt play has me saying that while some of our supporters worry about kiwibank its actually working
1163804 so no theres no issues of public trust our positions quite clear
1163805 if theres any change to that position and were not working on that but if theres any change to that position we will go out with a mandate we will go out to seek that mandate by going out and asking the voters of new zealand whether they support a particular policy or not
1163806 the bill risks conflating the roles of parliament and the judiciary which would be quite inappropriate
1163807 this is a recipe for confusion that arguably risks undermining the rights of fair trial for the individuals concerned

1163812 i really want to stay with kipp and try my hardest at kipp high school
1163813 it will be worth it and i will go to college
1163814 lieja and the other five award winners are raising the standard of excellence for the entire kipp network of schools
1163815 their contributions are helping showing what is possible in public education
1163816 are just another example of big money interests that mitch mcconnell is so very much wrapped up in
1163817 just the tip of the iceberg of what we are going to see from outside special interests made up of people in power who want to hold on to power
1163818 are misleading and are an attempt by an anti labor front group to divert attention from this terrible economy
1163819 they are trying to scare people in this years election to benefit mcconnell
1163820 it would give workers the option for a secret ballot or a majority sign up to create a union
1163821 the bill is necessary to give workers a level playing field with businesses
1163822 were architects of the ill fated right to work bill that former gov ernie fletcher tried to push to hurt unions
1163823 its basically sneaking into the rock concert through the fence
1163824 its a less controlled movement of fructose through these pathways that causes it to contribute to greater triglyceride synthesis the bottom line of this study is that fructose very quickly gets made into fat in the body
1163825 thats its cage pick one out im buying you a guinea pig for your birthday
1163826 you need to get a job and get your life on track
1163827 you see a mix of social class and even religious beliefs here says francesco buranelli director of the vatican museums who believes that including the pagan graveyard as part of the vaticans museums will foster awareness of the roots of catholicism and the importance of its roman history
1163828 brings together the rich and the poor the plebes and the nobles
1163829 we have not opened an exhibit as historically significant in recent history
1163830 everyone always thinks that if its not about pure christianity the vatican isnt interested
1163831 but there are many pagan aspects of all things modern and when it comes to archeology especially religious archeology there is really no room for distinction
1163832 its just not easy to dig with all those wonderful things underground
1163833 its no different than if the necropolis had been discovered in france or any other sovereign nation its ours
1163834 our thoughts and prayers go out to the individual who has been injured in this incident
1163835 this incident underscores the importance for all who work with exotic animals to be trained in safety procedures and to continually use appropriate procedures to ensure the safety of the public workers and the animals themselves
1163836 the wild tiger will almost certainly become extinct within the next five to ten years unless we as a global community take immediate steps to ensure its survival we are almost certain to lose this amazing animal from its natural environment
1163837 sir i know you ordered the salad but i mistakenly punched in one too many orders of the fajitas will these work
1163838 so im supposed to cruise over get totally shit faced then try not to blow my own dick off
1163839 heureux les simples desprit car le royaume des cieux leur est ouvert
1163840 i dont make much of it right now its something that we had to produce and put out there so we put it out there
1163841 that depth chart wont be the same this afternoon never mind tomorrow so its going to change every single day
1163842 he came running in here the first day of rookie camp and told me that one of my high school history teachers told me that he said hello
1163843 so i knew then that we got a little bit closer at that point but we know a little bit about some fine dining down there in connecticut that we share some information about sallys or pepes but its nice to have somebody from connecticut here
1163844 that message is that they need to earn their decals
1163845 questa la mia vita la vita dello scemo del villaggio
1163846 there were two men aged about 18 or 20 one wore yellow trousers and a beige shirt the other black trousers and a spotted shirt there were two girls with them
1163847 suddenly they started throwing bombs and shooting there was blood all over the transit lounge they told us to lie down one said in english im sorry the other said get down or ill kill you
1163848 in this weather the beetles which carry the virus fly more and breed more
1163849 the drought has not helped trees that were sickly which might have recovered in a summer with normal rainfall
1163850 you are a ruthless terrorist i do not expect any words of mine will ever raise in you a twinge of remorse
1163851 very well i have some compassion you may choose where the men stand when they shoot you and i will add 50 extra men to the squad to ensure someone will at least hit you perhaps if they stand closer they will kill you quicker if youre lucky
1163852 oh and just so you dont get any funny ideas they cant stand more than 20 ft away they must be facing you and you must remain tied to the post in the middle of the yard and to show im not totally heartless if you arent dead by sundown ill release you so you can die peacefully outside the compound i must go now but will return tomorrow and see to it that you are buried in a nice spot though with 100 men i doubt there will be much left of you to bury
1163853 working every day to make killing brown people safer for american soldiers
1163854 the most valuable thing is the trust of the people
1163855 by adding public affairs and photojournalism skills they can show the iraqi people what isof is doing to bring peace and stability to iraq
1163856 they were able to catch on very quickly and were creative with their stories
1163857 in the beginning some of the training was rough because this is a new subject to them but thats why we train
1163858 each day there was something new to learn about writing or photography
1163859 we were eager to take what we learned one day and carry it to the next
1163860 we are the connection between the army and the people of iraq
1163861 sometimes the people dont know what we are doing in the army
1163862 we can now tell the good things we are doing for the safety and security of our people we want iraq to be a safe place
1163863 these soldiers are doing great things all around the country and now they have individuals who are trained to tell the iraqi people about it
1163864 they can show the truth about their battle to liberate iraq
1163865 and it shall be like people like priest i will punish them for their ways and repay tham for their deeds they shall eat but not be satisfied they shall play the whore or harlot king james ver but not multiply because they have forsaken the lord
1163866 god is doling out punishment here and i find it interesting that he says
1163867 the implication is that satisfaction is the normal reward for eating and multiplying is the normal reward for intercourse
1163868 apparently god is punishing his people by withholding satisfaction from their eating and childbearing from their sexual immorality
1163869 today women and men do by choice the very thing which god brought upon israel as a curse
1163870 were still saying well start service this summer we just dont yet have a firm date
1163871 i dont think that the fed can really pull any of its levers to create a short term fix
1163872 to go higher i think we need the sentiment to change with lower energy prices crude oil dropping below the 117 area certainly would provide a very visible benefit in terms of the economy but it also makes the problems seems a little bit less severe
1163873 energy cannot be created or destroyed it can only be changed or transfered

1163876 playgirl is going all web the last print issue will be the jan feb 2009 magazine which comes out nov 18
1163877 the kids are taking it pretty well my wife and i are very shaken up i also injured both feet in the escape
1163878 there are instructions on how to make it on their web sites
1163879 its one thing to be an activist its another to be an extremist
1163880 its absolutely outrageous that you would bring this kind of an attack to a family all because of your passion over this cause to me its indicative of people who have a complete inability to articulate their point in a constructive manner
1163881 trying to send a message to this guy who wont listen to reason that if he doesnt stop hurting animals more drastic measures will be taken its certainly not an initial tactic but a tactic of last resort
1163882 is aimed at understanding how brain connections form during development with special focus on the visual system
1163883 so we can learn how to fix these connections after damage due to injury or disease
1163884 i feel bad that anyone would take that drastic a step to harm people
1163885 the downstairs was so smoky that we could not see
1163886 my wife and children all escaped out of the bedroom window using a fire escape ladder a neighbor and then the fire department came and put out the fire

1163888 sonny has joined us for one season with the option of another season
1163889 has confirmed his complete desire to finish with rugby league to switch over to union
1163890 hell be at the very least in the stadium or better on the team sheet
1163891 our problem is is williams under contract with another rugby union side the answer is no
1163892 therefore hes free to join with whoever he wants he doesnt need a letter to leave
1163893 very serene very determined to make his entry into rugby union
1163894 that seems to be a closed chapter in his career
1163895 in my view williams should finish his season with his club in australia and then come to france
1163896 i find it funny and bizarre that a player would break his contract in the middle of the season to go somewhere else
1163897 there is a rule in the french competition that a player can finish his season in australia and then come to france midway through the season
1163898 at a basic level we dont believe anybody should break their contract
1163899 it is very difficult to predict how the current market will play out and the full extent of its impact on the economy
1163900 in the meantime it will continue to be difficult for all of us in the industry
1163901 in new zealand the short term market continues to look challenging and this has obviously not been helped by the investment market volatility
1163902 setting the record straight economic and social achievements under mao
1163903 where there is debate it should be conducted by reasoning and not by force
1163904 sen barack obamas people are trying to denigrate the war heros military service
1163905 retired gen wesley clark who was speaking for obama tried to marginalize john mccains military service
1163906 i dont think riding in a fighter plane and getting shot down is a qualification to be president
1163907 i really loved reading it aloud and purchased a used copy on amazon this morning
1163908 oh didnt you hold the door for us at the library yesterday
1163909 at e3 this year midway showed that we have possibly our strongest holiday line up in recent years which we plan to kick off in september with tna impact a game that is garnering substantial buzz as a formidable competitor to other wrestling franchises following that we expect the releases of blitz the league ii and mortal kombat vs dc universe to expand the audience beyond their core fan bases
1163910 appears to be the result of clark rockefellers dissatisfaction with a divorce and custody settlement between him and sandra boss
1163911 i tried just about everything then the last thing we tried seemed to work well it turned around in about three or four days
1163912 he should have a nice fresh arm between now and the end of the year
1163913 hopefully we can get it done the next couple of days every thing is fine
1163914 ive missed time before but its frustrating when its something as small as this you miss some games and not part of the action in a pennant race its no fun to just be watching
1163915 our sales in the second quarter reflected solid demand for all of our products with robust orders from the international markets in addition sectors of the u s market remain strong particularly regions with infrastructure spending in energy mining agriculture and defense while other sectors are softening since its launch in the fourth quarter of 2007 the demand for our plasma cutting units has been exceptionally strong in all markets in addition it is very gratifying to see our cost and price management initiatives combine to benefit our gross margin despite the difficult commodity cost environment
1163916 in the first six months of 2008 we further improved our market position our profitability and our cash flow as we continued to build momentum within our organization and in the marketplace demand for our products remains strong on a global basis driven by infrastructure spending despite some pockets of weakness in the u s and european markets
1163917 escalating commodity costs have been and look to be an ongoing challenge although we will have less benefit from forward purchase commitments in the second half relative to the first we will have the full benefit of the price increase that went into effect april 1 some additional price increases that will be phased in on all product lines over the remaining six months of the year as well as the savings from our tcp cost improvement initiatives which are continuing to produce significant savings all in all we are pleased with our progress and are focusing on our long term objectives to build our core brand and product strength enhance service and reduce costs
1163918 politics is the business of getting power and privilege without possessing merit
1163919 the best british political libertarian blog on the web consistently excellent but not for the squeamish
1163920 but for all that he is a brilliant writer incisive fisker extraordinaire and with an over developed sense of humour and he can back up his sometimes extraordinary views with some good old fashioned intellectual rigour im promoting him on my blogroll to a daily read
1163921 the glorious devils kitchen not for the squeamish or easily offended
1163922 a very smart article takes a pretty firm libertarian line on the matter
1163923 by the way dk seems to be on fucking good form at the moment
1163924 devils kitchen is the big name on the free market libertarian strand of the british blogosphere profane rants are the immediate stand out feature of dks blog but the ranting is backed up by some formidable argument on a wide range of issues particularly relating to british and european parliamentary politics economics and civil liberties
1163925 an excellent intelligent uk political blog which includes a great deal of swearing
1163926 i like the devils kitchen i think its one of the best written and funniest blogs in the business
1163927 for sheer intelligence erudition and fun iain dales diary cranmer and devils kitchen are so far ahead of the rest i dont see how they can figure in a top ten they are the beatles stones and who of the blog world the astair bogart and marlon brando of the blog world the gerswin porter and novello of the blog world the dot cotton pat butcher bette lynch of the blog world
1163928 its the blogging equivalent of someone eating ostrich vindaloo washed down by ten bottles of jamaican hot pepper sauce and then proceeding to breathe very close to your face while talking about how lovely our politicians are but theres much more to his writing than four letter words
1163929 the devils kitchen is a life affirming life enhancing blog this particular post will also lead you to some of the best soldiers in the army of swearbloggers of which he is field marshal
1163930 underneath all the ranting and swearing dk s a very intelligent and thoughtful writer whom many people take seriously despite disagreeing with much of what he says
1163931 the most foul mouthed of bloggers devils kitchen was always likely to provoke sometimes disgust but more often admiration
1163932 i dont mean it literally or even metaphorically i just find that his atheism aside i agree with everything the devil of kitchen fame says i particularly enjoy his well crafted and sharp swearing especially when addressed at self righteous lefties
1163933 spot on accurate and delightful in its simplicity devils kitchen is one of the reasons that were not ready to write off euroweenie land just yet at least not until we get done evacuating the ones with brains
1163934 this hugely entertaining articulate witty scottish commentator is also one of the most foul mouthed bloggers around gird up your loins and have a look essential reading
1163935 the devils kitchen is one of the foremost blogs in the uk the dk is bawdy foul mouthed tasteless vulgar offensive and frequently goes beyond all boundaries of taste and decency so why on earth does dr crippen read the dk because he reduces me to a state of quivering helpless laughter
1163936 dk is a take no prisoners sort of libertarian his blog is renowned for its propensity for foul mouthed invective which can be both amusing and tiresome by turns nevertheless he is usually lucid often scintillating and sometimes illuminating
1163937 if you enjoy a superior anti left rant albeit one with a heavy dash of cursing you could do worse than visit the devils kitchen the devil is an astute observer of the evils of nulabour thats for sure i for one stand converted to the devil and all his works
1163938 this fellow is sharp as a tack funny as hell and when something pisses him off meaner than a badger with a case of the bullhead clap
1163939 foul mouthed eloquence of the highest standard in bad taste offensive immoderate and slanderous f ing brilliant
1163940 i tend to enjoy devils kitchen not only because i disagree with him quite a lot of the time but because i actually have to use my brain to articulate why
1163941 this blog is currently slamming politics certainly aint all my own but style and prose is tight fierce provocative and funny ok i am a child swear words still crack a laugh
1163942 10 000 words per hour blogging output prolific or obsessive compulsive i have yet to decide
1163943 anyone can cuss but to curse in an imaginative fashion takes work
1163944 ive been laffing fit to burst at the unashamed sweariness of the devils kitchen certainly my favourite place recently
1163945 god bless the devils kitchen colourful as his invective is i cannot fault his accuracy
1163946 it made me laugh out loud and laugh so hard and i dont even get all the references i hope his politics dont offend you but he is very funny
1163947 dk himself is unashamedly right wing vitriolic and foul mouthed liberally scattering his posts with four letter words not to be read if youre easily offended but highly entertaining and very much tongue in cheek
1163948 this blog is absolutely wasted here and should be on the front page of one of the broadsheets
1163949 this labour government is the most mendacious dishonest endemically corrupt power hungry incompetent illiberal fucking shower of shits that has ruled this country
1163950 while we were slow dancing my crush and i had our first kiss
1163951 after it i leaned back and i said you cheated and he said why and i said i dont kiss on the first date then he said well i never really play by the rules
1163952 on one date the girl said to me i dont kiss on the first date
1163953 have a boyfriend right now i go on dates and have crushes and stuff though
1163954 mitt romney is an example of someone who came to the wisdom of conservatism through practical experience
1163955 sonny has joined us for one season with the option of another season
1163956 has confirmed his complete desire to finish with rugby league to switch over to rugby union
1163957 hell be at the very least in the stadium or better on the team sheet
1163958 our problem is is williams under contract with another rugby union side the answer is no therefore hes free to join with whoever he wants he doesnt need a letter to leave
1163959 very serene very determined to make his entry into rugby union

1163973 what we have is a systemic decline and some of the accidents are indicative of the decline
1163974 doles stewardship over the last four years has been little more than a planned media event
1163975 in the months before dole quit her post there was growing concern for air safety that was punctuated by a series of accidents and incidents including the crash of a northwest airlines plane near detroit killing 156 people a near collision involving a delta airlines plane over the atlantic and a close brush between president reagans helicopter and a private plane in california
1163976 my opinion of pat has changed over the years i used to think he was truly a man of the people but the longer he has been mayor the less i think of him as with most cities charlotte has three political parties dem rep and chamber of commerce pat is definitely the puppet of the coc here what is good for business is good for charlotte and pat very personable guy he has gotten a bunch of dems in these parts to vote for him but i dont trust him

1163993 but i also dont want to tell others how to run their business
1163994 it means this will now drag on for a few more days we cant meet david until thursday

1164055 there is a subculture within the white southern population of which the scv is the most visible voice that feels besieged by modern culture in general and they identify the old south and confederacy as a way of life and a period of time before the siege began to really hit the south
1164056 i consider myself a southern gentleman but i just feel bringing this up now it represents a painful and a hurtful time and i dont think its necessary to hurt people to make a point
1164057 i think this is very likely to come back to bite them in the behind
1164058 i dont think seeing some gigantic confederate flag convinces anyone that the civil war was not about slavery and that the antebellum south was really a wonderful place where everybody got along

1164063 your feedback as well as the subsequent comments in your blog is very helpful as we go forward with the campaign we couldnt have afforded enough focus groups to garner the input weve received one of the benefits of how the campaign is structured is that the elements allow for flexibility in fact we have temporarily removed the videos so that we can rework the ending with a more positive spin stay tuned
1164064 we recognize the role of social media in our marketing mix we are learning as you know we are not launching the notincolumbus com web site at this time we shared it to ask for the precise kind of input that weve received from you that will only make us better going forward

1164076 fomentar el proselitismo pol tico y la deliberaci n entre los uniformados

1164094 coupled with an increase in the basic speeding fine this means speeding tickets are now raising over 100 million a year for the government

1164097 is labour using speeding tickets just to raise revenue rather than making our roads safer
1164098 using speed cameras as a cash cow undermines public confidence the government needs to rethink ways of improving road safety including cracking down on uninsured drivers

1164114 the pro shariah local taliban are sons of the soil they are not separatists and are the upholders of the integrity of pakistan they may be ultra conservatives but when they call for the shariah implementation they are in line with the nations constitution which visualises an islamic pakistan some people like rehman malik and others who share the formers perception are raising hell that they would not let the shariah call prevail for in their perception it will be against the government writ a state as they frantically argue cannot afford to have two kinds of law and administration
1164115 right now in fata the federation has lost friends those who side with the federation are killed by dubious elements thus it will be good politics if pro state tehrik i taliban pakistan is embraced by the gilani administration for seven obvious reasons
1164116 one it will be a step towards restoring the government writ two it will bring much needed peace three it will bring order to a chaotic situation where the colonial set up has already collapsed for its sadistic approach to people and their problems inefficiency and insensitivity four once the local taliban are recognised as the rightful representatives of their people in their region of influence they will be able to chase out miscreants from their jurisdiction five they can also go after the blood of the agents provocateurs and indian recruits engaged in sabotage and fomenting scare in society six the taliban can also negotiate neutralisation of the presence of foreign elements if due inquiry proves their presence seven it will strengthen pakistan as a nation and a state
1164117 from all counts the fata situation is manageable it offers challenge as well as hope islam can heal wounds give courage and help build a nation that yearns for islams remedial power the call for the shariah is not a laughable joke if the ppp administration and the establishment that supports it did not read the situation correctly it may devastate our nation today it is the call for the shariah in fata tomorrow its sympathy wave can embrace the whole nation the colonial world and its manifestations in pakistan are in the death throes the nation cannot continue with its stink for long the fata call is a wake up call

1164122 aggrieved parties send petition letters or visit the xinfang office of a higher level of the administrative government in order to seek compensation an apology or to correct mistakes made by a lower level of the administration the xinfang office has its roots in the traditional top down system of government where ordinary citizens rely on higher levels of government to alleviate their suffering
1164123 some estimates based on available statistics reasonably suggest that there were perhaps four or five million administrative xinfang petitions a year during the 1996 2004 period but only around one hundred thousand administrative complaints filed with the courts
1164124 there are 10 million to 13 million petitions filed every year as compared to 90 000 to 100 000 administrative lawsuits in chinas courts
1164125 petitions however carry no legal weight to compel government offices to respond according to some estimates only 0 2 percent of petitioners received a response in 2005
1164126 the deep structural reason is that there had been frequent infringements of citizen rights over the relocation of migrants demolition of buildings and mining rights disputes
1164127 the xinfang phenomenon why the chinese prefer administrative petitioning over litigation
1164128 it may be possible to present the explanation proposed here as a more advanced version of the
1164129 the best explanation for the xinfang systems superior popularity over administrative litigation is the latters inflexible and more adversarial procedure which stems from its prohibitions against mediation and private trials

1164161 anyone who has violated a taboo becomes taboo himself because he possesses the dangerous quality of tempting others to follow his example

1164163 ja hallo met mij de brandweer komt overal vandaan wat moet ik doen
1164164 ziggy saw what a great job lorenzo did last year for us in terms of leading our defense and leading our defensive line and i think it was a great example for him to see first hand
1164165 we expect him to have a great year and be even more productive but we expect that leadership to ramp up and hes done a good job of that through winter conditioning and spring ball
1164166 strykers got real good speed he runs a 4 5 hes as fast as most of the guys on our defense so hes got a great speed rush and has the ability to get to the quarterback real fast
1164167 tommys a real agile kid and plays at a real good pad level and works well with his hands they both bring two different things to the table but theyre both certainly very valuable to our defense
1164168 hes a kid whos just worked his butt off from the first day he got here until now hes shown a great attitude hes a real strong player inside good against the run and he uses his hands well
1164169 hes a physical specimen a 4 4 guy off the charts in the weight room and can jump out of the gym and to boot hes got great instincts and is a great linebacker
1164170 he can cover guys man to man he plays downhill plays in the box well plays in space well
1164171 hes done a great job of upping his leadership in terms of communication and getting after the guys and being positive with them
1164172 he had an outstanding spring his spring this year was one of the best springs ive seen in a linebacker in a long time he was just off the charts in terms of improvement in a lot of areas
1164173 hes a real physical kid who can bring a lot of big hits and real physical play against the run
1164174 the question is if he can stay healthy and weve got our fingers crossed
1164175 he picks up the schemes real well and hes real intelligent so that helped him get in there and understand the schemes and calls and what youre supposed to do and when youre supposed to do it hes a real big kid and can run plays well with his hands and his pad level he doesnt get himself out of control we havent actually played a lot of linebackers as freshmen but luke brock and weatherspoon all played as true freshmen so thats been a positive for us
1164176 weve been able to get them on the field as freshmen and then they kind of take off the next year so were expecting big things from luke this year for whatever reason the kids go through it and all of a sudden the light turns on and boom they take off
1164177 pig was one of the instrumental leaders of our defense and when he got hurt that kind of forced william into a different role
1164178 if you watched william moores play from the colorado game on the production was amazing he just upped his game hes a physical specimen hes got real good instincts for the football and also has the ability to take the ball and score william could play wide receiver he could return kicks whatever if you watch the tape id put him press man to man on an h back which youd be hard pressed to find three guys in the country who could do that
1164179 from two a days on we were just so impressed with his maturity and his ability to pick up the schemes

1164297 both pablo and owen are very important players for us and its a sign of the confidence they have in ipswich town that they have committed their future here for another three years
1164298 they are ambitious players and want to the playing in the premier league and they have a part to play in helping us get there
1164299 signing owen and pablo on long term deals is also a sign of the ambitions we have here we are no longer in a position where we have to sell our best players
1164300 we have an ambitious owner who wants to see this club back in the premier league and signing owen and pablo on three year contracts is another step in that direction

1164331 i have a high schooler and when they mess up they can sit them on the bench
1164332 i feel relaxed if im away from everything and not right up in the middle of the action but im kind of laid back so i dont get really nervous now my husband he paces enough for both of us

1164342 the new location of the northern retriever puts it at great risk of breaking free from its moorings during a sw storm and hitting the chehalis highway bridge

1164368 het is voor een kameel gemakkelijker om door het oog van een naald te gaan dan voor een rijke om het koninkrijk van god binnen te komen

1164372 oh almas ad lteras no sab is que la amistad del cualquiera pues que quiera ser amigo del dios
1164373 por tanto os digo todo pecado y blasfemia ser perdonado a los hombres mas la blasfemia contra el esp ritu no les ser perdonada
1164374 mas vosotros no viv s seg n la carne sino seg n el de dios mora en vosotros y si alguno no tiene el esp ritu de cristo no es de l
1164375 porque si pec remos voluntariamente despu s de haber recibido el conocimiento de la verdad ya no queda m s sacrificio por los pecados sino una horrenda expectaci n de juicio y de hervor de fuego que ha de devorar a los adversarios el que viola la ley de mois s por el testimonio de dos o de tres testigos muere irremisiblemente
1164376 ni los afeminados ni los que se echan con varones heredar n el reino de dios
1164377 y si hijos tambi n herederos coheredero s con cristo si es que padecemos juntamente con l para que juntamente con l seamos glorificados
1164378 porque del coraz n los homicidios los adulterios las fornicaciones los hurtos los falsos testimonios las blasfemias
1164379 pero yo os digo que cualquiera que mira a una mujer para con ella en su coraz n
1164380 pues habiendo conocido a dios no le glorificaron como a dios ni le dieron gracias sino que se envanecieron en sus razonamientos y su necio coraz n fue entenebrecido

1164383 nabi ibrahim as pernah berjalan bermil mil untuk mencari seseorang yang akan diajak untuk makan bersama

1164387 adventus is the exact christian latin equivalent of the greek
1164388 the central doctrine of christianity then is not that god is a bastard
1164389 if north american churches do not accept the need for a moratoria on same sex blessings and the consecration of gay clergy we are no further forward we continue to be in grave peril
1164390 the conference has been excellent i would even say it has been divinely inspired there was a growing sense of oneness a sense that we all have a lot in common we have been transformed by the relationships we have formed
1164391 it is not going to change anything on the ground in california
1164392 we bless same sex relationships and will continue to do so
1164393 we are concerned with the continuing patronising attitude of the west towards the rest of the churches
1164394 nearly all men can stand adversity but if you want to test a mans character give him power
1164395 its a big concern for the officers to keep this guy out of traffic to keep him from getting hurt
1164396 we are very excited to host the 40th anniversary usa masters track and field championships spokane has a storied tradition of track and field and running events with top competitors of all ages this meet will be great for both watching and participating
1164397 i had a great time in falmouth last summer everyone treated me so well and so im excited to come back
1164398 things didnt work out the way i wanted as far as the olympics but im feeling good now and looking forward to racing
1164399 its a wonderful event and were proud to be part of it
1164400 its amazing what the race directors kathy and rich sherman and lucia and john carroll and all the volunteers do to make it such a wonderful day for everyone
1164401 this episode resembles in a number of ways the so called headwinds episode of the early 1990s
1164402 a significant disruption in terms of the financial sector as we have had this time associated with a short but not especially mild recession but then the really distinguishing characteristic was that the subsequent recovery from the recession got off to a quite a sluggish start that lasted for a year or two or three depending on how you read the data
1164403 i dont see those historical comparisons as being particularly compelling
1164404 were talking 30 years policymakers around the world have learned a lot since then the disruptions of the 1970s were in part a consequence of policy mistakes unlikely to be repeated
1164405 its widely recognized in central banks around the world that milton friedman was right on this issue
1164406 if you want price stability it takes disciplined monetary policy we recognize that and intend to provide that
1164407 lots of things happen once that doesnt mean that they are good guides to the future
1164408 as long as people are confident that we will provide long run low inflation and price stability some of these short run fluctuations in food and energy while they may be difficult to adjust to will not affect the longer term course of inflation we have to be careful not to squander that credibility that means that at some point were going to have to take action to reverse the interest rate declines that weve engineered beginning last fall
1164409 i understand at least in part why youre anxious i wouldnt try to talk you out of that one talk is cheap and your own experience is going to matter more two its not like we are going to observe immediately a significant acceleration of growth and a significant diminution of inflation

1164431 i dont know if thats a good thing or a bad thing but its an exciting thing no doubt
1164432 other than that i think its just a big bulls eye
1164433 thats the whole key right now we must focus on football
1164434 i expect our team to do that i expect out staff to do that i quite frankly havent been able to think much about football lately but soon very soon i will be able to and im going to enjoy it
1164435 weve made too many mistakes in no way is that acceptable

1164454 hes got good experience in a couple different systems so i dont think anything he is doing here is anything that new
1164455 he shows up with a play or two every day and he is a hard working guy
1164456 it was pretty tough because you couldnt get a hold of anyone back there
1164457 that was probably the hardest thing not knowing for like four or five hours not knowing anything and just doing a lot of praying

1164490 according to law enforcement intelligence services organized drug trafficers have moved off the reservation during this period of time i am not saying they are gone but i have talked to our taskforce personel personally and some of them characterize our operation as sort of a blitz and that the result was that the organized drug trafficers have moved back

1164522 hes as focused on every nuance of this game as any of the best players whove ever been here
1164523 tony talked to me this offseason about some techniques he could improve on in the pocket he told me he threw literally hundreds and hundreds of balls into his couch
1164524 we havent broken through yet but when we do id like to think were going to kick the door down and keep it open for a long time
1164525 once you figure out how to do certain things the experience gives you a lot of knowledge how to do it again
1164526 he just waits waits waits and bam ive never seen someone so good getting to his second third fourth progressions

1164536 when i tell people that i played in the olympics there is much more of an ooh and aah factor than when i tell them that i played in the world cup
1164537 the olympic experience for an american is an amazing accomplishment
1164538 has a vested interest in the olympics not becoming another world cup
1164539 and yet because of what the olympics are theres a need to give it the due that it deserves in doing that weve created a very interesting and at times sticky situation
1164540 the reputation of this team has been damaged no question
1164541 i dont think its beyond repair and i dont think the reputation has been ruined but certainly it has taken some hits
1164542 you feel sad and sick that one of the guys youre an authority figure over and you care about got himself in trouble
1164543 you also hate the fact those guys do represent this program and this program represents this university and this university represents this state it represents anybody who claims to be a bulldog i feel sick about that
1164544 i mean theres no way you can say it hasnt been a distraction because it has been
1164545 if a guy has a first time offense i dont believe in throwing that guy under the bus to try to stave off the wolves so to speak

1164547 we will look into other ways of making sure we do a better job
1164548 i dont know if i would blame him for it with whats gone on this offseason
1164549 downtown that can be fun for a lot of guys but the team and what were able to do this season is a lot more important than going out and having fun with college students
1164550 i tried just about everything then the last thing we tried seemed to work well it turned around in about three or four days
1164551 he should have a nice fresh arm between now and the end of the year
1164552 hopefully we can get it done the next couple of days every thing is fine

1164573 aleksandr solzhenitsyn whose stubborn lonely and combative literary struggles gained the force of prophecy died late on sunday at the age of 89 in moscow
1164574 all i can say is one word his condition is serious
1164575 so the point that i was making at the time was that the political dynamic was the driving force between that sectarian violence and we could try to keep a lid on it but if these underlining dynamic continued to bubble up and explode the way they were then we would be in a difficult situation i am glad that in fact those political dynamic shifted at the same time that our troops did outstanding work

1164597 this type of parity is an exciting sign for not only now but the future as well

1164612 what do i get from this situation what nourishment doe it tell me i need
1164613 these preliminary data are released upon our being advised that the trial has now reached the point at which more than 50 of the patients have died the overall survival os and disease control rate dcr for patients receiving nimotuzumab compare well with published results in similar patient populations treated with cetuximab a currently marketed egfr monoclonal antibody nimotuzumab also continues to display a safety profile unequalled in its class this low incidence of toxicity with nimotuzumab may be related to differences reported in its interaction with egf receptors compared with other egfr targeting antibodies
1164614 the median overall survival of 9 3 months and disease control rate of 50 together with the exceptional safety profile of nimotuzumab support continuing development of nimotuzumab in patients with colorectal cancer
1164615 the results support further development of nimotuzumab in this setting and trials in metastatic colorectal cancer are high on the list of indications that ym and its licensees plan to develop initially however ym will concentrate on those indications where nimotuzumab can complete pivotal trials in the shortest time within its available resources we intend to file for registration trials in 2008 for patients with non small cell lung cancer nsclc and for those with brain metastases because of compelling observations in phase ii trials in those indications and because they require shorter development times than colorectal trials would require
1164616 ok im done with the last project what do you need me to do next
1164617 our national economy is continuing to pose enormous challenges for our working families
1164618 we cannot afford to wait for help from washington or for the situation to grow worse
1164619 we know this strategy will work because we have proven it before
1164620 when i took office in 2003 pennsylvania was trailing the nation in job growth and had spent most of the prior four years with a higher unemployment rate than the nations jobless number
1164621 here in new castle with todays announcement we will have invested 109 million in new state funds since 2003 lawrence county now has 1 700 more people working than in january 2003 and unemployment has dropped by almost 11 percent
1164622 the bridges in this years accelerated repair program will require enough concrete to build 16 000 homes which would be equal to a 60 percent increase in new home construction
1164623 in addition that bridge work will demand enough steel to build four eiffel towers
1164624 we can lead the way out of the national economic crisis by continuing to invest in jobs and business expansion a safe infrastructure strong communities and the resulting gains in productivity
1164625 last summer my daughter endured many stares and rude remarks at the public pool her psoriasis was particularly bad and she had many spots that her swimsuit didnt cover
1164626 i bought a pool for our backyard so she could swim at home without being hassled and embarrassed
1164627 unfortunately many people assume psoriasis is contagious because of the way it looks and because of that people living with the disease face discrimination weve heard from countless adults with psoriasis who as children were consistently excluded from pool parties because parents were afraid
1164628 through our pools are for recreation not discrimination campaign this year were encouraging individuals and organizations to educate their communities that psoriasis is not contagious
1164629 and were urging those who have faced discrimination because of their psoriasis to speak up about the disease to end the fear and open the pool
1164630 emilio grater n se autoexcluy de las filas de unt por romper con las reglas y las normas de esta organizaci n pol tica

1164635 un nuevo tiempo ha dado pruebas de desprendimientos hemos reconocido que carlos ocariz gan las encuestas en sucre vamos a trabajar intensamente para la unidad en el municipio el hatillo baruta libertador y estamos luchando esta semana para la alcald a mayor pero lo que no vamos a permitir es que se quiera tergiversar la historia que tiene una sola verdad desconocimiento de las normas del partido y por tanto este se or grater n no puede competir en el acuerdo de unidad porque l no es unitario
1164636 cuando se milita en un partido hay que respetar sus reglas hicimos un reglamente se contrat una empresa se nombr una comisi n manejada por uno de los hombres m s serios que es omar barboza y esa encuesta dio unos resultados y frente a esos resultados hubo desconocimiento y eso es lo que queremos decirle a chacao y al pa s

1164658 only a small portion of data breaches get publicized and with government data breaches even fewer get identified because the government unlike business doesnt have a financial incentive to do so

1164660 i am pleased to report that nisource remains on track to achieve 2008 financial results which are in line with our business plan

1164662 the pennsylvania settlement is a prime example of nisources commitment to invest in system service and reliability combined with our broader regulatory philosophy of working collaboratively with stakeholders to achieve mutually beneficial results
1164663 this outcome also is in sync with columbia of pennsylvanias ongoing 20 year 1 4 billion infrastructure investment program

1164669 the 28 million licensed drivers in california and washington have had plenty of time to prepare for the law since the measure was adopted by the legislature back in 2006 and i think that government agencies and manufacturers of hands free products have done a really great job of creating awareness among consumers
1164670 the july 1 deadline to go hands free in california had a substantial effect on parrot branded products
1164671 we experienced over 180 unit sales growth in the 2nd quarter of 2008 as compared to the 1st quarter having trained sales staff in place was extremely important as consumers struggled to understand bluetooth r and what their options were beyond headsets

1164697 it is going to be a good game of cricket
1164698 the players looked at the wicket with the declaration in mind and think we have a good chance of manipulating a win
1164699 i dived into a swimming pool hit my head and two vertebrae stepped out of line and there was a fracture
1164700 my doctor said to me it is absolutely amazing that im not paralysed from the neck down
1164701 its a big clich that after a big accident that you realise the talent and ability you have
1164702 at the moment im in the best shape of my life im fitter and stronger than ive ever been
1164703 its been a real eye opener i believe that things happen for a reason and this is a good reason for me to bring my game up to the next level
1164704 its been really refreshing as previously weve struggled quite badly to be honest
1164705 at the world cup in 2005 we didnt do so well and got ourselves into a bit of a muddle and we did really well in stellenbosch to prove that we didnt belong in the qualifying tournament
1164706 i was out for about a year but all the girls have stepped up their game and im excited for the future and with the world cup coming up a tour to england i really cant wait
1164707 ive obviously been down there while ive been growing up to watch games and stuff so being able to play there will be good
1164708 hopefully it will be in front of a few friends as well so im looking forward to it
1164709 they are both teams that we havent played recently so all were going to do is try and concentrate on what weve been doing recently
1164710 in australia and new zealand we performed really well and we just want to keep on improving on that and then take each game as it comes really
1164711 i think south africa have changed quite a bit from when we last played them and india we havent played them for a while
1164712 were just going to concentrate on us and then go from there
1164713 we dont know south africa that well but theyve got crizelda brits their captain who played a season with us at club level for hayes and shes a really good player
1164714 shes probably one of their danger players along with alicia smith who is a really good bowler
1164715 they are two players that come to mind for me but i dont know too much about the rest of them
1164716 with the indians its their spinners they have got quality spinners and probably one of the best seamers in jhulan goswami so were going to know what to expect and we have to think about how we are going to play them
1164717 being able to be a part of that and all the things that came with it were great
1164718 obviously we all play because we want to win and anything else that we get on top of that is a bonus
1164719 things like that make you realise everything you do worthwhile its really good fun
1164720 obviously our goal is to win the world cup and thats what these series against south africa and india are leading towards
1164721 we just want to make sure that were peaking at the right time and playing consistently
1164722 i think to win a world cup we recognise that its consistency thats key so we dont want to have our best performance in the quarter finals get in the semi final and then not perform as well
1164723 we want to make sure we perform consistently well to make sure we win all the games that we play
1164724 for me playing south africa and india will just be about making sure we are aiming to perform and win more games than not
1164725 it was really disappointing its always disappointing to lose and there is quite a big rivalry between us and sussex and it was a shame that it was because of the rain
1164726 it gives the girls in the kent team especially the young ones it gave them a taste of how much it means to win the county championship
1164727 it gives us another challenge next year to beat sussex and to beat all the teams
1164728 i think coming in in the middle order i want to be a bit more dangerous and help take games away from teams or get us out of trouble
1164729 i need to adapt to the role really depending on the situation that were in
1164730 how will we know when the market has bottomed out and we should buy a home
1164731 so far its actually given us a bigger list than we expected

1164736 how will we know when the market has bottomed out and we should buy a home
1164737 were extremely proud that the realestate com website was recognized at the 2008 apex awards competition
1164738 weve put a lot of blood sweat and tears into making realestate com the top online real estate destination for millions of americans and this honor certainly proves that all of our hard work is paying off
1164739 how will we know when the market has bottomed out and we should buy a home
1164740 most americans know why credit scores rise and why they fall
1164741 lack of consumer knowledge about credit scores not only increases the costs of their credit and insurance but also reduces the availability of these and other services
1164742 talking about credit card debt is an overwhelming social taboo
1164743 there is a social paradox happening people who are faced with credit card debt are unwilling to face their financial issues and therefore may be leaving it unresolved
1164744 how will we know when the market has bottomed out and we should buy a home
1164745 in an industry where communication is paramount our offices need to have the most advanced communication management technology available
1164746 by partnering with paetec re max offices have an opportunity to integrate advanced technology into their businesses with the help of leading experts and at competitive prices
1164747 paetec is a trusted advisor on complex communications technology decisions and our customer satisfaction levels set the benchmark for the communications industry
1164748 we look forward to making paetecs full range of data and voice solutions available to re max offices nationwide
1164749 how will we know when the market has bottomed out and we should buy a home
1164750 we are pleased with this recognition because it reflects our commitment as a brand to providing top quality service to luxury market consumers around the world
1164751 as we continue to experience consistent strategic growth worldwide and in light of challenging economic conditions in many markets our top priority is to remain focused on delivering the high quality service that is synonymous with our brand name
1164752 how will we know when the market has bottomed out and we should buy a home
1164753 if an alien landed on our planet and sized up our market theyd quickly see that its the biggest and fastest growing group and yet why marketers want to ignore them is beyond me but they do
1164754 in todays marketplace it doesnt pay to be loyal to one brand
1164755 they went back and tried to figure out what they did wrong
1164756 speaking to the 50 plus it has to be different in terms of writing and graphics and presentation
1164757 a 20 something is an easier sell you have to work harder work smarter to get that 50 plus customer but the return on investment if you do it right can be tremendous
1164758 i certainly dont remember any ads that led us to lexus
1164759 ad agencies are going to get all this pressure to market to 50 plus consumers and theyre going to have all these 20 something creatives working on it its going to fail and then theyre going to say see we told you
1164760 but if we hire smart creatives it shouldnt be a problem
1164761 were not living out our lives like our parents and grandparents
1164762 a 50 year old today may be the parent of a baby they may be an empty nester or they may have never had kids some 50 year olds may connect more closely with someone whos 30 than someone whos a year younger than themselves
1164763 every demographic group has needs and sometimes those needs cross many demographics
1164764 someone starting out in life with a new spouse and a new baby they obviously have a lot of needs but so does everyone throughout their lives those needs dont stop at 50
1164765 upscale 18 34 demographic at a media conference in new york cbs chief executive officer leslie moonves derided the idea
1164766 the only upscale 18 year olds i know are my children and they have to come to me if they want to buy a car
1164767 and the 50 year old is thrown in the garbage its one of the great old wives tales
1164768 how will we know when the market has bottomed out and we should buy a home
1164769 when we launched sharperagent one of the unique feature sets of the tool at the time was that you could have multiple media outputs from one system
1164770 most agents create print marketing pieces with one tool and then use a different tool to create their online marketing pieces what weve found over time is that the more automation you can put in front of agents and the less task oriented items you give them on a daily basis the more likely they are to utilize and realize the benefits of the technology and marketing
1164771 our mixed media product will enable a user to set up a totally custom campaign with different touch methods to reach people on a timely basis
1164772 brokers want to heighten the agents ability to communicate with todays consumer
1164773 brokers dont want their image represented on a recipe card they want high quality value and content that will explain to the consumer why their brand and their agent are the right choice they also want to have that communication fit the different generations they are targeting
1164774 weve created the ability for an agent to take a consumer set them into a campaign with a few single steps and be done with it
1164775 agents can set up campaigns based on how their contacts want to be contacted whether via e mail or direct mail or a combination
1164776 the program will also schedule tasks such as call john jones on this date you can send your campaigns out to your entire distribution list or a group based on a particular interest or demographic
1164777 they send out a postcard and months go by before they remember that they were supposed to be doing this regularly the success marketing program takes a consumer database of prospects and your sphere records the preference of delivery for each of them and then automates a mixed media campaign that is touching consumers on a regular basis through various mediums some go through e mail some through traditional mail and some through reminders that its time to pick up the phone or place a personal visit
1164778 frequency and consistency is everything when it comes to staying competitive
1164779 a lot of clients pay for messaging and realize they can only afford to send it once or twice
1164780 what traditional companies outside of real estate have been doing for years
1164781 in their advertising efforts they include television campaigns direct mail campaigns and support them with e mail and online campaigns we want to take that same approach that works in so many other businesses and use it in real estate
1164782 for many agents hiring an ad agency is likely cost prohibitive

1164784 consumer behavior is such that the consumer needs to be touched multiple times through multiple mediums
1164785 with so many new companies coming into play trying to grab the consumers attention an agent needs to not only demonstrate their expertise in selling real estate they need to make meaningful connections with consumers by contacting them on a regular basis in the manner in which they want to be communicated with
1164786 consumers are hungry for any kind of real estate marketing information whenever an agent can become the trusted resource of that information thats always valuable but then you may have customers who appreciate the targeted demographic or consumer information the summer safety tips or the local sports schedule theyre always effective in creating top of mind awareness

1164794 how will we know when the market has bottomed out and we should buy a home
1164795 it kind of surprised me but its a pretty cool idea
1164796 i never really thought about having one but i really like it and use it quite a bit
1164797 in fact the word hammock comes from the hamaca tree and thats a native tree there
1164798 but in some of the traditional countries like mexico theyre used indoors as beds space is tight and you can take them down quickly also people use them because of their comfort and to be off the ground and away from the bugs rodents and things
1164799 the only thing that happens sometimes is if you fall asleep and youre wearing shorts or bathing suit youll get a rope pattern on your legs or shoulders but that goes away real fast
1164800 is particularly nice in this climate because you get a breeze with it
1164801 we wanted a nice comfortable place to relax by the pool and watch the sun go down
1164802 weve fallen asleep out there it fits your body its like a nice cocoon
1164803 every time id go to a home and garden show id sit in them and say id buy one
1164804 i just like to go out there and sit in the evening
1164805 id rather sit ive always been attracted to hanging chairs when youre sitting in it and its got a little foot rest i think its almost more relaxing than a hammock at least it is for me
1164806 i said this is kind of neat i never sat on one before and the whole thing flipped i just didnt really read or listen to the instructions
1164807 i pull the edge to the back of my knees position myself in the center spin my backside and then lay down my feet
1164808 if you dont do it that way and sit in the center youre going to flip
1164809 we give people a quick tutorial about getting into it
1164810 aim your fanny at the very center of the hammock sit down then quickly fling your arms and legs into position and make minor adjustments in balance with your fanny
1164811 i cant tell you how many people have been ejected on their first attempt at getting into the thing but once you have the knack it is heavenly comfortable
1164812 whoever is in the hammock has to be left alone
1164813 i would urge anyone who gets a hammock have that special feature
1164814 how will we know when the market has bottomed out and we should buy a home
1164815 what to do with piment the piment we have is bigger than black pepperseed round about 4mm diameter and brown
1164816 pimento is also a name for the small red chilies also called
1164817 wassamatter princess aw need mr pigstabber to do it for you maybe your mommy could help about time for her to change your diaper anyway isnt it shirley
1164818 dont go thinking you have the whole story just because you made some casual observations
1164819 i dont really want to associate on wonderful terms with everyone i bump into i want to do my thing and go back to my internets where interesting people like kirk and shush are posting stuff i actually care about
1164820 so i have a one word solution to your hair woes bic
1164821 mainly because you dont know what the ol noodle is shaped like until the hairs gone and what i found out about my own skull is that it is neither smooth nor symmetrical it is however pale and frightening to small children
1164822 i prefer their instrumental covers of metallica songs than the originals themselves
1164823 perhaps if you want people to read your posts in the future you should end with the porn rather than beginning with it
1164824 the grand slam breakfast doesnt quite sound the same anymore
1164825 kirk im hurt that you didnt mention me what with my semi frequent postings of krispy kremes with tortie and in n out and val amp my bacon station
1164826 my heart burns like fire but my eyes are as cold as dead ashes

1164828 the new organization capabilities in vmware lab manager 3 will help us better enforce role based access rights to system configurations in the lab according to our it policy says tony anastasio technology architect for cerner the leading u
1164829 we have development teams working on trading gateways for virtually every major futures exchange around the world
1164830 vmware lab manager 3 gives us much more flexibility in the way we deal with a global lab environment it simplifies administration supports multiple networks and lets us assign resource pools and manage user access rights for all of our teams from a central location vmware lab manager has quickly become the industry standard virtual lab automation solution used by software development and testing teams worldwide said raghu raghuram vice president of products and solutions vmware this new release expands the appeal of vmware lab manager to more groups of people at our customers by promoting effective self service combined with centralized it control
1164831 impacts on individual species indicate wider changes at the biome level that will potentially change conditions for many plant and animal species in addition to ecosystem services to humans
1164832 the central u s is characterized by an ecotone thats the intersection of forest in the east and grassland in the west
1164833 the border between these ecosystems is largely determined by climate variability and it is likely that climate change will shift the location of this and other ecological boundaries worldwide
1164834 to close small plants it will be very effective to improve air quality
1164835 theres no co benefit to doing the carbon capture and storage
1164836 theres an argument for doing greengen in terms of research and getting experience with it but from a commercial point of view it doesnt make sense
1164837 it may well be in this environment where oil is above 100 a barrel that it is economically viable and valuable for nations that are rich in coal like china to use that coal and to sequester the co2 for purposes of producing more oil
1164838 view it as being a long term benefit to remove co2
1164839 when i was young the sky was green and we could not see stars at night
1164840 this year we see blue skies and stars we think its much better
1164841 needs to enforce the environmental laws if they want blue skies
1164842 as to how to go about utilising this resource we will learn from your experience
1164843 offsets such as the projects that nrg has committed to invest in are a low cost way to get the large reductions in greenhouse gases that are necessary to prevent catastrophic impacts of global warming and nrg has established a precedent for other electricity companies to follow
1164844 according to the meteorology agency this years dry season is very dry not wet like last year thats the problem
1164845 looking at the fluctuation of hot spots this year could be worse than last
1164846 pressure build up in a small sealed sample bottle in a storage safe
1164847 all indications are that there was no release of radioactivity to the environment further monitoring around the laboratory will be undertaken
1164848 this pressure build up of toxic gases that plutonium produces could have happened in the most modern lab as well
1164849 the laboratory is equipped with multiple safety systems including an air filtering system to prevent the release of radioactivity to the environment
1164850 no matter how many rounds of confirmation are made there is no way to guarantee the second requirement that both generals agree the message was delivered
1164851 outside the area of qingdao there are still some areas of algae but it will not disturb the competition
1164852 we have the eyes of an eagle and the speed of a puma and have worked really hard to fight this
1164853 yesterday we didnt see any algae its the cleanest day we have had
1164854 we were here for two days in june and it was really bad we came back in mid july and it was improved yesterday only one time did we see a string of algae on our keel and that is such a change
1164855 there is much more carbon in our natural forests than we thought
1164856 this means the potential amount of avoided emissions is much larger and therefore theres much more to be gained from protecting them from logging
1164857 it means the risks of logging are bigger than we thought
1164858 to be fair to the ipcc and the greenhouse office these are their default volumes
1164859 they were calling for better local data and we have produced that
1164860 protecting the carbon in natural forests is preventing an additional emission of carbon from what we get from burning fossil fuel
1164861 developing and utilizing renewables shall be an important part of building a new socialist countryside
1164862 china is already one of the top renewable energy producers in the world
1164863 renewable energy can provide 50 percent of the energy needs in china
1164864 all the good wind farm locations are now owned by the biggest energy companies
1164865 because land is very precious in china some places will not be allowed to build wind farms
1164866 china has the largest wind resources in the world and three quarters of them are offshore
1164867 the reality in china is they develop wind farms too fast
1164868 the local market is very limited because pv is too expensive
1164869 its a waste of all the production in china it doesnt make sense
1164870 to stop global warming its not an excuse to destroy the local environment
1164871 within 30 to 50 years hydro will be the main energy we should rely on
1164872 we have approximately a half acre fire the potential for spread is moderate
1164873 its gotten back to a more open condition the way it was in the past
1164874 the question here is much bigger than the state of roraima its a question of national integration
1164875 not just on the part of indians but from land grabbers prospectors and loggers who would take it as a signal that reservations could be invaded
1164876 the brazilian army does not serve the government but rather the brazilian state
1164877 if they decide against us it would be the worst thing that can happen to indigenous people across brazil
1164878 those people the settlers think their contribution to the economy and their control of the local institutions make them right
1164879 theres a free shot of it coming from the north
1164880 you look north and you dont see much getting in the way
1164881 it was shall we say somewhat of a godsend when we were picked to be the first major wind farm in nebraska
1164882 and to be honest with you i dont think ive heard anybody grumble about them as far as the looks
1164883 in fact the state ranks 6th in america for wind development potential
1164884 part of being on the road means the ability to live a little more luxuriously than at home and that means not having to turn off the lights and the tv
1164885 people say they want to be green but they dont want to compromise
1164886 we dont really know yet what it means to be green in the hospitality field
1164887 said they would suffer discomfort because they would get back to their room and it would be extremely hot
1164888 indicated that entering a dark room could be a safety issue
1164889 why run the risk of losing a customer because a room needs a few minutes to cool while the air conditioning kicks in its better business just to run the a c and make sure the client comes back
1164890 north america just doesnt have the culture of saving resources
1164891 we wanted to do it in a more stylish way
1164892 the world has shifted if you do the right thing people pick up on it
1164893 now big oils filling john mccains campaign with two million dollars in contributions
1164894 after one president in the pocket of big oil we cant afford another
1164895 barack obamas latest negative attack ad shows his celebrity is matched only by his hypocrisy
1164896 after all it was senator obama not john mccain who voted for the bush cheney energy bill that was a sweetheart deal for oil companies
1164897 this addiction is one of the most dangerous and urgent threats this nation has ever faced
1164898 in 10 years we will eliminate the need for oil from the entire middle east and venezuela
1164899 99 percent of the worlds potatoes are related to potatoes of chilean origin
1164900 99 percent are also genetically related to potatoes originating in peru in other words they coexisted potatoes will always carry genes from varieties found in chile and peru
1164901 i hope chauvinistic nationalism will be laid aside as it contributes nothing to scientific development and protection of the potato which is a multicultural and cross border resource
1164902 the state must register the variety to ensure recognition of the benefits and must also reward the communities of small farmer who originally cultivated it and have conserved it for years
1164903 potato growing on chilo is precarious production is mainly for subsistence and the areas planted are tending to shrink due to the high cost of fertiliser
1164904 the importance of native potatoes as a resource is greatly underestimated people generally eat improved varieties
1164905 our greatest need is training and regular technical advice in order to improve production
1164906 we are the worst affected within the potato production chain and also the most vulnerable to soaring food prices
1164907 while our countries waste time arguing about the origin of animal and plant species developed countries are using our germplasms to create new materials and claim property rights
1164908 solving our local production problems avoiding the loss of ancient varieties and widening the genetic base of cultivated potatoes
1164909 after one president in the pocket of big oil we cant afford another
1164910 a windfall profits tax on big oil to give families a thousand dollar rebate
1164911 every time you fill your tank the oil companies fill their pockets
1164912 barack obamas latest attack ads shows his celebrity is matched only by his hypocrisy
1164913 after all it was senator obama not john mccain who voted for the bush cheney energy bill that was a sweetheart deal for oil companies also not mentioned is the 400 000 from big oil contributors that barack obama has already pocketed in this election
1164914 to have a group of animals under such a high level of threat is quite frankly unlike anything we have recorded among any other group of species to date
1164915 it is not too late for our close cousins the primates and what we have now is a challenge to turn this around
1164916 the review paints a bleak picture some primates are quite literally being eaten to extinction but it is by no means a doomsday scenario there is a lot of will here among these scientists in edinburgh and in the countries where primates live

1164963 weve seen a rash of people abusing the dmca lately attempting to take down legitimate criticism and commentary online

1164970 gone down more than any of us have anticipated including president bush and john mccain
1164971 for one i feel that mccain is making fun of my christian beliefs as well as my spiritual principals of love dreams and most of all hope sen mccain acts like sen obama can not be charismatic and intelligent at the same time i wonder why people are not in an uproar about this type of negative campaigns i believe that these types of ads only make fun of spiritual and or religious people
1164972 i also saw myself in that video if you look closer i am holding the hand of the person you refer to as my friend i dont even know him i never saw that guy before we were just enjoying the moment of not only the possibility for making history but for the first time since i have been engaged in the voting process i have never been and felt this excited about any other candidate black or white
1164973 making fun of the american people who feel right now that all we have left is hope because faith is the substance of things to hope for and the evidence of things not seen we have enough evidence that what we have seen in sen barack so far gives us hope that he does have what it takes to become the next president of the united states of america

1165009 quisimos formar un equipo fuerte y que venga a darlo todo para sacar la victoria con una combinaci n entre juventud y experiencia
1165010 no no creo que yo est en deuda con nadie lo habr podido hacer mejor o peor pero siempre di lo mejor de mi mismo y me entregu al m ximo en este sentido tengo la conciencia muy tranquila
1165011 me he ganado el respeto con mi trabajo lo que s es verdad es que esta temporada tenemos una responsabilidad extra
1165012 cuando juegas en un equipo grande como el bar a el nivel de exigencia es alt simo y cuando llevas dos a os sin ganar nada sientes la presi n de saber que no puedes volver a fallar respeto todas las cr ticas y en este sentido creo que la mejor manera de ejercer esa responsabilidad es haciendo bien tu trabajo
1165013 fue algo que me reconfort porque que el entrenador crea en ti es algo que te da mucha moral pep quiere que exprima la experiencia que he ido acumulando a lo largo de estos a os los m s veteranos los que llevamos m s a os dentro del equipo somos los que tenemos que ayudar a los que ahora vienen nuevos
1165014 este es un nuevo bar a hay un nuevo entrenador
1165015 la din mica puede que no sea tan distinta como lo hac a antes en chivas pero creo que todos los partidos los estamos tomando con la misma seriedad y como si fuera de la temporada oficial se ha trabajado muy fuerte y los amistosos son para eso
1165016 tener a andr s de compa aro en el equipo es un handicap en el sentido que te dice lo que el entrenador quiere las cosas que hay en la ciudad la comida la adaptaci n todo es de beneficio para m y espero poder acoplarme lo mas pronto posible
1165017 hemos estado trabajando durante tres semanas y todos los jugadores han tenido su oportunidad este trabajo nos ha dado una idea de lo que queremos y por eso hoy le hemos dejado las cosas claras a un grupo de jugadores el mercado de fichajes cierra a final de mes y espero que se solucione el exceso de jugadores porque mi intenci n es contar con veinticuatro futbolista
1165018 a n no hay hora definida pero el partido ser el mi rcoles
1165019 iba ir a guadalajara pero al final lo suspendimos s iba ir a revisarme all pero al final no fui exactamente tengo una pubitis y este ahora es muy probable que est durante 15 d as sin jugar para recuperarme bien y estar de la mejor manera para evitar que me operaran porque si era as me perder a casi dos meses
1165020 hay que tener tranquilidad vamos a hacer un plan de trabajo para buscar que las molestias desaparezcan y si dios quiere y volver mejor en la parte f sica as que estamos con mucha tranquilidad
1165021 if youre going to do something then do it well i choose to be a damned good bitch ive had a lot of practice from dealing with assholes like you
1165022 estamos inconformes por el resultado con puebla pero nuestros objetivos est n intactos y solamente es cuesti n de obtener la primera victoria para levantar
1165023 yo creo que mejoramos en relaci n al primer partido salimos a proponer pero se nos complic al quedarnos en inferioridad num rica pero as es el futbol y ahora a pensar en el siguiente rival
1165024 si yo creo que siempre salimos con esa idea de ganar incluso si hubi semos vencido al puebla el futbol no te da ning n respiro y tienes que tomar todos los partidos como una final indios seguramente tambi n tiene esa urgencia as que ser un buen partido y tenemos toda la semana para prepararnos
1165025 claro nosotros tenemos aspiraciones y por eso tendremos que ir a buscar el resultado aunque con inteligencia para no desesperarnos yo creo que con el trabajo diario que ustedes ven los resultados van a llegar creo que luchamos nos entregamos y en base a eso los resultados tienen que aparecer
1165026 que va a ser complicado como todos ellos estar n ante su gente no han comenzando bien y por eso pueden ser m s peligrosos as que nosotros tendremos que esforzarnos al m ximo y presionarlos porque tenemos jugadores que saben que hacer con la pelota
1165027 la copa sudamericana es un torneo cada vez m s importante y esta versi n tiene la particularidad de que enfrenta a varios argentinos en la primera fase creo que de esto van a resultar encuentros atractivos y equipos clasificados con un aplomo especial
1165028 se cruzar n dos equipos con muchos logros internacionales y hay que respetar la trayectoria
1165029 es el equipo que m s me sorprendi desde el semestre pasado

1165035 im bitter man and you cant make eye contact with anyone man
1165036 i got a letter from gary underwood that stated graphically how im attracted to you im not afraid to have a quote unquote erection around you i need you i want you and he spelled my name in four different languages
1165037 is supposed to be a reflection of what he was thinking about
1165038 i have four boys and i would never dream of putting them in a situation like this
1165039 its like a prisoner of war type thing you put it in a place and you hope that door never opens
1165040 they say time goes on and it will be all right but thats not the case it continues to affect me and every facet of my life
1165041 i have six children and very few any contact with i became a drug and alcohol abuser its very difficult for me to hold down jobs because i cant seem to get past it
1165042 the counselors told me without a doubt this is a result of what was happening to me and what gary underwood did to me
1165043 i do the best that i can but at the same time theres always something in the back of my head that i always have to be numbed somehow so i can forget and if i dont im even worse
1165044 i didnt turn out to be a doctor or whatever

1165055 de eerste druppel was de uitspraak van minister van ardenne in jemen een halfjaar geleden zij vond dat seculiere opiniemakers ze had het zelfs over fundamentalistische seculieren gevaarlijk bezig waren door achter een fa ade van tolerantie vijandigheid jegens andere culturen en religies te betonen dat vonden wij z idioot dat we wat op papier wilden zetten er heerst steeds meer een sfeer dat je het over bepaalde zaken niet meer mag hebben de nadruk in het debat is steeds meer komen te liggen op het recht om te beledigen in plaats van op het recht van vrijheid van meningsuiting
1165056 toen zei minister donner vorige week dat hij jammer genoeg niet de juridische middelen had om de kruisigings act van madonna te verbieden en op dat moment vonden wij de tijd rijp om het al geschreven manifest in de openbaarheid te brengen en natuurlijk komen er verkiezingen aan en vinden wij dat het in de campagne ook over dit soort kwesties moet gaan
1165057 bij het cda zou het alle kanten op kunnen gaan
1165058 krijgen we geen handtekening van het cda van donner of juist wel van het cda van verhagen ook van de sp weet ik het niet zeker maar ik vermoed dat ze wel zullen ondertekenen

1165107 bleek dat pacelli in zijn streven naar onge venaarde pauselijke macht de katholieke kerk in 1933 medeplichtig had gemaakt aan de wandaden van het hitler regime
1165108 ik vond tevens bewijzen dat pacelli in het begin van zijn carri re al een onmiskenbare afkeer had van joden bovendien werden katholieke verenigingen die in het duitsland van de jaren dertig tegenwicht hadden kunnen bieden tegen hitlers regime en de genocide hadden kunnen vertragen door zijn diplomatieke inspanningen opgeheven
1165109 de betrokkenheid van de duitse clerus bij dit proces zou gedurende het hele nazi regime doorgaan uiteindelijk zouden de katholieke en protestantse kerk ook betrokken raken bij de organisatie van de vernietigingskampen
1165110 de gewelddadige aard van het gangsterregime waar hij zaken mee deed
1165111 toen pius xii in de lente van 1942 de eerste betrouwbare informatie over de genocide ontving en door de geallieerden en joodse organisaties werd gevraagd zich ertegen uit te spreken deed hij aanvankelijk niets
1165112 de honderdduizenden die geheel buiten hun eigen schuld soms alleen vanwege hun religie of ras worden uitgekozen om vermoord of geleidelijk uitgeroeid te worden
1165113 de kloof tussen de massamoord op het joodse volk en deze vage ontwijkende verklaring was schokkend zijn woorden hadden net zo goed op de ontelbare andere oorlogsslachtoffers kunnen slaan het dubbelzinnige taalgebruik was duidelijk bedoeld om zowel degenen die bij hem op een protest aandrongen tevreden te stellen als het nazi regime te vriend te houden maar deze overwegingen worden overschaduwd door de impliciete ontkenning en trivialisering van de genocide nergens verwees hij naar duitsland of de nazis hitler had zelf nauwelijks een onschuldiger reactie voor de paus kunnen bedenken
1165114 meer te maken had met ingesleten wantrouwen jegens joden dan met diplomatieke strategie of het streven naar neutraliteit pacelli liet zijn neutrale houding bijvoorbeeld wel varen toen nederland belgi en luxemburg in mei 1940 werden aangevallen
1165115 onderzochten de zuiverheid van het bloed op elk spoor van joods bijmengsel van allen die in kerk en staat een ambt bekleedden om geen zuiver bloed te hebben was het voldoende dat alleen iemands moeder joods was of slechts voor een kwart of zelfs maar voor een achtste joods bloed had certificaten werden afgegeven waarop officieel werd bevestigd dat een katholiek niet door joods bloed was bezoedeld
1165116 96 concilies en 114 pausen hebben in de loop der eeuwen wetten geformuleerd om het joodse volk bespottelijk en belachelijk te maken om hen te laten martelen en te verbannen om hun goederen te onteigenen en hen als parias van de samenleving te beschouwen
1165117 ik ben zeer teleurgesteld dat niemand nog lijkt in te zien dat de sovjet unie de ene echte grote vijand is van europa en dat er nog geen gemeenschappelijke kruistocht tegen het bolsjewisme is georganiseerd
1165118 het is inderdaad zo dat er in de christelijke wereld ik zeg niet van de kant van de kerk als zodanig al te lang onjuiste en onrechtvaardige interpretaties van het nieuwe testament hebben gecirculeerd met betrekking tot het joodse volk en zijn vermeende schuld interpretaties die haatgevoelens jegens dit volk hebben teweeggebracht

1165129 netshare status report we still havent gotten any answer from apple as to why netshare was removed from the app store calls to adc yield wait times of a few hours and were forced to give up e mails to various contacts at apple and the developer program have also given us no response is this acceptable business practice we dont think so when an application fails to be approved or even more importantly so when an application gets removed from sale apple should be required to provide a valid reason
1165130 what makes this more extraordinary is that developers of app store products are not just developers they are an income stream thirty per cent of the money we pay for every app goes directly to apple thats how the app store works its a deal and deals work in two directions both sides get something in this case apple gets software to offer to users of its exciting new platform and the developers get access to a secure online distribution system including payment processing hosting everything they need to sell their work deals make partnerships and partnerships even unequal 30 70 ones ought to work both ways apple expects and has a right to expect developers to behave themselves and act within the rules it has laid down but in return developers expect and have every right to expect apple to be a responsible indeed responsive store owner at the very least they have the right to know whether or not apple considers their work suitable for sale in the store and to be told why it has been withdrawn then reinstated then withdrawn again and so on
1165131 party at the bachelers summer home on pelham avenue in beach haven
1165132 if i make the team my father is planning on returning to china
1165133 i know it will be a thrill for him to go back to the land where he was born
1165134 we had an open campsite which is unusual we usually fill up very quickly so we were able to accommodate them and happy to do it
1165135 i mean people they just asked if i was okay and like how did i take it and stuff like that
1165136 that is a young girl in our community whose life could have been ended and weve got to care about that whatever the reasons that mitigated it happening weve got to stand with them
1165137 we came up this way and as i was coming up on this i saw some red up here
1165138 theyre trying to say this is my area right here dont come up in it if youre not one of us
1165139 they will mark it thats their area thats their playground thats their street and they dont want any other gangs coming in on that street in that area and then youre going to have trouble at that point
1165140 its not too bad here but if its in my neighborhood im going to be concerned
1165141 for me to see you know like little tentacles of gang it makes me wonder whats it like further into the city its got to be a real situation
1165142 i mean were not really afraid of them attacking us were afraid of getting caught in some crossfire
1165143 very happy to be home able to get out of the heat for a while good to see all of my friends still here be nice to all hang out and get back the way we were
1165144 we hate to even charge money for the event but we have to raise money for the scholarship were just asking for all the support we can get
1165145 it could be that somebody who just moved to the area at this time we know we have a lot of rental property that changes hands and it could be that he was cleaning out something or his house or apartment and found it and brought it to the nearest place he thought would be a safe place to drop it off and leave it with someone
1165146 if im working with buyers that are looking anywhere in the county i would require them to have a radon test
1165147 it can be traced back to me especially if im working as a buyers agent im a professional been in the business 30 years i know about radon testing i should recommend that to my buyer to protect them and myself because im ultimately liable for such things if they happen
1165148 you have to test for termites before you can sell a house but a termite never killed anybody but you dont have to test for radon
1165149 just because we think turnout is going to be so heavy and we dont want to run any risk of running out of ballots
1165150 hes a new generation of leader hes a rising star in the house conference and he comes from the conservative fiscally conservative wing of the party
1165151 the fact that cantor is from virginia is important as well because he could serve as an antidote to tim kaine
1165152 i think he feels as though he can still command plenty of media attention for john mccain is a trickier calculation
1165153 six of the towns you give the levites will be cities of refuge to which a person who has killed someone may flee
1165154 so that anyone who kills a person accidentally and intentionally may flee there and find protection from the avenger of blood
1165155 if the avenger of blood pursues him they must not surrender the one accused because he kills his neighbor unintentionally and without malice aforethought
1165156 the text clearly reads macbook which falls right in line with rumors that the next iteration of the smaller laptops would be aluminum just like their big brothers right now its anyones guess if these pics are legit or not but you can be sure well be keeping a close watch on this one as these pictures emanate from the same site carrying the last supposed leak
1165157 how long will you refuse to keep my command and my instruction
1165158 i think the lockout has contributed substantially to improved safety in those late night precincts
1165159 theres been no lockouts all the venues that trade late have an exemption how does he measure the success
1165160 whats missing in this approach to violence on our streets is a commitment to more police on the streets
1165161 todas estas leyes est n publicadas est n disponibles no hay nada oculto
1165162 todas estas leyes que buscan mejorar la eficiencia del estado est n orientadas a la b squeda de los objetivos de la naci n desarrollo seguridad agroalimentaria mejorar la relaci n del ciudadano con el estado asegurar la integridad y defensa del territorio nacional
1165163 porque todas esas leyes est n ajustadas a la constituci n vigente
1165164 orientado fundamentalmente a buscar la soberan a alimentaria y a ordenar el sector qui n puede negar hoy d a los avances que hemos tenido en agricultura por una pol tica constante permanente de apoyo y desarrollo en esta rea tan importante para la seguridad del pa s
1165165 en la medida en que vamos organizando al sector se est incrementando nuestra capacidad de buscar la soberan a alimentaria el autoabastecimiento y la producci n de alimentos vegetales y animales

1165167 eso nos permite dar un valor agregado a estos productores a quienes les damos asistencia t cnica tasas de inter s bastante accesibles y permite tambi n bancarizarlos lo m s importante es que estos productores son buena paga y contrario a lo que dice la banca tradicional cancelan a tiempo

1165169 what is it about our university that makes you want to attend
1165170 la suspensi n temporal se debe espec ficamente a que estos usuarios no respondieron a la convocatoria que les hiciera cadivi con lo cual incumplieron lo establecido en la providencia n 084
1165171 s lo 12 016 usuarios y usuarias convocados en la ltima oportunidad cumplieron con la obligaci n de consignar ante su operador cambiario los documentos exigidos para demostrar el correcto uso de las divisas autorizadas
1165172 el pcv al momento de hacer consideraciones sobre las candidaturas vio necesaria la consolidaci n de una verdadera unidad estrat gica para derrotar a la oligarqu a y al imperialismo
1165173 el gobierno que se va implantar a partir del pr ximo 23 de noviembre en este estado pretende recuperar el poder de las manos de la oligarqu a todo ello para transferirle ese poder al pueblo la gobernaci n no es un sitio donde est un gobernador m s bien ste debe ser un coordinador de las organizaciones populares y de toda la comunidad ese tiene que ser nuestro trabajo y junto con el pcv y el resto de la alianza vamos a lograrlo
1165174 nosotros pedimos que se adelante una investigaci n para ver de d nde provienen los inmensos recursos que maneja el candidato aldala makled o m s bien de su hermano walid makled quien es el que realmente est detr s de todo esto
1165175 el pasado s bado tuvimos la oportunidad de ir al encuentro de la carta de las am ricas y vimos como iban cinco camionetas y un cami n repartiendo mercanc a utilizando la pobreza para su campa a pero lo m s grave es que est n utilizando mercanc a de mercal para hacer campa a pol tica y en eso est detr s el gobernador de carabobo
1165176 por all andan diciendo que cuando lleguemos a la gobernaci n vamos a botar a la gente quiero decir que eso es falso nosotros estamos es sumando gente no desechando pero por supuesto la gente que est dispuesta a trabajar para la revoluci n se queda y no gente que trabaje para la derecha
1165177 si el ppt quiere darle su apoyo a varias candidaturas a las alcald as de carabobo bienvenidos ser n recuerden que estamos siempre abiertos al di logo en funci n del beneficio de las mayor as es decir todos los partidos tienen que dejar atr s ese arrastre que tra amos de la cuarta rep blica de tomar las decisiones desde las c pulas y no desde las bases
1165178 espero que el tsj decida antes del cierre de las postulaciones
1165179 they needed someone high profile with engineering talent and certainly this guy fits the bill
1165180 the only downside is that he doesnt necessarily have any consumer products expertise
1165181 in terms of actual products hitting the street youre not going to see jhas impact before 2010
1165182 probably his biggest impact will be the level and type of engineering talent he will attract to the company over time
1165183 motorola will only be successful if this new team creates a complete solution that includes hardware software and services similar to apple
1165184 while the iphone is a great phone its real value comes from its software applications and services
1165185 although creating slick phones is one part of the success equation apples success will force even traditional handset makers to think harder about the software and services angle if they are to really compete with apple head on
1165186 theres a tremendous opportunity here to take this business to the next level
1165187 maar als er folders met leugens in brievenbussen worden gestopt zijn grenzen ernstig overschreden dit is een beschadiging in mijn persoonlijke levenssfeer
1165188 wel probeer ik iets te betekenen voor pedofielen als je dat doet zijn er altijd mensen die het daar niet mee eens zijn dat mag maar het is vervelend als dan leugens een wapen worden met de pnvd heb ik niets ik was zelfs tegen de oprichting ervan
1165189 it is a pleasure to welcome the new staff into the district theyve joined the police to make the community safer and their enthusiasm training and personal life experiences will enable them to do just that
1165190 alpas communications are essentially a guide describing how to use sick leave inappropriately
1165191 despite these significant steps unlawful job actions escalated intimidation of pilots continued and the impact on our customers and other employees grew to truly unacceptable levels
1165192 fit to fly and if they dont believe you you will be required to visit a doctor and pay for it out of your own pocket since our company will not reimburse you oh and we understand from reliable sources that the company plans on taking away pass travel while you re on sick list and this time around your family too hows your summer going in a blatant attempt to erode if not eliminate captain s authority first officers are soon to replace captain s as fodms as you are aware fodms have the ability to order captains to fly even though many first officers have the experience and capability united will be breeding an environment where there will be first officers ordering captains to fly questioning captains decisions and placing captains in defensive positions how s your summer going with the expected shift in flying many domiciles will temporarily pick up other domiciles flying this will result in many w patterns flying 6 day trips with 4 oceanic crossings when the flying becomes aligned with the domiciles your reward for having worked your keisters off will be more surpluses reread the first bullet point how s your summer going to summarize united s managers will force pilots to work extra days with longer hours they will bully pilots to prove their non fitness to fly at their own expense they will attempt to take away pass travel for you and your family they will attempt to diminish captain s authority they will take away united mainline flying and give it away to express and then they will either furlough you or surplus you at the end of the season no one will be unaffected by the continually bad decisions united makes every day fatigue stress illness exhaustion anger fear depression resentment uncertainty frustration and disrespect are all being crammed down our throats by a company that gives not a damn about goodwill morale its employees or its customers so how s your summer going leverage does not just show up unannounced on one s doorstep unified pilots create leverage unity of purpose brings power there is power in unity

1165197 pressuring pilots to reduce fuel levels for your flight in order to save money
1165198 we ask that you remember this although we consider us airways to have embarked on a program of intimidation to pressure your captain to reduce fuel loads us airways captains are committed to maintaining their right to exercise their
1165199 unions attempt to bring safety into question when it is clear based on the data collected that this was a deliberate attempt by the pilots in question to carry and burn more fuel in an effort to influence the company to acquiesce to their contractual wishes as a one time executive vice president of the air line pilots association i have seen and participated in my fair share of labor disputes but i have never witnessed nor would i condone using a bogus safety issue to apply leverage to a company

1165210 previous findings have shown that fish and fish oil can help prevent stroke but this is one of the only studies that looks at fishs effect on silent brain infarcts in healthy older people

1165286 nu se mai accepta acoperis din azbociment ci din tabla care sa imite tigla nici la tara nu se mai foloseste acest material problema este ca sint multe construite ilegal noi am vrea ca la acoperisuri sa fie folosite culorile verde inchis sau caramiziu constructiile vor trebui sa faca parte integranta din zona in care sint construite

1165338 la chiamata a bonnie view non port a nulla era unanziana donna che pensava di aver visto un uomo che cercava di scassinare una porta di casa tippit scese ascolt la storia cerc gente in quella casa senza trovarla e torn in auto per scrivere un rapporto poi chiam la centrale per essere mandato altrove
1165339 nel 1978 ho intervistato il commesso di una drogheria che stava al 4121 di bonnie view mi disse che verso lora di pranzo del 22 novembre 1963 vide una donna che stava rubando nel negozio e chiam la polizia e tippit rispose alla chiamata il commesso mi disse che tippit port in auto la donna e se ne and quindi tippit era davvero l alle 12 e 17 ma strano che di questo fatto non si parli nelle trascrizioni della polizia
1165340 cera stata la sparatoria che aveva coinvolto il presidente kennedy e noi avvertimmo subito tutte le unit disponibili di andare verso il sottopassaggio a tre corsie della dealey plaza da dove ci dissero che erano partiti i colpi
1165341 attenzione tutte le squadre nellarea del centro citt codice 3 luci rosse e sirena verso la elm street e la dealey plaza con cautela
1165342 scoperto cinque testimoni che sanno cosa fece tippit negli ultimi minuti della sua vita
1165343 cosa pu aver visto o sentito tippit di cos importante per rimettersi in auto e andarsene ad alta velocit sappiamo che il tassista william whaley port oswald sul viadotto houston passando accanto alla stazione gloco possibile che tippit lo abbia visto riconosciuto e che per qualche motivo si sia lanciato al suo inseguimento
1165344 se qualcuno fuori zona e tu lo chiami e gli chiedi dove si trova o non risponde o ti dicono un altro posto
1165345 olsen disse che il giorno dellassassinio stava facendo la guardia a una vecchia casa cadente a oak cliff stando al suo interno disse che un procuratore lo aveva pagato per sorvegliare la propriet di un uomo morto da poco che ud le sirene della polizia ma non vide nulla perch era in casa
1165346 se vuoi saperne di pi sulla sua morte indaga su una rissa avvenuta qualche minuto prima che gli sparassero tra la dodicesima e la marsalis
1165347 ero alla cassa al top ten records al 338 della west jefferson un poliziotto tippit parcheggi sulla bishop street verso nord e entr nel negozio di corsa chiedendomi se potevo usare il telefono ricordo che tippit era cos agitato che disse alla gente nel negozio di farsi da parte tippit chiam ma non parl si vede che nessuno gli rispose stette a lungo ad aspettare per un po direi sette o otto squilli poi riagganci e usc agitato e di corsa attravers di nuovo la strada sal in auto e part verso la sunset senza fermarsi allo stop e gir a destra nella sunset dopo non pi di 10 minuti sentii alla radio che gli avevano sparato
1165348 in un giorno cos agitato e importante tippit avrebbe avuto tutti i motivi di stare appiccicato alla radio se avesse avuto qualcosa di personale cui badare sarebbe entrato nel negozio di corsa senza avvisare che sarebbe uscito dallauto per affari suoi altrimenti ne avrebbe dovuto rispondere
1165349 siccome ti interessi al caso tippit lasci che le dica una cosa che mi capit
1165350 388 stava parlando col centralinista a quellora la trasmissione 390a a pagina 31 dellarch kimbroughs channel 1 transcript riporta quello che stato interpretato come un
1165351 la mia ragazza mi ha detto qualcosa che potrebbe essere utile nel caso tippit stava guidando verso est sulla decima dietro a unauto della polizia a una certa distanza lagente pigi sul freno allimprovviso e lei fren pure ma non pot evitare di toccare lauto della polizia lei pensava che lagente sarebbe uscito e lavrebbe messa nei guai invece non la consider nemmeno super la macchina della polizia e se ne and e pi tardi ricord che avvenne proprio dove trovarono lauto di tippit quando tippit fu ucciso e cap che aveva colpito lauto di tippit
1165352 star fuori per un minuto al 4100 di block bonnie view
1165353 irwin ho filmato tutto ho visto la sua testa esplodere
1165354 cera un riverbero troppo forte leco faceva sentire i colpi come se arrivassero da tutte le direzioni
1165355 life is just a fairytale with bad endings that happen over and over again no one knows for sure what happens when we die in todays world personal politics dont amount to anything it doesnt matter what you think nobody else really cares
1165356 thats what i mean nobody knows for sure unless they go there ya know
1165357 its all top secret you know if theres something in there your not gonna find out about it and if you do youll be dead before long
1165358 do not forget the spirit and humility of a beginner
1165359 doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills
1165360 have you seen the new commercial the mccain campaign compares barack obama to britney spears and paris hilton
1165361 and today the obama campaign released an ad comparing john mccain to zsa zsa gabor and bea arthur
1165362 senses a chink in obamas armor following the democrats european tour which did not appear to give obama a noticeable bounce in the polls despite drawing a crowd of 200 000 in berlin
1165363 it is a strategy that carries some risks with americans weary of partisan sniping
1165364 beyond this one ad other overriding concerns im hearing is that mccain has perhaps gone too negative and its taking away from his above the fray campaign that he has said that he wants to run
1165365 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck
1165366 remarks put mr obamas campaign in a delicate position his campaign gingerly tried to tamp down the issue saying he did not believe that mr mccain had tried to use race as an issue
1165367 was the latest spike in a contest thats grown increasingly negative despite pledges by both obama and mccain to run aboveboard campaigns
1165368 as both maneuver for advantage and polls show the race competitive three months before the election
1165369 were going back almost 10 million years before any previously described asian anthropoid
1165370 the new fossils from india are exciting because they show that the anthropoid lineage is much more ancient than we realized
1165371 most of the fossil record of ancient primates is made up of teeth because teeth are easy to preserve and hard
1165372 occasionally we get lucky enough to have a skull to work with but in this case a few teeth is all we have
1165373 from the tooth size and structure we can say something about the animals body weight and diet because teeth have crests that are differentially developed depending on whether they ate primarily insects leaves or fruit
1165374 we have suspected for a long time that these virulence proteins had some way of slipping inside plant cells to suppress immunity our findings finally nail down that mechanism and enable us to focus on how to block the entry mechanism
1165375 the finding that virulence proteins from oomycetes and the malaria parasite plasmodium use the same entry mechanism means that we may be able to use the same or similar drugs to block infection by both groups of pathogens this type of approach may also be relevant to other groups of pathogens such as fungi which we also suspect of slipping virulence proteins into host cells
1165376 the double barreled gene gun enabled us to make much more accurate measurements of the avr1b protein than were previously possible which made it practicable to measure the action of the rxlr and deer motifs

1165379 citeva studii dedicate expresiei sentimentale in literatura europeana din evul mediu si pina la epoca barocului lirica si epica incepind cu hispanicele jarchyas si continuind cu chanson de roland si cantar del mio cid spre a se opri pentru moment la giambattista marino
1165380 speranta ca mai devreme sau mai tirziu spiritul universitar sanatos asa cum era el inteles pe vremea sa zicem fara a zimbi a lui ab lard va renaste de sub molozul sub care se caznesc a l ingropa intr o intristatoare continuitate avind in vedere cu larghete intreaga scena planetara deceniile de ideologii si practicile veninoase ale aciuatilor nevrednici
1165381 este o competitie importanta la care nici o alta formatie din romania nu s a mai inscris in ultimii 15 ani din cauza costurilor destul de mari importanta va fi forma de moment a jucatoarelor insa apreciez ca avem sanse sa terminam intre primele zece locuri ar fi onorabil pentru noi sa reusim acest lucru
1165382 asa gindisem initial insa regulamentul nu permite decit prezenta unor sahiste care au jucat macar doua partide in competitii oficiale pentru noi
1165383 clubul la care au activat pina acum contor zener arad s a desfiintat sint libere de contract si ne am inteles cu ele sa joace acum pentru noi in cupa campionilor si eventual de anul viitor in superliga
1165384 ni s a oferit sansa sa fentam o treapta insa n am vrut sa fortam nota si sa ni se reproseze ulterior acest lucru mergem pe cursul normal al lucrurilor
1165385 physicians should use esas with caution based on the international guidelines for esa administration in cancer and on certain prognostic indicators to guide their use physicians need to identify the appropriate group of cancer patients who will benefit from esa administration while avoiding possible detrimental effects
1165386 when the military says robot they mean everything from self driving trucks up to what you would conventionally think of as a robot you would more accurately call them autonomous systems rather than robots
1165387 its a chain of command thing you dont want to give autonomy to a weapons delivery system you want to have a human hit the button
1165388 you dont want the robot to make the wrong decision you want to have a human to make all of the important decisions
1165389 its oftentimes like the difference between the adverb and noun you can act intelligently or you can be intelligent im much more interested in the adverb for my robots
1165390 when i envision the future of robots i always think of the jetsons
1165391 george jetson never sat down at a computer to task rosie to clean the house somehow they had this local exchange of information so what weve been working on is how we can use the local environment rather than a computer as a tasking medium to the robot
1165392 we forget that when were controlling robots in the lab its really pretty safe and no ones trying to kill us
1165393 but if you are in a war zone and youre hunched over a laptop thats not a good place to be you want to be able to use your eyes in one place and use your hand to control the robot without tying up all of your attention
1165394 when i stood there and looked at that packbot i realized that if that robot hadnt been there it would have been some kid
1165395 our integration of arrays of nanowires that perform separate functions and are made of heterogeneous substances and doing this in a way that can be reproduced on a large scale in a controlled way is a first
1165396 our main objective is a route toward integrated nanowire arrays that we can produce on any substrate even paper and to reproduce them uniformly on a large scale
1165397 to do that over the past two years our group has developed methods of printing nanowire arrays after first growing the nanowires on a donor substrate we transfer them to any desired substrate including paper or plastic
1165398 nanowires grow sticking out in random directions they look like a bad hair day
1165399 is like combing the hair to make it stand up straight
1165400 to fabricate the integrated circuitry we had to position the two kinds of materials at precise locations on the receiver substrate
1165401 the pattern for the device was on a photoresist layer coated on the substrate first we printed the cadmium selenide nanowires onto the substrate then removed the photoresist with acetone leaving the cadmium selenide nanowires exactly where we wanted them we repeated the process for the germanium silicon nanowires
1165402 in the future we can foresee using a variety of different optical sensors to create nanoscale devices sensitive to multiple colors in high resolution
1165403 and thats just the beginning we contemplate printing nanowire sensor circuitry photosensors chemical sensors biosensors not on silicon but on paper or plastic tape this could be used easily and with instant results where spills have occurred or to test air quality or to test for disease organisms almost any use for a sensor that you can imagine
1165404 sa joc la real madrid este un vis pentru mine iar daca cele doua cluburi vor ajunge la un acord in privinta transferului meu atunci voi fi un om fericit
1165405 eu sint de acord dar nu sint sigur pina nu semnez ar fi bine sa joc alaturi de chivu as fi onorat dar pina nu dau eu cu pixul nu sint sigur mourinho este un super antrenor si nu ma asteptam sa ma doreasca era unul dintre ultimii de la care m as fi asteptat sa ma antreneze chiar daca e vorba doar de un imprumut inter e o echipa prea mare ca sa o refuzi ar fi un pas urias pentru cariera mea cred ca 15 milioane e o suma prea mare pentru romania indiferent pe ce post joci sau ce virsta ai
1165406 plec cu inima impacata iar cind va expira imprumutul voi veni sa imi iau medalia de campion sint parca de o viata la steaua de opt ani
1165407 unul dintre lucrurile care imi va lipsi cel mai mult va fi atmosfera din giulesti
1165408 o sa vina cineva sa il vada pe radoi in meciul cu poli iasi nu este adevarat ca pleaca marti sau miercuri in italia sa semneze oricum daca nu pleaca pina la meciul cu galatasaray nu mai pleaca deloc pntru ca nu mai poate sa joace la ei in liga campionilor eu nu sint interesat si nu imi doresc sa se faca transferul dar daca ei vor sa semneze in conditiile astea eu o sa accept pentru el e bine din punct de vedere finnaciar si pentru mirel pentru ca va lua doua milioane de euro salariu dar si pentru mine pentru ca as lua15 milioane
1165409 spre exemplu comitetul international olimpic aplica nu numai sanctiunile deja cunoscute pentru asemenea cazuri dar si o amenda de o suta de mii de euro celor depistati pozitiv de ce oare nu am incerca si noi aplicarea unei sanctiuni pecuniare usturatoare nu numai la nivelul performerului dar si la cel al antrenorului si personalului asistent al sportivului in alte tari consumul de substante dopante si difuzarea acestora se pedepseste cu inchisoarea iar se stie bine politia nu a ezitat cum s a intimplat in italia sau franta sa intervina fara menajamente
1165410 mutu a semnat noul contract in aceasta dimineata dar acordul va fi oficializat abia joi cand va semna si clubul noul contract il va lega pe mutu de fiorentina pana la finalul anului 2012 si include o marire de salariu de aproximativ 200 000 de euro
1165411 doi in unu a inceput meciul pe dreapta fara sa se aventureze dar nu le a lasat nici o sansa italienilor apoi a facut un cuplu in axul central cu rolando sapunaru a fost pur si simplu perfect
1165412 transferul este foarte aproape de a se realiza in proportie de 90 el este jucatorul nostru

1165422 sanjays leadership has been instrumental in growing qualcomm into the no 1 wireless semiconductor supplier
1165423 it takes two to three years to field a new platform and in the best case motorolas been at it for 18 months
1165424 even then there is no guarantee the new platform would be compelling so the pace of recovery will remain the same
1165425 my perspective is always going to be launching products quickly and effectively
1165426 we are hard pressed to imagine a better candidate than dr jha and believe that his appointment is a significant positive catalyst for motorolas shares
1165427 you know home just tugs at you while your away yet when you get back it just seems the same somehow

1165453 your wow score would be just one factor that will go into your blizzard level and rather than call it a score we just wanted it to be like youre leveling up on blizzard games youll have this blizzard identity and youll be able to see things like oh this guy was great at diablo iii but he never played starcraft and he was mediocre in wow that sort of thing

1165473 i was just watching ken machas new conference before game 1 and he said that harden is now officially the game 3 starter he said that they specifically limited his pitch count yesterday so that he could go again on friday in detroit he said that it was tough to push back haren who has been great but that harden was the man for now
1165474 rich harden might not have helped himself with a somewhat shaky outing in an instructional league game in phoenix on monday
1165475 he looked like rich harden assistant general manager david forst said of the report hed received
1165476 come tuesday you have to vote for the best person and thats carolyn cheeks kilpatrick
1165477 and his mothers vigorous defense of him as reasons for voters to pick a new congresswoman and polls have shown that the messages have worked with cheeks kilpatrick hanging onto a slim lead
1165478 over the years many statements have been falsely attributed to me but this is the first year a whole column has been made up and circulated in a chain letter on the internet claiming that i wrote it
1165479 letters phone calls and e mails from readers around the country have asked me if i wrote a column saying that barack obama is not an american citizen the answer is no
1165480 many of my readers have been savvy enough to tell that the style of the phony column is not mine but checked with me just to be sure
1165481 what is puzzling about all this is that some people would take seriously a chain letter on the internet saying what some columnist any columnist is supposed to have said and would pass that on without knowing whether it was true or false
1165482 nothing is easier than to check someones column as it appears officially on the internet among the places where my columns can be checked on the internet are the archives on my own web site www tsowell com
1165483 it is also puzzling why some people find it necessary to make up false statements and attribute those statements to someone else
1165484 if they think that the person they oppose is wrong and why else would they oppose him
1165485 we hope to see elected legislators of both parties who are in favor of low income parents having the power to choose the best school for their kids thats why we exist
1165486 the only issue we care about is k 12 education reform primarily through parental choice
1165487 everything from television and radio and print and all that to organizing volunteers to go door to door
1165488 participating in every aspect of political campaigns and that includes fundraising
1165489 we want to be in a place where candidates understand that they cant ignore latinos
1165490 i dont see age as a big factor because there are so many other things that are big factors
1165491 i think age plays a factor because of the physical wear and mental wear
1165492 this is a pressure job and i think age will play a part in the decisions
1165493 is in some ways a reflection of the countrys lack of interest in continuing the boomer political debate that has gone on between the two boomer presidents clinton and bush
1165494 its that whole culture war gridlock that type of politics that this country is really tired of
1165495 what voters have managed to choose are the two candidates least likely to continue that kind of politics
1165496 i think in 2008 you will find more and more younger people involved in the political arena
1165497 i think that means more people will relate to obama he is not as experienced as mccain but the things he has accomplished should not be overlooked
1165498 are people looking for a change or someone with experience who has been there before
1165499 obama is trying to explain to us that his experience is multilevel as far as european vs american vs war issues but i wish we had more economic strength coming from him
1165500 i grew up in st petersburg just up the coast
1165501 i know how valuable and precious our beaches are and how important tourism is to the sunshine state
1165502 far enough safe enough and clean enough even for a state like florida
1165503 im the one with the personal and professional experience to make that happen
1165504 i learned how to cut through bureaucracy and i learned to do more with less
1165505 my opponents are square guys but people are tired of politicians doing a round robin
1165506 weve had four more years of bad economic policies that have run the economy into a very bad place
1165507 he made me feel better that theres the possibility that business as usual will stop
1165508 the way you win florida is you do what hes doing
1165509 inevitably theres going to be some changes made its not like we have to start from scratch
1165510 has no knowledge at all of the public defenders office
1165511 elect ron filipkowski for public defender end the revolving door system
1165512 i believe party unity calls for the delegates from florida and michigan to be able to participate fully alongside the delegates from the other states and territories
1165513 today is a proud day for all of us who fought so hard to ensure floridians votes are fully counted
1165514 his commitment to uniting the party and ending the uncertainty surrounding the process
1165515 as always our goal is to ensure a fair process and a unified democratic party so that we can win in november
1165516 as we prepare to come together in denver however we must be and will be united in our determination to change the course of our nation
1165517 this is the first time in my life that i have felt i am actually doing something about what the democrats have done in the past and are doing now to black people
1165518 if the democrats had left us alone after the republicans freed us from slavery we wouldnt be having this discussion today they are keeping blacks in virtual slavery
1165519 obviously we werent consulted before she decided to do any of this
1165520 its a fruitless debate and it may conjure up more ill will toward the party we should be spending money on debating the democrats on the issues
1165521 look beyond barack obamas skin color and soaring rhetoric and see an arrogant elitist millionaire
1165522 mrs rice has some very strong views on certain issues
1165523 it showed us that before we donate to anything regardless of how it appears the party needs to ensure it takes a look at all the content
1165524 i imagine were going to be the most visited booth at the convention and theres going to be blood on the floor
1165525 im looking forward to it i tell you i am having so much fun i feel that for the first time in my life im actually making a difference in whats happening in the political arena
1165526 bill clinton says barack obama must kiss my ass for his support
1165527 we wanted to carry that out and see what we could make happen if we initiated a national organization
1165528 we would tell her you cant go around bashing the democratic party and then expect them to come to our side in droves
1165529 she would take the approach well youre not a real republican then
1165530 i spent a few thousand and garnered half a million in free coverage by my estimate
1165531 there are grounds to be concerned and i think theres enough reasons why the irs should be concerned
1165532 their name alone and what they appear to be promoting also the link to the mccain campaign on their web site all appears to be problematic you cant get more inconsistent with exempt status than that
1165533 they have been convinced wrongly the republican party is a racist party
1165534 black voters feel they have no choice because they dont want to vote for the party of the ku klux klan
1165535 hundreds of thousands of little people all around the country giving 5 or 10
1165536 if she had bought into a socialist policy of government handouts wed still be poor there
1165537 it takes a lot of talent energy time dedication and willingness to be trashed by the mainstream media in order to do this
1165538 nbra seemed to be in clear violation of the law
1165539 a black republican willing to say things white republicans cannot
1165540 everyone who knows mlk jr says he was never a republican and never voted or supported republican candidates
1165541 doesnt she just shut up shes doing far more harm than good
1165542 i think the african american turnout as well as the hispanic turnout is critical in that race
1165543 today we stand at a defining moment in our history
1165544 his mccains only proposal seems to be recycling that tired rhetoric about vouchers
1165545 i think theyre going to have to have a very intimate plan of getting people into the voting booth education efforts as well as transportation
1165546 adopta legile pe care le considera necesare pentru a reglementa folosinta bunurilor conform interesului general
1165547 necesare si obisnuite in domeniul constructiilor care in societatile moderne sint o preocupare centrala a politicilor economice si sociale pentru a implementa astfel de politici legislativul trebuie sa aiba o larga marja de apreciere atit in ceea ce priveste stabilirea existentei unei probleme de interes public ce necesita masuri de control cit si in alegerea unor modalitati de aplicare detaliate pentru implementarea masurilor vizate

1165552 hi all two days ago my friends and i started putting together the following system cpu q9450 motherboad p5n72 t premium memory corsair xms2 dominator twin 4gb samsung 2253 lw psu antec neopower 650 650w atx12v 120mm led fan 80plus rohs anyways during installation everything went smooth we installed win xp 64 bit w o a hitch and installed mobo and basic hardware drivers no problem at my friends house i used the latest guru 3d driver for the graphics card http en wikipedia org wiki graphics processing unit 177 79 but other then that the drivers were all just standard from the cd that came with the hardware we ran3dmark06 on it no problems again went very smoothly then i took it back to my place and yesterday morning started to do some more work on it starting with windows sp2 for the 64 bit system still no problems after that i started to install some basic programs such as the following pc probe ii amp ai suite both programs came with the motherboard speedfan kaspersky antivirus also came with mobo geoforms during this time i had maybe 1 freeze freeze being the kind that requires a whole new startup not just program close i should also not that the only modifications i made to any of the hardware was that i used rivatuner to turn the fanspeed on the gx2 to 100 i ran 3dmark about 3 more times during this initial period and had no problems the temps of the cpu mobo and gpu were about 35 38 and 65 during this time anyways as the day went on and i started installing more programs firefox 3 0 windows messenger http en wikipedia org wiki windows messenger adobe acrobat reader etc still no games just basic things i started to note more and more freezing and the freezing didnt seem to have any correlation to any activity sometimes i would get freezing right when windows loaded up or when i opened a webpage sometimes when i would start to run graphs of the core temperatures b c i wanted to see them underload on geoforms pretty much random freezing i thought at first maybe it was b c of the kapersky av since it seemed like crashes became more frequent after i installed that so i tried disabling it but no still got random crashes by the end of the day it got so that the comp could not go 30 minutes without freezing regardless of whether i just turned it on and left it or if i started to do something on it like run geoshaders it would always freeze so this morning i decided i should just rollback to before i had even installed sp2 since prior to that the comp showed absolutely no problems whatsoever and just try installing progams one at a time and then run a 20 min stress test http en wikipedia org wiki stress test with geoshaders to make sure there was no freezing before going on to the next thing so i used the rollback i had made just before installing sp2 the system went through closing windows and then did the system restore and rebooted now however as the system loads i get the windows xp x64 bit screen with the loading bar at the bottom but after that fads it just goes to a black screen for about 10 seconds then a blue screen with words flashes for an instant impossible to read what it says and then the computer restarts it did this cycle 4 times in a row before i turned the comp off manually then turned back on again still the same restart before i get into windows i dont know if this problem is related to the freezing or what but now i cant even get into windows if you have any advice to give as to how i can get into windows or if you think you know whats going on with the freezing please let me know i am not very computer savy my friends who built the comp with me know a lot more then me but unfortunately they are at work until 5 oclock today so in the mena time im hoping someone on these boards can help me fix it thanks for your time
1165553 we have the organizational ability and the financial ability to compete there
1165554 some of the old givens are no longer true its not how it was 20 years ago or even 10 years ago
1165555 i look for jewelry he looks for coins otherwise wed bid against each other
1165556 we thought itd be something to do for the weekend
1165557 my husband wanted to check out the sports memorabilia just to see what they had and of course i love the jewelry
1165558 we will hit those points in a few years and that will help in many ways
1165559 we just have to survive through this part of the cycle
1165560 it is not to barack obamas advantage to make this a big issue
1165561 it is simply not acceptable to the majority of people including many of those who may be sympathetic
1165562 nobody really thinks that bush or mccain have a real answer for the challenges we face
1165563 he doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollars
1165564 barack obama has played the race card from the bottom of the deck
1165565 race plays a role in american politics in a lot of different ways
1165566 when a large number of african americans decide to support barack obama on the assumption hed be a better vehicle for pursuing their interests thats taking race into consideration
1165567 one of obamas big problems is that hes black and he does have a funny name
1165568 we must be and will be united in our determination to change the course of our nation
1165569 to that end democrats in florida and michigan must know that they are full partners and colleagues in our historic mission to reshape washington and lead our country in a new direction
1165570 sen obama and the democratic party are trying to put humpty dumpty back together again
1165571 and just as in the fairy tale you cant put something together after its broken in so many pieces
1165572 today is a proud day for all of us who fought so hard to ensure floridians votes are fully counted
1165573 an enormous amount of work has been done and florida is in play in a very serious way
1165574 the amendments language isnt clear in some areas and creates uncertainty and multiple options
1165575 but we think thats going to be a pretty significant number because this is directly putting money in peoples pockets
1165576 when the states leading economists cant even figure out the impact its telling
1165577 in these uncertain times we dont need to add another uncertain element to the mix
1165578 we get at least two people a week who have lost their homes to foreclosure
1165579 their credit is obviously not the best but under the circumstances we are willing to turn a blind eye
1165580 were finding a lot of people have been forced to move out of homes due to foreclosure or because the investors that owned their homes are being foreclosed on
1165581 what used to rent for 1 000 is now 800
1165582 what used to rent for 850 is now in the low 700s
1165583 renters are trying to get deals and some owners are offering incentives to rent properties
1165584 i had one owner offer a 500 bonus to a realtor who could get someone moved in by aug 1
1165585 ive got a place in englewood a working class duplex and im not getting any calls at 650
1165586 ive got others who are getting older and cant continue to make payments because of their health
1165587 they dont have as much ability to pay as the people who are leaving
1165588 many dont have the full deposit or last months rent
1165589 every time i go in the office someone is moving out because they cant find work
1165590 i would say i lose about four people a week and replace them with three or four others but im still turning down about 75 percent of callers down because they dont have a good background
1165591 we were more than 95 percent full in the boom and now were down to 65 percent
1165592 people in construction and related fields arent here any more
1165593 there are a lot of single mothers and they just dont have the money
1165594 the way i see us coming out of this is by focusing on something that is not construction related
1165595 the only way to change things in tallahassee is to bring in someone whos out of the loop
1165596 if you want to lower rates you have to reduce the liability of both the insurance companies and the residents
1165597 if theyre going to insure in florida they shouldnt be able to cherry pick
1165598 we havent had any major disasters so why havent our rates gone down
1165599 i would hope theyd be wiling to trust in their future
1165600 when i see someone who is injured or in a nursing home setting i can empathize with them
1165601 but to begin again to prepare sanctions resolutions for the u n security council
1165602 but this is different its our own infrastructure i am asking the department to voluntarily close the loophole and let the agency review this
1165603 i enjoy warm weather and i want to be close to the beach
1165604 the social and professional opportunities in fort lauderdale are huge the real estate prices kept dropping and dropping it made it easier for me to afford
1165605 the first of the baby boomers are just barely over 60 now so over the next 10 or 15 years youll see a real increase in that group
1165606 lower housing prices could have some impact because historically florida has been a relatively low cost place to live but that has been going up in recent years
1165607 florida is going to face a very different racial and cultural gap as the older boomers age and the younger immigrants come with competing demands on public services
1165608 a lot of baby boomers will expect social services to be there for them and that wont be the case because funding hasnt kept pace with the need or demand
1165609 floridas destiny and its demographics are on a definite collision course unless we have the fortitude to invest in those essential services that will sustain a growing older population
1165610 these baby boomers are thinking more about coming here and theyre realizing now is the time
1165611 the prices are so much lower right now we got our house for 100 000 less than what is was going for a year ago
1165612 i think people got run out of town by the high prices and now that prices and rents are coming down well see more people
1165613 im just waiting for the house thats a good bang for the buck that i can make an offer on
1165614 with the economy the way it is i will probably have to work so id prefer to be in a place where i can play golf and enjoy the warm weather
1165615 tercer puente sobre el orinoco una de las grandes obras de la independencia
1165616 that show was the first thing to make me proud to be a wrestling fan in a long time
1165617 i am yet to watch a single wwe show where punk is treated like a top guy
1165618 raw was not just bad it was a i cant believe this made it on air type of bad
1165619 todd grisham did fine as play by play and tazz seemed to enjoy working with him
1165620 factually incorrect in a number of areas and thus is defamatory
1165621 det f rekommer mycket tvivelaktiga transaktioner fr n 2006 och fram t som tyder p att f retr darna genom mycket stora otill tna uttag f rs mrat bolagets betalningsf rm ga och d rmed f rorsakat bolagets borgen rer avsev rd skada
1165622 its a sluggish economy and its difficulties are felt all over
1165623 that does suggest those folks are important for the spending outlook and the overall economic outlook
1165624 consumer spending makes up 70 percent of gross domestic product and when one group accounts for a very substantial share of consumer spending they also account for a large share of the economic activity that creates jobs
1165625 a lot of our clients stop by a deli on the way to the airport rather than have a catered meal on the plane
1165626 and after we finished i thought it was unfair i point the finger at the democrats prior to 1992 and at the republicans now its motivated by self interest they just cut out these districts for the incumbents
1165627 it always struck me that if you parked at the orlando magic game you were crossing two congressional districts ours and corrine browns
1165628 someone 50 years old in the system might be like someone 60 outside
1165629 they tend as a group to have smoked more to have used drugs more and to have generally lived higher risk lifestyles
1165630 all this get tough on crime stuff has been building for years
1165631 but at his age there are more health concerns as well as the worry that he will be easy prey for other younger healthier inmates taken advantage of for cigarettes food or the other usual prison currencies
1165632 if youre not spending your money finding and developing new oil then theres no new oil
1165633 its not like theyre going to the board and saying well i can do one or the other or the other the balance sheets are flush with cash
1165634 theres only so much money you can throw at it without being ridiculous
1165635 when you look at the spending thats going on the companies are bringing on a lot of long term discoveries
1165636 could we do it effectively in a way that provides ultimate value to our shareholders probably not
1165637 you have criteria and you have to meet that to be a good investment for the shareholder and then if youve got cash thats left over youre going to return it to the shareholder because its theirs
1165638 the good thing about florida is schools are funded in exactly the same fashion in the state so we are all in the same boat
1165639 but each county has different sets of circumstances and none of us have enough money
1165640 some insurers can make a decision in the same day or right on the spot
1165641 as health care moves into the digital age there are more and more companies holding vast amounts of patients health information
1165642 most people dont even know these organizations exist unfortunately the federal health privacy rule does not cover many of them the lack of transparency with how all of this works is disturbing
1165643 we are not effectively reaching men who have sex with men and african americans to lower their risk
1165644 c d c s new incidence estimates reveal that the h i v epidemic is and has been worse than previously known
1165645 therefore there are roughly 225 000 more people living with h i v in the u s than previously suspected
1165646 the previous estimate was 1 million to 1 1 million
1165647 u s efforts to prevent h i v have failed dismally
1165648 this paper has been scrutinized by some of the best statisticians in the country and is much better now than when we started this process it was so complicated that even i who has some expertise in this area could not stand by it without making sure we had gone through the review process
1165649 this is one of those examples where getting the external review process to really scrutinize the paper pick it apart build it back up has in my opinion fundamentally improved it
1165650 h i v prevention has been underfunded and too often hindered by politics and ideology
1165651 since fiscal year 2002 when adjusted for inflation c d c s prevention budget has actually shrunk by 19 percent the president has recently requested decreases in funding for h i v prevention at c d c
1165652 less and less money to actually get these programs to the communities that need them
1165653 it looks like prevention campaigns make even less difference than anyone thought
1165654 h i v incidence did not decline as much from the 1980s to the 1990s as we believed
1165655 despite the dramatic increase in condom promotion and so called prevention education
1165656 if there is any good news here it is hard to report it but there is a little bit in the sense that while incidence rates are certainly too high they are stable that is important because a stable number of new infections in a world that has got more and more people with h i v and people with aids living in it suggests that we are keeping up with that pressure for transmission
1165657 replacing our old recycled pillows and blankets with this state of the art high quality take home kit is an eco conscious health conscious and customer conscious decision
1165658 in no way do i think john mccains campaign was being racist
1165659 there is something deeply wrong and elitist about wanting only a purebred dog
1165660 this is an effort to amend the constitution by ambush
1165661 this is not the proper way to deal with our founding document
1165662 reverses legal precedent prohibiting public funding of private school alternatives
1165663 we thought they were both policy issues that had to do with education spending
1165664 uniform efficient safe secure and high quality system of free public schools
1165665 spoken loud and clearly about the value of free public education in the state
1165666 the words we used were carefully considered and selected to create a system that the legislators knew if adopted by the people that it free public schools was the highest duty
1165667 this amendment 9 could potentially damage our public education system in dramatic ways we barely have enough money for it now
1165668 all i want is for our education system to be adaptable to each child
1165669 this ensures the legislature can make new programs that meet every childs need
1165670 i had called him after he had won the nomination
1165671 substantially impair the branchs ability to perform its constitutional functions
1165672 the seven additional cuts is on top of the nine positions we lost last year
1165673 this is based on caseload but the likelihood of this happening is slim to none
1165674 we dont like it but thats just the way the math works
1165675 its ironic that at a time when our business is booming our revenue is being cut
1165676 we have had every agency in the executive and legislative branches searching for solutions and im not seeing that in the judiciary
1165677 there is no other agency that im aware of that has had the luxury and the opportunity to hide behind the constitution to protect the status quo
1165678 there are dozens of fortune 500 companies that offer it its not a new thing
1165679 three of us said we want to do it now
1165680 fairness to the taxpayers who will pay these extra bills many of whom do not enjoy the same benefits
1165681 the problem of childhood obesity is reaching epidemic levels and florida is no exception
1165682 we have received a number of requests from families and physicians regarding lifestyle interventions for children who are overweight or obese
1165683 we believe that future legislators given the clear facts will not want to force guns into workplaces against the owners desires
1165684 a huge win for the people this bill is about protecting the sanctity of every working man and womans fundamental right to self defense
1165685 fraught with danger because the media covers them so aggressively and theres nothing going on
1165686 they always sound great in the conference room but its where the sandals meet the sand the execution is always very difficult
1165687 basically he was going and dedicating new tollbooths on the mass turnpike which hardly looked presidential
1165688 there are two ways vacations can mess you up number one choice of location and number two of course is what you do when you get there
1165689 he became a symbol of a simpler seemingly more virtuous america
1165690 takes as much risk sneering at baseball baby mother the flag the home or the dog
1165691 bush woke up this morning saw his shadow and six more weeks of vacation
1165692 i think thats actually a good life rule in general
1165693 if you want to keep asking me over and over again youre welcome to
1165694 now with each bus trip everyones filing a blog report every little thing is picked up and off it goes
1165695 hed love to be back on the bus driving around with eight or 10 of you and just riffing in new hampshire if hed say something that wasnt artfully phrased there was more of a flow he could revise something or say lets talk about baseball hed get a pass but in the age of blogs theres always someone who makes a big deal out of it
1165696 we have to find a balance he won the primary essentially on a bus with the press hes intensely loyal to the back and forth with the press its who he is it will always be part of our mix
1165697 both our new streammygame ps3 player and the bluetooth tool install automatically just download and double click
1165698 in addition to streaming games from your local pc the new player enables games to be streamed from remote pcs or pc servers housed in isp exchanges
1165699 the new player works with yellow dog linux version 6 which is now really easy to install and recommended by sony
1165700 we have included full details on our website of where to download ydl6 how to record it to dvd and how to install it
1165701 my wife and i decided we did not want our residency to be a distraction for the very important issues that are affecting these communities all around here
1165702 the law says you can live either in your district or outside the district
1165703 i think more particularly the question is do the people in south florida he represents feel like hes done a good job
1165704 but the change has to be acceptable john kerry has to prove he is acceptable
1165705 i did everything i could to get bush elected and re elected
1165706 no no i the fact is that im different but the fact is that i have agreed with president bush far more than i have disagreed and on the transcendent issues the most important issues of our day ive been totally in agreement and support of president bush
1165707 the big con the true story of how washington got hoodwinked and hijacked by crackpot economics
1165708 it is a complete waste of the money john mccains contributors have donated to his campaign
1165709 it is a complete waste of the countrys time and attention at the very moment when millions of people are losing their homes and their jobs and it is a completely frivolous way to choose the next president of the united states
1165710 the fact that virginia is even up for grabs tells you a lot
1165711 if you had told me four years ago that a democratic presidential candidate would be running a competitive race in virginia and would open 10 offices i would say that is spectacular
1165712 now we have a guy who has opened 20 to 30 offices around the state youve got to be kidding me
1165713 we have traditionally been the party who can get their people to the polls when its a presidential race
1165714 even in 1996 when bill clinton was winning every state imaginable bob dole won virginia because our people showed up
1165715 academic medical center is a bigger word than just a single hospital
1165716 this is not the invasion of george pattons army at all
1165717 it meant people would have to be creative to come up with an alternative and pick up some of those pieces
1165718 i had called him after he had won the nomination
1165719 the reputation of this team has been damaged no question
1165720 i dont think its beyond repair and i dont think the reputation has been ruined but certainly it has taken some hits
1165721 i would like to let everybody know that i apologize for my actions
1165722 i apologize to st marys and i apologize to my teammates and to bulldog fans i made a bad decision my teammates were hurt and i just overreacted
1165723 you feel sad and sick that one of the guys youre an authority figure over and you care about got himself in trouble
1165724 you also hate the fact those guys do represent this program and this program represents this university and this university represents this state it represents anybody who claims to be a bulldog i feel sick about that
1165725 i mean theres no way you can say it hasnt been a distraction because it has been
1165726 if a guy has a first time offense i dont believe in throwing that guy under the bus to try to stave off the wolves so to speak
1165727 i dont think its fair to the guy dewberry for example i dont think i should throw dewberry off the football team ive never had a problem with darius dewberry
1165728 we will look into other ways of making sure we do a better job
1165729 i dont know if i would blame him for it with whats gone on this offseason
1165730 downtown that can be fun for a lot of guys but the team and what were able to do this season is a lot more important than going out and having fun with college students
1165731 the meeting leader said i am not telling you how to vote but if the democrats win this bill will pass and you wont have a vote on whether you want a union
1165732 i am not a stupid person they were telling me how to vote
1165733 if anyone representing wal mart gave the impression we were telling associates how to vote they were wrong and acting without approval
1165734 we believe efca is a bad bill and we have been on record as opposing it for some time
1165735 we feel educating our associates about the bill is the right thing to do
1165736 we feel its important that our employee partners fully understand the implications that the employee free choice act could have on their work environment and benefits
1165737 i know how politics is i really dont think its going to matter either way
1165738 none of those conversations suggest that favre was soliciting a job or that other teams were soliciting his services
1165739 based on the information that we had the packers thought it was appropriate to bring this matter to the leagues attention
1165740 we respect the commissioners investigation of this matter and we now consider it closed
1165741 i know if they do open it up to competition not a lot of people give me a chance but i believe in myself and im going to be the best i can be and let coach decide from there
1165742 if he is i might go see him when im done here
1165743 omg no they should not spend that much money on me
1165744 the z100 dj just said that kid rock requested rihanna and david archuleta
1165745 the arch is not only a logical compliment to our full line of modular surgical tables but since it is less expensive than alternative solutions in facilitating anterior total hip replacement surgery more hospitals will be in a position to offer their patients the significant benefits of this procedure regardless of the brand of surgical table they are currently using
1165746 the arch is easy to use and there are few moving parts this is a huge benefit
1165747 the intuitive design guarantees easy handling and a short learning curve for the surgeon and or staff
1165748 the arch allows the leg to be placed in the exact position desired by the surgeon with constant safe traction and precise reference points
1165749 anterior total hip replacement provides definite advantages for patients even those in need of bilateral procedures
1165750 theres an interesting line building on obama that somehow success and intelligence are a handicap
1165751 biggest challenger may not be republican john mccain but rather his own hubris
1165752 not commander in chief just yet which is why some find his decision to start planning his transition into the white house a bit presumptuous
1165753 theres an interesting line building on obama that somehow success and intelligence are a handicap
1165754 you get to the hall of fame mainly through the voting of baseball writers i just hope that the writers judge the players on what they did on the field
1165755 he mais il est en tee shirt sur les photos
1165756 the whole thing hands me a laugh two years after im dead ill still be getting all star votes
1165757 its great to have achieved this award though really its not just for me but the local tradesmen who put in the graft over the months
1165758 my wife told me to get busy as i was starting to get under her feet
1165759 so i started taking on jobs by word of mouth
1165760 to provide a forum where the media and the public can gain a better understanding of each other
1165761 i am saddened that the alp has decided to remove from the people of lyne the right to vote labor
1165762 labor has contested lyne for as long as anyone can recall
1165763 when labor refuses to contest a seat they are removing competitive tension from the debate of issues in that seat our democracy suffers
1165764 this coming on top of the state electricity privatisation tells the grassroots of lyne that they are not wanted
1165765 a stronger greens presence in canberra will mean that innovative australian technology will get more support politically
1165766 i think nine years is a reasonable contribution to the community
1165767 at 73 i think its time i had a rest
1165768 homeless people arent necessarily people living in boxes or under bridges
1165769 more often its likely to be people living with friends staying on couches and the like
1165770 often its people who live from pay cheque to pay cheque just like you or i
1165771 through one or two bad circumstances they find themselves in this situation where they can no longer afford to keep their home
1165772 theres a great deal more financial strain on families and its killing people
1165773 rental prices are up and people are frequently forking out more than half of their average wage just to live
1165774 ive spoken with students at southern cross university in coffs who go from friends couch to friends couch
1165775 our aim is to assist homeless people deal with their legal issues such as fines and other debt problems
1165776 you might be interested to check out an intercultural learning space curious to hear your opinion
1165777 explore different cultures and learn how you can deal with the challenges of living and working with people different from yourself in ever more diverse and multicultural places
1165778 what does a new yorker a londoner a parisian look like
1165779 he has photographed 100 people at random and generated a set of composite images for a range of cities
1165780 you end up with a new person someone who didnt exist before someone who doesnt exist now but someone who is nonetheless quite real
1165781 this is supposed to be about assembling the best theres ever been in sport in one place
1165782 hopefully all the stories that people have been talking about will become secondary and people can go back to marvelling at what this is supposed to be and it becomes a celebration
1165783 ive seen enormous improvements in the city and to the quality of life i think theres been dramatic improvements in all of the things that have been talked about in recent weeks i think the people of beijing deserve a great event
1165784 an absolutely extraordinary achievement the venues the scope the roads the transportation the drive in from the airport its all beautiful
1165785 you suddenly realize youre up next and every move we make will be analyzed and spoken about
1165786 for us the end of the games in beijing is the signal that were on the straightaway and the training time is almost over theres no doubt were going to be coming back home with a considerable new level of scrutiny and weight
1165787 it could be anything youre never quite sure how things will happen until people actually show up despite all the care and attention theres always a long list of things that come up every day
1165788 we want to see how they deal with those things on the spot
1165789 its a very complex operation so we want to observe that for sure
1165790 i think what were looking at this largest undertaking in human history in peacetime
1165791 just the amount of people that have to be moved the size of the venues just the scope of the undertaking
1165792 one of the things about attending an event like this is that it gives you a sense of whats possible and the kinds of things people are able to overcome a sense of what can be achieved i think that can be inspiring for us
1165793 typically we make an up to date report on all our infrastructure plans and now that something like this has occurred i will probably report on it in a little more detail
1165794 based on statements by prosecutors about the existence of a
1165795 ive been tested and baited in the house to change canadian policy on a number of consular cases the khadr case is one of them
1165796 but i have discovered that it would be a very stupid neophyte foreign minister indeed that made any assumption that this was a simple matter
1165797 if a detainee were transferred to canada any decisions regarding the applicable legal proceedings that may be available in respect of the detainees conduct outside of canada would be dependent upon the nature of the evidence available and admissible in a canadian proceeding to determine if their sic was a reasonable prospect of conviction as well as an assessment as to the public interest in proceeding with a prosecution
1165798 prior to the attorney general being called upon to make such determinations a criminal investigation by domestic police forces would have to be completed
1165799 the news about the tragedy failed to weaken our devotion so we reached here early in the morning
1165800 this is an annual affair and every day more than 25 000 people visit the shrine
1165801 to a sikh or a hindu this is one of the holiest places in this region and nobody wants to miss the 10 day long shravan ashtami fair
1165802 this is our annual pilgrimage nothing can stop us even a natural calamity
1165803 we cant stop the devotees from coming to the temple it is their devotion that is bringing them here
1165804 we are trying to investigate how the rumour spread that boulders had started rolling down from the hill the stampede might have occurred due to the rumour
1165805 now were trying to get the parents involved let them know what their children are doing
1165806 i think i would like to know what my son or daughters doing in their car or in the family car
1165807 a lot of my friends dont drive that well i dont feel safe when im with them
1165808 i think its a good idea myself personally to know what your children are doing
1165809 the mccain tv ad that intersperses blonde women celebrities britney spears and paris hilton with black man barack obama is an obvious attempt to play upon american bigoted fears
1165810 if these amendments pass jeb bush will succeed in crippling public schools and setting up vouchers for all
1165811 what jeb bush couldnt do through a republican dominated legislature he is seeking to do through an appointed commission
1165812 i think its ridiculous that they keep wanting to make this all about jeb bush
1165813 its very sad the teachers union is trying every possible maneuver to prevent the people from voting on these two important issues
1165814 the tbrc can go where ever it wants to go in the state taxation and budgeting system
1165815 requiring 65 percent of school funding for classroom instruction states duty for childrens education
1165816 reverses legal precedent prohibiting public funding of private school alternatives
1165817 theres so much product out there if yours doesnt stand out to the consumer eye then youre just another title on the shelf
1165818 the best way to do that is to work directly with the retailers we can get immediate feedback find out whats going on in the marketplace and supply a more immediate replenishment of inventory
1165819 there are certain incentives we can work with that dont necessarily work when youre dealing with a middleman
1165820 as times and technology change so must pure play ive witnessed the evolution from vhs to dvd the advent of the internet hd dvd vs blu ray and the upswing of broadcasting and pay per view my adoption of d2r is the correct choice to stay in line with our changing business needs
1165821 by going direct to retail we can now center our attention on the many retailers and chains going direct to the source
1165822 offering one of the largest libraries of studios and genres to choose from ppm offers a highly trained and experienced staff that is growing by the day we are ready and excited to see this new method take off
1165823 its about increasing margins and increasing volume and making sure our product is out there in a big a way as it can be
1165824 its a changing marketplace and we felt this was the most appropriate way to respond to it nothing against the wholesalers its just that as a corporate entity we can do a better job representing our products in the marketplace as one organization
1165825 our content is exclusive and unique our models are hot and dirty and the video quality in the members area is second to none

1165832 cybercitizens risks rights and responsibilities of participation in the information age
1165833 the risks rights to safety and responsibilities of citizens in the information age
1165834 citizenship is a cornerstone of participation in modern democracies it is awarded on the basis of meeting specific civic responsibilities it affords the citizen the rights to safe passage and protection from unlawful harm
1165835 although cyberspace is a virtual space it is real just as citizens in physical territories experience risk have rights to protection and need to honor responsibilities citizens in cyberspace experience risk have rights to protection and need to honor responsibilities
1165836 but there is the other side where they dont have to do that
1165837 the young people are actually offering to do it themselves
1165838 the unintended result of that notoriety is children think well its ok for them or this is the standard to which im held
1165839 if the child says oh no oh mum i dont want you there talk about the reasons why
1165840 cybercitizens risks rights and responsibilities of participation in the information age
1165841 giving the next administration the tools it will need to start putting public health and especially the health of our children first
1165842 it was a very good week for the american public
1165843 its stunning democrats would claim to have a great week after failing to vote on let alone pass an energy plan on the no 1 issue facing most americans gas prices the democrats in congress have failed to deliver any relief
1165844 the safety commission failed to protect children against dangerous levels of lead in toys and it did nothing to stop the use of dangerous chemicals in plastic toys
1165845 the research and teaching of professional journalism in new and emerging media
1165846 is the united states in a better position now after my administration
1165847 where are the musicians this time around how come theyre not protesting
1165848 its not like anybody feels that any of those guys being mentioned in either party has to get it
1165849 maybe its hindsight playing tricks on me but it looks like the short lists in some years past contained people of greater stature
1165850 one major trend we have seen is going green and being eco friendly
1165851 lots of bold colors make functional storage another way to express personality
1165852 definitely we are moving toward what we are calling alternative art work
1165853 young gore sets out for his new home where the sky is clear the water is clean and there are no republicans
1165854 former vice president al gore who for the past three decades has unsuccessfully attempted to warn humanity of the coming destruction of our planet only to be mocked and derided by the very people he has tried to save launched his infant son into space monday in the faint hope that his only child would reach the safety of another world
1165855 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
1165856 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
1165857 this is no fantasy no careless product of wild imagination no my friends these indictments that i have brought to you today specific charges herein against the individuals their acts of treason their ultimate aim of sedition these are matters of undeniable fact i ask you now to pronounce judgment on those accused

1165861 he pietersen is a fine player and has confidence in bucket loads which he will probably take into his captaincy
1165862 but you dont want him to change he averages around 50 in both forms of the game and hes an unbelievable talent
1165863 he has got some very important attributes that you need in a captain
1165864 he can clearly lead by example by being a fantastic player
1165865 he is a very confident person and he is pretty decisive as well when tough decisions are there to be made he is going to make those decisions
1165866 his activities as a writer and public figure his entire long thorny life journey will remain for us a model of true devotion selfless service to the people motherland the ideals of freedom justice and humanism
1165867 you have written a marvellous thing you have described only one day and yet everything there is to say about prison has been said
1165868 theres a stalinist in each of you theres even a stalinist in me we must root out this evil
1165869 solzhenitsyns narrative is reminiscent at times of tolstoys artistic force an unusually talented author has been added to our literature
1165870 lampoons on the soviet union that blacken the achievements of our fatherland and the dignity of the soviet people
1165871 the ethical force with which he has pursued the indispensable traditions of russian literature
1165872 courageous creative work upholding the sense of human dignity and exposing the trampling of the human soul and the destruction of human values
1165873 trotsky was deported in his time everyone is watching us to see what we do
1165874 solzhenitsyn is a notable writer but his political views are an embarrassment even to his fellow dissidents
1165875 you are returning at a hard time full of conflict there are many problems and much to be done
1165876 youre romo like in your efficiency and big play capability
1165877 i find it to be a refreshing piece of work from dan a northern virginia based boys fan we are united in our hate for the washington redskins be sure to check it out
1165878 eagles fans who want to spy on the enemy should check it out
1165879 dude great site its good to see some knowledgeable fans
1165880 even throughout the dry period that has been this year leading up to the draft youre constantly finding gems to keep us entertained the landryhat has been my homepage for the last 3 months and its earned the spot for a long time to come keep it up and thanks
1165881 i come to this site everyday and at least 15 times a day i really do love your work and completely appreciate all the time you put in this web site
1165882 static caused by urgent sometimes vexing or even contradictory information played at too high a volume for too long
1165883 we talk about senator clinton and her inspiration to millions of americans speaker pelosi has been an inspiration as well in a role that is in many ways more powerful than the president
1165884 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
1165885 there is significant support among top mccain advisers that he make a transformative pick who would change the republican party someone who would appeal to moderate republicans and democrats this pick would be someone who like mccain has taken the unpopular stands made the hard calls and stood firm on principle a person who fills that bill these advisers say is joe lieberman
1165886 you know something the republicans dont want to win this election they dont mccain may want to win but these people around him that are giving him this advice they must not want to win this election
1165887 there is a reason the american people the past 100 years elevated only two sitting senators into the white house jfk and warren harding its because they believe most senators adept at compulsive compromise have no political compass and will sell them out
1165888 were mad as hell and were not going to take it anymore
1165889 the message that needs to be communicated to these people is your problem is not global warming
1165890 move quickly and boldly to shake off complacency throw aside old habits and rise clear eyed and alert to the necessity of big changes
1165891 to commit to producing 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
1165892 to be sure reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years will require us to overcome many obstacles
1165893 to those who say the costs are still too high i ask them to consider whether the costs of oil and coal will ever stop increasing if we keep relying on quickly depleting energy sources to feed a rapidly growing demand all around the world
1165894 reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years
1165895 provide funding and global business building expertise to a range of businesses both public and private and to entrepreneurs
1165896 an oil and gas exploration and production e amp p company
1165897 has already dug 100 wells around the world and is in the processing of raising additional capital
1165898 it would be ironic to say the least if kleiners first green jackpot turns out to be a company that actually drills for oil
1165899 designs microbes that when injected into oil wells increase oil production and decrease use of water
1165900 al gores carbon crusade the money and connections behind it
1165901 water infiltrating the concrete slabs freezes and then thaws weakening the concrete and rusting the steel
1165902 these pre clinical data provide the first firm basis for advancing pharmacologic ascorbate in cancer treatment in humans
1165903 this is encouraging work but its at a very early stage because it involves cells grown in the lab and mice
1165904 there is currently no evidence from clinical trials in humans that injecting or consuming vitamin c is an effective way to treat cancer
1165905 the community is in shock not so long ago there was this very happy event with two lovely people and two lovely families and then out of the blue comes this sad news its very difficult for people to handle
1165906 ben was a conscientious student he was professional at all times he took on responsibilities beyond those required of him
1165907 he was valued by all he came into contact with both at university and in the clinical setting
1165908 ben was caring articulate and dedicated to his chosen profession
1165909 he will be greatly missed our condolences go to the families of ben and catherine
1165910 i have had nightmares in the last couple of weeks
1165911 i had to be rushed into emergency and i couldnt walk on my foot for two days it was a poisonous spider
1165912 we went back home at night and i had a really bad fever i woke up in the night and couldnt stand on my foot by the morning my foot was like a red balloon and i had a red line all the way up inside my leg
1165913 i was thinking that somebody somewhere had a little doll and was sticking pins in but something like that just makes you more determined to fight it off they thought i might need an iv drip but in the end i had to have strong oral medicine i couldnt put my foot down and couldnt run for four days i still have scabs and have lost all the skin around my toe
1165914 you cant make a definite decision because im running on a leg that could break down
1165915 every time i go out i am planning to start the race and run well there have been lots of points where i thought am i going to make it
1165916 i wouldnt be here if i didnt think i was in good enough shape
1165917 i know from what i have done that i am good enough to be on the start line im racing unless my leg breaks down and i cant run that has already been decided
1165918 our dangerous dependence on foreign oil has been thirty years in the making and was caused by the failure of politicians in washington to think long term about the future of the country
1165919 this is one emergency we cant drill our way out of
1165920 any time you pick up a newspaper and see the terms climate change or global warming just think jobs for michigan
1165921 believe me the production people can do it if they really try
1165922 the most insignificant office that ever the invention of man contrived or his imagination conceived
1165923 if president bush had pursued the right energy policies and made the investments in clean coal technology that he promised eight years ago he might not be talking about the high gasoline prices today
1165924 big hurdle is fund raising even among a business community that is desperate to throw out mr mcgraw
1165925 10 thinks you didnt know about west virginia gov joe manchin
1165926 in my 31 years of social work i dont think ive seen a crime this heinous perpetrated against a social worker in the line of duty
1165927 thats old uncle aunt insert name talking out of his her head again
1165928 colorado obama 47 mccain 45 virginia obama 47 mccain 46 missouri obama 45 mccain 47
1165929 alabama too close to call arkansas too close to call
1165930 why is it that barack obama cant consistently overshoot 50 and john mccain cant comfortably crack 45 in the national polls
1165931 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
1165932 there is a divide between the professional and the amateur festival now and the two rarely meet but part of the fun of edinburgh is that you have them both
1165933 the big venues are very well run but everyone is in their own small world when they need to look at the whole mix
1165934 the four venues sell almost 50 per cent of tickets but are a world away from shows like the american high school performances
1165935 there have been comments that edinburgh is too much about trade but lets not forget that there are 247 venues not just four lots of one man bands that are just as important
1165936 someone from one of the venues complained to me that there is juggling and face painting in the fringe brochure but this range is a vital part of the fringe everybody owns the festival
1165937 they are acting as a cartel and trying to monopolise the fringe and sponsorship the four venues are making the fringe look divided when the main thing we are trying to do is present a coherent united front to get the city council and government to support the festival
1165938 they should front the fringe to the international marketplace against sydney against australia and canada selling the idea of the fringe abroad it is an advocacy role about having a public profile marketing the fringe as a whole not just by a few individuals
1165939 edinburgh needs to compete with upstart festivals promoting their countries and it seems to me that a festival worth 75m should be supported more by edinburgh the fringe society and director should be empowered to go out and sell the fringe internationally but they are quite under resourced
1165940 i believe in saying whats on the tin and we are in comedy and celebrating the festival unless we find a title sponsor we are likely to continue with the name i think the greatest thing in edinburgh is the spectrum from first performers to professionals and we should all call ourselves different strands of simply the edinburgh festival
1165941 my only concern is that there is a diverse mix of stuff comedy and theatre economic and uneconomic so that audiences can have a completely different experience you can choose your own totally idiosyncratic route through the fringe
1165942 i cant understand why there arent rings of young people blocking bulldozers and preventing them from constructing coal fired power plants
1165943 the gap between the carbon price and the cost of ccs
1165944 i hope that the strengthening of carbon markets will bring forward a sufficiently good price for carbon that it will provide some of the financial incentive for ccs will it be enough i do not know
1165945 as a fig leaf to give unabated coal fired power stations an appearance of environmental acceptability
1165946 has no right to withhold approval for a conventional plant
1165947 thanks i wont include hope to get the set of draft conditions out today or tomorrow
1165948 in the muslim school the teacher wrote to tell mother i made faces during koranic studies
1165949 it is clear that growth models in our industry based on high and increasing leverage will no longer be sustainable
1165950 it is also clear that complexity in financial services and the recent consequences of failed risk management need to be addressed
1165951 along with its supervisors our industry including lenders underwriters and investors needs to reflect on the lessons for risk management capital adequacy and funding
1165952 ultimately the real economy will recover from this crisis although it may get worse before it gets better financial markets will not and should not return to the status quo ante
1165953 the most difficult market in the working careers of perhaps all of us
1165954 bridging the worlds of environmentalism finance technology and politics together mr gore is ideally suited to speak to this audience of innovators striving to integrate green building practices and leading edge technology into the 21st century in a way that is both smart and sustainable
1165955 i think the extra work of doing this myself is gonna make it really cool
1165956 update now the democratic leadership has shut off lights of the house as gop members are speaking on the floor debating how we lower gas prices
1165957 we are speaking without microphones as though it were 1908 acoustics of house chamber are good and gallery and you can hear us
1165958 i just told the house chamber we the people can take back the capitol with these new media tools by networking and shining sunlight everywhere
1165959 one of the great advantages of politicking online is the ability to control delivery technologies
1165960 when the house republicans wanted to tell citizens that the democrats wouldnt allow a vote on their energy bill they went after young voters with messages on such short message systems as twitter and qik as well as the by now tried and true youtube more mature voters in their base were sought out through such websites as republican senate gov and an array of conservative blogs the scene was dramatic with all of this action occurring after the house closed for its august recess on friday night
1165961 last friday they decided that they could get more legs for their story on the web
1165962 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
1165963 the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
1165964 this is an investment that will pay itself back many times over
1165965 its an expensive investment but not compared to the rising cost of continuing to invest in fossil fuels
1165966 for decades al gore has challenged the skeptics in washington on climate change and awakened the conscience of a nation to the urgency of this threat i strongly agree with vice president gore that we cannot drill our way to energy independence but must fast track investments in renewable sources of energy like solar power wind power and advanced biofuels and those are the investments i will make as president its a strategy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and cannot be outsourced and one that will leave our children a world that is cleaner and safer
1165967 a friend suggested it and asked me to give a description of a man she had a grudge against stupidly i agreed as far as i know the man was never arrested and was never even a suspect
1165968 it ia bitter irony that she enjoys the same protection as a genuine rape victim thus making a mockery of the whole process naming this young woman is clearly in the public interest there are times when the law protects the wrong people
1165969 do you think running a campaign ad in which you feature britney spears and paris hilton with barack obama is respectful
1165970 its a bit of humor its a way to draw people into the ad
1165971 were not deciding whos our favorite celebrity who we are fans of
1165972 the only strategy theyve got in this election is to try to scare you about me
1165973 well you know hes got a funny name and he doesnt look like all the presidents on the dollar bills and the five dollar bills
1165974 what obama was saying is theyre trying to scare you
1165975 theyre trying to scare the american people and believe me im an expert on how they do that
1165976 to insinuate that his celebrity is somehow all he has
1165977 theyre trying to say to america somehow hes not like you
1165978 the mccain campaign is to use barack obamas words raising the question is he a risky guy but it has nothing to do with his name or his skin color it has to do with his lack of experience and bad judgment his unreadiness to be president
1165979 in 2000 al gore gave me the extraordinary honor of being the first jewish american to run for national office and al gore said he had confidence in the american people that they would judge me based on my record not on my religion
1165980 and i urge barack obama to have the same faith in the american people that they will judge him on his record or lack of record certainly not on his name or his race
1165981 break americas gridlock by honoring a bipartisan effort if that is the only way to move us towards alternative and renewable fuels
1165982 when john mccain brings american troops home from iraq theyre staying home
1165983 i think liebermans going to want to be part of the stronger democratic majority
1165984 the bulk of his treatment is completed but he still gets chemo once a week his immune system is still repressed so right now his staff believes he wont go you never know with him though he might get up one day and decide he has to be there
1165985 we have to live with our feet very much rooted in reality
1165986 were pursuing renewables as well but you cant simply take away half of your energy base
1165987 to be sure reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years will require us to overcome many obstacles
1165988 it would be difficult for north carolina to meet a 10 percent renewable portfolio standard with only new north carolina renewable supply resources by 2021
1165989 by 2010 were lowering sulfur oxide and nitrous oxide emissions by 70 percent from 2002 three years before required
1165990 the main reason we did it was just to show people what the possibilities are
1165991 a price point comparison will be low enough to do it one day i guess the way of capturing solar energy is kind of expensive silicon is expensive
1165992 this is really just our first dip of our toe into the water
1165993 this is our time to step up and see if its feasible
1165994 were just getting into it right now we wont know probably for at least a couple of years how it works
1165995 coal is dirty any way you slice it coal isnt good
1165996 if you were to put a price on health coal would cost a whole lot and solar would begin to seem more reasonable
1165997 the worst thing you could do is raise peoples payroll taxes my god
1165998 on social security he sen obama wants to raise social security taxes i am opposed to raising taxes on social security i want to fix the system without raising taxes
1165999 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
1166000 and yet few politicians have seemed inclined to address solutions particularly if those solutions involve a modest individual sacrifice
1166001 since taking steps to make his home more environmentally friendly last june gore devours an average of 17 768 kwh per month 1 638 kwh more energy per month than the year before the renovations by comparison the average american household consumes 11 040 kwh in an entire year according to the energy information administration the cost of gores electric bills over the past year topped 16 533
1166002 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
1166003 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
1166004 the conrad foundation is based on petes history of innovation and entrepreneurship
1166005 we believe that ultimately it will offer a platform to encourage students to explore entrepreneurship while creating innovative solutions to important issues that face our world and their future
1166006 when al gore recently challenged america to convert to clean renewable energy he struck a chord within our foundation
1166007 if al gores challenge can galvanize the nation to develop renewable energy why not ask americas youth to answer the challenge in our 2009 competition we have invited our students to answer al gores challenge
1166008 i will sit down with her when im president and will say lets work together
1166009 i may disagree with all the ways of getting there
1166010 surrender of personal excellence and community value in the mere accumulation of material things it measures neither our wit nor our wisdom and can tell us everything about america except why were proud to be americans
1166011 i had just come out of the cotton fields and corn fields
1166012 i was on welfare with my family and i hated welfare i got angry and upset and told them i wanted to go to work
1166013 we wanted better health care shoes and clothing i felt during the years of my life working in the cotton field they owed me that i just got angry went from door to door we pulled together a few hundred women
1166014 we started marching on the welfare department demanding what we wanted and needed it was about 6 000 people
1166015 the police came and arrested us we had to do something to call attention to our agenda of wanting jobs and wanting to get away from welfare
1166016 i feel good about the honor i am grateful because i earned it i worked for it and i do it from the cotton fields to the bright street of las vegas earned that
1166017 should we ignore gore or put him in charge hes an absurd extremist says mark davis the planet does not need saving the climate is not in crisis
1166018 options fade for failing schools outside managers lack of interest in texas has forced campus closures
1166019 he is a great surrogate he is the top surrogate
1166020 we just found out last week that gore could come to the island
1166021 he asked gore to come and to be his surrogate
1166022 obama is the first presidential candidate to refuse federal funds in a general election
1166023 while mccain will get 85 million from the federal government for his campaign our goal is to raise 300 to 400 million
1166024 this will be the second or third fundraiser hell attend its pretty special gores a nobel prize winner an academy award winner and almost president
1166025 a politician with a troublesome reputation for trying to have it both ways
1166026 mr gore has a bit of a reputation for flip flopping and corner cutting
1166027 at least you know what i believe and where i stand
1166028 which many historians believe would have collapsed of its own weight no matter who was commander in chief
1166029 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
1166030 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
1166031 i respect speaker pelosi i think shes one of the great american success stories
1166032 we talk about new york sen hillary clinton and her inspiration to millions of americans speaker pelosi has been an inspiration as well
1166033 i may disagree with all the ways of getting there but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue and his continuous leadership and i am in no way trying to get into a fight with him
1166034 but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue and his continuous leadership and i am in no way trying to get into a fight with him
1166035 mccain is going to be just like obama mccain is a socialist and will pick nancy pelosi as his vp because he hates conservatives
1166036 i respect speaker pelosi i think shes one of the great american success stories
1166037 i had other priorities in the 60s than military service
1166038 in the councils of government we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence whether sought or unsought by the military industrial complex
1166039 the potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist
1166040 achieving the goal before this decade is out of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to the earth
1166041 we are being told by scientists we may have less than 10 years to make dramatic change lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
1166042 i have never seen an opportunity for the country like the one thats emerging now
1166043 at the least the have a lot of hatred of anybody who is enjoying life
1166044 gefallen hat w rden wir uns freuen wenn auch ihr unseren
1166045 i know how proud my mum and dad have been
1166046 i spoke to my dad this morning and he said you know can walk away a proud lad because youve given it everything and thats all he ever asked me to do
1166047 my apologies to you for the times i have fallen short
1166048 it is important to me that everybody who has been hurt know that the sorrow i feel is genuine
1166049 we can even have an open relationship if you must
1166050 dry your eyes mate i know its hard to take but her mind has been made up
1166051 i dont like to talk about my health issues in the media which is why i havent talked about them all year
1166052 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
1166053 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
1166054 the need for math and science education and higher level thinking skills
1166055 the capital costs of wind and solar are terrifying to contemplate
1166056 coal makes us sick its global warming its ruining our country its ruining the world weve got to stop using fossil fuel
1166057 addressing both the challenges and significant opportunities that humanity is facing requires significant innovation in technology business and building and we are extremely excited to hear mr gores timely exploration of the intersection of these industries
1166058 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
1166059 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
1166060 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
1166061 scientists have confirmed that enough solar energy falls on the surface of the earth every 40 minutes to meet 100 percent of the entire worlds energy needs for a full year tapping just a small portion of this solar energy could provide all of the electricity america uses
1166062 enough wind power blows through the midwest corridor every day to also meet 100 percent of u s electricity demand
1166063 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
1166064 the quickest cheapest and best way to start using all this renewable energy is in the production of electricity in fact we can start right now using solar power wind power and geothermal power to make electricity for our homes and businesses
1166065 our struggling auto giants switch to the manufacture of plug in electric cars
1166066 new and replacement generating plants will cost about 560 billon through 2030 absent a significant expansion of energy efficiency programs or new climate initiatives
1166067 of course there are those who will tell us this cant be done
1166068 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
1166069 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment
1166070 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations
1166071 our country needs a new energy policy that reinvests in america and it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy
1166072 wait a second if youve gotten to the point where youre sheepish about us doing well i cant vote for you
1166073 hey jimmy were only guys we show up at 11 30 we tell the jokes thats what pretty boys do all night
1166074 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
1166075 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that
1166076 when we brought the organization to philadelphia and we did research with then television partner nbc polling people of the philadelphia area the awareness factor of arena football was about 1 5 percent
1166077 today i dont think theres a sports fan in philadelphia that hasnt at least heard of the philadelphia soul
1166078 i know that the players are happy i know that our fans are happy i know that the recipients of our philanthropy are happy
1166079 if this victory can clear the way and get rid of the curse that theyve had here for a number of years i hope it does
1166080 i hope the eagles now can win it the sixers mo cheeks and those guys can win it
1166081 its amazing how many people have texted or e mailed or called
1166082 coach tom coughlin from the giants andy reid bill belichick bob kraft doug flutie john elway al gore youd be surprised at the people who were glued to their tv sunday charlie weis
1166083 so many people that weve run into over the years that just had the best of wishes for what we just accomplished it was pretty cool
1166084 i urge your colleagues to take even bolder steps toward solving the climate crisis
1166085 we have an historic opportunity to shift to a clean energy economy and in the process create new sustainable jobs to support the development and deployment of these new technologies
1166086 im afraid right now that we are more concerned about the business climate than the earths climate
1166087 until we realize they are not mutually exclusive we wont be able to address these issues
1166088 but it should be clear to anyone who has been watching the session that weve already
1166089 under governor patrick massachusetts joined the regional greenhouse gas initiative and became the first state in the nation to require greenhouse gas analysis and mitigation in major real estate projects
1166090 comprehensive energy legislation the oceans management bill and pending biofuels legislation all put massachusetts into a leadership position nationally we support the creation of an economy wide cap as the next step in reducing greenhouse gas emissions but many details remain to be worked out with the legislature
1166091 windmills should be installed in every uninhabited windy place in this country
1166092 the driver of the town car that eventually whisked away gores wife and daughter left the engine idling and the ac cranking for 20 minutes before they finally left
1166093 the worst thing you could do is raise peoples payroll taxes my god
1166094 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
1166095 there is strong disagreement with many of the legal analytical economic science and policy interpretations
1166096 is a deeply flawed and unsuitable vehicle for reducing greenhouse gas emissions
1166097 will not only harm the us economy but will fail to provide an effective response to the global challenge of climate change as the president observed in april decisions with such far reaching impact should not be left to unelected regulators and judges
1166098 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
1166099 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront the issue as president next year
1166100 a middle course between the republicans insistence on more drilling and democrats demands for more renewables and efficiency measures
1166101 educational levels tend to be higher among those who actually use the label yes
1166102 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
1166103 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
1166104 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
1166105 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
1166106 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions

1166113 after i looked at the programmes of real madrid and oranje i came to the conclusion it is too heavy a burden because of the necessary physical effort
1166114 i had a very fine tournament with oranje and i look back at that with a good feeling
1166115 of course i find it regrettable that i cannot make use of his qualities and international experience when i compose the oranje selection
1166116 i have spoken in length with ruud and i cannot do anything else than respect his decision
1166117 in 1970 the u s imported 24 percent of its oil by 1990 it was 42 percent and today its almost 70 percent we import 70 percent of our oil at a cost of us 700 billion a year four times the annual cost of the iraq war ive been an oil man all my life but this is one emergency we cant drill our way out of but if we create a new renewable energy network we can break our addiction to foreign oil
1166118 when president john f kennedy challenged our nation to land a man on the moon and bring him back safely in 10 years many people doubted we could accomplish that goal
1166119 but eight years and two months later neil armstrong and buzz aldrin walked on the surface of the moon
1166120 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now
1166121 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
1166122 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
1166123 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
1166124 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
1166125 to show that he is a regular guy despite a perceived surplus of gravitas which at least some americans seem to find intimidating
1166126 all over this country people are asking whether or not george bush is smart enough to be president of the united states
1166127 does anyone in america doubt that kerry has a higher iq than bush im sure the candidates sats and college transcripts would put kerry far ahead
1166128 i dont know how theyve done it because my record is not public
1166129 i must have been drinking the night before i took that military aptitude test
1166130 once you settle for a ronald reagan then its easy to settle for a george bush and once you settle for a george bush then its real easy to settle for bush ii you know this should be evolution instead its devolution whats next
1166131 all of us are ignorant of many things its just that the liberal here thinkss he knows what the conservative is ignorant of
1166132 small c conservatives are smeared as stupid by liberals because they respect the values of western civilisation
1166133 a few months later another study emerged demonstrating that the average iq of states that had voted for gore was much higher than those that went for bush connecticut was given an average iq of 113 while conservative utah scored an 87 again barely above retarded according to these numbers the 16 smartest states all went for kerry while the 26 dumbest went for bush
1166134 liberals believe in free speech individual liberty religious freedom the right to make a living
1166135 we have been drilling for more oil and the prices have gone up
1166136 a lot more oil has been found a lot more has been produced
1166137 the exploding demand for oil especially in places like china is overwhelming the rate of new discoveries by so much that oil prices are almost certain to continue upward over time no matter what the oil companies promise
1166138 john mccain enters the offshore drilling debate with voters favor
1166139 wants the government to act to address the immediate price consequences and to act now for achieving energy independence in the medium and long term
1166140 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
1166141 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
1166142 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
1166143 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
1166144 the leading experts predict that we have less than 10 years to make dramatic changes in our global warming pollution lest we lose our ability to ever recover from this environmental crisis
1166145 eliminate carbon from the us electricity supply by 2018 or we are doomed
1166146 a challenge to all americans in every walk of life to our political leaders entrepreneurs innovators engineers and to every citizen
1166147 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront this issue as president next year
1166148 given how hot its been this summer can there be any doubt about global warming
1166149 does anyone have any reliable information from knowledgeable sources regarding how much oil is out there
1166150 on this anniversary of his first landmark testimony hansen once again appeared before congress today
1166151 i tell you the truth it is hard for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven again i tell you it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of god
1166152 we want to jump on this bandwagon we have to
1166153 produce every kilowatt of electricity through wind sun and other earth friendly energy sources within 10 years this goal is achievable affordable and transformative
1166154 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
1166155 i didnt read all the specifics of his plan i agree with his goal i may disagree on all the ways of getting there but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue
1166156 i am in no way trying to get in a fight with gore because we share the same goal
1166157 the following describes a long standing and common implementation flaw in online affiliate programs allowing for fraud
1166158 re web security re the great waf debate was gt xss injection
1166159 and then something very very scary happened daddy and i got a call from grandma cheri she told us that amanda had given birth to you way way way way too early you were so tiny mommy didnt think that a tiny baby like you would be able to survive i went out into the garage to get in the car so we could drive to the hospital to see you when i got out there i started crying and crying and i fell on my knees in the garage and i begged jesus to let me see you just one time i thought that i was going to lose you like i lost my other babies and i asked jesus if this one time i could see you could touch you could tell you how much i loved you and wanted you then i got in the car and we drove to the hospital when i saw you for the first time you gave me hope you wrapped your tiny finger around mine and squeezed it so tight and then i wondered if you were really going to live and you did
1166160 if hed been president we wouldnt have hadthese bush administration messes the past eight years
1166161 hes charismatic hes a strong orator he has a presencethat draws you in
1166162 al gore is one of the few public figureschallenging my generation to do anything hes inspirational
1166163 i dont think im very good at some of the things that themodern political system rewards and requires and ive foundother ways to make a difference and to serve the publicinterests
1166164 hebecame a star by rising above politics with his passion for theenvironment hes now international leader on an issue more andmore people care about there has been no more successfuldefeated presidential candidate
1166165 if the vice president says its do able i believe
1166166 its a strategy that willcreate millions of new jobs and one that will leave ourchildren a world that is cleaner and safer
1166167 it cannot be the basis of a soundenergy policy by any responsible official in america it seemsto me maybe i am wrong but i dont think so
1166168 you win some you lose some and then theres that little known third category
1166169 after i looked at the programmes of real madrid and oranje i came to the conclusion it is too heavy a burden because of the necessary physical effort
1166170 i had a very fine tournament with oranje and i look back at that with a good feeling
1166171 of course i find it regrettable that i cannot make use of his qualities and international experience when i compose the oranje selection
1166172 i have spoken in length with ruud and i cannot do anything else than respect his decision
1166173 when you connect the dots it turns out that the real solutions to the climate crisis are the very same measures needed to renew our economy and escape the trap of ever rising energy prices
1166174 because the sun doesnt shine and the wind doesnt blow all the time
1166175 the country is not going to be able to go cold turkey
1166176 we have a hundred years of infrastructure with trillions of dollars of investment that is not simply going to be made obsolete
1166177 we must make sure that our descendants learn about that history and feel pride in their nation
1166178 the founding of the republic would have been impossible without liberation and liberation without national founding would have been meaningless we all should be one at a time when we are marking the 60th anniversary of the founding of the republic
1166179 i was staying at my home in rome last friday when i got an urgent phone call from the beijing olympic organizing committee said jo 46 they asked me to give a performance of the beijing olympics theme song in front of the chinese president i was surprised because i was taking time to prepare for my performances in china scheduled for aug 11 and 14 but i took a plane immediately

1166185 they really wanted to blame somebody in the middle east
1166186 how to deploy and use these kinds of substances so you start to piece it all together
1166187 told us this was not something some guy in a cave could come up with

1166189 former fbi official after 9 11 white house told fbi to blame anthrax attacks on al qaeda
1166190 told us this was not something some guy in a cave could come up with
1166191 they couldnt go from box cutters one week to weapons grade anthrax the next
1166192 did the fbi meaningfully investigate who sent an anonymous letter to the fbi after the anthrax letters were sent but before they were made public accusing a former fort detrick scientist the arab american ayaad assaad of being a
1166193 prove it was a second wave assault by al qaeda
1166194 anthrax case yeah solved the guy responsible killed himself nothing else to see here move along move along
1166195 youve been infected vote no on legislation x to receive the antidote
1166196 after the anthrax scare makes me wonder if it truly had been weaponzied or was still rather crude
1166197 may be a remnant of the us biological weapons program

1166200 she has purple blood she has a lot of coaching experience now and is a great recruiter and a great teacher washington and wisconsin are similar in that they are both state schools that draw a lot of gifted athletes who were all state performers in other sports and who chose the school for academic reasons we take those athletes and make them into top notch rowers one of nicoles main responsibilities will be to bring the new rowers up to speed
1166201 this is my dream job theres simply nowhere else i would want to coach at this point i coach rowing because i want to give young women the same experiences i had as a husky rower rowing at washington was the best experience of my life and i am honored to have the opportunity to come back and represent the school i came from
1166202 in some respects when we think about what the capabilities of a 349 desktop system should be like we cant help but be impressed what asus has achieved and the overall value of the eee box whats more impressive though is the eee boxs absolutely tiny form factor and completely miserly power consumption the original eee pc notebook cultivated quite an enthusiastic following in the marketplace and we think the eee box is likely to as well

1166244 my brother hosam and i knew that obama will be a big hit even before he became a candidate we knew the guy would be a celebrity in gaza so we decided to invest the amount of 29 000 to buy obama t shirts from his website and sell them in gaza
1166245 i know on the back of this story obama rivals will present our business as a donation and they will try to use this story to let obama fall but im telling you we bought t shirts
1166246 we have nothing to do with the obama campaign we just like obama and believe he will be the best for the palestinians and for the world

1166259 the largest growth area in the medium to long term is regional tv

1166262 if there was a competition for the country with the most pessimistic consumers the uk would be the winner
1166263 despite the undoubted pedigree of the competition the uk consumer easily wins the title of the most pessimistic in europe and probably the developed world even us confidence has been more resilient

1166288 at 560p morgan sindall trades on a full year estimated 2009 price earnings ratio of 5 8 times and offers a yield of 7 1 per cent we continue to believe that the current rating does not reflect the underlying strength of the business the group currently trades at a 33 per cent discount to the sector and we retain our outperform recommendation
1166289 the length and depth of that is uncertain i think if a recession occurred it could be shallow but any meaningful recovery in the housing market is unlikely before next year employment is fragile these are difficult conditions and they will remain difficult into next year too
1166290 i dont think emerging markets have completely decoupled from europe north america or japan there has been an element of decoupling there is an increasing amount of exports to other destinations there will be an impact from a us recession there is no question
1166291 the near term outlook remains negative with a significant degree of uncertainty there is pressure on a number of emerging markets in terms of inflation
1166292 north america continues to disappoint we warned in late 2006 that we saw the consumer market weakening and regrettably we havent been proved wrong

1166301 we know it will take time to get rid of these bad elements and even some good people joined them because they fell into a trap
1166302 if the government fails to deliver on basic services and other needs of the iraqis sadr followers could use their new organization to tell people they should look to them as voice of change
1166303 we welcome any news about iraqis laying down their arms and working to rebuild this country
1166304 we will continue to fight until the occupation is driven out of iraq

1166323 we have already seen the courage and determination of the chinese people
1166324 the world mourned the staggering loss of life from the earthquake in sichuan province and marveled at the courageous response by the chinese people
1166325 starting this weekend and over the next 16 days the world will have another reason to come together to share common emotions

1166336 if i dont have written proof of something we have to take for granted the passports that weve seen and have been checked by the ioc are ok gueisbuhler said
1166337 the ioc relies on the international federations who are exclusively responsible for the eligibility of athletes rogge said
1166338 its not the task of the ioc to check every one of the 10 000 athletes
1166339 not to do anything about that this is ridiculous said longtime gymnastics coach bela karolyi who will be part of nbcs broadcast team in beijing and whose wife martha is now the coordinator of the u
1166340 its just as grave and just as brutal like cheating with doping
1166341 according to all valid legal identification cards provided by local governments where each athlete lives they also provided photocopies of he and jiangs passports which were issued in july 2007 and march 2006
1166342 the international gymnastics federation strictly verified their passports and confirmed that their ages met the age rules for participating in the world championship world cup and olympics the association said in a statement
1166343 i dont believe you have to be a child psychologist or doctor to look at those particular girls and say wait a minute these are kids they are not 16 years old not a doubt in my mind
1166344 you can test for lots of drugs but theres really no carbon dating olympic gold medalist bart conner said
1166345 other than believing what they say where is the truth if you have to look for some independent source i dont know
1166346 im going to really enjoy the olympic atmosphere im sure and im out to try and win a medal nadal told the associated press in an exclusive telephone interview before catching a 13 hour flight to the chinese capital
1166347 its an honor to represent your country and i look forward to taking part
1166348 i feel pretty much as i did yesterday morning or last year he said its another step in a long process which has taken a lot of very hard work and which really started coming together about four or five years ago
1166349 the whole world needs to continue seeing him as the enormous champion he has been and quite definitely still is nadal said
1166350 people tend to talk about how my style leads to injuries but i think they have got that wrong i have only really had one troubling injury and that was in 2005
1166351 i have worked hard on my game and feel much better about my ability to cover the court he said
1166352 wimbledon has been an incredibly hard experience for me but this year i managed to do it better i managed to win said nadal
1166353 wimbledon is special it was a very special experience for me
1166354 every morning i wake up with clear goals in my head on how i need to improve my game nadal said
1166355 sometimes it was close campbell brown says with a laugh
1166356 iron man is a summer favorite and reads voraciously anything by john grisham
1166357 being a true champion is more than finishing first in a competition its a behavior for many people its a way of life
1166358 the best way i can describe veronica is shes just a champion he says
1166359 a lot of that has to do with her god given ability a lot of it is that she has a great work ethic she doesnt just take it for granted and continues to try to get better
1166360 whenever i see her at meets we hang out and talk campbell brown says
1166361 i put it behind me because i cannot reverse the past she wrote in an e mail
1166362 i would be wasting my energy to be constantly worrying about something that is in the past besides i strongly believe that everything happens for a reason and i know that god has a plan for me
1166363 its nice to have someone that understands you says campbell brown who met her husband in high school after attending the same track meets
1166364 if im still running really fast even if im 30 why retire
1166365 the pace im running will determine when i retire im not sure what the future holds
1166366 we are both friends with misty and kerri theyre good people were good people and we want to beat each other badly id love it to be the yankees and red sox and make it some controversial hate each other deep down to the core rivalry but its not like that
1166367 they deserve everything that they have going for them and they give a lot back to the sport obviously when youre out there on the court its business and competitive and youre not friends when youre out there playing but once you step out of the lines its different
1166368 i think theyre a great team but its just a great rivalry
1166369 we played them so many times in 2007 and they beat us twice and thats two times too many its really motivating knowing that theres a team out there who can beat you
1166370 theyre both very dominant at the net they play really good defense for being taller players and theyre both physical so kerri and i cant slack off weve got to be playing our best match whenever we step on the court with those two but they definitely help to make us better
1166371 facing them week in and week out has made us such a better team
1166372 i missed the press conference but im in my selection for the olympic games was announced this morning in hyde park im going to beijing my third olympics i was meant to arrive back in the uk first thing this morning and go straight to the press conference but my plane was stuck on the runway in chicago due to technical issues
1166373 after meeting the selection criteria in madrid and being nominated its actually a relief to have the selection confirmed i knew i was in but couldnt say so until it was officially announced now it is phase two of the heat acclimatization for beijing ill race national champs in bryn bach on july 26th and then we head to korea for heat and humidity acclimatization
1166374 i am so excited about representing the usa again in beijing this august the road to making my 3rd olympic team has been a very difficult one but one that i will never forget i dont know what the outcome is going to be in beijing for me but what i do know is that this olympic games is going to be different than sydney 2000 and athens 2004
1166375 after athens i told myself that if i was ever able to get back to another olympic games i would make sure that i walked in the opening ceremonies when speaking to many past olympians i always hear that the opening ceremonies is one of the best experiences athletes have at the olympics i have many wonderful memories from sydney and athens but now im going to add the opening ceremonies to my list of olympic memories so on august 8th at 8 08pm 8 is a lucky number in china can you tell look for me walking with team usa into the stadium during opening ceremonies how are you going to see me on tv just look for the guy with the biggest grin on his face
1166376 as i sit to write there are less than four weeks to go until the olympic games mens triathlon and only 14 days until the opening ceremony on the 8 8 08 wow ill admit that the reality and excitement of being part of this event is starting to sink in i have been a bit light on the updates over the past months but to be honest there hasnt been too much to tell i have been training training and more training and believe me this is not all that exciting to write about
1166377 about the best news i can give is that everything to date in my preparation has gone mostly to plan and i am happy with the shape i am in i have followed a fairly similar preparation to what i did for the olympic test event in 2007 so things feel pretty familiar at this stage in the more recent weeks i have started my final preparations to get ready to race most notably my first and only full triathlon hit out before the games in the heat and humidity of singapore i have also had a few fast running races over the 10km distances although with tired legs but all still great training
1166378 on july 13th i was in tiszaujvaros hungry for my last race event before beijing on august 19th i have been training very well in switzerland since the beginning of june with all the focus to have the best performance i possible can in the olympic games my race in tis helped to make my final analyses and to see where i could get some improvement for the next final five weeks
1166379 with a very good 3rd lap i could put myself closer however it was not enough time to get there and i needed to be satisfied with one more fifth place in a word cup i am quite happy the only reason i know i still can run better than what i did is because i will keep doing exactly the same thing i have done and i will get my performance where i want
1166380 after travelling nearly two full days in a van that had no air conditioning or windows in the back we drove into the quaint little town of pierrelatte for the d2 race in the south of france the temperature was around the 35 degree mark which was a shock coming from the teens i found myself in the front pack of runners and after the first lap one guy surged and i couldnt respond so was content with finishing off in 5th
1166381 our recovery day was spent climbing mt ventoux a massive climb used in the tour de france not this year and saw us going from 300m to around 1900m in 21km gradient went from 6 11 i am now in the netherlands battling the wind and rain getting the body prepped for the 19th of august
1166382 with almost 40kg excess baggage and without major problems i am now finally here on jeju island in south korea although i have often been in asian countries i am amazed to find something new every time the first few days we trained with the brazilians and got used to the time change
1166383 according to our coaches there should be no intensive sessions on our training plan but my definition of intensity is a little different than his so i am already back into my normal training schedule at the 50m pool and the 400m athletics track also we got our new olympic bikes from cervelo this month they are white with the five olympic rings specially made for us
1166384 in the frame of a transparent and consistent qualification system
1166385 it is very disturbing for the itf and should be for the ioc when players who do not meet the itf qualification criteria approved by the ioc are entered at the expense of players who qualified and deserve to represent their countries at the 2008 olympic games the federation said in a statement
1166386 while recognizing that the german noc may not understand how professional tennis works there is no excuse for mr schuettler who is prepared to take a place that was earned by his compatriot denis gremelmayr and of next alternate michael berrer the itf said
1166387 b sample taken during last months european championships in ukraine confirmed the result of the first test which was positive for the banned diuretic furosemide the italian fencing federation said monday

1166392 i had a bad experience in the united states with some damn cheesecake he said recalling a bout with food poisoning after ordering room service from a sacramento hotel in the 2002 playoffs
1166393 so if im scared of cheesecake the night before a game ill probably just stay with the chicken and the steak
1166394 were going to try to get out a little bit wade said
1166395 we try to enjoy the experience wherever we go and hopefully we can do that and it not be too crazy
1166396 there are no jokes in islam there is no humour in islam there is no fun in islam

1166413 its an increasing problem as the number of buzzards and birds of prey goes up we wont notice it for a couple of years and by the time its obvious its too late
1166414 it needs the will to look at it as an ecological problem and see how many of these species can we tolerate if we want to have the other birds about moorland is a very fragile habitat
1166415 whenever people have applied for a licence to control buzzards they have been turned down
1166416 there might be some people who think what are we going to do they might resort to poisoning
1166417 its totally wrong but if the law is completely inflexible that may be a reason why its happening no one wants to poison things and its a crime with quite a big ticket but there will be some people who think they have got no option
1166418 no single species should have more protection than any other species
1166419 we do not condone the breaking of the law in any shape or form but we make no secret of the fact we would like to see the law changed
1166420 history tells us and also the ecology of the birds tells us that allowing control of species such as raptors is not a good thing because they are quite vulnerable to increased mortality
1166421 they are at the top of the food chain if you remove them we know their populations are quite slow to recover
1166422 lets look at the question that is being asked is there dna from madeleine on the swab
1166423 it would be very simple to say yes simply because of the number of components within the result that are also in her reference sample
1166424 what we need to consider as scientists is whether the match is genuine because madeleine has deposited dna as a result of being in the car or whether madeleine merely appears to match the result by chance
1166425 we cannot answer the question is the match genuine or is it a chance match
1166426 it would appear they were seeking to apply pressure by overstating the evidence that they had and frankly it is a scandal
1166427 confronted with the fact that madeleines dna was gathered from behind the sofa and from the boot of the vehicle and analysed by a british laboratory he said he could not explain why this would be
1166428 i can confirm that the portuguese police put it to gerry as a fact that madeleines dna had been found in the apartment and the vehicle when it is now clear that that was not the case and that the initial fss report had said the findings were inconclusive
1166429 you have to ask what the police were trying to achieve by over presenting evidence that they did not have and clearly could not claim to have
1166430 is it true that sometimes you despaired with your childrens behaviour and that left you feeling very uneasy
1166431 is it true that in england you even considered handing over madeleines custody to a relative
1166432 did you have any responsibility or intervention in your daughters disappearance
1166433 are you aware that in not answering the questions you are jeopardising the investigation which seeks to discover what happened to your daughter
1166434 stretched more than ideally than they could have been in flying the plane safely
1166435 balpa has for some time sought to engage the airline in discussion about how it might review its own culture but to date there has been no positive response in fact there has been no response other than threats of legal action
1166436 for the moment passengers will give flyglobespan the benefit of the doubt but the airline will have to watch because if there are any more safety related issues people may start to lose confidence
1166437 we have always maintained that this was a genuine mistake of technical interpretation which at no time put passengers in danger
1166438 a heavy loss for the whole of russia we are proud that alexander isayevich solzhenitsyn was our countryman and contemporary we will remember him as a strong brave person with enormous dignity
1166439 like millions of citizens solzhenitsyn lived through tough times he was one of the first to talk about the inhumane stalinist regime and about the people who experienced it but were not broken until the end of his days he fought for russia not only to move away from its totalitarian past but also to have a worthy future to become a truly free and democratic country we owe him a lot
1166440 his intransigence his ideals and his long eventful life make solzhenitsyn a hero from a novel an heir to dostoyevsky he belongs to the pantheon of world history i pay homage to his memory
1166441 he soon got up and complained of pain he periodically lost consciousness we called the ambulance
1166442 undoubtedly russia has turned some kind of corner under putin look around you this is not a country where people cower in fear
1166443 he always told it how it was not how people wanted him to tell it despite all the changes in society he held to his judgment
1166444 i wont deny that he is a noted figure in russian history
1166445 but in terms of his positions as a citizen he was contentious
1166446 these are people who were larger than life this is a generation its a full generation and its very sad to see its last representative go
1166447 solzhenitsyn is a notable writer but his political views are an embarrassment even to his fellow dissidents not only would a meeting with the president offend the soviets but it would raise some controversy about solzhenitsyns views of the united states and its allies
1166448 instead of secluding myself here and writing the red wheel i suppose i could have spent time making myself likeable to the west the only problem is that i would have had to drop my way of life and my work
1166449 athletes from across scotland and the rest of the uk will be taking part in the beijing olympics and fans should be allowed to show their support by waving the national flag of their choice
1166450 with participants like andy murray often wearing saltires on their kit as a symbol of national pride it will be a shame if fans are not able to echo that by waving saltires from the stands
1166451 i will be writing to the british olympic association and the international olympic committee urging them to challenge this ruling
1166452 chinas crackdown on any show of support for tibet including the flying of flags is out of keeping with the olympic spirit and will raise many concerns as to chinas commitment to improve free speech and expression in the run up to the games
1166453 that it will have this unfortunate side effect for anyone wanting to fly a saltire or the english welsh or northern irish flag may focus peoples minds on the need for further dialogue between china and tibet
1166454 it is rule 51 of the ioc and we have to abide by that i cant comment on how well the rule has been policed in the past but it has always existed
1166455 flags of non members of the olympics or paralympics flags or banners larger than 2m x 1m flagpoles any banners slogans fliers brochures or samples
1166456 andy jamie and the other members of the olympic squad will be playing for scotland england wales and northern ireland
1166457 the fact andy is playing for great britain in no way diminishes the pride fellow scots will feel watching andy play and his fans all over the world will continue to support him all the way

1166477 im willing to admit that ive been going through a very bad time with depression
1166478 ive finally decided to get professional help its not something that blossomed up overnight im on medication trying to get better
1166479 ive really had a lot on my mind really been contemplating a lot of things
1166480 in the state that im in had he reported i would be at training camp physically but mentally i could have gotten myself hurt or gotten one of my teammates hurt
1166481 but i have a meeting with my doc on thursday and hopefully ill be up that way on friday
1166482 pharmacologic concentrations of ascorbate the chemical name for vitamin c decreased tumour volumes 41 53 per cent in diverse cancer types known for both their aggressive growth and limited treatment options
1166483 this is encouraging work but its at a very early stage because it involves cells grown in the lab and mice
1166484 it is a very powerful and symbolic attack because security in xinjiang is at an all time high
1166485 we are confident the chinese authorities have done everything possible to ensure the security and safety of everyone at the games
1166486 the snps discredited lit proposals have been exposed as unworkable undeliverable and unfair it is now for scottish labour to fill the vacuum left by the snp
1166487 its a step in the right direction for one of their leadership contenders to be considering land value tax
1166488 this is exactly the sort of fresh idea we wanted to see in this leadership election
1166489 we are absolutely devastated by the events of the past week and the loss of ben and catherine we would like to thank our friends and family for their kindness
1166490 the reservoir topped out and had washed away a large part of the earthworks at the back of the dam which has left it very stretched
1166491 if there was a catastrophic breach of the dam then you can imagine the effect that the debris trees and boulders pouring down the burn would have
1166492 when the police asked us to leave it was not a question of if it was when it was going to burst its banks
1166493 was designed to be an entertaining travelogue the programme makers had a responsibility to be accurate when presenting the facts
1166494 this was particularly important when stating facts about a recent historic event such as the wars of the former republic of yugoslavia which were a matter of political controversy
1166495 there will be a child concern report issued in this case as we have concerns that there was nobody looking after this child
1166496 it is a terrible tragedy that this man has been killed for a small amount of money so that the murderer a self confessed grand theft auto addict could continue to play the computer game
1166497 clearly these violent games can have a very serious and negative effect on the people that play them as this man said murder seemed so easy in the game
1166498 i am not an advocate of censorship what we need is to ensure that those under 18 are not given access to violent games and violent films
1166499 its like if someone asks a kid who plays football not to play i love bulls very much fighting them is my decision if people are worried about me they shouldnt come to see me
1166500 because he is a star in his country and he fights in corridas aiming to kill
1166501 michelito is a bullfighting star disguising as the pupil of a bullfighting school they cant make me believe that this boy who kills bulls in the arenas of mexico is performing for free in france
1166502 i am getting ready to lodge a formal complaint for slander we are being called unworthy parents when my son just wants to live out his own passion
1166503 he is enrolled in the normal way at the merida bullfighting school in mexico which is associated with the international association of bullfighting schools we respect all the rules
1166504 its a sporting activity like any other if we have to ban it because it is dangerous then it will be necessary to extend this to horse riding skateboarding rugby or skiing
1166505 theres no indication that either alcohol or drugs were involved
1166506 i have rarely seen a situation of this kind outside a war zone this looks like what i have seen at certain times in southern lebanon it looks like it has been bombed
1166507 the tornado came out of nowhere and left total chaos behind it in five villages
1166508 it took down power and phone lines and damaged or destroyed almost everything in its way then by 2am on monday it had disappeared
1166509 letting nature take its course is advertisement probably the only option to be honest it is obviously very sad but it doesnt look like theres much anyone can do now
1166510 sperm whales are deep sea animals that usually live and feed in the deep waters beyond the continental shelf to the north and west of scotland they are occasionally seen in northern areas of the north sea
1166511 the southern waters of the north sea are widely regarded as a whale trap because they are shallow and the soft sea bed is likely to confuse the animals which use echo location to navigate
1166512 the inner moray firth which narrows sharply at channory point where the whale was last seen is likely to be very difficult for it to navigate
1166513 in this part of the world most of the animals are male and a male sperm whale can weigh up to 50 tonnes and be 60ft long
1166514 like the northern bottlenose whale that stranded last week in hampshire this is another deep sea animal outside its normal habitat
1166515 the sperm whale is in very shallow water and doesnt look to be in very good condition at all
1166516 it is likely that it wouldnt survive even if we were able to get it back out to sea it is a very large animal and it would be impossible to refloat it should it become stranded
1166517 letting nature take its course is probably the only option to be honest
1166518 it probably will strand at some point and there is unfortunately nothing much we can do for a huge sperm whale like that
1166519 i would like to be more positive but this is a deep diving species and its in an estuary as opposed to the ocean it doesnt look good for the creature unfortunately
1166520 it could still head out to sea but that looks unlikely there is nothing we can do
1166521 bill risks conflating the roles of parliament and the judiciary which would be quite inappropriate
1166522 we are concerned that some of the proposals being put forward by the government in the counter terrorism bill would place inappropriate responsibilities on parliament
1166523 we are deeply concerned that the independence of the judiciary may appear to be undermined and that trials may be prejudiced we are also critical of the proposal that ministers should be able to order that an inquest be held without a jury
1166524 its a days wages sepa lose their leverage because those responsible realise this is as bad as it gets
1166525 the fines available to the courts are too low and even then they typically fail to exact the full penalty
1166526 we need to look at how the fiscals are presenting the arguments and what fines they are asking for
1166527 the fiscal has to stand up and say there has been a major environmental impact

1166531 it wasnt the easy choice it was the hard choice i lost my gi bill my veterans benefits but i did whats right and ive still got my pride
1166532 well you know what i think its come out that you know these people had nothing to do with 9 11 there was no iraqi on those planes we can see around here theres no al qaida theres no terrorist syndicates in baghdad or iraq saddam had stamped em out
1166533 well you know were here to find weapons of mass destruction
1166534 all were trying to do is make it home alive

1166536 the war resisters support campaign is calling on supporters across canada to urgently continue to put pressure on the minority conservative government to immediately cease deportation proceedings against other us war resisters and to respect the will of canadians and their elected representatives by implementing the motion adopted by parliament on june 3rd
1166537 frankly ministry of health has a heavy weight on the budget of the state for offering free treatment inside iraq for sending the patients outside iraq very heavy budget thats affecting the budget of the state there is no neighboring countries or all over the world any country there is not country like us that offers free treatment

1166542 in the former iraqi air force headquarters the family set up a makeshift home in the former iraqi air force headquarters there were no government services sewage ran through the streets and the childrens toys were scraps of metal rubble and garbage times seemed grim but now jassim looks back on those days as carefree about four years ago bandits stopped her husband and demanded his car his most valuable possession he refused and he paid with his life

1166544 to vote for the second time on the elections bill which must be approved before elections can be held in the countrys 18 provinces but the session never convened because kurdish arab and turkmen lawmakers were unable to reach an agreement on kirkuk where their respective ethnic groups are locked in a struggle for land and resources
1166545 u s officials believe the elections initially scheduled for october are necessary for iraqs long term stability sunni arabs formerly the countrys elite boycotted the last such elections in january 2005 leading to the creation of provincial councils dominated by shiite muslims and kurds the absence of sunni muslims from local government helped strengthen the sunni led insurgency across central and northern iraq the stalemate emphasized the fissurges and entrenched positions among arabs turkmens and kurds in northern iraq which often threatens to spill over into violence

1166554 this was the site of the old botanics immediately before it moved to inverleith
1166555 it is really exciting that the house will be looked at by professional archaeologists and researchers and secrets will be unearthed for all to see
1166556 we might find proof in the archives that it was actually built by john adam as the centre piece for the leith walk royal botanic garden and that would be an exciting discovery
1166557 our grant will mean that the secret histories of botanic cottage can be revealed and shared and that people can learn about it long after the building itself has disappeared
1166558 we do definitely have prisoners with dementia although its not possible to say exactly how many we have people in our prisons with all manner of medical conditions the only exceptions would be those people with terminal advertisement illness who have a few months to live that are better suited to hospital treatment
1166559 there are a lot of dementia sufferers who are not violent and there may be questions about how to deal with this individual if he does not adhere to his restriction of liberty order
1166560 the key thing in this particular case is that the judge has seen all the relevant medical reports i am satisfied that the normal sentencing considerations could not be applied
1166561 its an image boosting operation that risks turning into a boomerang

1166563 paratroopers guarding the centres of the major tourist cities arent exactly a great calling card for a country at the height of the tourist season
1166564 i really dont see the need for this it will have a completely negative effect i have already had people asking me if there is some sort of civil war going on
1166565 i think its very sad and a bit repressive i would have expected to see soldiers in a south american banana republic not a european capital
1166566 we saw the troops arriving from the bus and everyone broke out into applause it was time i feel safer the gypsies wont try to steal my bag or my purse
1166567 this morning the many gypsies who are normally stationed outside arent here thats already an encouraging sign
1166568 investing is about making money theres nothing moral about it

1166570 these guys representing the bank are doing their job however they need to give us a break because the landlord did not tell us
1166571 it could be costly because the tenant could be paying three times the rent

1166573 my son and i are either going to have to call a friends house or stay in a hotel until we find an apartment

1166578 trying to play politics with an extremely serious issue is typical of the first minister and this issue is of huge importance to many of my constituents
1166579 instead of trying and failing to ingratiate himself on the world stage mr salmond should turn his mind to reducing class sizes making our streets safer and helping people affected by the credit crunch
1166580 scotland has got two parliaments and two governments and alex salmond needs to stop grandstanding on the world stage and get on with what he was elected to do
1166581 the purpose of the first ministers letter was to clearly state our opposition and that of the scottish parliament people of scotland and scottish civic society to these abhorrent weapons of mass destruction
1166582 it is all the more important because nuclear weapons are based on scottish soil against the will of the scottish people
1166583 it is wrong to say that this is a completely reserved matter
1166584 the scottish government does have powers in terms of planning and transport that are relevant in this area
1166585 indeed we intend to continue to look at ways in which we can use these powers to remove these weapons
1166586 there will also be a range of events where ministers will engage with the people of the region and that is consistent with the governments approach towards engagement and consultation the prime minister has always made it clear he wants to listen and learn from the experience of people and the challenges they face in their daily lives
1166587 imitation is the sincerest form of flattery gordon brown is listening learning and stealing ideas from the snp
1166588 the prime minister remains in charge while he is on holiday he continues to remain closely involved in all the issues

1166590 in japan these two series are considered masterpieces of the form along the lines of katsuhiro otomo s akira and takehiko inoue s vagabond with our other new releases for 2009 were extremely excited this season to be presenting some of the absolute best the manga medium has to offer

1166595 we wont stand them down because to make them play is punishment enough
1166596 you have to say given the things that have been afforded to collingwood and mick malthouse they havent got the job done
1166597 no expense has been foresaken they have the lexus centre they go off for their altitude training they have the best of everything whatever they want more than any other club
1166598 if you weigh everything up like in a business you really have to question whether they have got the job done
1166599 maybe were expecting too much of this group at this stage i dont know
1166600 but they probably havent lived up to expectations at this point of the season
1166601 they go very wide and short they have no long runners and there is no flair in the midfield
1166602 i dont think micks done anything to spice them up a bit
1166603 collingwood does work hard they play a bash and crash style and have a terrific workrate and to their credit they have fashioned some deserved wins
1166604 but there are not many games they kick easy goals every game is hard work
1166605 you just cant sustain that style of game for 22 weeks
1166606 having looked at the team from the outside i think defensively collingwood is very light on
1166607 they work their butts off to create goals but then give up easy ones at the other end they definitely cant handle big bodies defensively
1166608 knowledge is just opinion that you trust enough to act upon

1166627 fernando adalah pembalap luar biasa yang bakal menjadi aset fantastis bagi tim manapun termasuk yang ini
1166628 apa yang ross brawn dan saya lakukan adalah membangun tim juara dunia
1166629 situasi ini tidak beda tottenham telah menawarkan kepada kami sebesar 15 juta pounds untuk andrei namun itu tak cukup bagi kami kami akan menunggu proposal baru
1166630 informasi tersebut tidaklah benar situasi tetap tidak berubah sejak dick advocaat terakhir memberikan komentar mengenai hal tersebut
1166631 saya tidak menilai absennya beberapa pemain bakal banyak mempengaruhi kami dan karena alasan tersebut kami tidak akan kembali ke pasar transfer
1166632 was uns selbst nicht gut tut ist auch f r den hund schlecht
1166633 nur bei starkem ungehorsam und das wird dann auch dokumentiert allerdings w rden wir hunde aussondern denen man immer wieder damit weh tun m sste das bringt nichts
1166634 it is very hard to imagine how we can see a world growing enough crops to produce renewable energy and at the same time meet the enormous increase in the demand for food which is quite properly going to happen as we alleviate poverty
1166635 it is vital that all airport expansion in london and the south east including heathrow is halted now as it is completely contrary to the growing evidence on the role of aviation in contributing towards catastrophic climate change
1166636 rather than more runways and plane journeys we must cut carbon emissions by using energy more efficiently the governments own figures show air travel produces two to three times more carbon emissions than making the same trip by rail
1166637 expansion would also have a huge impact on road congestion and pollution with more plane journeys leading to more traffic congestion and pollution from cars
1166638 the expansion of heathrow will take much needed green space and mean the complete destruction of sipson village home to over 1 000 people
1166639 so on every test environment economic and quality of life the argument for expanding heathrow has not been made and i dont believe it ever can we have a duty to protect our environment not just for us but the generations who will come after us
1166640 we know that huge numbers of people in london and across the rest of the country support our case
1166641 they agree with us that it would be bad for london that it is unfair and sends the wrong message about what sort of a city london is whilst having no meaningful benefit on the environment
1166642 the proposed changes would result an increase in congestion as people switch to low co2 vehicles for london use whilst retaining their larger vehicles for travelling outside of london
1166643 a dramatic increase in co2 from the production of those additional vehicles that will inevitably be purchased
1166644 the majority of our co2 emissions come from other sources farming energy production and air travel contribute far more yet we are doing little to face or attempt to tackle this
1166645 there is also a real danger that desire to reduce co2 will overtake the need for a strong economy and we risk destroying our financial stability and reputation if we ignore this fact
1166646 no a net reduction surely this helps x heavy polluting cars off the roads for five days a week at least the owners couldnt be driving the old gas guzzlers and their new green cars at the same time surely
1166647 and at every turn people say ill change if they will if people wont even give up driving petrol powered porsches how about an electric one instead then what chance do we have why should an indian villager make changes in his life if we bitterly resent someone who suggests that we could manage without that tumble dryer maybe
1166648 one thing we can learn from history is that the human race is quite resilient which is why we dominate this planet in such a gigantic way we must adapt and change with the planet to a certain degree which is what weve been doing for thousands of years
1166649 there is no ps3 version of left 4 dead currently in production
1166650 basically the psp version was cancelled because of control issues
1166651 dah big willy unleashed was designed by a wii developer specifically for the wii when it was ported over to the psp the controls simply didnt translate well and instead of pushing out the product with translated controls it was cancelled
1166652 with the writers strike it took so long to get underway and roger avary the writer had a commitment that was in line before working the wolfenstein stuff but ive recently been in contact with roger and hes actually working on the script right now
1166653 theres some contract provisions and if they dont have certain things done within a certain period of time they cant just sit on the rights forever and not use them
1166654 being robbed the person actually defended himself by shooting the assailant the assailant ran away
1166655 he felt that he was in a dangerous area so he carried a gun on him or nearby so he had a gun available to him and you know the rest
1166656 when you were a little child like around 3 or 4 years old did you always understand why your parents did the things they did now looking back do you feel you understand more today do you think as you grow to become an adult yourself you will understand your parents past actions even more
1166657 its like that with god we are now like very little children to god there is no way we can understand why he does certain things or why he allows certain things to happen yet someday maybe not until we are in heaven we may understand
1166658 where are the musicians this time around how come theyre not protesting
1166659 outgoing users in the specified domain can authenticate in the local domain but users in the local domain cannot authenticate in the specified domain
1166660 i do not believe that we should use this strategic oil reserves at this point
1166661 i have said and in fact supported a congressional resolution that said that we should suspend putting more oil into the strategic oil reserve but the strategic oil reserve i think has to be reserved for a genuine emergency
1166662 senator obama has looked at the issue he recognized that americans are suffering that we have a unique situation with rising gas prices
1166663 this is one occasions where we really need to look at this strategically and he made the decision that we do need to tap the strategic petroleum reserve
1166664 you can see mine here and there in the video especially around 00 32
1166665 pero vosotros comet is el agravio y defraud is y esto a los hermanos no sab is que los injustos no heredar n el reino de dios no err is ni los fornicarios ni los id latras ni los ad lteros ni los afeminados ni los que se echan con varones ni los ladrones ni los avaros ni los borrachos ni los maldicientes ni los estafadores heredar n el reino de dios
1166666 oh almas ad lteras no sab is que la amistad del mundo es enemistad contra dios cualquiera pues que quiera ser amigo del mundo se constituye enemigo de dios
1166667 porque de tal manera am dios al mundo que ha dado a su hijo unig nito para que todo aquel que en l cree no se pierda mas tenga vida eterna
1166668 por tanto os digo todo pecado y blasfemia ser perdonado a los hombres mas la blasfemia contra el esp ritu no les ser perdonada
1166669 mas vosotros no viv s seg n la carne sino seg n el esp ritu si es que el esp ritu de dios mora en vosotros y si alguno no tiene el esp ritu de cristo no es de l
1166670 porque si pec remos voluntariamente despu s de haber recibido el conocimiento de la verdad ya no queda m s sacrificio por los pecados sino una horrenda expectaci n de juicio y de hervor de fuego que ha de devorar a los adversarios el que viola la ley de mois s por el testimonio de dos o de tres testigos muere irremisiblemente
1166671 ni los afeminados ni los que se echan con varones
1166672 y si hijos tambi n herederos herederos de dios y coheredero s con cristo si es que padecemos juntamente con l para que juntamente con l seamos glorificados
1166673 porque del coraz n salen los malos pensamientos los homicidios los adulterios las fornicaciones los hurtos los falsos testimonios las blasfemias
1166674 pero yo os digo que cualquiera que mira a una mujer para codiciarla ya adulter con ella en su coraz n
1166675 pues habiendo conocido a dios no le glorificaron como a dios ni le dieron gracias sino que se envanecieron en sus razonamientos y su necio coraz n fue entenebrecido

1166677 the average biotech bull market has been good for 566 gains in under three years
1166678 biotech giant genentech shot up as big pharmaceutical company roche offered to buy it out completely
1166679 if 100 billion genentech can sell to a big pharma company then every biotech stock has to be in play right now and biotech just went from the back pages to the front pages this is when you want to be a buyer
1166680 biotech has been the quiet performer this year oil bank stocks and real estate have garnered all the headlines but biotech has been the stealth winner shares of the s amp p biotech index fund have quietly hit new highs
1166681 consider the rydex biotech fund for example back in 2000 during the last biotech peak this fund had 1 4 billion invested then for eight years biotech stocks did nothing
1166682 assets in the fund absolutely collapsed bottoming earlier this year at around 60 million thats more than a 95 fall in assets but whats this in just the last few weeks assets in the fund have more than doubled investors are quietly creeping in
1166683 biotechs are an exceptional bargain now when you size them up on simple traditional measures of biotech value like price to sales for instance in short while the companies stock prices have done nothing in eight years their businesses have kept growing so shares are a great value
1166684 if you catch just one biotech bull market youll never have to work again and now we have our catalyst to get biotech from the back pages of the money section to the front the genentech offer from roche
1166685 one simple way to buy into biotech is through the s amp p biotech etf xbi but no matter how you do it now is finally the time biotechs next big bull market should be starting right now
1166686 i accept this as an assignment from god i feel a stirring in my spirit
1166687 the one who breaks open will come up before them they will break out pass through the gate and go out by it their king will pass before them with the lord at their head
1166688 what do you mean they dont want me in the new star trek movie im jonathan friggin frakes im the only star trek alum to have a successful directing career what do you mean you didnt see clockstoppers it was huge in laos well i guess i just have a more global perspective than you tell j j abrams to call me ill be at the pay phone on 59th and lexington at 4 00
1166689 my 13 year old matthew loved starship troopers and i was a fan too
1166690 i believe this one will join the ranks of cult classics that we all enjoy in the sf genre im extremely proud to have it as a notch on my bedpost
1166691 because they went in a different direction and didnt bring any of the characters back also in starship troopers 2 hero of the federation they did away with the political satire and fednet messages
1166692 my character is captain lola beck whos a pilot then theres dix hauser played by casper van dien returns as johnny its the tale of the three of them and their adventures together
1166693 i dont know why he didnt direct the first two he has directing in his blood hes incredible ive worked with quite a few directors and a few first time directors as well ed was absolutely stellar stunning just incredible he operates like a mad scientist a little of this a little of that and then he makes something go boom it was a pleasure working with him ed gave us lots of liberties
1166694 it was in such a way that it was a group effort it was how about this how about that then we would get down to something
1166695 my favorite part of the movie it was great to be in his presence to pick his brain to work with him on my character on the film itself on the storyline ed gets the message across i think the political satire and the fednet advertising are essential to the movie as a whole eds a gentleman and its a pleasure to know him
1166696 in that when we went to south africa to shoot we happened to catch the movie industry over there at a lull and we were able to get the best of the best crew they were absolutely incredible we truly had an a team
1166697 robert created an actual physical bug or rather two of them
1166698 these were actual constructions that moved and were operated by wires and pulleys somehow electronically there were times when we needed an arm to move and it didnt want to but in the end it all worked out well
1166699 i had dinner on the beach with a crush and there were lights on the palm trees then went walking on the beach and after that we slow danced wait it gets better while we were slow dancing my crush and i had our first kiss and after it i leaned back and i said you cheated and he said why and i said i dont kiss on the first date then he said well i never really play by the rules i was waiting for a a director to say cut i was like are we shooting this right now
1166700 on one date the girl said to me i dont kiss on the first date
1166701 so its official nick jonas and selena gomez are dating
1166702 t his interview will open many peoples eyes it will shake islam from the roots and im not exaggerating
1166703 what other case do you know where a son of a hamas leader who was raised on the tenets of extremist islam comes out against it
1166704 a verse like love thine enemy had a great influence on me
1166705 at this stage i was still a muslim and i thought that i would remain one but every day i saw the terrible things done in the name of religion by those who considered themselves great believers
1166706 i studied islam more thoroughly and found no answers there i re examined the koran and the principals of the faith and found how it is mistaken and misleading
1166707 the people who supposedly represent the religion admired mohammed more than god killed innocent people in the name of islam beat their wives and dont have any idea what god is
1166708 i have no doubt that theyll go to hell i have a message for them there is only one way to paradise the way of jesus who sacrificed himself on the cross for all of us
1166709 i felt responsible it was better for me to be there rather than a gang of fools who would poison his mind
1166710 i tried to understand those people their thoughts in order to change them from inside by means of a strong person like my father who admitted to me in the past that he does not support suicide attacks
1166711 there is clearly a dysfunctional relationship between those elements that are essential to the criminal justice system stated government policy legislation including subsidiary legislation rules and guidance and sentencing practice in terms of decision taken by sentencers this is not a new problem but it is now essential for the nettle to be grasped
1166712 the criminal justice act 2003 is a particular example of legislation which was not thought through and had inadequate provision for its implementation
1166713 what were we thinking how could we have been so wrong the new way is clearly so much better
1166714 given the current tough economic times for the consumer people are looking for reasonably priced merchandise tvs computers electronics so thats really driven growth for them
1166715 plus we saw a benefit this quarter too with the economic stimulus checks helping out the pawn companies
1166716 forgiveness is only for those who deserve it or earn it

1166723 rogerborg on july 25 2008 said as an historic reenactor i regularly go on jaunts with a bootload of blunt but heavy cutlery sometimes with plenty of documentation to hand sometimes not i know that its only a matter of time before im lifted by some desperate or ambitious copper whos behind on his sanctioned detections
1166724 get the distinct impression from pauls experiences that a significant part of the problem is that child protection has gone bananas
1166725 mop on july 26 2008 said on the one hand i would like people to learn to work but so many of the underclass lack the skills that any effort on welfare reform should have an educational component
1166726 extra tenner then it was called something else then when that did not work something else
1166727 get them out of our unemployment figures for election time
1166728 you havent hit anyone for ten whole minutes heres a prize
1166729 to be fair we do need to give the scrotes better life chances
1166730 reforming welfare would be a good place to start but i do worry that it will fail to root out the most cunning claimants it could damage the mentally ill and i am uncertain that the private sector will contribute as much as the politicians want
1166731 isnt there a very strong case that there are some people who because of the endemic cyclic problems within the family passed down from generation to generation that they should be stopped from having kids
1166732 thespecialone on july 27 2008 said isnt there a very strong case that there are some people who because of the endemic cyclic problems within the family passed down from generation to generation that they should be stopped from having kids
1166733 thus i believe that any progress will be slow and we should not
1166734 greater effort needs to be made to enforce discipline at schools and amongst the
1166735 oh and the canoe couple fraud is theft and i see no reason to punish white collar criminals any less than blue collar ones
1166736 anything you try and do because you are decent and staightforward hurts you badly act like an habitual professional lifestyle criminal and chances are you will walk away relatively unscathed
1166737 please smoke a bit further away from the window near my sick infant
1166738 the police showed up a bit later and pointed out that the child could be taken to social services while the friend was arrested
1166739 would it really have been better to not admit to dumping the water and asking for a solicitor
1166740 yes i did pour a glass of water on him he called me a bitch and would not comply with my polite and reasonable request its hardly a major issue is it
1166741 especially the part about complaining about the officers surely that would curry no favours and would be more likely to get one in trouble
1166742 every time someone comes up here who can run everyone says damn hes exciting well this kids steady has good at bats kind of looks like bill mueller im not sure thats not exciting

1166748 we really are pleased with the public support of the tru2way platform by so many major companies in the consumer electronics information technology content and cable industries
1166749 the bbc deceived its audience by faking winners of competitions and deliberately conducting competitions unfairly the investigations found that in some cases the production team had taken pre mediated sic decisions to broadcast competitions and encourage listeners to enter in the full knowledge that the audience stood no chance of winning in other cases programs faced with technical problems made up the names of winners
1166750 we have taken these issues extremely seriously from the outset apologizing to our audiences and putting in place an unprecedented action plan to tackle the issues raised this includes a comprehensive program of training for over 19 000 staff rigorous new technical protections new guidance to program makers on the running of competitions and a strict new code of conduct ofcom has recognized that neither the bbc nor any member of staff made any money from these serious editorial lapses whilst we must never be complacent and must remain constantly vigilant audience research suggests the comprehensive action we have taken is rebuilding the trust of viewers and listeners
1166751 while consumers today have a clear desire to experience web media on the television they are often paralyzed by the need to choose among a number of conflicting technological options

1166753 the enormous market fragmentation in web to tv solutions makes it difficult for us to author interactive and timely content for many diverse platforms

1166755 activevideos high levels of usage and the ability to deliver deeply personalized content to individual consumers hold clear value to the advertising industry for building brand awareness and driving transactions
1166756 todd m nisbets interactive expertise and his background with both clients and agencies will accelerate our creation of advertising models and strategies that help programmers operators and ce manufacturers to monetize the activevideo experience
1166757 the one to one ability to deliver the right ad to the right viewer at the right time on television continues to be the ultimate goal for the advertising community the models we are creating will help marketers to engage viewers in the living room using the same standards based creation targeting and distribution mechanisms that have spurred the growth of web ads and commerce relevancy is the advertising backbone of the activevideo platform what we have deployed in the market today is proven to be better tv for everyone
1166758 the results are clear by making their programming available through the cbs audience network cbs has expanded the reach and audience for its content without impacting their traditional television viewership

1166760 everyone knows that the world of entertainment is quickly shifting to digital video from the creation of original webisodes and home videos to streaming tv shows online and an increasing amount of high definition programming

1166777 the truth of the matter is that coach kramer was in no position to deter the highly irresponsible acts of those who were no longer connected to msus football program
1166778 um did not terminate the um head football coachs employment contract or even criticize the head football coach instead um as it should have supported the head coach
1166779 coach kramer was fired humiliated and his professional career completely decimated by the montana state university system while the other head football coach was endorsed and supported

1166890 the current countermeasure to this dns cache poisoning vulnerability is to introduce increased entropy by forcing randomization of the query id and the source port essentially making it all the more difficult to spoof the dns response
1166891 however it appears that apple forgot something the client libraries on my os x 10 4 11 system post patch install still does not randomize the source port
1166892 the bottom line is that despite this update it appears that the client libraries still arent patched
1166893 apple might have fixed some of the more important parts for servers but is far from done yet as all the clients linked against a dns client library still need to get the workaround for the protocol weakness
1166894 in these cases the network device performing pat port address translation uses a predictable source port allocation policy such as incremental allocation when performing the layer 4 rewrite operation that is necessary for pat

1167223 de filosoof arnold cornelis zegt dat ieder van ons een verborgen programma in zich draagt vanuit dat programma dat zich in de tijd ontvouwt ontwikkelen we ons dat gebeurt onbewust eerst zijn we nog volop bezig met iets dat ons tot dan toe bevredigde het volgende moment klopt er iets niet meer ervaar je een kortsluiting tussen jezelf en je omgeving uitgeblust burn out er is iets veranderd het verborgen programma brengt je zonder dat je je dat bewust bent in een volgende fase dat betekent dat iedereen van tijd tot tijd overgangen ervaart van de ene fase in zijn leven naar de andere dat brengt pijn en onzekerheden met zich mee en emoties die arnold cornelis benoemt als angst boosheid en verdriet hij beschrijft ook hoe de externe tijd die wij als drukte tijdsdruk deadlines ervaren ons vaak zozeer domineert dat we niet de tijd nemen om die emoties toe te laten en ons verhindert om te luisteren naar de signalen die het verborgen programma uitzendt over de weg die we in deze volgende fase zouden moeten gaan het kan zijn dat jouw verborgen programma iets wil dat niet meer aansluit bij jouw oorspronkelijke vertrouwde omgeving het kan zijn dat de externe sturing vanuit die omgeving haaks staat op de interne sturing die je vanuit het verborgen programma ervaart soms is een klein initiatief opnieuw afstemmen waar jij en de ander en heen willen voldoende om de situatie weer aan te passen aan jouw ontwikkelingsfase soms is een meer radicale stap nodig serieuze reflectie een denkpauze tijd voor iets anders cornelis gaat ervan uit dat je spiegels nodig hebt om je van je innerlijke ontwikkelingsproces bewust te worden als je door anderen wordt gespiegeld zie je beter waar je op uit bent wat je wilt en vooral wat er daarin verandert en veranderd is als je jezelf wilt sturen vanuit de ontwikkeling van het verborgen programma is het goed om gesprekspartners te zoeken via deze communicatieve zelfsturing wordt ook beter duidelijk welke mogelijkheden de wereld biedt voor de behoeften en kwaliteiten die uit het verborgen programma naar voren gekomen zijn zo is het raadzaam om voldoende tijd te nemen extern tijd te reserveren om te luisteren naar de signalen vanuit je interne ontwikkelingsproces en ze niet als irrationele emotionele stoorzenders af te doen onzeker en gefocust als we vaak zijn op de signalen uit de buitenwereld aardig gevonden willen worden maatschappelijk slagen besteden we vaak veel meer aandacht aan datgene dat zich van buitenaf aan ons bewustzijn opdringt status dan aan datgene wat zich van binnenuit laat horen zelfzorg maar of je er nu naar wilt luisteren of niet als je er niet op reageert worden de signalen steeds sterker net zo lang totdat je er wel naar luisteren moet en handelen wilt en dan ben je misschien al uitgeput heb je een burn out ben je depressief die burn out dient zich op steeds lagere leeftijd aan eind twintig begin dertig jaar is geen uitzondering niet leuk als je er in zit maar misschien als mogelijkheid om er tegenaan te kijken een vermomde zegen een geluk bij een ongeluk omdat het je aanzet tot verandering tot zoeken naar wat echt bij je past in plaats van door te modderen op een doodlopende weg cornelis zegt iets zeer treffends hij zegt hoe begaafder hoe gevoeliger hij bedoelt gevoeliger voor de signalen vanuit de ontwikkeling van ons verborgen programma voor angst boosheid en verdriet als waarschuwingssignalen voor een nakende kortsluiting tussen jezelf en de wereld en ontvankelijker voor geborgenheid energie en inspiratie van binnenuit als signalen voor harmonie en bevruchting tussen jouw ontwikkeling en de ontwikkeling van je omgeving veranderen leidt altijd naar meer meer betekenis meer inspiratie en daarmee plezier en nooit naar minder tenminste als je bereid bent je over te geven aan verandering vanuit het onontkoombare proces van het verborgen programma om actief op zoek te gaan naar de bevrediging van de nieuwe behoeften en wensen die van daaruit worden aangegeven misschien kun je daar ook voor kiezen niet alleen vanuit een soort opgedrongen noodzakelijkheid maar echt van binnenuit omdat de nieuwe fase berust op een besef van wat je achter je hebt moeten laten en ook niet meer terug wilt omdat je vaststelt dat je eerder iets niet wist wat je nu wel weet namelijk dat je oude ik je oude staat niet voor eeuwig kon voldoen en dat je hebt gezien waaraan het je ontbrak op het moment dat de voortgang van het verborgen programma je toonde wat dat was dus ga je onderweg en zoek je het pad dat overeenstemt met de richting die het verborgen programma je aangeeft alles is tijdelijk en het enige wat ons rest is te delen en genieten van de weg

1167232 our new research suggests that schizophrenia is a by product of the increased metabolic demands brought about during human brain evolution

1167240 based on these findings we concluded that male rats treated with olanzapine zyprexa experienced an early disruption of energy metabolism this was a result of the fat tissue we observed and the impairment in blood sugar regulation which are both associated with metabolic syndrome and subsequent risk of diabetes
1167241 of the 289 cases of diabetes linked to the use of olanzapine 225 were newly diagnosed cases one hundred patients developed ketosis a serious complication of diabetes and 22 people developed pancreatitis or inflammation of the pancreas which is a life threatening condition there were 23 deaths including that of a 15 year old adolescent who died of necrotizing pancreatitis a condition where the pancreas breaks down and dies most cases 71 percent occurred within six months of starting the drug and many cases were associated with moderate weight gain

1167243 students of game theory know what the refusal to disclose to skeptical sources indicates about the quality of the hidden information the refusal tells you you can safely assume the worst
1167244 the data in question is information about drug safety much of which that pharmaceuticals havent disclosed to the fda
1167245 perhaps it would be easier and in the long run more productive to abandon the attempt to force the data into the mold provided by darwin
1167246 darwins theory serves no important role in guiding modern experimental biology that branch of science simply makes no practical use of darwins theory

1167262 after the strong decrease of the arctic ice during the last summer climate scientists all around the world are constantly asked how will the ice develop in the next years
1167263 to answer this question we did not want to guess but to rely on sound calculations
1167264 through this we are still not able to make a definitive statement on sea ice cover in september this trick enables us to compute the bandwidth of possible ice covers and to quantify the probability of extreme events
1167265 it is a first test and all participating researchers are eager to know how their prognosis has fared at the end of the summer in the end this small competition serves the optimisation of our models so that we are able to improve our predictions concerning short term seasonal fluctuations

1167312 people who have seen this installation in jerusalem and the west bank tell me it has been quite cathartic for them but it has been a totally cathartic experience for me too
1167313 i have become a collector of tears so many people wept as they recalled what happened it was genuinely shocking and many people who came to the first showing at al hoash gallery in east jerusalem also broke down in tears for them it represents a gaping wound that has not yet healed

1167315 any reference to the nakbah or catastrophe means facing the facts about the events now termed ethnic cleansing that forced 750 000 palestinians into permanent exile
1167316 i approach this as an artist from a purely humanitarian and spiritual aspect although there are others who want to see any concern or compassion for these people who we should understand are victims of 1948 as taking some sort of political stance i reject that totally

1167326 labor has contested lyne for as long as anyone can recall when labor refuses to contest a seat they are removing competitive tension from the debate of issues in that seat
1167327 our democracy suffers this coming on top of the state electricity privatisation tells the grassroots of lyne that they are not wanted
1167328 twenty four thousand labor voters delivered to the state alp 50 000 in taxpayer dividends
1167329 nine months later they are denied their democratic right to choose by the same party why because federal labor is scared

1167365 at the end of the day we got the merger approved and good things are worth waiting for

1167367 given concerns about potential harmful effects and lack of evidence proving that these medications are effective in young children the fact that one in ten u s children is using one of these medications is striking
1167368 consumers believe that retailers like wal mart know the quality and safety of products they sell
1167369 retailers benefit from that trust and must be held accountable for the products they sell
1167370 not to be involved in wasteful dispute with the abc and the parties mutually have agreed not further to engage in litigation about the relevant contract
1167371 watpac recognises that the abc because of things unrelated to watpac has a particular sensitivity to any possible contamination of land in the vicinity of the site and prefers not to proceed to develop its new queensland headquarters on the site the subject of the contract

1167374 our may budget struck the right balance between fighting inflation on the one hand and investing in the future on the other
1167375 but we have perhaps the most difficult global conditions in over 25 years
1167376 you read the report and its almost a complete replication of what happened in bundaberg
1167377 and the really terrifying part is its still the same attempt by the bureaucracy to say its not our fault lets blame the doctors
1167378 but queensland health are to blame and the only change ive seen is that the bureaucrats are now smarter about how they get back at whistleblowers
1167379 they the commission do make the observation that the changes made would have gone a long way to stop this thing that happened in mackay from occurring again

1167385 the program shows how composers from three different centuries portrayed animals in music

1167387 the parker string quartet is one of the very best young quartets performing today
1167388 the concert features a great haydn quartet one of beethovens blockbuster quartets that marked the arrival of his heroic period and the dramatic jan ek quartet inspired by tolstoys novel the kreutzer sonata
1167389 we see this as an opportunity to celebrate chamber music as a lifelong pursuit that can be enjoyed and shared

1167399 the romans loved puns and anagrams which translators tend not to translate
1167400 in our thinking if something is funny it cannot in any way be serious but the ancients found that humor and earnestness went side by side almost all life contains the elements of the humorous and the pathetic and the touching and an epic poem certainly does
1167401 all the music notes for a score on one line

1167413 the analytical process we typically use to do our work understand the problem and alternatives develop several ideas and do a final external check with the customer gets flipped instead design thinking methods instruct theres an opportunity somewhere in this neighborhood use a broader consumer context to inform the opportunity brainstorm a large quantity of fresh ideas and co create and iterate using low resolution prototypes with that consumer

1167480 take me for instance the wolves have won me over in a little more than two years
1167481 or were born to peasants the han have a peasant mentality that impossible to break down and if they were transported out here id be surprised if they didnt skin every last wolf on the grassland were a farming race and a fear and hatred of wolves is in our bones how could we venerate a wolf totem we han worship the dragon king the one in charge of our agrarian lifeline our dragon totem the one we pay homage to the one to whom we meekly submit how can you expect people like that to learn from wolves to protect them to worship and yet kill them like the mongols only a peoples totem can truly rouse their ethnic spirit and character whether its a dragon or a wolf and so on in this vein for another several lines
1167482 it looks like your fascination with wolves was worth it
1167483 its contagious now when i read history i keep looking to the barbarian tribes of the four corners and am tempted to look for their connections to wolves
1167484 youre damned near a mongol yourself all you need is an infusion of wolf blood hybrids are always superior creatures
1167485 i cant tell you how happy i am that you urged me to come to the grassland
1167486 i think more explanation needs to be undertaken on the part of the government for people to really understand sana ang kanilang pananaw palawakin pa we hope people will have a wider perspective
1167487 it might be good for malaca ang to make its own survey of applause and cheer rating from well chosen individuals such as cabinet members loyalist senators and congressmen and beneficiary provincial city and municipal officials who knows it is probable that said people will give malaca ang a glorious rating
1167488 it would be good for the palace to provide some kind of a cheating mechanism to change the unwanted survey result after all cheating is not something alien to it

1167498 in the long term the media and advertising outlook for asia is tremendous as you see the emergence of a wealthy middle class
1167499 we dont see ourselves taking a stake in print because it is not available and because we wont want to take just a 26 per cent stake
1167500 the largest growth area in the medium to long term is regional tv
1167501 this is a clever move because the hindi and english language markets have so many channels and such pressure on advertising rates
1167502 for the big advertisers the main growth markets are the semi urban areas and that is still largely a local language market
1167503 if there was a competition for the country with the most pessimistic consumers the uk would be the winner
1167504 despite the undoubted pedigree of the competition the uk consumer easily wins the title of the most pessimistic in europe and probably the developed world even us confidence has been more resilient
1167505 not only does the uk win the title for the weakest of the lot it also takes the gold medal for diving the uk index has fallen most from peak to trough bellyflopping from the top diving board compared to irelands commendable performance from the lower three metre springboard
1167506 surging inflation and rising unemployment are likely to have been the main contributors given the recently announced huge increases in utility bills which came after the consumer confidence survey was conducted there remains scope for a further decline in the coming months
1167507 that was a period of not seeing the light at the end of the tunnel

1167519 they are believed to have looked at michael page before and there is strategic sense to a deal
1167520 the key obstacle for adecco would be convincing michael page that the two companies can work together michael page is a professional recruitment consultant they focus on recruiting lawyers accountants etc but adecco is focused on more general blue collar recruitment
1167521 we expect the uk leisure travel market to prove particularly tough in 2009 despite the self help capacity cuts being seen across the sector
1167522 it is not inconceivable that ongc and sinopec team up to avoid competing against each other
1167523 the probability of a deal now exceeds 50 per cent
1167524 given that we believe the double digit declines in ad revs are now priced in that the risks surrounding pension funding have been mitigated and management is tackling costs we believe that there is little near term downside in the stock

1167548 to adequately answer this i think we need to take a glance at the past century for more than a hundred years women have been tirelessly fighting for equal footing with men they have gone on hunger strikes been jailed for their beliefs and even given their lives to prove the point that as a sex they are just as able as any man however when the question of women being entered into the selective service arises these days i see many women get angry at the thought women who under other circumstances would be outraged to be slighted in favor of a man this subject makes hypocrites out of the best of us we cannot as a nation preach equality for women then say that they are too fragile or that it is unfair for them to be enlisted if you want to truly be equal heres our nations opportunity
1167549 heres a quick and easy response to that most definitely maybe with this question there are two sides to the story and we as a group of freedom loving citizens will dive in deep and pull up a most certain answer up from the depths of uncertainty the first side of the story unfolds like this women got the right to vote in 1920 they were finally given a say in our government finally women were thought of after a few more laws and amendments passed as equal to men so why not make them completely equal give them a chance in the military selective service is a service that makes men between the ages of 18 to 25 register with important information to the military in the unfortunate event of war the solution give women the option to sign up with selective service if they want to submit they can if they dont well they dont have to not like those select few wont be missing out on some secret party im pretty sure that those few will know when this party is happening war i did say there were two sides to this story the second side is as follows we change the name of our country to the united super strong race ussr we round up everyone that doesnt think this is a fantastic not good fantastic idea we then not including me force these carbuncles slaves to push canada and mexico away from us sounds like a failure pile to me so the first option is definitely the way to go no

1167558 i am so busy planning the conference and working at the conference itself i miss some of the great presentations offered each year
1167559 even though i am now retired when i study the brochure for the conference there is just no way i can be present in all the workshops i would like to take
1167560 i finally have worked it so we no longer have cattle and actually we are down to three horses but we still produce hay on 20 acres 10 on pasture land with roseburg loam and another 10 acres in colburg loam two of the finest soils for producing hay
1167561 i also have a goat that keeps the blackberries under control and i have two cats and a dog

1167566 i thought it is not only science but also sheer aesthetic pleasure
1167567 but the variety weve seen and some of the phenomena weve seen have been really surprising the satellites have been more beautiful than we expected and the science has been much better than we expected
1167568 we tried to choose images that were beautiful and also contained interesting planetary findings on this mission that was easy to do the show has no murky photos that might appeal only to science geeks
1167569 because we have not seen all we want to see by a long shot
1167570 the neural network behind sound production in vertebrates can be traced back through evolutionary time to an era long before the first animals ventured onto dry land
1167571 i am amazed at the breadth of the investigation scientific history biblical studies geology biology geography astronomy chemistry paleontology and so forth and find the style of writing to be quite lucid and aimed clearly at a general lay audience
1167572 is the systematic ploy of obstructionists who in lieu of any divine intervention state that any coincidental grouping or chance union of electrons and protons and neutrons regardless of the configuration always produces a chemical element
1167573 what this means is that really bad experiences may have lasting effects on the brain even in healthy people
1167574 this suggests that the differences we see in the brain and behavior of people who were near the sept 11 disaster are not specific to that one event
1167575 and it turns out there is a very similar pattern of gray matter volume loss with normal aging which raises the question what role trauma plays in the aging brain

1167587 he was having difficulty breathing so i grabbed his wittman hand and started pulling his fingers but he was really strong and he knew what he was doing
1167588 thats not something that is permitted in the cba collective bargaining agreement its not something we are going to allow and something should they decide to do we will have to manage it the way we would manage any other violation of the collective bargaining agreement i believe we have got great players who have strong levels of integrity and competitive spirit and i believe they will play this game the way they play every other game we will pay the prize money as it was originially dictated as determined by mls ownership if there is something we determine is a violation of the cba we will address it
1167589 it goes to the club owner its no different from a nascar tournament where the team owner wins prize money and the team owner has a driver under contract and whatever his agreement with that driver is is what that driver receives what i have found very frustrating is that this has been positioned as the league misleading the public by saying that the prize would go to the players we never ever implied that the players would get the one million dollars the winner is the team the club gets that million dollar prize and then we have an agreement as to what that share would be to the players

1167593 modeling studies suggest that even small exposures to a number of environmental estrogens may add up and work together with the bodys own estrogen over time to contribute to increased breast cancer risk
1167594 reaching younger audiences using media they can relate to is so important
1167595 because breast cancer may take decades to develop so knowledge of all risk factors and taking advantage of opportunities to reduce exposure whenever possible are important considerations for women in their teens 20s and 30s these short videos show women how to take simple steps to avoid exposure to environmental estrogens found in everyday products

1167618 that might lead to various distress responses one of which on the part of women is having transactional sex to feed their kids

1167636 the stations complaints committee acknowledged i had been treated in an unfair and unkind manner and that two complaints submitted by my office were justified and the broadcaster has now twice censured michael laws for his inaccurate and unfair comments
1167637 not only were there inaccuracies but the vitriol was disturbing

1167650 were deeply concerned and disturbed that our reporter of all of those in that area was asked to move
1167651 my understanding is that stephen was the only reporter approached and asked to leave the area and the only reporter in that area who is black another reporter who stood up for stephen was then asked to leave

1167653 without the support of the americans we would not have accomplished the mission because the british forces had done nothing there
1167654 maliki and the americans felt the british were morally impugned by the deal they had reached with the militia the british were accused of trying to find the line of least resistance in dealing with the shia militia
1167655 you can accuse the americans of many things such as hamfistedness but you cant accuse them of not addressing a situation when it arises while we had a strategy of evasion the americans just went in and addressed the problem

1168261 theres two things that we need to understand about these permits and green taxes the first is that theres a difference in the effects of a carbon tax and these cap and trade systems using permits with tax we know what the cost will be but not what the emissions reductions will be with permits we know what the emissions will be but not the cost i prefer the tax because it makes clearer and more transparent the cost benefit analysis but feel free to differ but if the tax and the permit prices turn out to be at the same level then the two systems are functionally equivalent however a cap and trade system where some permits are given away is not the same as a carbon tax its the same as a carbon tax plus corporate pork

1168293 we will look into other ways of making sure we do a better job
1168294 i dont know if i would blame him for it with whats gone on this offseason
1168295 downtown that can be fun for a lot of guys but the team and what were able to do this season is a lot more important than going out and having fun with college students
1168296 we dont want to be looked at as bad guys or thugs
1168297 we just have to move forward we understand what was done and we understand we cant afford to have those mistakes in the future
1168298 what im keen on doing is applying a bit of science to the fishery
1168299 we knew we shouldnt expect to see something like that
1168300 the really cool thing is that all the details are still there
1168301 the existence of wet based glaciers proglacial lakes tundra vegetation and insect remains all indicate that the climate of the western olympus range was warmer and wetter that that of today
1168302 as it cools it crosses thresholds this is one when antarctica became permanently frozen and locked up
1168303 because if human beings are unfortunate enough to push climate over one of these thresholds it could be a total catastrophe
1168304 we cannot rule out the possibility that overfishing has occurred
1168305 i believe the fish are there and they will not stay permanently down so when the temperatures improve they will move higher up where fishermen can catch them
1168306 no other development project will have sparked so much long term interest or such high expectations
1168307 it has never been done before i doubt it will be repeated this is it weve got a golden opportunity to fast forward our research
1168308 i immediately jumped off my seat i thought this is what ive been waiting for i said thank god for the olympics for me this is 10 times better than winning the lottery
1168309 if mother nature cooperates i expect there would be an impact but it all depends on the wind directions
1168310 its a giant science experiment on air pollution as far as i know its the biggest case where a city that had air quality problems took strong measures to improve air quality theyve taken it very seriously its exciting from a science standpoint
1168311 they didnt have to go to quite the extremes that beijing has beijing has had to come a long way further than l a or atlanta
1168312 its not just about china its about megacities across the world whats learned here can perhaps be applied to other cities
1168313 hopefully with our data china can see the need to take a dramatic policy strategy to continue the good policies they conducted during the games
1168314 he was approached by a vehicle coming from the opposite direction at an extremely high rate of speed so much so that the vehicle forced the patrol car to the shoulder to prevent a collision
1168315 these days there are homeowners groups all over the place
1168316 there are probably thousands of meetings a week with a small effort on their part our programs could make a big difference in the community
1168317 its easy to forget we live in a semi arid environment
1168318 sonny has joined us for one season with the option of another season

1168342 i saw a young girl who had a service cart smash into her leg and i know she didnt see a doctor
1168343 i thought we were going to die but my children were there so at the same time i was saying to them its going to be fine

1168353 im another disgruntled sureslim client of three days when it shut the owner was obviously lying when she told me i was the only new client to join in june she cant possibly deny knowing she was about to shut the doors when signing up new clients
1168354 i have also been affected by the closure of sureslim having paid up front 990 and then only getting one visit in before they closed the doors
1168355 had nothing but great support from the sureslim team up in auckland

1168361 wed really appreciate stuff that people can see as saleable good quality stuff winter donations have definitely slowed down its the slowest ive seen in the five years ive worked here people arent spending as much on new clothes so theyre giving away less
1168362 go for an experience some people have this perception that you only find old out of date things but youll be surprised with what youll find the beauty is youll come out with a warm feeling knowing youve also helped the community
1168363 we have noticed a slight decline in donations from the community that may be as a result of the public cutting back on spending in tough economic times our costs are rising with food fuel and clinical wages going up and our income is going down
1168364 police are investigating the arrival of campaigners believed to have breached their bail conditions but we cannot confirm how many arrests have been made
1168365 im pretty nervous about being arrested because ive never been to prison it will be bad but the worst thing about being arrested will be that i wont get to go to an event that i have been planning for a long time this is one of the most important issues of our generation and its vital that we are allowed to discuss it its tragic that the police seem to want to stop that

1168397 breaking our oil addiction is one of the greatest challenges our generation will ever face
1168398 it will take nothing less than a complete transformation of our economy
1168399 anybody who says that we can achieve energy independence without using and increasing these existing energy resources either doesnt have the experience to understand the challenge that we face or isnt giving the american people some straight talk
1168400 he sees more drilling as the answer to all of our energy problems and like them hes found a receptive audience in the very same oil companies that have blocked our progress for so long in fact he raised more than one million dollars from big oil just last month

1168446 tremendous attention focused on the proceedings here today not only domestically but internationally

1168454 barack and i as partners as friends and as lovers we accessorize each other in many ways
1168455 the best thing i love having on me is barack on my arm and vice versa whether its having him standing there smiling at me or watching him mesmerize a crowd or talk to some seniors in a senior center
1168456 dont vote for barack because you think hes cute or because you like his smile this can be a purely objective decision because the choices are pretty clear

1168586 the spirit in the team is very high and we have been playing very well in our recent friendly matches so the belief is strong that we can go that extra step

1168588 compared to previous years this year we have had a lot of good friendly games against powerful opposition
1168589 but most of us are not worried about who we play we are just excited to be playing a dream game like this opening against the hosts in a packed stadium at a huge tournament
1168590 of course we want to win that first game against china
1168591 but if we dont well we know how to respond
1168592 this team definitely has the talent to win the gold medal all we need is a little bit of the luck we ve not had up to now
1168593 our goal is always to finish among the medals at every tournament were certainly capable of it
1168594 japans style of play will suit our own style of pressure and physical dominance
1168595 you always dream of being an olympian as a kid and now its happening every day we get a little more excited about it

1168620 when i first heard jo o gilberto i had the desire to make music
1168621 madder than the mad and more lucid than the sane that seducer who who enchanted so thoroughly without possessing a drop of glamour that artist who proved himself even more more the artist when he was not practicing his art
1168622 what jo o gilberto proposed was a deeply penetrating and highly personal interpretation of the spirit of samba he did this through a mechanically simple but musically challenging guitar beat that suggested an infinite variety of subtle ways to make the vocal phrasing swing over a harmony of chords progressing in fluent equilibrium
1168623 joaos white album a hauntingly sparse beautiful and quite ethereal recording upon sober reflection and countless hours spent listening to it i think i can quite comfortably say that i think this is the single greatest bossa nova album ever recorded gilberto is gentle and graceful beyond the reach of practically any other musician alive and this record is a masterpiece it includes revamped acoustic takes on several bossa nova and pre bossa oldies along with newer material such as his lullaby for his daughter bebel and one song each by the upstart tropicalistas caetano veloso and gilberto gil gilberto sings barely at a whisper while his percussionist is the absolute model of restraint and economy

1168654 the severe time rationing is necessary because a computer far from making you more productive instead loads you down with things to do and its important for the machine to know who is boss
1168655 and yet just as we have won the cold war abroad we are losing the battles for economic opportunity and social justice here at home
1168656 now that we have changed the world its time to change america
1168657 i have news for the forces of greed and the defenders of the status quo your time has come and gone its time for a change in america
1168658 tonight 10 million of our fellow americans are out of work tens of millions more work harder for lower pay the incumbent president says unemployment always goes up a little before a recovery begins but unemployment only has to go up by one more person before a real recovery can begin and mr president you are that man
1168659 if you want to know where i come by the passionate commitment i have to bringing people together without regard to race it all started with my grandfather
1168660 people are working harder than ever spending less time with their children working nights and weekends at their jobs instead of going to pta and little league or scouts and their incomes are still going down their taxes are still going up and the costs of health care housing and education are going through the roof
1168661 meanwhile more and more of our best people are falling into poverty even though they work 40 hours a week
1168662 our people are pleading for change but government is in the way it has been hijacked by privileged private interests it has forgotten who really pays the bills around here it has taken more of your money and given you less in return we have got to go beyond the brain dead politics in washington and give our people the kind of government they deserve a government that works for them
1168663 our country is falling behind the president is caught in the grip of a failed economic theory we have gone from first to 13th in the world in wages since ronald reagan and bush have been in office
1168664 what is george bush doing about our economic problems now four years ago he promised 15 million new jobs by this time and hes over 14 million short al gore and i can do better he has raised taxes on the people driving pickup trucks and lowered taxes on the people riding in limousines we can do better he promised to balance the budget but he hasnt even tried in fact the budgets he has submitted to congress nearly doubled the debt even worse he wasted billions and reduced our investments in education and jobs we can do better
1168665 so if you are sick and tired of a government that doesnt work to create jobs if youre sick and tired of a tax system thats stacked against you if youre sick and tired of exploding debt and reduced investments in our future or if like the great civil rights pioneer fannie lou hamer youre just plain old sick and tired of being sick and tired then join us work with us win with us and we can make our country the country it was meant to be
1168666 he wont take on the big insurance companies and the bureaucracies to control health costs and give us affordable health care for all americans but i will
1168667 he wont break the stranglehold the special interests have on our elections and the lobbyists have on our government but i will
1168668 he wont take the lead in protecting the environment and creating new jobs in environmental technologies for the 21st century but i will and you know what else he doesnt have al gore and i do just in case just in case you didnt notice thats gore with an e on the end
1168669 jobs education health care these are not just commitments from my lips they are the work of my life
1168670 our priorities must be clear we will put our people first again but priorities without a clear plan of action are just empty words to turn our rhetoric into reality weve got to change the way government does business fundamentally until we do well continue to pour billions of dollars down the drain the republicans have campaigned against big government for a generation but have you noticed theyve run this big government for a generation and they havent changed a thing they dont want to fix government they still want to campaign against it and thats all
1168671 but my fellow democrats its time for us to realize weve got some changing to do too
1168672 now i dont have all the answers but i do know the old ways dont work trickledown economics has sure failed
1168673 we offer our people a new choice based on old values we offer opportunity we demand responsibility we will build an american community again the choice we offer is not conservative or liberal in many ways it is not even republican or democratic it is different it is new and it will work it will work because it is rooted in the vision and the values of the american people
1168674 an america in which the doors of colleges are thrown open once again to the sons and daughters of stenographers and steelworkers we will say everybody can borrow money to go to college but you must do your part you must pay it back from your paychecks or better yet by going back home and serving your communities
1168675 an america in which health care is a right not a privilege in which we say to all of our people
1168676 an america yes in which the wealthiest few those making over 200 000 a year are asked to pay their fair share
1168677 the end of the cold war permits us to reduce defense spending while still maintaining the strongest defense in the world but we must plow back every dollar of defense cuts into building american jobs right here at home i know well that the world needs a strong america but we have learned that strength begins at home
1168678 and so we must say to every american look beyond the stereotypes that blind us we need each other all of us we need each other we dont have a person to waste and yet for too long politicians have told the most of us that are doing all right that whats really wrong with america is the rest of us them them the minorities them the liberals them the poor them the homeless them the people with disabilities them the gays weve gotten to where weve nearly themed ourselves to death them and them and them but this is america there is no them there is only us

1168690 i set my dvr to record the alternative on all airings this mornings 3 am three hour episode was a repeat of sundays show with one interesting change when the show comes back from commercial instead of showing a graphic with vh1 classic the alternative it showed as vh1 classic 120 minutes i thought this was very interesting unfortunately from what i could tell that was the extent of it

1168749 throughout this entire process he presented himself as a single parent relocating himself and his daughter to baltimore
1168750 this was a cash transaction using cashiers checks which is not an uncommon practice
1168751 i met him like a month and a half ago when we were doing a walk through in the house and its funny he mentioned that he was bringing his daughter here to live so i guess he thought he was not going to get caught
1168752 he didnt make it seem like this was a way station
1168753 it seems like he was setting up a life down there
1168754 i have no doubt that he would have been right back in high society circles
1168755 didnt figure out what he did but he seemed very bright definitely

1168759 the candy factory first opened its doors on july 10 1978 in the front area of piedmont candy company a wholesale manufacturer of pure sugar stick candy and mint puffs owner and second generation candy maker robert ebelein sold his homemade fudge and peanut brittle along with his companys signature products from this first storefront attracted by the stores turn of the century d cor customers asked to buy antiques displayed in the store so robert and his wife frances made the rounds of auctions and flea markets seeking antiques to offer in addition to their candy products the business was an immediate success needing more space for candy and antiques the ebeleins bought the circa 1907 lexington hardware building on main street renovated the store and opened for business the candy factory retail store is still owned by the ebeleins three daughters

1168761 this is a tremendous victory for consumers which will allow us to make dvrs available to many more people faster and less expensively than would otherwise be possible

1168765 these festivals are a national asset theyre good for the arts theyre good for tourism throughout the uk and it would be good if there was more tv which reflected that
1168766 it is our duty to keep the fringe as healthy as possible
1168767 we have to ask what is our capacity to build and deliver a world class festival the biggest in the world on a permanent team of 13 this is not about becoming more bureaucratic this is about providing more and better services

1168775 we welcome any new research that could lead to the development of effective treatments for psychosis especially if those treatments bring fewer of the horrible side effects that are associated with some medications for schizophrenia

1168800 u s society today is very nearly a pure meritocracy perhaps the purest there has ever been if you display any ability at all in your early years you will be marked for induction into the overclass especially if you belong
1168801 seek out the rich man in his castle it is far more likely the case in the u s a than anywhere else and far more likely the case in the u s a of today than at any past time that he is from modest origins and won his wealth fairly in the fields of business finance or the high professions
1168802 it is likewise probable if you track back through his life that it will be one of lackluster ability and effort compounded perhaps perhaps with some serious personality defect
1168803 i have two kids in school eighth grade and tenth i know several of their classmates there are some fuzzy cases but for the most part it is easy to see who is destined for the castle who for the gate
1168804 of the deciding factors by far the largest is intelligence
1168805 there are of course smart people who squander their lives and dumb people who get lucky if you pluck a hundred rich men from their castles and put them in a room together though you will notice a high level of general intelligence
1168806 who might be technically adept or good at deal making but as a group with one or two exceptions they were less intelligent less intellectually inquisitive less knowledgeable and despite their good schools less broadly educated than high flyers in other professions their high salaries were not a sign of any obvious superiority most dismaying was their lack of empathy and their unwillingness to contemplate other less luxurious lives
1168807 contrariwise a hundred poor men taken from their gates will if put all in one place convey a general impression of slow dullness
1168808 trevor phillips chairman of the equality and human rights commission wants to extend that bodys remit in order to tackle the class divide
1168809 yet the cover story in the new statesman this week contends that in our deregulated world cash has displaced class in the piece danny dorling writes that the social nuances have faded that style profession and acquired airs are now irrelevant the sole determinant of status being wealth
1168810 both phillips and dorling are right given their slightly different definitions of class we have clinched a double defeat our society is inegalitarian and polarised yet its tone is demotic to the point of yobbishness
1168811 that the old nuances allowed one to steal a march on ones wealthier rivals they mitigated the power of money
1168812 not long before she died pauline kael remarked to a friend when we championed trash culture we had no idea it would become the only culture

1168814 he pietersen is a fine player and has confidence in bucket loads which he will probably take into his captaincy
1168815 but you dont want him to change he averages around 50 in both forms of the game and hes an unbelievable talent
1168816 he has got some very important attributes that you need in a captain
1168817 he can clearly lead by example by being a fantastic player
1168818 he is a very confident person and he is pretty decisive as well when tough decisions are there to be made he is going to make those decisions
1168819 the more i know myself the more i know what i need and where i am going to
1168820 there are two main problems in life when to start and when to end
1168821 happiness is being able to find what you really want the kind of passion that you feel inside
1168822 would you look at what happened to your poor grandfather
1168823 we came here to find the american dream and now were right in the vortex
1168824 as my demonstration concludes im struck by the lengths ncsoft are going to with aion to create something which offers a genuine break to their own mmorpg cannon and a strong rival to genre leaders such as conan and of course wow aion looks set to offer a diverse experience which engages the player on multiple levels using a variety of techniques of course much will depend on how well the multiple elements of this game function together and whether the world hangs in a balanced manner but the signs are good very good in fact
1168825 this was made from the press event we held recently but the lore is quite intricate and perhaps overwhelming to take in all at once so i understand that a few thigns were mixed up by some of the journalists
1168826 show knowledge of the crime or proximity to the crime which are not enough to prove aiding and abetting
1168827 the wait was worth it and the book is even more than i had hoped it would be
1168828 in 1939 everett cook invested 5 000 in 83 acres with a house and a barn

1168851 this is a major milestone that truly reflects the dedication and commitment of our staff our community and adoptive families
1168852 my father and all his brothers they passed away due to the hiv epidemic
1168853 the rate of aids diagnoses for black women was nearly 23 times the rate for white women
1168854 the thing about african americans is they dont want to know
1168855 they feel like if they dont know it aint going to hurt them and when they do find out they dont want to talk about it if we could just break the silence i think that we can prevent a lot of hiv and aids in the african american community
1168856 people in situations are going to not have access to the information they need or the healthcare they need
1168857 theyre doing things for survival that they might not do if they werent in such dire circumstances
1168858 there was a time when a woman was expected to have sex with the master of the house and the masters son and her husband could do nothing for her
1168859 that silence is historic and people not talking about what happens in terms of sexual relationships has been handed down through generations
1168860 and you also have to remember theres clearly the continued racism thats still pervasive there was a recent study in the new england journal of medicine on implicit bias that takes place among physicians treating african american versus non african american patients in terms of the types of treatments that are provided
1168861 my research team documented in the early 90s and published our results showing that the most conservative african americans we surveyed church congregations that 30 percent of them believed that hiv was a man made virus unleashed on the black community
1168862 the fact that the theme resonates today is a serious problem and is contributing to the spread
1168863 we have allowed our problems with addressing the issue of homosexuality to blind us to the results of what it means to have people closeted what it means to have men marry because the homophobia is so devastating therefore they engage in same sex behavior with men and come home to the woman
1168864 theres a stigma attached to it so people dont come out and admit they have it a lot of people dont realize how real it is in their own neighborhoods
1168865 at some earlier stages in this epidemic it was lack of a perceived risk
1168866 they saw it as a white gay male disease so the behaviors that put people at risk unprotected sex and sharing needles with people who were infected didnt apply to them from their own perspective
1168867 black leadership in the early days said we cannot own hiv aids because it will be used to denigrate us
1168868 one fourth of the people living with hiv in the united states in one study have been incarcerated at some point
1168869 a man who may have been in jail for a considerable time and then leaves that environment may move to heterosexual companionship but may move in a situation which the adequate support system in terms of education and treatment arent there in terms of hiv so its a complex situation with poverty racism and incarceration also becoming part of the paradigm in terms of hiv spread
1168870 president bush has this wonderful program outside the u s but washington d c has infection rates higher than most of the places that pepfar dollars go
1168871 but in the u s we dont have a national aids plan we dont have continuing growth of resources as the number of new infections and the number of people living longer with hiv grow in this country
1168872 in the african american community you hear the statistics but you dont see the results
1168873 when its happening at home really up close you cant see the forest for the trees people arent talking about it people arent broadcasting it making it a major issue
1168874 now weve got some good churches out there who are rolling up their sleeves and fighting
1168875 during the time period 2001 2004 hiv diagnosis rates among black males and females declined by 4 4 percent and 6 8 percent respectively
1168876 results from a 2007 study reported similar declines among african americans in the state of florida
1168877 its promising that were moving away from being disease specific aids over here heart disease over there and talking more broadly about health disparities and addressing the common risk factors
1168878 and that means you must address the issue of poverty and health literacy
1168879 if you take aids out the isolated box and put it in a broader context of other racial and ethnic health disparities cardiovascular disease diabetes infant mortality it destigmatizes it in some ways
1168880 there will always be situations of material need where help in the form of concrete love for neighbour is indispensable
1168881 it might just be my best for some reason theres a cohesiveness here thats not like anything ive done before but at the same time its not real predictable theres a lot of texture to it as well but its a simple record i dont know how that happened but i know it when i hear it
1168882 the sad truth is that the fcc is ill equipped to detect isps interfering with your internet connection its up to concerned internet users to investigate possible network neutrality violations and effs switzerland software is designed to help with that effort comcast isnt the first and certainly wont be the last isp to meddle surreptitiously with its subscribers internet communications for its own benefit
1168883 watch out im gonna milk my looks for as much fun as i can get
1168884 its still part of our future down the road but right now the markets really are in pretty bad shape
1168885 it took about eight hours to do a 30 second commercial
1168886 i was always confident in myself as a football player
1168887 i knew it was a waiting game being an undrafted free agent i had to earn my way up the ladder theres nothing wrong with that
1168888 we had some really good players when i came here i just have kind of been around for a while now so when i had a chance to play i showed what i can do
1168889 i think it was a mix of a lot of different things for it to happen
1168890 you cant have success and not be a good team we had a really good quarterback jeff garcia the offensive line blocked very well you cant run without an offensive line they did the job last year
1168891 i played with eg for three years at florida and hes a blue collar guy
1168892 he just comes to work and work from six years to do what he did last year i was happy for him
1168893 i had confidence the whole time that it would get done
1168894 you know its nice to get the recognition get what you want last year was a great year for the team the contract is a big deal they got it done so we can focus on this year now

1169041 its a great loss for our family its also a loss for the country
1169042 the first thing i pray for is that we will not be tainted by any scandal of drugs or doping we have a bad history on that front and i hope for once and for all that we can come out of this games clean
1169043 after that i think that for athletes to have qualified alone is a remarkable achievement given that they are up against the best of the world and the bar gets higher with every olympic games
1169044 a few personal bests i would hope everyone could manage a personal best but not everyone can have a great day id also hope for a good bit of luck with the draw for the boxers you always need a bit of luck at an olympic games so it is certainly a time for the luck of the irish
1169045 there could be but i dont want to put pressure on anyone
1169046 it is clearing on a daily basis i spoke this morning with the president of the international olympic committee ioc jacques rogge and he more or less told me that they are not curtailing any events but they will assess things on a nightly basis
1169047 but the last thing they will do is put any athletes health in danger
1169048 the heat was to be expected because that is normal in this part of the world and everybody knew what to expect with that before we came here
1169049 i think things have been better than we could have expected he said
1169050 i think one of the bonuses is that we have a lot of rain and we have had some blue sky days as well the projections are for rain and that is very positive as that will clear away the smog but we are pleased with the conditions and the athletes are responding well a lot of athletes have their plans in place they know it is going to be hot they know it is going to be humid but they have individualised their plans accordingly

1169078 your heart was lifted up because of your beauty you corrupted your wisdom for the sake of your splendor i cast you to the ground i laid you before kings that they might gaze at you
1169079 look this was the iniquity of your sister sodom she and her daughter had pride fullness of food and abundance of idleness neither did she strengthen the hand of the poor and needy
1169080 and they were haughty and committed abomination before me therefore i took them away as i saw fit
1169081 o king the most high god gave nebuchadnezzar your father a kingdom and majesty glory and honor
1169082 and because of the majesty that he gave him all peoples nations and languages trembled and feared before him whomever he wished he executed whomever he wished he kept alive whomever he wished he set up and whomever he wished he put down
1169083 but when his heart was lifted up and his spirit was hardened in pride he was deposed from his kingly throne and they took his glory from him
1169084 then he was driven from the sons of men his heart was made like the beasts and his dwelling was with the wild donkeys
1169085 but you his son belshazzar have not humbled your heart although you knew all this
1169086 and you have lifted yourself up against the lord of heaven

1169090 the dr told me i was 1 cm 50 and not closed
1169091 well maybe the dr s fingers are thinner than mine i can barely get my finger through
1169092 will almost killed me quite literally he would have run me through if we hadnt reached an accord
1169093 he blamed me and rightly so for chasing you away
1169094 do not fret he was right to do what he did and if anything after the initial shock it has brought us closer together
1169095 i think youre going to have be more specific than that love
1169096 i couldnt have been more than 3 i remember my father had just come home from battle he had been away for nearly 6 months and i had never seen him in his armor he seemed so tall and frightening on his horse i didnt recognize him as my father
1169097 i dont remember its really more a picture than a memory
1169098 lakosha was much more tumultuous when i was a child landholders would quibble amongst themselves lakosha skirmished with neighboring countries more often as well
1169099 my parents respected each other certainly and i believe they grew to love each other to a degree they were both formidable people intelligent attractive stubborn their relationship was not terribly close i think in a way i think it was easier for my mother when my father was away
1169100 if theyd known what they could have had what were blessed to have it would be sad as it was their relationship was pretty typical and i believe they were comfortable with the arrangement
1169101 what does any child realize i was loved i knew i was loved my father indeed both my parents were hard on me from a young age but no more than was necessary to mold me into an effective ruler
1169102 i believe my father suspected that he was not to live to his dotage and felt the need to fit a lifetimes worth of teaching into a scant few years he died when i was 22
1169103 for me yes for him not as young as you might think though young by our standards he was 60 when i was born
1169104 eighty two is young by lakoshan standards exactly how long do people live here
1169105 apparently longer than in your dimension i believe the average lifespan currently is 130 my father was middle aged when he died i was barely old enough to hold the crown without a guardian
1169106 your mother must have died young too then unless lakoshan women can bear children for a much longer period of time
1169107 my mother died ten years ago she was much younger than my father she was but 21 when i was born 49 when she died
1169108 my mothers parents were nearly 50 years apart in age my fathers were 30
1169109 so the fact that youre only 2 years older than i am is

1169117 when you consider that the police chiefs dont make that any of the police officers dont make that i mean nobody else makes that type of money

1169171 its like if someone asks a kid who plays football not to play i love bulls very much fighting them is my decision if people are worried about me they shouldnt come to see me
1169172 because he is a star in his country and he fights in corridas aiming to kill
1169173 michelito is a bullfighting star disguising as the pupil of a bullfighting school they cant make me believe that this boy who kills bulls in the arenas of mexico is performing for free in france
1169174 i am getting ready to lodge a formal complaint for slander we are being called unworthy parents when my son just wants to live out his own passion
1169175 he is enrolled in the normal way at the merida bullfighting school in mexico which is associated with the international association of bullfighting schools we respect all the rules

1169178 it will make italy look like a country in the grip of an uncontrolled security emergency
1169179 paratroopers guarding the centres of the major tourist cities arent exactly a great calling card for a country at the height of the tourist season
1169180 i really dont see the need for this it will have a completely negative effect i have already had people asking me if there is some sort of civil war going on
1169181 i think its very sad and a bit repressive i would have expected to see soldiers in a south american banana republic not a european capital
1169182 we saw the troops arriving from the bus and everyone broke out into applause it was time i feel safer the gypsies wont try to steal my bag or my purse
1169183 this morning the many gypsies who are normally stationed outside arent here thats already an encouraging sign
1169184 it is a terrible tragedy that this man has been killed for a small amount of money so that the murderer a self confessed grand theft auto addict could continue to play the computer game
1169185 clearly these violent games can have a very serious and negative effect on the people that play them as this man said murder seemed so easy in the game
1169186 i am not an advocate of censorship what we need is to ensure that those under 18 are not given access to violent games and violent films
1169187 a heavy loss for the whole of russia we are proud that alexander isayevich solzhenitsyn was our countryman and contemporary we will remember him as a strong brave person with enormous dignity
1169188 like millions of citizens solzhenitsyn lived through tough times he was one of the first to talk about the inhumane stalinist regime and about the people who experienced it but were not broken until the end of his days he fought for russia not only to move away from its totalitarian past but also to have a worthy future to become a truly free and democratic country we owe him a lot
1169189 his intransigence his ideals and his long eventful life make solzhenitsyn a hero from a novel an heir to dostoyevsky he belongs to the pantheon of world history i pay homage to his memory
1169190 he soon got up and complained of pain he periodically lost consciousness we called the ambulance
1169191 undoubtedly russia has turned some kind of corner under putin look around you this is not a country where people cower in fear
1169192 he always told it how it was not how people wanted him to tell it despite all the changes in society he held to his judgment
1169193 i wont deny that he is a noted figure in russian history
1169194 but in terms of his positions as a citizen he was contentious
1169195 these are people who were larger than life this is a generation its a full generation and its very sad to see its last representative go
1169196 solzhenitsyn is a notable writer but his political views are an embarrassment even to his fellow dissidents not only would a meeting with the president offend the soviets but it would raise some controversy about solzhenitsyns views of the united states and its allies
1169197 instead of secluding myself here and writing the red wheel i suppose i could have spent time making myself likeable to the west the only problem is that i would have had to drop my way of life and my work

1169237 is not sonys fault that the xbox 360 is made by a company that is worth 5x more than they are and also that said company has a annual profit of 16 billion dollars so im pretty sure microsoft afford to pay for exclusives

1169259 we have a constantly changing set one of our cast members is mother nature and so she tends to be a little difficult to work with sometimes so thats an interesting challenge
1169260 the thing that worried the most quite frankly was just stan herds in town and theyre making a film about him and were going to shut the town down thats a little weird for me
1169261 a lot of hollywood stuff is a little bit excess and independent films are really the way things should be shot i think

1169263 previous findings have shown that fish and fish oil can help prevent stroke but this is one of the only studies that looks at fishs effect on silent brain infarcts in healthy older people
1169264 more research is needed as to why these types of fish may have protective effects but the omega 3 fatty acids epa and dha would seem to have a major role

1169270 i certainly think australian home owners would welcome some relief but that is entirely a matter for the independent reserve bank he said

1169297 i explained i was with the state press but the secret service man said that didnt matter and that i would have to go
1169298 i would first express regret that your reporter was moved and i can tell you beyond a shadow of a doubt that race had nothing to do with it
1169299 were deeply concerned and disturbed that our reporter of all of those in that area was asked to move
1169300 my understanding is that stephen was the only reporter approached and asked to leave the area and the only reporter in that area who is black another reporter who stood up for stephen was then asked to leave
1169301 at the end of the day your reporter was in the wrong place i do not know why the other reporters were not moved the rest of the local press should have been moved as well
1169302 my mind went back to a few years ago we tried so hard we almost gave up hope and i remember her coming in and telling me the news oh man we were living going crazy in the kitchen we laughed and an held each other tight and we laughed until we cried
1169303 does anyone understand why obama suggesting that people keep their tires properly inflated is some sort of hilarious gaffe
1169304 mccain supporters in michigan will distribute tire gauges at obamas energy speech in lansing the rnc will also deliver gauges reading obamas energy plan to washington newsrooms
1169305 inflating your tires and getting a regular tune up sounds more like obamas plan for ego maintenance than it does for helping american families
1169306 obama refers to big oil and the need to reduce our use of oil by 35 over the next twenty years how do we get there keep inflating those tires folks
1169307 it seems to me the only thing obama wants us to do is inflate tires
1169308 barack obama stood up at a speech recently and said that one of the things that is really important from energy policy from his standpoint is to check the pressure in our tires so heres a tire gauge and you can go out in the parking lot here and check your tires now thats an interesting thing we want you to have good pressure in your tires you know it will very mildly add to your fuel efficiency but checking the air pressure in your tires is not an energy policy for the united states of america
1169309 we want you to wear sunscreen you know it will very mildly improve your chances of not getting sick but wearing sunscreen is not a healthcare policy for the united states of america

1169314 the employees were given contracts of employment of considerable complexity governing matters totally irrelevant such as ownership of inventions and the like not inadvertently but as part of a general tactic by the employer to intimidate

1169316 food is such a basic need that you can see people really going to great lengths
1169317 that might lead to various distress responses one of which on the part of women is having transactional sex to feed their kids
1169318 recent studies in botswana swaziland malawi zambia and tanzania have shown associations between acute food insecurity and unprotected transactional sex among poor women

1169342 the pc market in western europe is growing strongly despite the prevailing weakening economic climate while the pc market is not immune from the economic forces sharp declines in average selling prices have certainly fostered the growth

1169344 the pc market in the uk performed strongly this quarter with both the consumer and professional markets fuelling growth this strong performance can only be sustained if new users are being reached or existing users are buying additional pcs or replacing their old ones more rapidly

1169363 and that got me to wondering where had i run across this sort of paranoia this fear of words which might be smuggled like a contagion across borders and then i remembered among the books in the mcsleaze library is a copy of the 1914 baedeker guide for travellers to russia which warns prospective visitors books in large quantities are submitted to a censor travellers should avoid works of a political social or historical nature unprinted paper only should be used for packing to avoid any cause of suspicion russia of course was in those days regarded as a tyranny a few years later the tsars were gone and the bolsheviks erected a tyranny of their own now they are gone and what is modern russia well certainly a state where ruler a former bigshot in the secret police hand picks his successor and still seems to be running the place is no smileygrad and america i cant help but recall something lincoln wrote to an associate in 1855 while still a rather obscure illinois lawyer and to put this in some sort of context lincoln was commenting on the know nothings antebellum americas precursors of lou dobbs i am not a know nothing that is certain how could i be how can any one who abhors the oppression of the negroes be in favor of degrading classes of white people our progress in degeneracy appears to me to be pretty rapid as a nation we began by declaring that all men are created equal we now practically read it all men are created equal except negroes when the know nothings get control it will read all men are created equal except negroes and foreigners and catholics when it comes to that i should prefer emigrating to some country where they make no pretense of loving liberty to russia for instance where despotism can be taken pure and without the base alloy of hypocrisy
1169364 nadat ik de programmas van real madrid en het nederlands elftal nog eens goed had bestudeerd kwam het besef dat ik gezien de vereiste fysieke inspanning om op dit niveau maximaal te presteren een keuze moest maken
1169365 de combinatie van enerzijds de competitie beker en champions leaguewedstrijden van real madrid en het programma van het nederlands elftal anderzijds is voor mij een te zware belasting er rest mij dan ook geen andere keuze

1169386 you have to put a depth chart out during the week of the first preseason game its mandatory and we had to do it last night but i think we all know there are a number of positions that are very close you got to put down a first team and second team even though we really dont know its really that close so nate webster will get the start against houston and well switch it off with niko and like i said thats part of the preseason and well see how it folds out
1169387 michael plays both at fullback and tailback hes a guy that can play both very similar to mike bell michael has a lot more experience at both positions and he looked it today coming back from his hamstring injury

1169417 the stations complaints committee acknowledged i had been treated in an unfair and unkind manner and that two complaints submitted by my office were justified and the broadcaster has now twice censured michael laws for his inaccurate and unfair comments

1169449 we were prepared to welcome proposals for a long term relationship with a new substantial investor to help establish west brom as a successful premier league club
1169450 we said we would shut the door on this at the end of july because we did not want anything off the pitch impacting on the new season
1169451 there has been some initial contact from a few third parties but we have received no firm proposals whatsoever
1169452 we proactively invited a new investor with substantial resources to contact the club
1169453 although no one has come forward the club have been planning more ambitiously and aggressively than ever before for the new season and we are very much looking forward to once again competing in the premier league

1169458 daniel is a special talent and i am delighted that we have been able to add him to our ever improving squad its an incredibly exciting signing for the club and a real coup
1169459 hes one of the stars of madrids academy and he is the link man weve been looking for hes comfortable on the ball has great technique and is deadly from set pieces
1169460 to get in any real madrid starting xi youve got to be a very good player and ive got no doubts whatsoever that hell be a very good addition to our squad

1169483 fears of insolvency have not as yet been fully set aside
1169484 there may be numbers of banks and other financial institutions that at the edge of defaulting will end up being bailed out by governments
1169485 lower global stock prices could impede the recapitalization of banks and other financial institutions debt issuance would also be suppressed as it leverages off the level of equity
1169486 the price of equities worldwide will determine whether the international financial system can maintain a modicum of stability as it eases out of its credit crunch or falls back into another period of angst and turmoil
1169487 the cause of our economic despair however is human natures propensity to sway from fear to euphoria and back a condition that no economic paradigm has proved capable of suppressing without severe hardship
1169488 regulation the alleged effective solution to todays crisis has never been able to eliminate historys crises

1169558 on our hybrids were looking at about 50 miles per gallon versus our black devilles were looking at just over 20 so were getting over two and a half times the distance

1169566 the foreign office was clearly disturbed that former ambassadors like christopher meyer and craig murray were able to publish highly critical memoirs while paying only lip service to the rules
1169567 but in trying to stop that happening again they have changed the rules in a way that has at least on paper serious unintended consequences this looks like a case of back to the drawing board
1169568 freedom of information means that it is not up to the government to decide what information is made public and what stays private
1169569 yet there seem to be different rules for memoirs if i were a minister or a civil servant writing my memoirs i would think it was reasonable for government to suggest changes i should make for public interest reasons but not for it to censor me
1169570 the bill risks conflating the roles of parliament and the judiciary which would be quite inappropriate
1169571 this is a recipe for confusion that arguably risks undermining the rights of fair trial for the individuals concerned
1169572 considering that any debate will be highly political in nature and any vote may well be whipped by the political parties we are deeply concerned that the independence of the judiciary may appear to be undermined and that trials may be prejudiced

1169574 improvements are needed in how the information is processed and disseminated
1169575 the mod was perhaps slow to appreciate the potential of uavs but now recognises the important contribution they can make
1169576 the uavs acquired for current operations are proving very effective in collecting istar information however improvements are required in how this information is processed and disseminated
1169577 the mod must push forward with its planned improvements so that our armed forces can continue to achieve information superiority over the enemy
1169578 unmanned aerial vehicles are giving our forces the vital information they need to stay one step ahead of the enemy
1169579 whether it be targeting taliban or supporting troops on patrol their ability to feed back images and videos in real time loiter over and survey an area for enemy activity means they are an invaluable asset for our ground commanders

1169601 this investigation has been subject to numerous reviews and assessments since 1999 by the mets internal review group the crown prosecution service criminal case review commission two senior independent treasury council and the court of appeal
1169602 this remains a met police investigation officers from the homicide command from the specialist crime directorate led by commander simon foy will today begin the process of further assessment and scrutiny of the available evidence to establish whether there are further potential investigative leads in this case
1169603 over the passage of time there must be someone out there who knows something about the murder of jill dando

1169733 heavy tilt toward big oil companies reflects the influence of exxon mobil and other oil companies on policy makers in washington dc
1169734 you can look at how dick cheney did his energy policy he met with oil and gas companies forty times and thats how they put together our energy policy
1169735 quote for me the bills that have passed and who the writers were alongside the signers of the bill alongside the writing into law by bush where are they i would love to read about how bush signed a law enforcing cap and trade or windfall profits or where are the 100s of thousands of green jobs created of 10 years with 150 billion invested to get up and running

1169738 obama is the only one talking about it that can actually make these changes he is the only presidential candidate that is talking about this while mccain cant even talk
1169739 the one thing i have to remind folks though of weve been talking about this through republican administrations and democratic administrations for decades and the reason it doesnt change you can take a look at how dick cheney did his energy policy he met with environmental groups one he met with renewable energy folks once and then he met with oil and gas companies forty times and thats how they put together our energy policy weve got to put the national interest ahead of the special interest and thats what ill do when im president of the united states
1169740 there are things you can do individually though to save energy making sure your tires are properly inflated simple thing but we could save all the oil that theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires and getting regular tune ups youd actually save just as much
1169741 and in the face of public frustration over rising gas prices the only energy proposal mccains really promoting is more offshore drilling

1169746 i dont think any developers are going to take the iphone seriously
1169747 how does the iphone as a platform compare to the other mobile platforms for which gameloft has developed

1169758 im glad that governor gregoire has started to recognize the budget crisis shes created she had to know that by increasing spending 33 percent in her first term she was heading the state toward a budget deficit unfortunately her announcement today does not go far enough
1169759 in addition to a hiring freeze we should also freeze salary increases for politically appointed state employees further governor gregoire should suspend salary negotiations with state employee groups over pay increases until we know the full extent of our deficit next year

1169767 we applaud the cdcs efforts to provide a clearer picture of the aids epidemic
1169768 while the federal governments focus in recent years on testing care and treatment has saved the lives of many people living with hiv aids these new numbers clearly indicate that this approach has done little to prevent new infections
1169769 these numbers are unacceptable for all of america at nmac we consider hiv aids just one symptom of an overall health emergency in this country particularly in communities of color which have been disproportionately impacted by hiv aids since the epidemic began three decades ago
1169770 ethnicity is not a risk factor for hiv aids which of course can impact anyone regardless of age gender or race however the limited access to support services such as education and health care and high rates of homelessness malnutrition substance use incarceration and poverty unfortunately found in many minority communities has left their members immuno suppressed and more susceptible to hiv aids and its co morbidities like diabetes tuberculosis heart disease hypertension and hepatitis a b and c

1169812 i just wanted to thank you again for your time this morning and for your willingness to help me i cannot tell you how frustrating and hopeless i have felt dealing with this pain and hearing every doctor tell me that there is nothing that can be done and nothing they can find that is causing the pain i feel so full of hope right now and i have not felt this way in quite some time again thank you for restoring my hope and faith in the natural medicine i knew that there was a doctor somewhere who still cared for his patients i just wish that it hadnt taken me so long to find you

1169814 i cant thank you enough and am eager to share your name and contact info with others including my ob gyn and perinatologist i am also thankful there will be other ways to resolve pregnancy back pain other than medications especially since i am a high risk patient
1169815 dr brady i love your people skills my senior citizens that you talked to really appreciated you coming and giving them good information on chiropractics and aging i also value the fact that you use homeopathic and naturopathic remedies and that you are willing to think outside the box in terms of treating people
1169816 your knowledge goes far beyond the spine itself and far beyond any other chiropractor ive been to
1169817 i admire the way you give your undivided attention to who ever you are talking to the way you tilt your head with interest and the personal touch you give
1169818 i think that your approach as a chiropractor is different than the traditional approaches and b c of that you appeal to a broader base of patients
1169819 you are genuinely concerned in the health of your patients you have a burning desire to bring people to their optimum level of health and quality of life your lively hood is secondary to the health of your patients

1169860 because its an election year the government is trying to make sure the statistics look really good
1169861 youre dealing probably with the most disengaged group or in north canterbury with young men who have got really good job opportunities and can earn really good money and they dont see the reason for staying at school
1169862 the thing that i cant understand is the double standard its against the law to have marijuana and yet schools are expected to do something other than what the law dictates
1169863 there has to be a line in the sand for things like drugs because of the safety of students
1169864 schools need to ensure that their policies are flexible and reflect the needs of the situation
1169865 it is important that student support needs are assessed on a case by case basis to ensure actions are appropriate to the circumstances and take into account the background of the student not just the incident at issue
1169866 if you go and say that those kids cannot leave school and then you dont fund alternative programmes principals like me effectively have to invent programmes and staff them and do that out of an existing budget and thats virtually impossible to do
1169867 every principal you talk to will have stories to tell you of kids who should not be at school who when they come to school cause merry hell and because they dont meet the absurdly high criteria for early leaving exemptions they cant get one
1169868 they almost invariably are behavioural issues in some cases you get a kid who just cant cope in school and therefore they get bored to tears and the behaviour starts to disrupt
1169869 theres no doubt about it that the ministry as agents of the government want to have the rates as low as possible its a good news story for them if they have lower rates
1169870 its a farce really its made a nonsense of things
1169871 in days gone by if somebody was involved in smoking marijuana at school the schools zero tolerance to that would have ended up with that kid being kicked out of school

1169874 his significance to our literature and society is indelible of course he was a great man and author of the many writers and public figures of the 20 th century he is perhaps the greatest
1169875 undoubtedly he brought a religious perspective to his thinking and his views on mankind and society bear clear religious impressions
1169876 he brought his children up in the orthodox faith and even in the soviet times one of his sons went to church
1169877 he possessed an exceedingly active mind so frequently his statements were not only novel but also astonishingly frank not everyone understood them at first and not everyone agreed with him however his assessments of society civilisation and indeed the entire world were accurate and his forecasts were mostly confirmed by events
1169878 i pray that the ruler of life our lord jesus christ shall grant repose to the soul of the newly departed servant of god aleksandr in the heavenly mansions where there is neither sickness sighing or grief but life everlasting

1169880 aleksandr isaevich attempted to do everything possible to preserve russian literature to ensure the survival of its traditions he took an active role in the public life of our country he took a stand on the issues of the day as an involved citizen and he tackled the questions of the social cultural and spiritual development of a new and reinvigorated russia

1169885 ufology is one of the longest enduring subcultures of the past century but its roots can be found way back in ancient culture and religion
1169886 ufology exists in practically every country on earth and the word ufo is spoken in almost every language
1169887 the intense reaction to recent claims by former nasa astronaut edgar mitchell that aliens do exist shows that ufology remains a topic of great community interest and debate
1169888 for some people ufology is an attempt for them to make more sense of their place in the universe and compensate for the fact that science or religion cannot explain everything
1169889 i also wanted to explore the whole phenomenon of how someone can explain the paradox of how people can talk about an object that has been identified as unidentified
