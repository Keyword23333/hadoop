3350000 this is like a voice over for a cartoon character
3350001 why couldnt they pick a kid who is both cute and a good singer this damages the reputation of both kids for their future especially the one lip synching now everyone knows shes a fraud who cares if shes cute
3350002 i can understand why they picked the prettier girl they need to maintain a certain aesthetic beauty during the opening ceremonies this situation is not so bad especially since it gives two people an opportunity to shine rather than just one
3350003 still cannot believe his daughter has become an international singing sensation
3350004 its an amazing opportunity lara is strong athletic confident and independent so its a huge responsibility to take on her role
3350005 shes got everything that a woman aspires to be like and everything that a man would like to meet
3350006 shes still a leading icon in games but maybe shes not as big as she used to be
3350007 the last couple of games have had their ups and downs and weve yet to see a true next generation lara croft video game
3350008 designed with an incredible attention to detail that creates a truly believable world and delivers a new level of challenge and choice
3350009 shes still as relevant today as she ever was whether she can surprise us still remains to be seen
3350010 lara croft is an iconic gaming character she just goes from strength to strength
3350011 while contact centers will continue to rely mainly on telephones for communications use of e mail the internet and social networking technologies will grow in importance
3350012 unfortunately most enterprises fail to take such actions today with self service websites and contact centers still operating in silos
3350013 besides reaching an agent by e mail and web chat customers can also navigate for information and participate in feedbacks polls and blogs through a web 2 0 portal
3350014 with clients expecting a seamless experience when dealing with contact centers or navigating web portals companies will need to re evaluate customer service strategies
3350015 organizations are also expected to adopt a wait and see approach by observing how their peers develop customer service strategies with web 2 0
3350016 i believed i was a young untouchable great singer who could do whatever he wanted whenever he wanted
3350017 i had an image of myself and when things change or life moves on thats when people struggle
3350018 for me that happened at quite a young age i had to make major decisions in my life that upset the image i had of myself i had to accept i had to lose the image of myself
3350019 just little things like that change your perspective of who you are
3350020 touring america changed me a lot i became greedy it was all about wants and needs and thats not me as a human being
3350021 thats not the kind of person i am and i didnt like the person id become
3350022 i was putting myself under a lot of pressure and allowing past failures and things like that to control the moment instead of just expressing myself like i used to be able to
3350023 id lost that especially as a performer i was half the singer i used to be
3350024 do you know that fella gollum from lord of the rings it was a really mild version of that
3350025 i kept thinking hang on a sec ive should have a good life here why am i feeling this way
3350026 im in what i believe to be one of the best bands in the country and im sat panicking about random stuff distorted thoughts
3350027 suicide became an option i became a very unhappy young man but even suicide is the act of an ego thats the final act of an ego to protect oneself from being wrong
3350028 when your bodys physically shaking and you cant keep still and youre sweating and youre sat watching your tv and your hearts like a machine gun thats when i got to the point where i was thinking theres something not right here
3350029 which is what i needed to hear so i checked in and got myself sorted for a few weeks
3350030 after that its just been constant care and attention ive been sober for two and a half years now
3350031 staying fit eating well seeing a regular therapist whenever i can whenever ive got things to talk about
3350032 stay present as opposed to living in the past or the future
3350033 you just need to look down the song titles to know that
3350034 strength in numbers the spike refers to addiction wants and needs and the grey areas in between
3350035 ive tried illegal drugs and legal drugs and theyre both shit all it does is stops us from discovering who we are i dont know why people are so afraid of reality
3350036 so there was a mild fascination with addiction and what drives people songs called the left side and get through it are obvious ones
3350037 it was mccain who used his influence in the senate to help foreign owned dhl buy a u s company and gain control over the jobs that are now on the chopping block in ohio
3350038 not long ago a couple hundred thousand berliners made a lot of noise for my opponent
3350039 migrants play a massively positive role in our community they bring important cultural diversity to northern ireland and they contribute greatly to our economy
3350040 in october obamas former pastor wright will publish a new book and hit the road to promote it an occasion that might well place the topic of obamas blackness along with his patriotism and his candor about what he heard in the pews in all those years at trinity church squarely at the center of the national debate how obama handles that moment may determine whether he becomes the next occupant of 1600 pennsylvania avenue

3350047 ever since the hanging of ken saro wiwa and eight other activists in 1995 this region has been seething with anger saro wiwa had been fighting against environmental degradation of his native ogoniland by the shell oil company
3350048 house speaker nancy pelosi and other washington politicians lobby groups pledge support to rossport campaigner
3350049 i dont think any company even shell umh will introduce expensive safety measures unless they have to
3350050 first they ignore you then they laugh at you then they fight you then you win
3350051 we do not seek conflict we know the strength of the forces arrayed against us know that because of them we can only use peaceful means but we are determined that justice will be done
3350052 jean smith who lives about half a mile from the plant in kimberley road said she heard an explosion about 6pm and saw a ball of smoke followed by flames
3350053 the cleaning process was a joke and a waste of time
3350054 now you have the situation where shell will be laying rusted pipes around a landfall area with a history of landslides which minister eamon ryan recently exempted from the planning process
3350055 while obviously shell doesnt design these pipelines to fail the evidence is that their penny pinching has previously resulted in accidents in which people have been killed

3350061 the palestinian side will only accept a palestinian state with territorial continuity with holy jerusalem as its capital without settlements and on the june 4 1967 boundaries
3350062 its perfectly normal that russia would want to defend the interests both of russians in russia and russophones outside russia
3350063 it is also normal for the international community to want to guarantee the integrity sovereignty and independence of georgia
3350064 ive never played singles at the olympics so this has been really cool for me
3350065 every time i walk out there its like im playing in my match but at the same time i have the whole u s team on my side its good i really like that feeling
3350066 obviously its a long ways away but the third round makes it closer im really excited for both of us to be playing really well for the u s
3350067 its hard to train for singles and always dealing with swelling ive just really been playing careful with it i really wanted to be here in whatever capacity it was and it became painfully obvious to me that role was doubles i was very happy to accept that and move forward
3350068 but with the time difference im still waking up like at 5 in the morning so its good i like the early matches
3350069 my way of improving on it is to keep it up
3350070 i played really clean matches in the past the next one would be kind of streaky i dont want to do that any more i just want to keep playing the same consistency
3350071 wir hoffen auf einen positiven imagegewinn durch das fu ball engagement
3350072 he must hold firm to the sure word as taught so that he may be able to give instruction in sound doctrine and also to confute those who contradict it
3350073 people were telling me yesterday afternoon that they are usually harassed by police members so they are very mad
3350074 since then every leader of the community has appealed for peace that has been heard but we still dont know what will happen at any time
3350075 people are still mad police behaviour is still bad to them so we never know what will happen
3350076 this is not only about gang street members its about ordinary citizens who live peacefully in montreal north
3350077 whenever police see a black man or just see a young man police will stop him and try to get information from them and arrest them
3350078 if you live in montreal north and you have a good car police will try to stop you and ask you for your identity

3350082 a safety belt was in use and alcohol was suspected
3350083 in that respect they will be very strict in regard to any price they would pay for michael page
3350084 he was our little brother he was the baby of the family
3350085 i saw blood on his stomach and on his side and i couldnt do anything
3350086 i kept saying take care of my brother take care of my brother
3350087 i share their pain and suffering in this very difficult time
3350088 that is why it is essential to shed the light on every detail of this tragic event i have personally asked the minister of public security jacques dupuis to identify the most effective way to ensure a transparent investigation can take place as quickly as possible and i would like that investigation to be known and very well understood by the community
3350089 this morning montreals police chief yvan delormes appealed for calm in this city after such a tense night
3350090 there have been six arrests so far and several counts of mischief up to 39 were told 20 break and enters and a lot of looting and vandalism happening last night
3350091 this is a group of people that are trying to say something to us and i am willing to listen
3350092 of course there was some major vandalism but at the same time i spoke with many of the citizens and many of the authorities right now everybody is talking to each other so i have a good feeling that were on the right track
3350093 eighteen year old freddy villanueva was killed by police during a confrontation with officers on saturday evening in montreal north
3350094 why didnt that police officer use his gun when that kid was trying to get it from him
3350095 police brutality is spreading across the country on the way they handle youth way of life
3350096 i applaud those who rioted and stood up to the police
3350097 good for you for destroying the neighbourhood because you dont like the cops
3350098 minding their own business and police just walks in arresting ppl at random
3350099 i would never give it up not unless i was dying of alcohol poisoning or something
3350100 its inelastic demand as far as many of these stocks are concerned
3350101 so far theres signs that they are holding up although theres still concern that these industries will see some impact
3350102 id rather spend 4 or 5 on quality beer than 3 on hopped up water
3350103 its worth the extra buck or two to get quality
3350104 were going to stop buying silly things like that as opposed to giving up going out for a drink
3350105 cigarettes in general can withstand such an environment better than many consumer products
3350106 while not immune from the consequences of an economic slowdown we can certainly look to the future with more confidence than most
3350107 the odd bar of chocolate is not going to break the bank
3350108 i always have a piece a day and i cant see that changing
3350109 i cant believe i still havent run out of fat jokes yet
3350110 sharp downfall in economic data coming out of the euro zone a rise in oil is not going to change that
3350111 im gonna join jerry and tour to a few different colleges theyre doing sort of a seinfeld presentation at some colleges i know theyre gonna do it in september at nyu and in phoenix and in san francisco so im gonna join him on a couple of those dates
3350112 sony hasnt said anything but im assuming theyre gonna want me to at least look the way i looked on the show
3350113 the aggressor has been punished and suffered very significant losses its military has been disorganised
3350114 the mother was there he was still there but they left
3350115 he wasnt that close to them so he just said they left
3350116 he was aspiring to be an actor out there and he thought it a more appropriate name
3350117 but theres nothing wrong with using aliases as long as you dont use them to defraud
3350118 to our mind the efforts undertaken by this defendant to avoid conclusive identification are simply too extensive for us to take anything at face value
3350119 any identification we make must be checked double checked supported and verified by every means possible
3350120 confirmed the move into senaki and said it was intended to prevent georgian troops from concentrating
3350121 we have completed a considerable part of the operation to force georgian authorities toward peace in south ossetia
3350122 if my memory serves m e right it was ronald reagan who said in relation to one of latin americas dictators a while ago somoza of course is a son of a bitch but hes our son of a bitch and we will be helping him well protect him
3350123 experiments are about the assembly of persuasive arguments ones that will stand up in court the task at hand is to capture the building up of a persuasive argument about the world even in the absence of the logicians certainty
3350124 perhaps they can pull a rabbit out of the hat but im skeptical
3350125 we are honored that gl amp scs has named ngc a top 100 great supply chain partner
3350126 it is especially gratifying to be recognized by our customers for providing best in class technology solutions and services ngc will continue to work hard to make sure that our customers harness the power of our plm global sourcing and erp solutions to transform their supply chains
3350127 i recognize that people across the commonwealth particularly retirees on a fixed income are facing difficult economic times
3350128 however i returned an earlier version of this legislation expressing concern about adding significant costs to the commonwealths already large unfunded retirement liability
3350129 he was trying to strike a balance between helping the retirees on the truly fixed incomes while also helping the affordability of the commonwealth
3350130 we were taking a certain amount of risk hindsight being 20 20 we underestimated the priority the governor placed on his amendment
3350131 the easy decision would have been to sign it and give an added benefit to 100 000 employees
3350132 but the state didnt have any money to pay for it
3350133 he was not prepared to handle this legislation at this time but i believe he wants to do something to improve the cost of living adjustments for retirees
3350134 were getting together a mission statement and brochure and letter and materials appropriate for captains to ask their natural constituents to help
3350135 i hate to lead with my chin but i have to say its one of the easiest sells ive been involved in
3350136 it is the single most important thing other than family and health that senator kennedy is focused on
3350137 he will be gratified if things go forward as a salute to him and an institution he loves at a place he loves
3350138 the united states senate is one of our forefathers most brilliant democratic inventions
3350139 to preserve our vibrant democracy for future generations i believe it is critical to have a place where citizens can go to learn first hand about the senates important role in our system of government im looking forward to getting the institute up and running soon
3350140 to have an edward m kennedy institute on a umass campus is very exciting very exciting
3350141 this has its closest analogy in the presidential libraries but those cover a four to eight year period this is a lot longer time period and its a completely different style of politics
3350142 wed like to have republicans and democrats on an advisory board wed like to have lectures from senators on both sides of the aisle
3350143 it really is a model about government the presidency of john f kennedy and the senate career of edward m kennedy this will be a model in perpetuity that will remember the short time we had president kennedy and the many years weve had with senator kennedy
3350144 its not the best use of manpower but we have a responsibility
3350145 if we make an arrest weve got to hold them and that means bringing them to a secure facility
3350146 we reverted to what every department does and thats send them to a state facility that has a bed
3350147 theres no question the whole sys tem is strained and underfunded
3350148 thats what were looking at how do we best run it and how do we best fund it
3350149 we want to use the dwindling federal funds for other programs
3350150 there are no words for a loss of this magnitude which is reverberating throughout our communities
3350151 everyone was sad he was pretty well liked by everyone
3350152 he wanted to know everyone just as much as people wanted to know him
3350153 he was such a goof but he always made people smile
3350154 this training period also will provide an opportunity for the community to learn more about how biosafety research in research labs is carried out and about the many safety protocols in place
3350155 if they meet all the criteria there shouldnt be any reason they do not get an occupancy permit
3350156 the bottom line is they have to be cognizant of whos going in and out of this building
3350157 we dont want anyone studying how to game this place
3350158 were doing much better than we had anticipated in our original projections
3350159 its very good progress and we hope to do even better
3350160 we are still very concerned that there will be large numbers of persons who about a year ago filed to be naturalized and have yet to go through that process
3350161 without knowing her personally we feel a connection with her
3350162 were very proud of her we just want her to be healthy and happy because so many of the girls get hurt
3350163 although winchester gets quiet in the summer there is a buzz of excitement at town hall and around the community about alicia as she competes in the olympics
3350164 weve trained with her weve watched her day in and day out
3350165 there have been claims in the past that have been made against our card or other cards and happily theyve all been able to be dismissed or dealt with
3350166 its not a light step for a judge to grant this action and it speaks to the strength of our arguments and the merits of our position
3350167 that certainly would discourage security researchers from discussing their work and sharing information that might ultimately make systems more secure
3350168 we planned all along not to reveal the full details about what we had found
3350169 we basically gave some information but nothing that would enable someone to defraud the mbta at all
3350170 theyve made claims that theyve been able to in some way understand part of the code
3350171 what were doing is simply trying to figure out whether or not there is anything to their claims
3350172 theres a line between being responsible for rebuilding a country you helped destroy and being a chump and i think we crossed that line
3350173 senator coleman at any time could have done these hearings on reconstruction and he did none

3350175 perd no creo que merezca estar en esta situaci n pero no siempre el deporte es justo me desanim bastante lo que ocurri con la norcoreana donde como dije antes con palabras vulgares me afanaron la lucha
3350176 si no fuera por eso quiz s estar a en otra instancia en este momento
3350177 fui perjudicada por los rbitros me sancionaron a m pese a que ella no atacaba me obligaron a abrir la lucha por lo cual ella me hizo una puntuaci n y reci n despu s de correrla mucho le dieron una sola penalizaci n cuando se merec a dos mas
3350178 la lucha la tendr a que haber ganado yo me quej de la manera que pude pero cuando uno se queja se pone en contra a los rbitros ya no hay nada que hacer
3350179 me tendr a que haber recuperdo psicol gicamente para volver bien con la holandesa porque ten a la chance en el repechaje el tema de las injusticias me tira mucho abajo porque si te tiran es una cosa pero si te perjudica un rbitro es otra
3350180 no puedo pensar en el futuro ahora lo voy a hacer en fr o
3350181 dimos un gran espect culo y espero que lo sigamos haciendo

3350187 he is a person of interest we want to speak to him we want anybody who was associated with him from 1985 to 1988 to please come forward
3350188 if and when it changes our wholesale business and the agreement with the tata group gives us great experience of the indian marketplace and consumer
3350189 its a sensible deal theyre not betting the farm on it
3350190 it gets them entry into the market and thats what its all about but its a very very long term one
3350191 the security of our peacekeepers and civilians has been restored
3350192 the aggressor has been punished and suffered very significant losses its military has been disorganized
3350193 if there are any emerging hotbeds of resistance or any aggressive actions you should take steps to destroy them
3350194 russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century
3350195 the irish are the only men who know how to cry for the dirty polluted blood of all the world
3350196 i used to work in a fire hydrant factory you couldnt park anywhere near the place
3350197 the continuous decline of the cpi is a positive sign as it shows the governments measures to ease inflationary pressures were effective
3350198 we know this isnt going to be easy to bounce back from
3350199 but thus do i counsel you my friends distrust all in whom the impulse to punish is powerful
3350200 republicans are a little more positive about gas prices than are democrats and independents

3350210 im happy to be here and i will do my best for west bromwich albion football club
3350211 i spoke with the manager and he is a good manager his mind is good he is the reason i am at west brom
3350212 when i spoke to him he explained to me his style and i like it its a big club and i think we can stay in the premier league and achieve more
3350213 im not at all disappointed there are reasons why players decide to come and sign for this football club
3350214 they see ambition and an exciting chance to join the hull city bandwagon
3350215 some players decide against it ive got no problem with that but i dont class this as a failure quite the opposite
3350216 we want players that want to play for us and do everything they can for the team
3350217 i want players with pride when they pull on a hull city shirt but he didnt want to even do that for bolton i definitely believe that he was a good one to miss
3350218 stored procedures views triggers query cache and prepared statements are gone for now the field types have been simplified and there is an open debate about the show commands i am falling into the camp that think they may just belong in the client application but not in the server will any of this go back in it is hard to say the goal right now is to target a certain class of applications developers and see if this is useful as an example 1 web based apps 2 cloud components 3 databases without business logic aka stored procedures 4 multi core architecture
3350219 drizzle solves many of the problems that mysqls development has had for years
3350220 it opens up mysql development for the community you no longer have to wait years to get your patches and reasonable extensions into the server critical bugs that have existed for years can finally get fixed as the development is no longer constrained by unrealistic release schedules that put artificial constraints on things that can be fixed drizzle will put some mysql server differentiation on a true test a bit like fedora does to red hat drizzle has created new excitement in the mysql developer community a lot of people seem to be very enthusiastic to work on it in a true community oriented manner developers working on drizzle is doing drastic refactoring of the server something that mysql planned to do years ago but never happened development decisions is again driven by people that are using the server daily this will ensure that drizzle will be faster and more stable than what can be done with current mysql development model drizzle will target the mysql core users the web users whose requirements have been ignored for years while the core mysql developers have added features that they dont need in addition drizzle will include the latest innodb code you dont have to wait for mysql 6 0 or go to the trouble of annually downloadoing and installing the innodb plugin from oracle just to get access to the latest and fastest innodb version
3350221 eight three percent have yet to pay for the use of their open source database
3350222 a majority of respondents indicated that they used an open source database in order to migrate away from their use of microsoft sql server and oracle commercial databases
3350223 less than one percent indicated they moved off of ibm db2 to an open source database microsoft sql server was the highest at eleven percent while oracle was at six percent
3350224 even enterprisedb which offers proprietary oracle compatible functionality on top of postgresql is pitched more at oracle avoidance projects than oracle replacement projects
3350225 only nine percent of respondents said they prefer commercial databases to open source ones
3350226 what prevents you or your company from using an open source database
3350227 nothing prohibits their company from using an open source database
3350228 10gen offers an open source stack consisting of an app server and object database developers can write apps in server side javascript or ruby experimental and host it on their own computing clouds
3350229 its also striking that many platform as a service companies deviate from the standard web server app server relational db trio of which the lamp stack is an example google app engine uses bigtable for its storage whereas 10gen wrote its own

3350232 one of the first main challenges for a company that has been acquired by google is adopting the proprietary technology stack used within the company google does use linux and open source but their core technologies are all internal to the company
3350233 because of the difference in technology it can take a company anywhere from a year to three or more years to move over to the google infrastructure and architecture
3350234 the solutions for google are either to adopt a more open stack in parallel to what they currently use or to open source their internal technologies as facebook and yahoo are doing in the hope that they will spread and gain adoption from more developers

3350244 some men change their party for the sake of their principles others their principles for the sake of their party
3350245 the means of defense against foreign danger historically have become the instruments of tyranny at home
3350246 we need a jeffersonian revolution if it doesnt happen our democracy will continue to weaken and things will get worse right now we have a two party electoral dictatorship with each party looking for the highest corporate bidder
3350247 a people that values its privileges above its principles soon loses both
3350248 a democracy will continue to exist up until the time that voters discover they can vote themselves generous gifts from the public treasury
3350249 we are not blind we are men and women with eyes and brains and we dont have to be driven hither and thither by the blind workings of the market or of history or of progress or of any other abstraction
3350250 this country with its institutions belongs to the people who inhabit it whenever they shall grow weary of the existing government they can exercise their constitutional right of amending it or their revolutionary right to dismember it or overthrow it
3350251 a cynical mercenary demagogic press will produce in time a people as base as itself
3350252 the minute you read something that you cant understand you can almost be sure that it was drawn up by a lawyer
3350253 laws control the lesser man right conduct controls the greater one
3350254 one of the greatest delusions in the world is the hope that the evils in this world are to be cured by legislation
3350255 naturally the common people dont want war neither in russia nor in england nor in america nor in germany that is understood but after all it is the leaders of the country who determine policy and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along whether it is a democracy or a fascist dictatorship or a parliament or a communist dictatorship voice or no voice the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders that is easy all you have to do is to tell them they are being attacked and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger it works the same in any country
3350256 preventive war was an invention of hitler frankly i would not even listen to anyone seriously that came and talked about such a thing
3350257 the purpose of the law is not to prevent a future offense but to punish the one actually committed
3350258 ultimately we need to restore the understanding that in a democracy the rights of citizens to govern themselves are more important than the rights of corporations to make money
3350259 it does not require a majority to prevail but rather an irate tireless minority keen to set brush fires in peoples minds
3350260 when people who are honestly mistaken learn the truth they will either cease being mistaken or cease being honest
3350261 during times of universal deceit telling the truth becomes a revolutionary act
3350262 america will never be destroyed from the outside if we falter and lose our freedoms it will be because we destroyed ourselves
3350263 the things that will destroy america are prosperity at any price peace at any price safety first instead of duty first the love of soft living and the get rich quick theory of life
3350264 democracy is two wolves and a lamb voting on what to have for lunch liberty is a well armed lamb contesting the vote
3350265 whoever controls the volume of money in any country is absolute master of all industry and commerce
3350266 if tyranny and oppression come to this land it will be in the guise of fighting a foreign enemy
3350267 the tyrant grinds down his slaves and they dont turn against him they crush those beneath them
3350268 patriotism is the conviction that your country is superior to all others because you were born in it
3350269 freedom is the right to tell people what they do not want to hear
3350270 anyone who believes exponential growth can go on forever in a finite world is either a madman or an economist
3350271 fascism should more appropriately be called corporatism because it is the merger of state and corporate power
3350272 corporation n an ingenious device for obtaining profit without individual responsibility
3350273 the hottest places in hell are reserved for those who in time of great moral crises maintain their neutrality
3350274 we are at the parting of the ways we have not one or two or three but many established and formidable monopolies in the united states we have not one or two but many fields of endeavor into which it is difficult if not impossible for the independent man to enter we have restricted credit we have restricted opportunity we have controlled development and we have come to be one of the worst ruled one of the most completely controlled and dominated governments in the civilized world no longer a government by free opinion no longer a government by conviction and the vote of the majority but a government by the opinion and the duress of small groups of dominant men
3350275 facts do not cease to exist because they are ignored
3350276 i believe that banking institutions are more dangerous to our liberties than standing armies if the american people ever allow private banks to control the issue of their currency first by inflation then by deflation the banks and corporations that will grow up around them will deprive the people of all property until their children wake up homeless on the continent their fathers conquered the issuing power should be taken from the banks and restored to the people to whom it properly belongs
3350277 banking was conceived in iniquity and was born in sin the bankers own the earth take it away from them but leave them the power to create money and with the flick of the pen they will create enough deposits to buy it back again however take it away from them and all the great fortunes like mine will disappear and they ought to disappear for this would be a happier and better world to live in but if you wish to remain the slaves of bankers and pay the cost of your own slavery let them continue to create money and control credit
3350278 it was not accidental it was a carefully contrived occurrence the international bankers sought to bring about a condition of despair here so that they might emerge as rulers of us all
3350279 so you think that money is the root of all evil have you ever asked what is the root of all money
3350280 we shall have world government whether or not we like it the only question is whether world government will be achieved by conquest or consent
3350281 if we dont change our direction were likely to end up where were headed
3350282 there are a lot of exiles in this world each one has his own reason we have ours long before we left america the america we knew left us we travel not to get away from it but to find it
3350283 while each of us is entitled to his own opinions none of us is entitled to his own facts
3350284 find out just what the people will submit to and you have found out the exact amount of injustice and wrong which will be imposed upon them and these will continue until they are resisted with either words or blows or with both the limits of tyrants are prescribed by the endurance of those whom they oppress
3350285 those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it
3350286 a morsel of genuine history is a thing so rare as to be always valuable
3350287 any intelligent fool can make things bigger more complex and more violent it takes a touch of genius and a lot of courage to move in the opposite direction
3350288 in the beginning of change the patriot is a scarce man and brave and hated and scorned when his cause succeeds the timid join him for it then costs nothing to be a patriot
3350289 the first step in the evolution of ethics is a sense of solidarity with other human beings
3350290 the human race has improved everything except the human race adlai stephenson
3350291 earth provides enough to satisfy every mans need but not every mans greed
3350292 if you tremble indignation at every injustice then you are a comrade of mine

3350298 i come here to see the ultra wasp y crowd in new york
3350299 if i were single i would come here to find girls to hook up with
3350300 as a girl i would not come here to hook up with a guy for just that reason
3350301 i came to see the place where the preppy killer was
3350302 but there are none here so well come back tomorrow
3350303 i feel like they disappear as soon as they happen when i wake up i think i had fun the night before and then i reconfirm it with other people
3350304 i came down and stopped at elaines and there was nothing happening
3350305 ive been to a lot of places and theres no place like dorrians
3350306 the best thing about dorrians is that theyve got a pretty good class of people if they can help you they cant theyll say not they wont just walk away
3350307 the bouncers dont disrespect you like some places that want to call you all sorts of

3350314 the documents are predominantly based on confidential material provided by microsoft which was provided on the clear understanding that it would remain confidential
3350315 could give rise to an actionable breach of confidence by microsoft
3350316 disclosure of the mou would create a risk to microsofts commercial interests
3350317 future negotiating position with microsoft would be weakened and we would not be confident of our continuing ability to obtain the best deal possible for those uk schools
3350318 has it ever occurred to them that if they started negotiating from a position of dignity and strength rather than abject supine servitude they might just possibly do their job a teensy weensy bit better
3350319 significant potential for institutions to find themselves locked in to microsofts subscription licensing arrangements
3350320 very significant complexity leading to a lack of understanding at institution level that has resulted in widespread use of inappropriate licensing strategies
3350321 for the pleasure of having them corrupt young childrens minds
3350322 microsoft is scared witless by the prospect of open source getting a foothold in schools and would agree to any deal rather than let the uk education system discover the power and value of free software
3350323 1 22 microsofts subscription licensing agreements are all or nothing in other words if a school wants to cover any of its ict estate using a subscription agreement it must cover all its eligible pcs microsoft has set the definition of an eligible pc as any computer with a specification of a pii processor or higher the pii was launched in 1997 the eligible pc definition also includes apple macintosh computers g3 or higher this approach results in over licensing double licensing and other anomalies 1 23 one such anomaly occurs because schools tend to retain computer systems longer than is typical in other market areas this leads to a position whereby the total number of computers on which they must pay a subscription based licence fee increases year on year the elderly nature of their ict estate means that older pcs may not even be capable of running the new software under these arrangements therefore costs increase while the scope for using the new products across the entire estate decreases 1 24 a further anomaly arises in that a school which uses a mix of microsoft based and apple computers can find itself paying microsoft a licence fee for software which cannot run on its apple machines
3350324 microsoft should rebase the eligible pc definition in line with the specification necessary to run the most recent version of the relevant operating system when educational institutions wish to license on the basis of computer numbers they should have the freedom to select which computers they license
3350325 due to incompetent public sector contract negotiations we the public and taxpayers will not know what our money is buying us
3350326 for an example of why vocabulary is important consider the role of cathedral and the bazaar in providing the industry a vocabulary with which to explain open versus closed development models
3350327 we talk about community at mozilla all the time a lot of other people talk about community as well people use the word community to mean many different things sometimes community is used to describe a coherent structured group and sometimes a diffuse permeable set of people
3350328 at the heart of the mozilla world is a set of people who share many things we share code we share goals we share a set of values we share specific means of collaboration information repositories a decision making structure and a clear set of basic rights we share activities
3350329 the people in this group may share our values our goals our decision making processes for example but develop their own ways of collaborating and their own sets of activities
3350330 beyond this theres a set of people who arent actively involved in creating mozilla artifacts but are very supportive of our product or our mission
3350331 an ever larger circle is the set of people who use our products some of these people are also in earlier concentric circles but a number are not they use firefox because its a great product that meets their needs
3350332 open source communities extend beyond those who interact directly on the open source projects mailing lists and forums and include the users customers and partners in a wide variety of ways in my opinion there are neighborhoods within the larger community that have their own perspectives and ways of interacting with the larger community

3350351 just as you wouldnt expect to see a tobacco ad on a kids site or show there shouldnt be junk food ads there either
3350352 while there are some rules for tv there are no rules when you move online
3350353 we dont want to reduce junk food advertising to kids on tv and then find that it has just moved to another platform
3350354 with social networking marketers are getting the kids to create the ads and share them with their friends
3350355 it is incredibly sticky and it is viral regulators need to understand that
3350356 the report finds that although there is room for improvement the food and beverage industries have made significant progress
3350357 the cost of reaching and engaging a lot more kids is a lot less than the cost of what it is to buy a 30 second television ad
3350358 they are using a powerful arsenal of tools to target children and adolescents so they can engage in these unhealthy eating behaviors
3350359 to show that the government needs to regulate this advertising to improve childrens diets would be pretty tough
3350360 we think that companies can act on a self regulatory basis much more quickly than the government can
3350361 listen up fellow parents when we point a collective finger three more are pointing right back at us
3350362 when will we stop playing the victim and start taking personal responsibility for our kids health and eating habits

3350377 corporations and self employed individuals may already take a deduction for their development expenses for both open source and proprietary commercial software
3350378 technology and resources with communities worldwide to help eliminate the digital divide create economic opportunity and foster equal access to technology
3350379 perhaps in years to come we will see big businesses boasting about lowering their proprietary licensing footprint through the more efficient use of computing resources just as today they boast about the efficient use of natural resources maybe the laggards could pay someone else to adopt open source for them via proprietary offsetting schemes while i am being flippant here it wouldnt seem unreasonable for shareholders to demand that businesses justify their spending on it resources to ensure that profits are being reinvested efficiently
3350380 a buon punto ha osservato marino abbiamo centrato il primo obiettivo della stagione cio lingresso in uefa ora tenteremo di andare il pi avanti possibile la gara con gli albanesi del vllaznia non affatto semplice ha sottolineato il dg azzurro allemittente campana come tutte le partite in uefa daltronde pensate che la nosta gara col panionios pi che un turno di intertoto per la caratura dellavversario poteva essere considerato un buon ottavo di finale ludinese in torunee in grecia ha giocato sul campo del paok salonicco che giunto sei posti in classifica dietro il panionios ed stata sconfitta ad ogni modo abbiamo gi salito un altro gradino importante per il futuro gioved proveremo a salirne un altro ancora in campo la squadra albanese cercher di qualificarsi con i mezzi che ha a disposizione il vllaznia colmer con lagonismo il gap tecnico incontestabile che ha nei confronti del napoli
3350381 si vero ha ammesso ci sono stato ed i giornali hanno carpito il nostro lavoro jodlowiec lo seguiamo ormai da un anno e un giocatore che speriamo di riuscire a tesserare la trattativa stata anticipata dai giornali ma non ancora a livello di firma il mercato dellest lo conosciamo bene e lo seguiamo attentamente qualche giocatore ci gi sfuggito allultimo momento per la concorrenza spietata di club inglesi francesi spagnoli e tedeschi tuttavia non ci sfuggono per questioni economiche
3350382 noi abbiamo una opzione per jodlowiec e lassenso del procuratore del giocatore il suo arrivo a napoli indipendente dalla partenza di domizzi al ragazzo polaccoi dobbiamo concedere qualche mese per ambientarsi ha precisato marino arriva senza conoscere la lingua e il campionato italiano da lui non pretendiamo tutto e subito pu arrivare anche se non parte domizzi
3350383 non me lo spiego ha ammesso probabilmente abbiamo sbagliato qualcosa nella comunciazione perch molti pensano che il napoli allultimo minuto se ne debba liberare
3350384 e chiaro che quando necessario forzare un p perch c un obiettivo stagionale appena quindici giorni dopo linizio del ritiro pu succedere che qualche giocatore sia vittima di infortuni ad ogni modo devo fare i complimenti a reja e ai nostri preparatori atletici che ci hanno consentito di vincere le due gare di intertoto dispiace per mannini per lui si poteva fare qualcosa in pi perch ha subito due volte lo stesso infortunio in questo caso abbiamo sbagliato sia noi che il giocatore
3350385 sono contentissimo di lui ha sottolineato il dg trovo piuttosto superficiale e dilettantistico il voler contare quanti gol fa in amichevole o notare gli assist piuttosto che i gol gli assist di denis per bogliacino e hamsik nelle due partite con il panionios valgono quanto un gol ad ogni modo non possiamo valutarlo dalle reti in precampionato il giocatore ha confermato da vicino quello che avevamo visto da lontano e quindi siamo soddisfatti
3350386 dopo linfortunio di rocchi sarebbe giusto da parte di casiraghi chiamarlo altrimenti non ho capito perch hanno portato in cina una riserva quando poteva allenarsi qui con il napoli

3350392 is still missing a clear strategy about how to foster the italian open source ecosystem through training education research and outreach
3350393 our concern is that they idabc will still insist on standards that have no intellectual property ip rights and they will not revise the definition of an open standard as contained in eif version one they define open standards inconsistent with the common understanding of the term in what we believe is a dogmatic approach it fails to recognise that almost all standards that help interoperability and that governments should indeed use to promote the very objectives of the eif do have intellectual property
3350394 we stressed the need for the evaluation of standards along many dimensions one of them being openness and the possibility to implement the standard in open source software which is of course only important if you value open source software standards with ip rights regimes that prohibit the implementation of these standards in open source software should if more open alternative standards exist not be used as the basis to achieve interoperability if your organisation wants to be able to benefit from open source software
3350395 the intellectual property i e patents possibly present of parts of the standard is made irrevocably available on a royalty free basis

3350422 the spirit shows what is true and will come and guide you into the full truth
3350423 when you see yourself doing something badly and nobodys bothering you to tell you anymore thats a very bad place to be your critics are the ones telling you they still love you and care
3350424 life isnt about surviving the storm its about dancing in the rain
3350425 weissu was wihlich sss hlt im lem rocknroll und garten
3350426 the affair began before rielle hunter was hired to work for the campaign
3350427 she said that john edwards was in love with her and she was in love with him and that the relationship was solid
3350428 misconduct took place for a short period in 2006 it ended then
3350429 the ad was mostly ad libbed with russell brand asking her for advice about hosting the show
3350430 the more competent and trained police officers we have on the streets the better we will be able to prevent crime
3350431 the da will employ police officers purely on the basis of competence not quotas and we will stop top level political appointments
3350432 specialised units have previously been hugely successful in combating specific crimes almost all have been closed down they must be reinstated so that the war on child abuse narcotics and vehicle theft among others can be strengthened
3350433 those who commit other serious crimes will have to show cause as to why they should be granted bail those who are convicted must serve the time they deserve
3350434 most importantly this directorate will manage a victims of crime fund to ensure that victims have access to services and assistance
3350435 we have again received scores of applications for leave to appeal and the judge took one as a sample
3350436 i am satisfied that there is no reasonable prospect that the sapap may come to a decision different to that of the ombudsman
3350437 they had been two of the bulls stalwarts before their injuries it is up to them to seize this opportunity and make the most of it
3350438 ocha is extremely concerned by the escalation and the violence the situation is deteriorating on the ground amidst a significant movement of population
3350439 thats why ocha is asking all parties to give humanitarian organisations access to people who are wounded to people who need aid
3350440 both sides blame each other for continuing hostilities in south ossetia preventing people from leaving the region
3350441 south africans are bombarded by bad news and have become allergic to drama this production will go some way to my goal of reflecting society
3350442 i would like afrikaans theatre to reflect society and be given an opportunity to grow with the audiences
3350443 tv is a terrible vehicle to give artists the opportunity to grow but serves the purpose of a regular pay cheque
3350444 i first directed steriel at the kknk and the play centres on the kaapse style afrikaans
3350445 the coloured community feels marginalised yet this is a multi cultural vibrant energetic society and the community exhibits these qualities with vitality and humour
3350446 i cant work with rules thats what made tv writing difficult i need the space to express what interests me and i get obsessed
3350447 today audiences dont want to think they want to laugh and thats why i focus on comedy with my social commentary woven in
3350448 also its a treat to work at artscape its so well organised so that you can just come in and focus on what you need to do act you dont have to worry about all the other hassles compared to when you work at the festivals
3350449 of a type commonly relied upon by reasonably prudent persons in the conduct of their affairs
3350450 the audience will understand that its in the national interest
3350451 nine year old lin miaoke becomes instant star with patriotic song
3350452 the national interest requires that the girl should have good looks and a good grasp of the song and look good on screen
3350453 lin miaoke was the best in this and yang peiyis voice was the most outstanding
3350454 we had to make that choice it was fair both for lin miaoke and yang peiyi
3350455 this is like a voice over for a cartoon character
3350456 why couldnt they pick a kid who is both cute and a good singer this damages the reputation of both kids for their future especially the one lip synching now everyone knows shes a fraud who cares if shes cute
3350457 i can understand why they picked the prettier girl they need to maintain a certain aesthetic beauty during the opening ceremonies this situation is not so bad especially since it gives two people an opportunity to shine rather than just one
3350458 still cannot believe his daughter has become an international singing sensation
3350459 it feels good to be at the top of the championship points for sure
3350460 after laguna seca when we dnfd did not finish last may there i knew it was going to be a long road back up to the top the team is really gelling the cars been really great and hopefully we can keep this trend throughout the rest of the year and we can finish up top

3350466 to members of the g len movement he is an inspirational leader who encourages a life guided by moderate islamic principles to his detractors he represents a threat to turkeys secular order
3350467 the host of the popular shari ah and life tv program on al jazeera qaradawi issues weekly fatwas on everything from whether islam forbids all consumption of alcohol to whether fighting us troops in iraq is a legitimate form of resistance
3350468 with a charismatic oratory and casual style khaled blends messages of cultural integration and hard work with lessons on how to live a purpose driven islamic life
3350469 more than 30 years ago yunus loaned several dozen poor entrepreneurs in his native bangladesh a total of 27 it was the beginning of a lifetime devoted to fighting poverty through microfinance
3350470 his skillfully crafted works lay bare his native countrys thorny relationship with religion democracy and modernity earning him a nobel prize in literature in 2006
3350471 president of pakistans supreme court bar association ahsan has been a vocal opponent of president pervez musharrafs rule
3350472 when musharraf dismissed the head of the supreme court in march 2007 it was ahsan who led the legal challenge to reinstate the chief justice and rallied thousands of lawyers who took to the streets in protest
3350473 his work explores the role of citizenship identity and the creation of historical narratives in postcolonial africa
3350474 a fierce nationalist who sees no incompatibility between islam and democracy ebadi became the first iranian to win the nobel peace prize in 2003

3350478 all too often ive seen couples getting married without taking into consideration what their tax bracket will look like when they file until it is too late
3350479 at times i build upon the ideas i have mentioned in the column i write for economic times there is no space limitation as far as my blog goes a blog obviously does serve as a mode of expression but it proves to be particularly useful for students who have questions about topics that ive covered in class it helps to place issues in context
3350480 i integrate my blog posts with classroom exercises after discussing an issue in class i ask my students to read relevant posts and leave their comments on the blog or submit feedback on paper
3350481 i have been been blogging for the past two years all in all its been a terrific experience blogging has motivated me to study close to 400 brands for me a blog is an information resource rather than an interaction tool i do not try to integrate blog posts with classroom exercises the information on my blog serves to add value i use my blog mainly as a research journal through which students can get information and analyses about numerous brands
3350482 i want to blog more often and have students logging on and exchanging views outside the classroom blogging allows interactions with students to become more informal and reach to a wider audience students can stay in contact with me after graduation too i encourage students to access my blog and also send some of my blog posts in the form of e mails to my students my e mails also have the link to my blog in case they wish to read about other issues
3350483 i am also part of numerous yahoo groups where issues related to coursework are discussed i have observed that since in a yahoo group the audience is so much more visible some students prefer leaving comments there rather than on a blog in my opinion the potential of blogging has not been explored fully there are so few collaborative blogs

3350515 versicherungsunternehmen in westeuropa haben l ngst meist gro e sap l sungen im einsatz etliche davon sind auch unsere kunden viele versicherer in mittel und osteuropa dagegen bevorzugen vorab eher l sungen die bei der implementierung der nutzung und bei den kosten leichter berschaubar bleiben und schneller einzuf hren sind aber dennoch alle gesch ftsprozesse abdecken daher bieten wir nun neben sap auch die l sungen von firstapex an und komplettieren so unser portfolio
3350516 s amp t ist einer der f hrenden it anbieter in mittel und osteuropa eine allianz mit einem unternehmen derartigen kalibers hilft firstapex dabei eine solide pr senz auf diesem schnell wachsenden und sich rasch entwickelnden markt aufzubauen und gleichzeitig unsere globale pr senz zu st rken gemeinsam mit s amp t bieten wir firmen vor ort zugang zu erstklassigen branchenf hrenden l sungen und tragen dazu bei dass die it bed rfnisse der versicherungs und r ckversicherungsbranche in der region erf llt werden
3350517 wir sehen den bedarf f r firstapex l sungen vor allem bei unternehmen die eine derartige l sung neu einf hren wollen und bei unternehmen die zwar im erp bereich sap l sungen einsetzen aber f r ihr kerngesch ft auf spezialisierte software setzen wollen
3350518 unsere versicherungskunden in westeuropa fokussieren nicht auf die kernanwendungen sondern auf prozessoptimierungen auf komplexit tsreduktion und vertriebssteuerungssysteme im harten wettbewerb um neue kunden sollen h here ausgaben in die it zur profitabilit t beitragen
3350519 wir unterst tzen selbstverst ndlich auch unsere versicherungskunden in westeuropa bei ihren it herausforderungen unsere berater und technologieexperten verf gen sowohl ber branchenerfahrung als auch ber die entsprechende technologische fachkompetenz und betreuen umfassend bei lokalen als auch bei grenz berschreitenden projekten
3350520 nee die schade is wel niet voor de huurder verhuurder als het dezelfde maatschappij is draaien ze linksom of rechtsom voor de schade op
3350521 die lebensdauer von mo medien betr gt ber 50 jahre

3350524 yeah i think that both could work on other platforms
3350525 but being no 1 doesnt necessarily mean being accurate our colleague kathie lithicum notes at the l a times
3350526 the mission of beyond the pale is for us to honor the spirit and power of sound with people that we feel are kindred spirits we want to bring together a diverse group of people who push the envelope are truly original and have that unspeakable fire and inspiration flowing through their art
3350527 in our 23 years of existence we have had very few experiences that felt as right as our initial performance at roadburn in 2007
3350528 it is a great honor and privilege to have asked to host our own beyond the pale event at roadburn 2009
3350529 2009 also marks the 10th anniversary of our own label neurot recordings what an amazing way to mark our first decade as a label i believe that roadburn and neurosis share a clarity of vision that will result in an amazing experience for us all
3350530 once that wheel starts slowing to get it moving takes considerable effort

3350532 if you like enough low end that the neighbours can feel it three doors down the street you re gonna love the sludgy glory of sonic lord
3350533 portability is a key capability for cloud customers as the only real power customers have is in where they take their business and the only way you can change suppliers is if theres a ready market of fungible services and the only way their can be a market is if theres a high degree of standardization
3350534 this is big stuff despite the skepticism of some cloud fanatics who cant grep why
3350535 there is no direct financial loss to open office when someone has a pirated copy of microsoft office to the extent that bsa enforcement actions cause fear in the market that just benefits open source so why join it
3350536 on the other hand if we helped oracle enforce its license terms we might accelerate the move to mysql and ingres
3350537 our number one goal is that we want people to use our product if theyre going to pirate somebody we want it to be us rather than somebody else and thats because we understand that in the long run the fundamental asset is the install base of people who are using our products what you hope to do is over time you hope to convert them to licensing the software legally licensing it so on and so forth
3350538 by cracking down on software piracy nations around the globe are starting to see that they can help themselves dramatically by encouraging innovation and creativity as well as job growth and richer economies through open source development
3350539 its shameful that so many corporations make big profits and pay nothing to support our country
3350540 half of all business income in the united states now ends up going through the individual tax code
3350541 sharp downfall in economic data coming out of the euro zone a rise in oil is not going to change that
3350542 up until now people thought that the tasmanian mega fauna had actually gone extinct before people arrived on the island
3350543 things were very climatically stable in that part of australia and yet the mega fauna still managed to go extinct
3350544 so its down to humans of one sort or another
3350545 a lot of people still have in their minds an axe wielding spear wielding people bloodthirsty out there slaughtering all over the place it wasnt like that at all
3350546 it was basically just one joey baby kangaroo in the pot for christmas and thats all youve got to go to do to drive slow breeding species to extinction
3350547 i just pitched it to hbo two weeks ago in l a it went
3350548 how could i express what i was feeling in a way that didnt sound like bitching about george bush
3350549 make a bold statement this year and every year this magnetic permanent yet removable bumper sticker measures 15 by 3 3 4 inches its perfect not only for your car but for your refrigerator file cabinet any metal surface where you would like to make a statement
3350550 a repeat of the failed extremist politics that have characterized and plagued democratic party politics since the late 1960s
3350551 if youre suffering from the delusion that john mccain and barack obama are looking out for your best interests think again the only interests our major party candidates care about are their own and those of their buddies and financial contributors of both the foreign and domestic variety
3350552 make no mistake promoting either into the presidency means a further loss of our freedoms and once taken those freedoms wont be returned without a fight
3350553 farah is a serious man with a serious proposal that must be taken seriously

3350555 we work out together so while everyone else is standing up im just sitting there you know expecting it she does it whenever she feels good
3350556 as long as she stays healthy then she will have more opportunitues to play on this olympic stage
3350557 we didnt really talk too much on her recruiting visit
3350558 then we just hit it off that was pretty much it
3350559 oh no i just tell candace she should have come to duke she could have seen him all the time
3350560 im trying to absorb everything the opening ceremonies our first game and live every moment
3350561 we still support each other having him here is really great because he shows support i wouldnt want to be in beijing without him
3350562 its called the american dream because you have to be asleep to beleive it
3350563 you need to do your own research and find out who is really behind your green theory crap you should google endgame etc
3350564 my apology to ralph nader for not demanding that he be included in the debates
3350565 showing absolutely no indication theyre going to stop enriching uranium
3350566 it is clear that iran doesnt pay attention to talks iran is a threat not only to israel but this is a global threat
3350567 any kind of hesitation is being perceived by the iranians as weakness
3350568 you dont even give them 15 months necessarily you think its a more urgent matter
3350569 t he world cannot afford a nuclear iran and weapons of mass destruction everywhere in this region in the hands not only of states but also of terrorist organizations
3350570 we are working very hard with the europeans to try to resolve the conflict
3350571 the russians have said that the one thing they want is for the u s and the europeans not to do things such as bring georgia and ukraine into nato does that suggest options i dont know
3350572 what there is to lose is the stability of the framework that the u s thought was going to govern the post cold war world when one country conquers another thats typically regarded as pretty serious and the inability to do anything about it is something the united states is not all that accustomed to
3350573 what they have to be thinking in moscow is that the bush administration is only around for another five months
3350574 the dynamic might be different if it was the beginning of the new administration and they were trying to shape a new relationship
3350575 russias goal is not to occupy georgia but to assert its own interests in the region and to humiliate embarrass and eventually dislodge saakashvili from power once it has humiliated him enough and made its point then it would be ready to negotiate a diplomatic settlement
3350576 mi sento bene sono in forma e posso fare sempre meglio

3350581 other teams were good but we were better we performed perfect today everyone was excellent
3350582 it bothers me a lot especially if people from home kind of put down our team saying count the u
3350583 i wish more people in the u s believed in us like we believed in us now i hope more people realize the u s is a force to be reckoned with
3350584 since athens the chinese team has run into a lot of failures which tested the team
3350585 i know them and they do work very hard and put a lot of hard work in their training we worked as team we enjoyed it and thats more important than anything
3350586 we always believed in ourselves and we kept at it tenacious
3350587 and our guys knocked it out of the park it was just amazing
3350588 we have done it in reaction to the government operations in swat and bajur
3350589 if this kind of operations continue against us in swat and in the tribal areas we will continue this

3350595 we dont believe we are in a position to wait much longer for resolution of this question
3350596 created a solution to a problem that does not exist
3350597 rather than focus on building consensus for a budget that addresses californias long term fiscal problems the governor seems adamant on picking a fight over whether state employees are entitled to the wages they have worked for and earned
3350598 i condemn this terrorist attack that targeted us and this is not the first attempt
3350599 is not going to sway us from continuing our course of imposing security through operation good omen
3350600 we must capture or kill the hard core terrorists that are residing now out in the hinterlands
3350601 we want to use this handover occasion to celebrate the goodness of our people the capacity of our government to honour commitments from government to government and also to celebrate the friendship between two countries
3350602 the nigerian government can go ahead and handover bakassi to cameroon on thursday if they want but for us that will not change anything on the ground
3350603 our forces will remain on the ground and mount more attacks
3350604 i believe that if we really have a country and a government that respects the rule of law yaradua should respect the high court order if they have any misgivings about it then they should go on and appeal

3350644 the second quarter is the sixth consecutive quarter of home value declines and we see little promise of turnaround in the short term as the rates of decline have yet to slow and in fact actually accelerated in many markets
3350645 the high rates of negative equity are having a direct effect on home sales figures as weve seen considerable growth in foreclosure transactions and homes selling for a loss unfortunately while there are a few bright spots like pittsburgh oklahoma city and austin that reached record high values most markets are likely to remain in negative territory for the next few quarters given the magnitude of current year over year declines

3350656 i havent met one person who says my gosh boy you really need to take over the power system in san francisco
3350657 a public power initiative to take over pg amp e
3350658 i think its rather cynical way of branding it the clean energy act
3350659 al gore just delivered a helluva speech two days ago
3350660 which everyone is talking about that this country is able to convert to renewables a hundred percent renewable in the next ten years
3350661 as long as pg amp es there thatll never happen
3350662 at this rate pg amp e will only abide by the bare minimums the federal minimums as stipulated by the bush administration and that is 20 percent renewable by 2017 and that is just god awful
3350663 while a few municipal utilities do enjoy lower rates than what san francisco customers get many others have had to drastically increase rates because of the current energy crisis the ones with lower rates were formed years ago they either own their own generation facilities or have locked in long term contracts for low cost electricity a mud per se does not mean lower rates
3350664 lets call it what it is its a public power initiative to take over pg amp e who are by any objective standards doing more than any other utility in the united states of america to reduce greenhouse emissions

3350668 organic projects might generate more contributions which in turn might allow them to evolve faster which in turn might allow them to compete more effectively and so on which is ultimately why im comfortable with inorganic projects and contributions i generally trust the market
3350669 with but a few exceptions im a believer in allowing the market to make its own decisions on which software development and governance models they choose to support im not naive i understand that commercial deployment is hardly a strict meritocracy and that influence financial and otherwise is rampant

3350671 while the honey collector does not have responsibility to look after the bees that a bee keeper has he will have to take care not to disrupt the nest and may well choose to make an effort to nurture the nest and encourage honey production of course as these are wild bees there is also always a risk that the bees will leave the nest or production will dry up the collector is also aware that any improvements resulting from his efforts are available to everyone and rivals can easily set up alternative honey collection businesses

3350702 in the last 12 months the strategists have been ahead of analysts in reducing forecasts
3350703 in difficult market circumstances strategists are very useful because they can identify changes in the market when you have a prolonged period of benign environments you tend to focus on the bottom up and analysts can point you in the right direction
3350704 analysts tend to be more optimistic about the earnings outlook of individual companies generally they typically have a bias for thinking earnings will be higher than they actually are

3350710 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
3350711 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
3350712 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most

3350716 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
3350717 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here

3350721 before just before i came into current position i was a homicide detective for two years with the orange county sheriffs office and in my experience the smell that i smell inside that car was of decomposition
3350722 because they found hair samples in the trunk of the car that are similar in color and length to that of caylee and they also found a stain in the trunk that came up under black light that is questionable
3350723 they also found some dirt inside the car that needs to be processed
3350724 based on the evidence of human decomposition would it lead you to believe would it not that there is a possibility that this child is no longer alive
3350725 i wouldnt use the word suspect i would use the word person of interest

3350850 landen die zelf in een conflict verwikkeld zitten kunnen naar mijn mening geen lid worden
3350851 ze zag mij niet eens staan alsof ze niet wist waar ze was zo stond ze ook op de mat ik heb haar na drie partijen alsnog op de rails moeten zetten hoe door knalhard ruzie te maken
3350852 zij heeft een harde aanpak nodig straks bij willeboordse moet ik dat anders aanpakken dan moet ik lief zijn
3350853 daar sta ik nog steeds achter maar vandaag moest ik omschakelen de situatie vroeg er om ongelooflijk eigenlijk
3350854 ze zei ik ben er helemaal klaar mee echt dat zei ze terwijl ze nog een medaille kon winnen ga dan nu maar weg heb ik geantwoord hier hebben we geen vier jaar lang keihard voor gewerkt
3350855 ze begon te huilen daarna heb ik weer de ware elisabeth gezien degene die een unieke prestatie leverde door vijf wereldbekerwedstrijden op rij te winnen daarvoor waren er alleen maar twijfels twijfels twijfels ze is z xa2 goed maar ja dat mentale
3350856 ik was gewoon op van de zenuwen hier ik blokkeerde volledig ik dacht dat ik van dat probleem af was dat bleek niet zo de olympische spelen hebben me overdonderd het was even te veel voor me
3350857 maar de tijd om door schade en schande wijs te worden heb ik eigenlijk niet ik ben 29 misschien ben ik er over vier jaar wel helemaal niet meer bij krijg ik nooit weer een kans als deze toch heb ik nog brons omdat ik net op tijd weer in mezelf ben gaan geloven of ik er blij mee ben natuurlijk
3350858 ik had een complete off day niet n fatsoenlijke actie heb ik kunnen maken vooraf klopte alles het had allemaal gekund het is het de vorm van de dag verhaal
3350859 voy a entrenarme duro para estar con esas fieras en 2012
3350860 en el futuro no me voy a contentar con un sexto s ptimo puesto

3350871 hij moet nog wel een stapje harder zeker om straks aanspraak te kunnen maken op een medaille ik denk dat het morgen in de halve finales helemaal los gaat maar pieter laat ook zien dat hij op het juiste moment in vorm is
3350872 hij heeft een mooie race gezwommen precies zoals het moet dit is zeker bemoedigend
3350873 ik had een complete off day het was gewoon niks
3350874 als je kijkt naar zijn prestaties van de laatste jaren dan had hij hier kunnen winnen
3350875 mentaal was ik goed fysiek ook dat weet ik zeker maar dit was zon dag dat de vorm er gewoon niet was daar is weinig aan te doen na elke actie voelde ik me heel moe na de derde partij wist ik dat ik nergens op hoefde te rekenen
3350876 dat komt omdat de tegenstanders me niet kunnen werpen ik kon echter ook geen actie maken daarom duurden de partijen zo lang op een gegeven moment houdt het dan op
3350877 geen goud dan houdt het voor mij eigenlijk op ik was zwaar teleurgesteld geen finale ik heb het geprobeerd maar het zat er niet in ik was op had geen energie meer het is jammer maar het zat er echt niet in
3350878 het was ook nu nog lang niet het niveau wat we kunnen halen bij vlagen was het goed bij vlagen bagger
3350879 we maakten te veel fouten ik weet niet nu nog niet hoe het komt
3350880 het is mooi om hier te zijn zeker in deze ambiance maar we willen door niet na drie potjes eruit

3350882 wel een pot om naar uit te kijken nederland duitsland altijd leuk
3350883 daarom is er uitvoerig onderzoek gedaan en wordt nu eerst een proef gehouden
3350884 ik ben titelverdediger maar ben hier een outsider hopelijk een heel gevaarlijke outsider
3350885 daarin ga ik weer een tandje harder en dan hoop ik de finale te zwemmen dan ga ik nog iets harder maar dat geldt ook voor mijn concurrenten je moet re el zijn er wordt echt ongelooflijk hard gezwommen het stimuleert me niet dat mijn naam niet bij de favorieten wordt genoemd zoals bij de estafettevrouwen maar zij hebben me wel ge nspireerd ik hoop dat ik die lijn kan doorzetten

3351032 this is a very exciting time for our product development department we are looking forward to creating unique frame platforms that carry forward iron horses renowned ride characteristics the goal is to incorporate the key qualities from our existing models with benefits of the ict system
3351033 we are committed to produce well engineered world cup quality performance bikes

3351280 creo que la generalitat de catalu a se equivoca cuando plantea sus condiciones como si fueran las nicas a contraponer a la posici n del estado
3351281 el resto de estatutos que tambi n contemplan prioridades son igualmente leyes org nicas por tanto el conjunto del estado y el gobierno del estado tiene que contemplar el conjunto de los estatutos
3351282 no estamos de acuerdo en que haya un acuerdo de financiaci n del estado con una comunidad aut noma eso no puede ser porque por encima de los estatutos hay una constituci n
3351283 este es el puzzle que hay que construir teniendo en cuenta que hay muchos estatutos que plantean condiciones para la financiaci n
3351284 conjugar todo eso es lo correcto es un juego multipolar no es exclusiva entre el estatuto de catalu a y el gobierno central porque todos los estatutos fijan condiciones
3351285 tenemos un cuello de botella porque la n 232 no est ntegramente desdoblada
3351286 el ministerio de fomento ha llegado a acuerdos para que mientras se producen las obras de esta carretera pudi ramos aprovechar la autopista actual y esa es la l nea que siempre hemos manifestado
3351287 avanzamos a muy buen ritmo un segundo circuito que conecte el norte con el mediterr neo a trav s de pamplona que afectar a san sebasti n y bilbao que es el principal cliente de la n 232
3351288 russia has stopped its invasion in georgia but at what price
3351289 we can discuss the question of a definitive settlement if two conditions are met
3351290 first georgian troops should return to their initialposition and be partly demilitarised second we need to sign abinding agreement on non use of force
3351291 they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights
3351292 my way of improving on it is to keep it up
3351293 im not sure that i faced any breakpoints today so thats really good
3351294 thats good for me going on in the later rounds that im tough on my serve
3351295 i definitely feel more confident with every match that passes thats what winning does
3351296 its only a heat i probably took it out a little slower than i usually would have and didnt put in as much effort as i should have knowing how fast heats have been going here
3351297 im not surprised what the other girls have gone the way everyone is swimming here i didnt do myself any favours going out so slow
3351298 i dont know what im capable of the closer i can get to my best the happier ill be
3351299 we have received a report from the japan association of athletics federations that it has determined it impossible for noguchi to take part in these games
3351300 we have decided to respect the decision in view of her recovery which has been unsatisfactory
3351301 of course i could do with a bit more time but ill just go in and give it a go thats a hundred times better than watching on tv
3351302 if it was a big city marathon or even a world championships id say do not push it make sure i was well prepared but i dont want to sit there watching it wondering what could have happened

3351305 on the other hand malia is a big fan of hannah montana and when miley cyrus had that picture in vanity fair she just offered this very sensible opinion
3351306 allora danzavano lungo le strade leggeri come piume e io arrancavo a loro appresso come ho fatto tutta la mia vita con la gente che minteressa perch per me lunica gente possibile sono i pazzi quelli che sono pazzi di vita pazzi per parlare pazzi per esser salvati vogliosi di ogni cosa e allo stesso tempo quelli che mai sbadigliano o dicono un luogo comune ma bruciano bruciano bruciano come favolosi fuochi artificiali color giallo che esplodono come ragni traverso le stelle e nel mezzo si vede la luce azzurra dello scoppio centrale e tutti fanno

3351310 scusa cara cosa cazzo ti prepari per lestate siamo a ottobre quantomeno prematuro
3351311 siamo onesti vuoi che resti per tarpare le mie ali ed impedirmi di volare e come donna accarezzare nuovi scampoli dassenza
3351312 no prudenza non potrei vederti senza quei tuoi scampoli dassenza io rispetto le tue scelte
3351313 no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no eravamo solamente io e giovanna sopra a unisola deserta insomma tipo chai presente due chilometri di spiaggia tutta vuota dormivamo in un capanno in riva al mare ed ogni sera i pescatori ci portavano del pesce e facevamo le grigliate sulla spiaggia fino allalba cantavamo a squarciagola le canzoni di battisti tanto lisola deserta
3351314 ho deciso di sospendere le operazioni per costringere la georgia alla pace ha detto medvedev in un incontro con il ministro della difesa anatoli serdiukov e il capo di stato maggiore nikolai makarov il risultato stato raggiunto
3351315 la sicurezza dei nostri peacekeeper e della popolazione civile stata ripristinata laggressore stato punito e ha subito perdite considerevoli le sue forze armate sono disorganizzate
3351316 possiamo discutere la questione di una soluzione definitiva se sono rispettate due condizioni
3351317 la prima che le truppe georgiane devono tornare alle posizioni iniziali ed essere parzialmente demilitarizzate in secondo luogo dobbiamo firmare un documento giuridicamente vincolante sul non uso della forza
3351318 assolutamente normale che la russia voglia difendere gli interessi dei suoi compatrioti nel suo paese e dei russofoni fuori dalla russia
3351319 naturalmente ha aggiunto normale che la comunit internazionale voglia assicurare la sovranit lintegrit territoriale e la sicurezza della georgia
3351320 se la georgia viola la tregua la russia sar costretta a rispondere adeguatamente
3351321 sulla difensiva e in alcune aree sta proseguendo il ritiro delle truppe nei suoi territori
3351322 posso assicurarvi che lobiettivo della federazione russa questo e solamente questo
3351323 la georgia non si arrender mai perch noi combattiamo per la nostra libert e il prezzo da pagare tornando indietro sarebbe troppo alto vorrebbe dire la perdita della libert un sentimento che i georgiani hanno conosciuto per decenni e che non possono sopportare per questo dico che la georgia non si arrender mai
3351324 le bombe cadono davanti a noi e accanto a noi
3351325 diverse persone sono ferite e giacciono sulla strada ce ne andiamo di corsa
3351326 l dove finisce la zona di sicurezza per principio non facciamo fuoco sugli obiettivi non militari i militari russi non anno sparato alcun colpo mirato su gori
3351327 loperazione per estromettere le forze georgiane dalla parte superiore della gola di kodori sta proseguendo con successo e secondo i piani
3351328 difficile dire quanti ne sono sopravvissuti dopo i bombardamenti e gli attacchi aerei di questi giorni

3351333 i would never give it up not unless i was dying of alcohol poisoning or something
3351334 its inelastic demand as far as many of these stocks are concerned
3351335 so far theres signs that they are holding up although theres still concern that these industries will see some impact
3351336 id rather spend 4 or 5 on quality beer than 3 on hopped up water
3351337 its worth the extra buck or two to get quality
3351338 were going to stop buying silly things like that as opposed to giving up going out for a drink
3351339 cigarettes in general can withstand such an environment better than many consumer products
3351340 while not immune from the consequences of an economic slowdown we can certainly look to the future with more confidence than most
3351341 the odd bar of chocolate is not going to break the bank

3351343 the audience will understand that its in the national interest
3351344 nine year old lin miaoke becomes instant star with patriotic song
3351345 the national interest requires that the girl should have good looks and a good grasp of the song and look good on screen
3351346 lin miaoke was the best in this and yang peiyis voice was the most outstanding
3351347 we had to make that choice it was fair both for lin miaoke and yang peiyi
3351348 this is like a voice over for a cartoon character
3351349 why couldnt they pick a kid who is both cute and a good singer this damages the reputation of both kids for their future especially the one lip synching now everyone knows shes a fraud who cares if shes cute
3351350 it was inventive on his part ill give him that

3351358 mercenaries and auxiliaries are useless and dangerous and if one holds his state based on these arms he will stand neither firm nor safe for they are disunited ambitious and without discipline unfaithful valiant before friends cowardly before enemies they have neither the fear of god nor fidelity to men and destruction is deferred only so long as the attack is for in peace one is robbed by them and in war by the enemy
3351359 this is the first war that the united states has fought where so many of the people and resources involved arent of the military but from contractors
3351360 it was considered an all out imperative by the administration to keep troop levels low particularly in the beginning of the war and one way that was done was to shift money and manpower to contractors but that has exposed the military to greater risks from contractor waste and abuse
3351361 it is a shocking number but i still dont think it is the full cost
3351362 i dont think there have been any credible cost numbers for the iraq war there was so much money spent at the beginning of the war and nobody knows where it went
3351363 these new numbers point to the overall question when do you cross the line in terms of turning over too much of the public mission of defense to private firms
3351364 there are some things that are appropriate for private companies to do but others things that are not but we dont seem to have had a strategy for determining which was appropriate and which wasnt we have just handed over functions to contractors in a very haphazard way
3351365 the truman committee held 60 hearings on waste fraud and abuse
3351366 its unfathomable to me that we dont have a bipartisan investigative committee on contracting in iraq

3351407 people were telling me yesterday afternoon that they are usually harassed by police members so they are very mad
3351408 since then every leader of the community has appealed for peace that has been heard but we still dont know what will happen at any time
3351409 people are still mad police behaviour is still bad to them so we never know what will happen
3351410 this is not only about gang street members its about ordinary citizens who live peacefully in montreal north
3351411 whenever police see a black man or just see a young man police will stop him and try to get information from them and arrest them

3351418 well never see the old entertainment days of las vegas again
3351419 corporate says that every department has to make money so you cant experiment and take chances thats the bottom line todays performers feel that they dont need las vegas to sell records or to be successful what i mean by that is that they dont have to perform a few nights at a hotel they can do a concert and thats enough or they can get paid to make an appearance at an ultra lounge and get just as much publicity
3351420 playing vegas can help an act as long as it is the right venue years ago it meant something to headline a hotel but times have changed playing the house of blues or the pearl helps most of the others places could hurt an act
3351421 weve been doing it for along time and selling it out each weekend
3351422 its certainly an easier production it also gives our patron a choice of how to spend their entertainment dollar especially with the high cost of the production show ticket this way they can afford to see one of our cirque shows and then choose from one of our many other shows
3351423 not easy finding emerging talent newer performers today play it safe by being the opening for a major concert artist so its difficult to find anyone willing to take a chance
3351424 to be fair its a question i cant answer its mind boggling and it sure beats doing risky broadway shows theyre a great marketing tool for hotels theyre the preeminent show producers with the most talented people willing to spend unbelievable amounts of money you cant ask for more
3351425 my new neighbor next door is michael jackson its very strange that they have the queen of the strip and the king of pop living on the same block we have michael jacksons longest running impersonator lane lassiter who has been in the show since day one

3351427 im still getting my plastic surgery i have my plastic surgeon on speed dial i have to do that because we have such young people coming into the show like britney spears and people like that this show is reasonably priced too i also talk about britney spears shaving her head and looking like howie mandel in drag you can purchase tickets at frankmarino com where also include updates on la cage

3351509 russia has used massive and disproportionate force against an independent and sovereign democracy
3351510 this is completely unacceptable under international law and we and our allies must not beat around the bush in condemning russia very clearly
3351511 it looks increasingly as if russia intends to topple the elected government of georgia and to try and cripple that country
3351512 russia is sending a clear message to the countries of the former soviet union that you only enjoy limited sovereignty and you cannot behave in ways moscow disapproves of
3351513 today russia says it is fighting in defence of russian citizens in south ossetia who will it be defending tomorrow russians in the ukraine russians in the baltic states russians in central asia
3351514 this is a dangerous doctrine with worrying echoes from the darkest chapters of european history
3351515 threatens the stability of the entire region and risks a humanitarian catastrophe
3351516 there is a clear responsibility on the russian government to bring this conflict quickly to an end
3351517 he was aspiring to be an actor out there he was trying to get into the acting business and he thought it was a more appropriate name

3351519 i think we were clear about what our intention was in the movie and where the humor was coming from and i feel like thats clear in the context of the movie
3351520 im very pleased that the court gave us so much consideration but i have to respect the courts wishes that everything stays silent
3351521 de voornaamste dreiging voor de groei verschoven is van de vertraging van de economie in de verenigde staten naar de druk door de inflatie in azi pacific en de inspanningen van de regeringen en centrale banken uit de regio om ze aan te pakken
3351522 een beduidende stijging van de verkoop en een strikte controle van de kosten
3351523 georgi speelt op de achtergrond een rol ook omdat de olieprijs nog niet reageert op de ontwikkelingen in die regio ubs is met zijn kwartaalcijfers niet bepalend voor de stemming in amsterdam het bood meer van datgene wat we al gezien hebben maar chf17 miljard aan weggehaald kapitaal is niet weinig

3351529 i started in lapidary sawing grinding and polishing stone and shell
3351530 i was always amazed at how beautiful the materials were and the fact that they came straight out of the earth or bottom of the sea i still get that feeling today with our new designs combining the art of jewelry design and the technology involved with the production process is still very challenging and rewarding even 30 plus years later
3351531 while many u s jewelry manufacturers have found it more profitable to farm work out to other countries weve relios chosen to stay and uphold our made in the usa value system and its paid off
3351532 of course there are certain concessions weve had to make there are hardly any stone cutters left in the u s so many of our stones and beads are sourced worldwide but everything else is done right here at our albuquerque factory from design modeling the original and casting to stone setting and assembly all right here under one roof it helps us serve our customers better to have that kind of quality control
3351533 consistent customer service has gotten us where we are today and thats not all
3351534 were relios very committed to the idea that in order to be successful all stakeholders must be satisfied employees customers vendors and shareholders we focus a lot on employee team building

3351539 you could definitely say its one of the worst feelings
3351540 its the olympics and im with the team in the village
3351541 theyre not going to give me a tough time because i lost but its nice to make others proud and to win for new zealand
3351542 when you dont its tough but thats how it goes
3351543 it did go through my mind but it wasnt something i dwelt on
3351544 but i was thinking at one stage i had match point this could have been done but it didnt happen
3351545 any loss in the olympics is tough you want to do well in the olympics
3351546 but that might have been the problem maybe she wanted to do well too badly it seemed to me morita wasnt expecting anything and was quite loose
3351547 marina was muscling the ball too much and was not really relaxed
3351548 if its a form slump you lose one and one she hasnt done that what i think is maybe shes creating too much expectation for herself and putting a little too much pressure on herself
3351549 i was standing out there watching it it was nervy touch and go i knew i had to get third fourth at the worst no less than that to get through
3351550 i was actually hoping to go a little bit quicker than that but once i saw the second one i was happy
3351551 i heard the first part was good i havent seen the breakdowns yet ill have to talk to the coaches about that
3351552 i didnt feel bad but i didnt feel great either
3351553 its our first finalist since danyon loader in 1996 so its a momentous day
3351554 im just going to talk to the coach see what i need to improve on from this race and think about those during my final ill try to get all the things i can do right and hopefully get a good outcome from that
3351555 i didnt have much of a warm down after the 200 freestyle i just wanted to get through the 200 fly to try not to go all out and conserve as much as i could i felt fine i barely had any time to relax between reaces

3351570 software should have no nationality nor even a collection of them
3351571 calling software european as opposed to american or burmese sounds like an effort at exclusion and a claim that your quasi nationalistic project is the measure of quality strikes me as a way to set oneself apart
3351572 to assist european software developers in improving the quality of their code and to remove one of the key barriers to entry for open source software by providing scientific proof of its quality
3351573 would be happy to avoid buying software licences in order to support their companys balance sheet during the current tough economic climate

3351595 kaminsky said at this weeks black hat briefings in las vegas that the flaw not only allows hackers to force people to visit web sites they didnt want to but it also permits them to intercept e mail messages
3351596 although the email aspect of the flaw implies a man in the middle attack the flaw goes much deeper than that since it involves the central computers that route internet users to relevant ip addressed systems
3351597 the problem with the internet is that although its structure appears logical and relatively simple the reality is that there is some quite complex routing involved and as the internet grows so does that complexity
3351598 the world of ip addressing and url security is advancing at a rate never before seen in the it industry this means that a secure solution developed just 12 months ago is not going to be totally secure today it managers need to constantly review their security systems and software to be sure that they protect their it resources as effectively as possible

3351608 jodlowiec lo seguiamo da un anno speriamo di prenderlo domizzi sbagliata comunicazione tutti pensano che lo dobbiamo vendere per forza allultimo
3351609 il progetto napoli dopo 40 giorni di precampionato a che punto
3351610 a buon punto ha osservato marino abbiamo centrato il primo obiettivo della stagione cio lingresso in uefa ora tenteremo di andare il pi avanti possibile la gara con gli albanesi del vllaznia non affatto semplic e ha sottolineato il dg azzurro allemittente campana come tutte le partite in uefa daltronde pensate che la nosta gara col panionios pi che un turno di intertoto per la caratura dellavversario poteva essere considerato un buon ottavo di finale ludinese in torunee in grecia ha giocato sul campo del paok salonicco che giunto sei posti in classifica dietro il panionios ed stata sconfitta ad ogni modo abbiamo gi salito un altro gradino importante per il futuro gioved proveremo a salirne un altro ancora in campo la squadra albanese cercher di qualificarsi con i mezzi che ha a disposizione il vllaznia colmer con lagonismo il gap tecnico incontestabile che ha nei confronti del napoli
3351611 si vero ha ammesso ci sono stato ed i giornali hanno carpito il nostro lavoro jodlowiec lo seguiamo ormai da un anno e un giocatore che speriamo di riuscire a tesserare la trattativa stata anticipata dai giornali ma non ancora a livello di firma il mercato dellest lo conosciamo bene e lo seguiamo attentamente qualche giocatore ci gi sfuggito allultimo momento per la concorrenza spietata di club inglesi francesi spagnoli e tedeschi tuttavia non ci sfuggono per questioni economiche
3351612 noi abbiamo una opzione per jodlowiec e lassenso del procuratore del giocatore il suo arrivo a napoli indipendente dalla partenza di domizzi al ragazzo polaccoi dobbiamo concedere qualche mese per ambientarsi ha precisato marino arriva senza conoscere la lingua e il campionato italiano da lui non pretendiamo tutto e subito pu arrivare anche se non parte domizzi
3351613 e chiaro che quando necessario forzare un p perch c un obiettivo stagionale appena quindici giorni dopo linizio del ritiro pu succedere che qualche giocatore sia vittima di infortuni ad ogni modo devo fare i complimenti a reja e ai nostri preparatori atletici che ci hanno consentito di vincere le due gare di intertoto dispiace per mannini per lui si poteva fare qualcosa in pi perch ha subito due volte lo stesso infortunio in questo caso abbiamo sbagliato sia noi che il giocatore
3351614 sono contentissimo di lui ha sottolineato il dg trovo piuttosto superficiale e dilettantistico il voler contare quanti gol fa in amichevole o notare gli assist piuttosto che i gol gli assist di denis per bogliacino e hamsik nelle due partite con il panionios valgono quanto un gol ad ogni modo non possiamo valutarlo dalle reti in precampionato il giocatore ha confermato da vicino quello che avevamo visto da lontano e quindi siamo soddisfatti
3351615 dopo linfortunio di rocchi sarebbe giusto da parte di casiraghi chiamarlo altrimenti non ho capito perch hanno portato in cina una riserva quando poteva allenarsi qui con il napoli le convocazioni della nazionale ho parlato con angelo peruzzi inviato da lippi a frosinone e mi ha assicurato che gli osservati speciali del napoli sono maggio blasi e santacroce ritengo che gi sabato prossimo uno di questi sar convocato in prpospettiva sono sotto osservazione tre giocatori del napoli e la cosa mi inorgoglisce se pensiamo che due anni fa eravamo a lanciano
3351616 non tratteniamo giocatori demotivati ma nemmeno possiamo depauperare il patrimonio del

3351633 we chinese people love the olympics and support the olympics and thats why there are no protesters
3351634 i will not announce a success before the ink is dry but the information we are getting makes the acceptance of my governments demands by the u s more probable than only a few weeks ago
3351635 unfortunately performance has not been acceptable to date unfortunately the responsibility rests both here in sudan and also with the united nations
3351636 but we have reasons to be encouraged and hopeful that the pace of the past will be reversed and we will see substantially more unamid peacekeepers here to help the people of darfur in the near future
3351637 well be very disappointed if the pace doesnt pick up substantially weve had specific plans shared with us both in new york and in darfur at unamid headquarters for that to take place
3351638 given that the nc is adamant to allowing us to have the defence ministry in a government led by us we talked with the cpn uml about ways to find solutions to this state of deadlock and we even urged the cpn uml to lead the government if they wish to
3351639 both the cpn m and nc have urged us to lead the next government but we are stressing forming a national consensus government incorporating at least four major parties

3351641 it was unbelievable in such a short time on fifth street we saw a huge round eight foot tubes that had burst through the earth and had flooded fifth street almost immediately the neighbors said they were snaking in the air and that theyve never seen nothing like it they kind of stood there in horror and watched
3351642 media roundtable the edwards affair covering the olympics and war in the caucus
3351643 were speaking to some people at the moment in terms of potential permanent moves to bring a player in
3351644 were very active in trying to sign someone to play that position id hope wed do so in the a week or so
3351645 hes reading boss steve coppell still very comfortable in terms of the balance of the team and very happy to play stephen hunt at left back very happy to play liam rosenior at left back and graeme murty at right back so weve got options within the squad
3351646 but we are trying to bring another left sided player into the squad and balance us up and obviously give hunty the opportunity to move forward again depending on what the manager decides
3351647 i thought hunty grew as the game went on and i thought he played exceptionally well second half
3351648 we didnt create as much as wed like but i thought we grew as the game went on and i felt if someone was going to win it was going to be us
3351649 youre always looking for three points but its a good point for us and i think we finished strongly which was encouraging their keeper made an unbelievable save from kev to keep it out and stop us taking three points
3351650 shes been here for one week and hasnt seen a doctor even though they know she has been shot
3351651 she is complaining of abdominal pain she understands she lost part of an intestine
3351652 they have all been telling me what a huge achievement winning gold is i realise that but frankly the enormity of the goodwill generated has caught me by surprise honestly enough it really has not changed me i am still the same abhinav who just a day ago was hanging around alone in my room in the olympic village frankly all the attention is a bit overwhelming i am not much good at making loud public pronouncements that in no way means that this is not the most intense experience of my life
3351653 for more than a decade now my life has been all about my sport in fact i do not have a life beyond the confines of the 10m range i have had a range built in my own home to cut down any possibility of distraction and to be able to practise my sport whenever the fancy strikes me it all did pay off didnt it
3351654 i would like to reiterate that everyone who represents india at the olympic games has put in years of toil and sweat i ask the indian people to support our athletes more it is fine to celebrate our achievements but it is just as important to keep up the backing when we are not on top of our game
3351655 it is important for india to do better at olympic sport as these are the true measure of a nations sporting depth i wish more private initiatives come up with corporate support apart from the backing of the government the joy that the nation feels at my win is humbling i just wish that this is repeated more and more often
3351656 yeah yeah yeah india won gold in shooting in beijing olympics todays performance in chicago was tops but nothing could top this news
3351657 i was absolutely thrilled to see bindra receiving the gold and i had goosebumps when indias national anthem began playing what a moment my congratulations to bindra for his achievement he has done india proud and given us all a moment to celebrate
3351658 at this time i cannot help but remember the reaction of certain people across the country when india had lost a cricket match tournament and people began attacking the homes of various players how easily we forget that our sportspersons are trying their best they too want to win they are the ones who have worked day and night and are certainly more upset than we the supporters are at that time instead of standing by them in their moment of loss and dejection we attack them
3351659 abhinav bindra was born on september 28 1982 since his birth date is 28 the year 2008 is quite significant for him he won olympics gold medal in 10m air rifle strangely it is after 28 years that india wins a gold medal in olympics
3351660 people were telling me yesterday afternoon that they are usually harassed by police members so they are very mad
3351661 since then every leader of the community has appealed for peace that has been heard but we still dont know what will happen at any time
3351662 people are still mad police behaviour is still bad to them so we never know what will happen
3351663 this is not only about gang street members its about ordinary citizens who live peacefully in montreal north
3351664 whenever police see a black man or just see a young man police will stop him and try to get information from them and arrest them
3351665 if you live in montreal north and you have a good car police will try to stop you and ask you for your identity
3351666 the company was yet another victim of the speed at which us venture capital funds close down companies
3351667 what would have happened if the investors had been israeli its difficult to tell one may assume that they would have held off the decision and tried to find a direction for the company largely because it still some had some cash and a technology that had won acclaim
3351668 but qlusters foreign investors saw things differently the company is struggling it cant come up with a strategy that looks promising no point in wasting any more time lets move on
3351669 sun needs to make it clear whether it wants to fan the flames or fight the fire that is linux
3351670 it strikes me as odd that sun which has embraced open source and is also the defacto leading corporate open source software contributor is continually dogged by doubts about its transitions and tenures despite well respected technology and participation in open source
3351671 however sun has a longstanding solid history with open source openoffice opensolaris opensparc java etc
3351672 nevertheless sun knows how to do open source right and continues to participate effectively in a variety of open source software communities projects and enterprise products
3351673 lets also not forget that it was sun that started off this year with a billion dollar bet on open source mysql and its database software and business
3351674 part of this lies in the companys continuing dichotomy in strategy a reference to tepid support for linux and continued preference for and focus on solaris this is a large part of suns handicap imho when it comes to linux and open source sun has its own os and therefore is in the same category as the dreaded microsoft for many

3351677 its better to be hated for who you are then to be loved for who you are not
3351678 i dont know what the key to success is but the key to failure is trying to please everybody
3351679 a womans heart should be so close to god that a man has to seek god to find it

3351682 when you educate a man you educate an individual but when you educate a woman you educate a nation
3351683 any writer i suppose feels that the world into which he was born is nothing less than a conspiracy against the cultivation of his talent
3351684 few people think more than two or three times a year i have made an international reputation for myself by thinking once or twice a week
3351685 it would not surprise me at all if this were to occur
3351686 yes we have no experience with athletes here but the treatment is safe and we can help you
3351687 it strengthens lung function and stem cells go into the bloodstream and reach the organs it takes two weeks i recommend four intravenous injections 40 million stem cells or double that the more the better we also use human growth hormones but you have to be careful because they are on the doping list
3351688 i dont know how it was arranged or what level of hospital this was but it supports the idea that the world of athletics is very aware of gene doping and already pursuing it
3351689 there are interesting preliminary results but i cant expand on that
3351690 but were all encouraged by the results and wada very much wants to be ahead of the curve on this and has funded a dozen or more labs on gene doping
3351691 this is all very subjective but the hope is that it will be a fair process that will allow the athlete who has had gene therapy for legitimate reasons to state his or her purpose for it
3351692 the sporting authorities can then either accept or reject it
3351693 if gene doping is happening already as we suspect its being done unethically and with immature
3351694 i can lock you up without evidence and you wont see a lawyer for two years

3351699 duch personally tortured or mistreated detainees at s21 on a number of separate occasions and through a variety of means
3351700 his leadership and participation were clear contributing factors to the overall functioning of s21 and demonstrated an intention that the staff of s21 carry out these crimes

3351720 before the end of the year queensland will introduce the first piece of legislation which all other states and territories will sign on to as the first step to establish a national registration scheme for doctors and other allied health professionals including nurses

3351727 we are honored that dow jones amp company showed this level of confidence in kodak thermal ctp technology they conducted a very thorough review process before making this significant investment in prepress equipment
3351728 printers like dow jones are attracted to kodak trendsetter news platesetters because they offer stability and high quality digital production across multiple plant locations they can assure their customers of color consistency from each print site removing a major variable from the process

3351733 to make humanized animals really creepy youd have to do several things you increase the ratio of human to animal dna youd transplant human cells that spread throughout the body youd do it early in embryonic development so the human cells would shape the animals architecture not just blend in youd grow the embryo to maturity and youd start messing with the brain were doing all of these things
3351734 if you want permanent restrictions your best bet is the senator who tried to impose them two years ago hes the same presidential candidate now leading the charge against evolution sam brownback a kansas republican he thinks were separate from other animals unique in the created order too bad this wasnt true in the past and it wont be true in the future
3351735 were not doing these things because they are creepy were doing them because they are logical the more you humanize animals the better they serve their purposes as lab models of humanity thats whats scary about species mixing its not some crazy frankenstein project its the future of medicine
3351736 when stanford first head of the proposal for humanized mice brains they were grossed out but after thinking it over they tentatively endorsed the idea and decided that it may not be had to endow mice with some aspects of human consciousness or some human cognitive abilities
3351737 imagine that a hominid brain network you can treat like a lab animal because it is a lab animal
3351738 if something were half human and half animal what would our moral responsibilities be it might be immoral to kill such a creature its wrong to create creatures whose moral stature we are perplexed about

3351756 when questioned by canadian and u s military officers several of the afghan security guards freely admitted to opening fire on what they thought were taliban fighters but when informed that a canadian soldier had been wounded their stories began to change and many never claimed to have fired at all
3351757 after threatening to arrest the whole lot for lying in the end there was little that the canadian and american officers could do except take the names and mobile phone numbers of the afghans in charge of the convoy and the names of the suspected shooters
3351758 what they tend to do is fire a few harassing rounds and then theyll disappear into the woodwork

3351791 georgia is a sovereign nation and its territorial integrity must be respected
3351792 a return by the parties to the status quo of august the 6th
3351793 i condemn russias aggressive actions and reiterate my call for an immediate ceasefire
3351794 for many years i have warned against russian actions that undermine the sovereignty of its neighbours
3351795 commitment to the sovereignty and the territorial integrity of georgia
3351796 those who have been supplying arms to georgia i believe they should feel part of the blame for the loss of life of civilians including many russian citizens and peacekeepers i think those who have been appeasing mr saakashvilis aggressive intentions and who helped create a feeling of impunity among the georgian leadership should think twice
3351797 so far each step in the caucasus drama has put the conflict on a yet higher plane the next step will no longer be just about the caucasus or even europe remember the guns of august

3351813 i think its crazy when moms dont admit they have favorites
3351814 but it changes at any given time one of your kids is going to be stuck in some behavioral rut my most colicky baby who cried nonstop and needed tons more attention now sets his own alarm gets ready and does homework more efficiently than anyone else in the end it all evens out
3351815 it shows that if you protect these animals then they can recover
3351816 im encouraged by the fact that several of the large whale species that had been in trouble for a long time have shown steady increases over recent decades
3351817 humpbacks have really shown an ability to recover strongly from extremely intensive hunting
3351818 it takes a while for conservationists to build up the confidence that it is a real signal of recovery and not a short term variation
3351819 it is a political question and it will be answered in a political form
3351820 i think it is really important to stress that the red list is not about whether a given species can be exploited
3351821 its simply about looking at the status of these animals and giving people some idea where they are now in relation to where they used to be
3351822 the trouble is that the nets that cause the most trouble the entangling nets that are unselective in what they catch are still being used
3351823 i think we are just seeing the start of the effects of climate change in the oceans another big problem is noise from sonar which we dont fully understand yet
3351824 preventing deliberate harm of that species has been ongoing for nearly a century and has been pretty effective
3351825 but the numbers that are killed in ship strikes and become entangled in lines from lobster and crab traps are preventing the population which is not very big in the first place recovering
3351826 how you stop or reduce that is a real challenge
3351827 the data deficient category is pretty large for cetaceans probably surprisingly large to many people
3351828 it is the species that live far offshore that are found in less developed parts of the world that in many cases we dont have a clue about how many there are

3351842 my whole life i am very good at riding over a storm for many times already in my life so why not another time
3351843 i am sorry that i will not accept the premier post
3351844 we have received confirmation from all sources that the rumor of a coup is not true the rumor was spread by some faction but it is not true
3351845 ill take this chance to relax and meet old friends i want to take a break im getting old
3351846 we will pay the best for the best and to the best that is my strategy which is why i want a player like ronaldinho we need to breed success right now we have a negative cash flow but within two years we will be making money you will see
3351847 the supporters i hope will also see what i am trying to do they have loved the club longer than me but i am with them because i have invested my money a lot of money
3351848 there are times when i wish i could be closer to the fans and to talk to them but they will have to trust me and to see that instead of words i show them my intentions with actions
3351849 i will not resign because my resignation will not resolve anything
3351850 i may be not be a perfect man but i reaffirm that i am not as bad as some accused me of being if good fortune were on my side i would like to return to thailand and die there like all other thai people
3351851 poor thai women from the countryside with a modest education can make well educated worldly western men do really crazy things
3351852 the intensity and the focus are just not there even our shots are not as strong mentally we are not at a good level
3351853 i am not looking for excuses but this is what explains our bad performance since the beginning of the tournament

3351906 i went in with a lot of confidence because i had come second in athens but i still had to shoot my best it was a close call but at least it went in my favour
3351907 no longer will a gold medal surprise us never again will we plead with the constellations to allow luck to go our way
3351908 we commit ourselves to the creation of an effective momentum for sustained boycotts of goods destined for the two countries throughout the region with the trade union movement taking an active lead
3351909 all workers must refuse to serve president robert mugabe and king mswati iii as well as their close associates and collaborators anywhere in the region so as to ensure that they indeed feel the heat of isolation

3351923 today i ate a hot dog a chocolate chip cookie a dove ice cream bar and like 1000 carbs nasty but delish and so fun it looks like i squirted some ketchup and mustard on the windshield but really those are just dried bug guts bug condiments they are everywhere my nose is dry my back is sore and a tumbleweed just crossed the highway reggie needs my attention now he has apparently caught some trout on the ride out and is sharing the aroma with us when he breaths it smells like a toilet

3351926 festival of flesh at the adult video avn awards in vegas it was a cavalcade of celebrities including everybody from
3351927 we really wanted to bring a fresh twist to the news archival process
3351928 this is light years ahead of anything the wall street journal is doing historically it will go down with the first time
3351929 this turnout of both fans exhibitors film makers and stars is even larger than last years record breaker weve really become a mainstream business with proper recognition
3351930 this has been our best ever sales convention and were a tomorrows technology company so were ready if the dvd business switches fully over to internet broadband downloads to burn your own dvd or pop it up on your mobile it just keeps growing bigger and bigger
3351931 many of the actresses are friends of mine this is just a lot of celebrating and im here for the joy of it its just another process of the many aspects of entertainment its no longer dirty its no longer under the covers its come out from hiding to go mainstream and when you think of it this is no different than the celebrating that goes on with the oscars or for the grammys
3351932 jenna and i are best friends still our marriage lasted eight years and we were always best friends then but now time for us to both move on but remain best pals
3351933 shes definitely the next major crossover star and has an incredible future ahead of her modeling doing tv commercials and being a corporate spokesperson
3351934 im excited by all the mainstream offers but im not giving up the adult entertainment industry at least yet
3351935 yes it does exist yes it was me but it was never meant for public viewing
3351936 it was done in private for private enjoyment however since all the controversy its got me interested in the adult business which is why im here tonight i support the industry and although i wont act in one of these things i will direct some x rated product ill leave the on screen acting to the professionals
3351937 the x girls are a talented group of gorgeous dancers and their new burlesque project brings an energetic and sexy production to the resort
3351938 we are excited to add this edgy show to our already dynamic line up
3351939 x has always been known for pushing the envelope and x burlesque will take that to the next level
3351940 the dancers are amazing the routines are unique and the tops are off
3351941 our guests have come to expect the absolute best whether it be dining gaming entertainment or with our hotel rooms and spa services michael is the perfect addition to our family of headline names and keeps us a cut above the competition
3351942 caesars has set new standards of excellence in the past few years now were raising the bar in the salon spa industry and i am thrilled to be part of it
3351943 i love vegas i come for the shows the sports the restaurants and the shopping and now im coming for the spa this was the perfect mini vacation squeezed in between miss america and returning to canada for a christmas movie for disney
3351944 i use luxe ingredients but i dont take myself seriously i respect the food i work with i simply fell in love with the kitchen this is a fun adventure where my goal is to engage all the sense i decided to abandon the traditional approach to food and incorporate all kinds of crazy twists but in the end it has to taste fantastic and it does i simply wanted to awe my guests and make dining with me the most joyful experience of their day
3351945 you guys talk about that and i havent said anything about breaking any records
3351946 my goals havent been published bob bowman u s coach is the only one that knows it
3351947 i knew he was going to finish strong and he always does in races i saw his time was incredibly strong in the 400m freestyle
3351948 four years ago i wanted to race and i hated to lose getting third in the 200m freestyle and when i do lose in races like that it motivates me to swim faster
3351949 i have so many races so much to do in every race i have to keep 100 per cent focused no matter how good you have to force it out of your head
3351950 every morning i wake up at 4 30 5 00 and it takes me a while to get up in the morning but its the olympics you have to i need to recover as much as i can and it is crucial for the coming events
3351951 that didnt provide us with the opportunity to test the security arrangements we will explore whether we would only use karachi and lahore
3351952 we have decided not to link the payment of his fine with his selection
3351953 shoaib gul and afridi carry a lot of experience and we are confident they will be 100 percent fit for the tournament
3351954 we have asked geoff to join us in australia and new zealand when we present to stakeholders including player groups the result of the task team visit
3351955 as a former australia test player a coach and someone who lives in pakistan he is in a unique position to give his perspective to those stakeholders
3351956 he had differences with the selectors over the selection of some players and was not happy with the situation
3351957 the only reason he has gone is because the task force felt he would be the best man to talk to the players in australia and new zealand and assure them about the situation in pakistan

3351963 i want to go back to college and it is really a matter of needing the money
3351964 i go to the doctor tomorrow to get put on birth control so that my cycle matches whoever ends up carrying my egg
3351965 really they have been given enough time and it was extended for a few days we think that is enough time to arrange alternative accommodation
3351966 we are convinced that conditions do exist for people to now safely return
3351967 we are not liable for all of those things but because we care about the well being of people we help where possible but now we are not going to be buying tools
3351968 we are trying to find out why they are not reintegrating
3351969 what started us looking at this issue is the fact that senator mccain has declared his intention to maintain us forces in iraq for a hundred years
3351970 that means that mccain wants to control babylon for at least a century
3351971 we believe that the end times is near based on the pattern of wars earthquakes and other strange phenomena weve been witnessing since the start of the new millennium
3351972 given that it may be imminent the person who controls babylon must be the antichrist
3351973 what clinched it for us was that the name mihai means who is
3351974 as far as were concerned that was enough it means that mccain might easily pretend to be the redeemer
3351975 many people think that the antichrist will be a evil seeming leader but in fact the bible tells us that he will be charming
3351976 but because of it its the law in the short term well be better off getting the ordinance off the books
3351977 this proposed rule gives federal agencies an unacceptable degree of discretion to decide whether or not to comply with the endangered species act
3351978 we need to focus our efforts where they will do the most good
3351979 it is important to use our time and resources to protect the most vulnerable species it is not possible to draw a link between greenhouse gas emissions and distant observations of impacts on species
3351980 if adopted these changes would seriously weaken the safety net of habitat protections that we have relied upon to protect and recover endangered fish wildlife and plants for the past 35 years
3351981 over the years the endangered species act has become a regulatory nightmare that kills or stalls even the most well crafted land use projects
3351982 the economy suffers people suffer rational environmental planning suffers some careful streamlining is long overdue
3351983 we have done it in reaction to the government operations in swat and bajur
3351984 if this kind of operations continue against us in swat and in the tribal areas we will continue this
3351985 want to get rid of us they want to make regime change
3351986 i have to keep my mind on the games i hope everything is restored in georgia but i have to keep my mind here
3351987 but every choice they made in that movie was wrong
3351988 the idea was to make an american christ figure but what they centered on was his weakness
3351989 they made him more a lamb of god rather than give us a real powerful superman they had too many scenes where hes being kicked to the floor and thats not superman superman would get up and fight
3351990 the hulk has proven the audience will forgive you and let you redo the franchise
3351991 superman is a character more recognizable than abraham lincoln or mickey mouse
3351992 but no one knows crap about mickey mouse hes a symbol understanding a soul is much harder so dont treat him like a walking american flag
3351993 men of tomorrow geeks gangsters and the birth of the comic book
3351994 superman was created not because america is the greatest country on earth not because moses came to save us from krypton but because a little boy lost his father
3351995 in his first appearances he couldnt fly he didnt have x ray vision he was only bulletproof so supermans not a character built out of strength but out of loss
3351996 when you hear that it puts on a whole new spin on superman and his origins
3351997 the understanding was that batman was born out of traged and superman out of hope and aspiration and it turns out that its about not wanting to lose your loved ones thats critical and it means that we can connect with him hes not an untouchable character bad things still happen to him his father passes away and his powers cant save him
3351998 everybody knows what its like to see the pretty girl and think if only she could see me for who i really was
3351999 past the glasses and acne or whatever but he has to hide and half his co workers dont even know his name thats a critical part too
3352000 it is so much deeper than hes an alien with superpowers
3352001 i never wanted to write a superman movie before but i do now i understand what superman is now
3352002 well i actually did pitch a batman film when warner bros
3352003 in my version there was actually a new villain it wasnt one of the classics which is probably why they didnt use it
3352004 it was more of a hannibal lector type he was somebody already in arkham asylum that bruce went and sort of studied with it was a whole thing i get very emotional about it i still love the story maybe ill get to do it as a comic one day ed note hint hint dc comics
3352005 i just love the respect nolan has for the character and the world
3352006 i thought christopher nolans done an amazing job of bringing out the comic book and i see a lot of movies coughs
3352007 oh im too lazy to upload every day its so troublesome
3352008 the wells fargo wagon is a comin down the street

3352010 why do packages make me happy is that what i want to make me happy
3352011 oil exports will begin when the pipeline is repaired the fighting is not an obstacle for exports
3352012 the reason for btcs closure is the fire and blast that occurred in turkey the halting of oil shipping at btc is not related with georgia btc was closed prior to the clashes that started in georgia
3352013 no information has been received by bp officials regarding claims the btc was targeted oil is being shipped through the baku supsa back up route
3352014 we can discuss the question of a definitive settlement if two conditions are met
3352015 first georgian troops should return to their initial position and be partly demilitarised second we need to sign a binding agreement on non use of force
3352016 we will need more evidence everyone in this situation needs a signed binding agreement
3352017 until that happens we are mobilised we are prepared for everything
3352018 i do appreciate it medvedevs gesture but there has been more damage to infrastructure and civilian casualties today

3352090 the leaders met on tuesday but could not arrive at a workable formula or solution that would appease the people
3352091 they think its really cool that the apples are sliced and put in bags
3352092 the person on the street knows so much more about these issues
3352093 it takes away anything so preachy about it makes it so genuine and easy to hear
3352094 theres a real increase in demand for good quality local food
3352095 this dramatic increase is further proof that new yorkers are hungry for healthy food options we need only make those healthy foods available
3352096 what matters is not the length of the wand but the magic in the stick
3352097 there is value in exposing children to a natural environment the simple act of walking in a green space learning about the cycle of nature a lot of kids rich or poor dont experience that
3352098 if they dont have access to a pleasant stress free natural environment and all they know is concrete then we can all understand how that might impact their social emotional and physical health
3352099 its amazing to experience firsthand what they are seeing for the first time
3352100 at nighttime its like boom a rock you can see in the city
3352101 a lot of kids get freaked out they push shove and fight and then all of a sudden theyre holding hands in the pond
3352102 or with hikes they complain the entire way but then theyll cross paths with a deer and think it is the most beautiful thing theyve seen
3352103 a lot of the kids are a year or two behind in school we try to make education viewed as something that is fun so catching frogs here can lead to looking at a frog in a book during biology class back home
3352104 theres a lot of listening and talking about the problem breaking it down and talking it out to have the child understand why they strayed and how to prevent it in the future
3352105 kids are able to come out of their shells at camp they put on a tough guard living in shelters and on the streets but they can just be kids at camp
3352106 programs that can provide fun interesting and exciting activities for children are performing a good service this particularly is so during the summer when kids like to go outdoors swim play sports or just go exploring
3352107 every dhs shelter for families with children has a summer plan these include activities both at the shelter and off site such as going on picnics or to the park or seeing plays each shelter also has a department of education liaison who connects children to day camps throughout the city for free
3352108 not only is this camp just beneficial because it gives healthy challenges and allows the children to learn grow explore be curious and make friends it oftentimes is all they need to be reconnected to take ownership of their education and growth
3352109 oh lord thy sea is so great and my ship is so small have mercy

3352113 it is not worth an intelligent mans time to be part of the majority by definition there are already enough people to do that
3352114 surfings like the mafia once youre in youre not getting out
3352115 one reason it failed then is because the rents were too low
3352116 every one of our deals has to work without burdening the tenants with a rent increase
3352117 he overpaid based on the current rents we think hes going to financially crash the building
3352118 i know that when someone leaves i have to factor it in with how i operate the building
3352119 although i may have told them the tenants at various times over the past 5 or 6 years that we had no present plans to do so i believe these statements were correct when i made them
3352120 if these guys want to pay too much for their buildings thats their right who are we to stop them
3352121 dhcr is currently completing its review of upaca site 7 and owners are awaiting notification from dhcr to proceed to public meetings
3352122 it was a horrible time period and we felt awful but im buying a building that hasnt been kept up properly for 50 years im clear that were responsible its not always easy to make up for 50 years of deferred maintenance
3352123 lilac cherry and mulberry trees a 25 year growth of lilies of the valley crocuses daffodils and roses
3352124 he not only chopped everything down he bulldozed the roots
3352125 we are only expecting to sell the 13 or 14 apartments that are vacant or are already at market rents
3352126 if stuy town turns out not to be able to return that value that would probably make a lot of banks think twice about lending in such situations
3352127 he doesnt want me here because my presence is an obstacle hes about to sell our apartments from under our feet
3352128 theyve not rented to a black or working class person
3352129 the new tenants are 99 percent white this is a perpetuation of the historic alienation of black people in harlem
3352130 there are very few black people who can afford this
3352131 i like the idea of people of different backgrounds living in the same building
3352132 i think thats a more worthwhile way of providing affordable housing

3352141 it looks like the rabbit had been caught taken away skinned and theyve actually brought the skin back
3352142 i dont know if it was some sort of trophy for them because it looked as if the skin had been placed back down on the ground rather than thrown on the ground
3352143 i felt totally sick i was nauseated i just cant believe that somebody can do that especially to a pet
3352144 it was a deliberate act they knew what they were doing
3352145 i was overjoyed because shes very calm and timid so i really thought it was her that had died misty was fiery
3352146 i just hope that she can get over her ordeal because its been quite hard on her and shes lost a sister that shes lived with since she was born so i dont know how shes going to cope
3352147 hes a bit happier today with the fact weve managed to catch thumper

3352151 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3352152 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3352153 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3352154 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3352155 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3352156 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
3352157 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3352158 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

3352166 increasingly there are no limits technologically as to what a company can do in terms of collecting information and then selling it as a commodity to other providers
3352167 our responsibility is to make sure that we create a law that regardless of the technology includes a set of legal guarantees that consumers have with respect to their information
3352168 insight into the number of people who have seen an ad campaign
3352169 how many users visited their sites after seeing an ad
3352170 google is slowly embracing a full blown behavioral targeting over its vast network of services and sites
3352171 over 3 billion page views 15 million unique users and over 60 million video streams
3352172 people are starting to see oh we have these different industries that are collecting the same types of information to profile individuals and the devices they use on the network
3352173 internet cellphones cable any way you tap into the network concerns are raised
3352174 a broad approach to protecting peoples online privacy seems both desirable and inevitable
3352175 advertisers and data collectors who record where customers go and what they do want profit at the expense of privacy
3352176 they have this thing that says drill offshore in the protected areas
3352177 we can do that we can have a vote on that
3352178 but it has to be part of something that says we want to bring immediate relief to the public and is not just a hoax on them
3352179 sweep them under the rug and would further damage the publics faith in our democratic process
3352180 that does not explain how mr and ms rocchio came to give these significant amounts given what appears to be their modest lifestyle
3352181 if there are two americans and one russian we win
3352182 the security of our peacekeepers and civilians has been restored
3352183 the aggressor has been punished and suffered very significant losses its military has been disorganized
3352184 i dont think moscow will be in the mood not only to hold talks but even to speak to saakashvili
3352185 he has committed crimes against our citizens our position is that mr saakashvili can no longer be our partner hed better quit
3352186 bigger part of the operation to coerce the georgian side to peace in south ossetia
3352187 deeply concerned by reports that russian troops have moved beyond the zone of conflict attacked the georgian town of gori and are threatening georgias capital of tbilisi theres evidence that russian forces may soon begin bombing the civilian airport in the capital city
3352188 these russian actions would represent a dramatic and brutal escalation of the conflict in georgia
3352189 we hope russia will join the broad consensus that is emerging that this has gone on for too long
3352190 implications for the region implications for the future relations of russia with the united states and the other international communities
3352191 for us the situation is not as simple as our american colleagues or our georgian colleagues would like us or others to see
3352192 our forces are continuing to take steps which would make sure that georgian forces do not have the ability to invade south ossetia again
3352193 their accounting is so distorted it recalls the phrase the big lie
3352194 words like invasion should not be used lightly but this is an invasion
3352195 the attempt to turn white into black black into white and to adeptly portray victims of aggression as aggressors and place the responsibility for the consequences of the aggression on the victims
3352196 georgian rulers who used tanks to run over children and the elderly who threw civilians into cellars and burned them
3352197 we need to focus our efforts where they will do the most good
3352198 it is important to use our time and resources to protect the most vulnerable species
3352199 it is not possible to draw a link between greenhouse gas emissions and distant observations of impacts on species

3352250 it presents several new aspects which were not present in previous incidents in xinjiang
3352251 one is the sophisticated coordination of the attacks it was not just one attack its a string of bombings that requires much more planning and a larger organization to carry out especially at the time of the olympics when the security is so high

3352281 global demand for u s coal should stay strong for at least 2 3 years everything we hear suggests that coal will continue to be strong at least in the mid term horizon
3352282 the problems were encountering are on the supply side the mining companies can barely keep up with demand
3352283 demand for export coal has significantly increased as global supplies tighten
3352284 it appears as though were at or near bottom its difficult to pick that point but there does appear to be some improvement going forward at this point

3352294 i dont want to talk about it i dont even answer my phone anymore because im sick of talking about it
3352295 i already knew the outcome so i didnt really want to watch it
3352296 coalition troops called in close air support to engage the militants hiding in the structure they did not have knowledge of noncombatants in the buildings at that time
3352297 the struggle against terrorism is not in the villages of afghanistan
3352298 the only result of the use of airstrikes is the killing of civilians this is not the way to wage the fight against terrorism
3352299 if a visitors stomach can handle pepper and curry first thing in the morning then this is a nice surprise for the palate and a great way to start the day

3352303 we kind of thought there was a void in this area

3352312 there has been no marketing behind the device by t mobile nor any handset maker
3352313 oh yeah heres that google phone that everyone has been talking about
3352314 weve identified the source of this issue and fixed it in addition as with all issues that affect gmail and our other services were conducting a full review of what went wrong and moving quickly to update our internal systems and procedures accordingly we dont usually post about problems like this on our blog but we wanted to make an exception in this case since so many people were impacted
3352315 the city had sold some water stock earlier and we persuaded the remaining council members to buy the land
3352316 sejak awal 2008 pembangunan jalan sudah dilakukan menjelang lebaran 2008 ruas jalan tersebut sudah bisa dimanfaatkan

3352320 its shameful that so many corporations make big profits and pay nothing to support our country
3352321 understanding how elephants and other animal populations react to droughts will be a central component of wildlife management and conservation
3352322 our findings seem to support the hypothesis that older females with knowledge of distant resources become crucial to the survival of herds during periods of extreme climatic events
3352323 in the end we can never be given knowledge by others we can only be stimulated we must develop our own knowledge
3352324 isso deixa algumas pessoas incertas mas n s ainda n o terminamos
3352325 das war seit kindertagen mein traum ich kann das noch gar nicht realisieren
3352326 alles hat zusammengepasst so ein gef hl hatte ich noch bei keinem wettkampf ich glaube ich kann das erst realisieren wenn ich das gold um den hals h ngen habe
3352327 da geht einem der puls hoch man fiebert mit und hofft dass einige andere langsamer fahren
3352328 f r die sportart ist das ganz entscheidend die erste goldmedaille f r deutschland ist motivation f r viele
3352329 unsere taktik ist voll aufgegangen er hat fast fehlerfrei gek mpft
3352330 er ist aber auch einer der die taktik durchziehen kann
3352331 das kann er er schaltet im gr ten trubel ab
3352332 by using seals we have increased the number of hydrographic profiles 30 fold
3352333 what we know about the southern ocean is very limited which makes predicting the formation of sea ice difficult
3352334 these animals are filling a blind spot in our sampling
3352335 occasionally they stay long enough for the data loggers atop their heads to send the data via satellite
3352336 on average we can collect two profiles a day from each seal
3352337 in the antarctic when seawater freezes to form sea ice the salt usually suspended in the water is ejected into the water beneath the ice
3352338 we wanted to understand the foraging ecology of elephant seals and study their role in the marine food web
3352339 we think the seals at the bottom try to catch deep dwelling animals like squid and fish at these depths the seals lungs and body can be compressed to overcome the great pressures at 2 000m
3352340 everything has changed whats the world coming to when a man cant even tend his yard without a reporter asking him why hes doing it
3352341 no one knows what the city is going to do
3352342 i cant get a straight answer from our insurance company and the federal programs seem to be linked to what the insurance companies decide weve done what we can got our stuff that wasnt ruined out and tried to gut the worst of the damage now we wait and see if we have something that were going to be able to save
3352343 we are still at the point where we are just seeing the tip of the iceberg
3352344 there are beginning to be increased calls from some of the service providers but its still too early to even get a handle on what we think volume is going to be
3352345 the timing has to do with the fact that there are basic concrete things that individuals focus on first
3352346 there is that whole initial phase of shock but then people move on to the nuts and bolts of finding out what they can do with their property there are certain phases to disaster cycles that people go through and that the communities go through
3352347 people are starting to get the economic information now and unfortunately there arent going to be quick answers to the government buy out situation or to questions about the fate of specific neighborhoods
3352348 some people may now know or will soon learn how much they are eligible for through the government programs insurance or other programs many times there are going to be gaps so the financial realities start to become very evident thats when people start to see just how difficult this is going to be
3352349 a lot of people do fine day to day while everything is clicking along particularly on a financial level when they have jobs and money coming in
3352350 those individuals may not have needed any extra support or extra assistance in terms of mental or behavioral health needs but if theyve now lost their job even those individuals who did not experience the flood at their residence but their business or place of employment was affected and there is no longer any income that situation is going to create additional stress that may be just enough to create additional problems elsewhere in their life so historically that person may not have needed extra assistance but this was just one more thing that may tip the scale
3352351 i think in terms of the man mowing the yard around his damaged house that this was probably the one thing he could control
3352352 you know he could make his yard look nice it could also be that this was an activity that he particularly enjoyed ive heard people remark as theyve been out looking at the flood affected neighborhoods about how nice the yards look just look at how nice that yard looks they obviously want back in their home they have so much pride in this piece of property my guess would be that it makes these individuals feel better to do something to have control over one aspect of whats going on when people can do something concrete it makes them feel like they are moving forward
3352353 perhaps you are a person that has typically read novels for enjoyment but now you find that you cant concentrate or focus on what youre reading
3352354 when you can no longer find enjoyment in the things that you previously like to do that can signal problem
3352355 by that same token some individuals may respond by engrossing themselves in books or whatever they find enjoyable that can be a problem too when it is being used as a way to completely escape and not deal with the current reality

3352471 ninety percent of the agencys training budget designated for advice and training of small disadvantaged businesses was given to one single contractor who falsified documents handed a majority of the work to unapproved subcontractors and spent most of the funding on salaries
3352472 this no bid halliburton style contract was given to an outgoing administration employee rather than to companies and organizations with extensive track records of working with the small and disadvantaged business community
3352473 we credit representative nydia velazquez chairwoman of the house committee on small business for bringing this issue to light to former sba administrator preston and getting the ball rolling on this investigation
3352474 as an organization that has received contracts and grants to provide technical assistance to small and disadvantaged businesses and especially as the representative for the intended recipients of those critical services we are truly disappointed that the sba channeled this contract to a former administration official with no experience in this field and virtually no knowledge of the technical assistance needs of our business community
3352475 based on documents submitted by vbp that were false or of questionable authenticity
3352476 we thank sba acting administrator jovita carranza for taking action quickly on this issue but are extremely concerned that funds meant to educate our members small and minority businesses were lost to fraud graft and wholesale mismanagement
3352477 global economic activity continues to expand but at a slower pace sluggish growth in the advanced economies is expected to continue at least until the first half of 2009 the rapid growth in the emerging markets is likely to soften according to advance estimates released by the bureau of economic analysis u s real gdp growth was 1 9 percent in the second quarter of 2008 the contribution of net exports to u s growth was a robust 2 4 percent in fact net exports have partially offset the negative drag from private residential investment especially since 2007 although this positive contribution could diminish as global growth slows
3352478 you dont have to be a technician to look at that chart and recognize something new is going on back in 2003 global gdp began pulling away from oil production note that oil broke out over 32 shortly thereafter and never looked back in the annual businessweek forecasts 2004 i was one of a handful of strategists that picked energy as my top sector its also pretty clear that all of the hullaboo on off shore drilling is just so much political nonsense yes we should be drilling no it wont make much of a difference in prices
3352479 i would recommend the system of mortgage credit used in denmark where loan to value ratios and underwriting standards are strictly enforced by a single strong regulator these mortgages are transformed into instantly tradable bonds cover for the bonds is provided by both the mortgages and the credit of the financial institutions issuing them the mortgages remain on the balance sheets of the issuers eliminating the moral hazard inherent in the us system which is based on earning fees from selling them on to the market the standardization of mortgages in the danish system promotes transparency and liquidity householders can prepay their mortgages at any time by buying the bonds since house values and bond prices tend to move in unison this arrangement reduces the danger of householders equity falling into negative territory for the issuing banks owning these bonds carries lower capital requirements so the bonds sell at a premium to ordinary covered bonds this system has survived and provided affordable home mortgages since its creation shortly after the great copenhagen fire of 1795
3352480 lacking an asset bubble to promote growth while still working through the aftermath of the last asset bubble leaves the u s economy hobbled while i think another downward lurch in line with the more apocalyptic outlooks remains unlikely stabilization at relatively low rates of growth looks like the best we can expect for the foreseeable future the collapse in energy prices gives the fed room to avoid a rate hike this year but the sting of this years burst of inflation will keep policymakers from cutting rates as well like the us economy monetary policy is in limbo

3352540 durante siglos el pueblo hebreo tuvo como aspiraci n jesusal n nuestro objetivo es tsjinvali y sujumi capitales de osetia del sur y abjasia respectivamente dijo el parlamentario durante una sesi n extraordinaria del legislativo georgiano
3352541 todos los georgianos debemos demostrar que seremos abanderados dignos de esa causa
3352542 no gang member or gang leader is above the law
3352543 will spare no effort in dealing with anyone who breaks the law
3352544 there is only one police service in tt the tt police service by law is the primary agency for providing effective and efficient law enforcement services to all citizens of this country contrary to what you believe the mandate of sautt is to operate in support of the police service
3352545 the solution to crime does not lie with the arrest and prosecution of offenders it also involves moving people away from crime
3352546 involved in programmes designed to discourage youths from gangs and gang violence
3352547 while it is clear that government is prepared to use all measures within the law to reduce crime including meeting with persons with significant influence in their communities at no time has government abdicated its responsibilities for law and order
3352548 we fear for our safety here in tbilisi which is the capital of georgia it is relatively calm right now in fact it has been calm since the fighting started but we dont know what is going to happen since russia has refused to sign the cease fire agreement
3352549 when we heard on the news that soldiers were heading to tbilisi we thought it was best to move out
3352550 when we were leaving the city the streets were lined with georgian soldiers and there were civilians with them but other than that we havent seen or heard anything more
3352551 it is calm so far but some of the people have left and are heading to nearby villages and the armenian border
3352552 it is just a blame game russia is saying that georgia fired the first missile and georgia is saying that russia started it south ossetia is part of georgia but the people have decided that they do not want to be georgians any longer they are ethnically different they have been supported by russia in their decision to be independent
3352553 there is a lot of hands on training and we get to work one on one with the professors and we also get to do a lot of research this is like a student foreign exchange programme because we get to go to different countries and experience all the different ways to practice medicine
3352554 we really like it here but safety comes first people know that the georgian military cant stand against the russian military georgia has just a couple of planes while russia has over 1 000
3352555 and we dont want to take that route because russian troops are occupying gori at this time
3352556 we are concerned about the safety of our children and there is no way of getting them out of the country only the british embassy in london can help us now
3352557 oh god all i can do is tell her everything will be all right god took her there and he did not take her quite there not to take care of her but it is better for them to be back home when the situation is resolved then maybe they can go back
3352558 i think it is unfair we cannot go and sit there for so long to see the pm i am not able with that if the pm want to see me he can make an appointment and come in my office to see me this is my livelihood at stake here
3352559 right now we have a computer training course for the younger folk i took the course too but what i will do with that now i am 50 years old and it is hard for a company to employ me now
3352560 we are doing a lot to get the fishermen to come out we are getting the people to come out but not necessarily from the fishing industry
3352561 the choice not to change can often be destructive and they would find that they are being left behind
3352562 this is about having a career we want people to become professional fisherfolk with the right equipment and tools and there are ways that they can get it
3352563 if i had gotten work i would have still kept my boat but nothing is opening up only one man in our group that did the courses got a job
3352564 it depends on the job that we are getting but there might be some who would not want to leave the sea
3352565 if you have a rampant board what can the commission commission for co operative development do
3352566 i dont think it is a very effective process but that is the act we have
3352567 and it begs the question what can society do to protect their assets
3352568 no court shall take cognisance of any act involved in the winding up or dissolution of an organisation under the act co operative
3352569 i cant think of any two countries that have closer ties based on our history
3352570 interestingly alzheimers disease pathology was associated with physical frailty in older persons both with and without dementia
3352571 the level of frailty was approximately two times higher in a person with a high level of ad pathology compared with a person with a low level of ad pathology
3352572 together both of these studies suggest that frailty can be an early indicator of alzheimers disease pathology and may appear before memory loss
3352573 if any one faculty of our nature may be called more wonderful than the rest i do think it is memory there seems something more speakingly incomprehensible in the powers the failures the inequalities of memory than in any other of our intelligences
3352574 k nnen wir nicht daf r garantieren dass wir die rzteschaft ruhig halten und wir wollen das auch nicht
3352575 das ist sehr weit weg von dem mindestversprechen der politik von 2 5 milliarden euro
3352576 weve learned that the nf1 gene affects stature through a different pathway than the one weve previously focused on to understand cancers in patients with neurofibromatosis type 1
3352577 given that this second pathway has been linked to cancer in other contexts we may need to consider the possibility that it is contributing to these tumors and alter our treatment goals accordingly
3352578 in conclusion we provide evidence that a metabolically benign obesity can be identified and that it may protect from insulin resistance and atherosclerosis
3352579 furthermore our data suggest that ectopic misplaced fat accumulation in the liver may be more important than visceral fat in the determination of such a beneficial phenotype in obesity
3352580 we already know that ptks are associated with several types of aggressive cancers including colon breast and lung cancers
3352581 what we have discovered is that ptks have an important role to play as cancer cells grow and mutate to become potentially more aggressive tumours
3352582 the more we can learn about how tumours develop the more we are able to prevent their growth in the future
3352583 there are already drugs that inhibit particular ptks in the late stages of treatment our discovery could change the timing of when and how those or similar drugs are administered
3352584 some of these same gene regulatory networks are re activated in the adult to direct the growth of new blood vessels this can be beneficial as in the case of a heart attack
3352585 finding that a single factor regulates a large part of the angiogenic process creates a significant target for therapeutic development for any disease involving the vascular system
3352586 i was at my wits end it was 2am and the kids were coughing
3352587 sometimes cough medicine doesnt seem to do the trick my brother in law had sent this email to everyone saying you should rub vicks on their feet then put socks on top
3352588 i doubted that it would do anything but i gave it a try anyway i shut the door and it just worked it works every single time
3352589 after 10 days of careful observation we are happy to see the cow is very healthy

3352615 afnemende groei onduidelijkheid over de winstvooruitzichten en risciomijdend gedrag bij beleggers zetten de toon een duurzaam herstel is pas mogelijk als de economische vooruitzichten fundamenteel verbeteren
3352616 na de forse koersdalingen vanaf mei is een kortstondige opleving van de effectenbeurzen echter mogelijk door dalende prijzen van olie meevallende kwartaalberichten en kalmering op de financi le markten
3352617 centrale banken kunnen in 2009 mogelijk zelfs de rente gaan verlagen
3352618 daarnaast verwacht de nederlandse grootbank dat de amerikaanse economie in 2008 en 2009 nog een lichte groei zal laten zien ondanks de zwakke huizenmarkt en de oplopende werkloosheid
3352619 de duitse ifo indicator en andere indices voor het ondernemersvertrouwen zijn scherp gedaald bovendien ondervinden de exporten in europa veel hinder van de dure euro
3352620 wij handhaven daarbij onze voorkeur voor large caps en voor bedrijven met en sterke ontwikkeling van de cash flow in combinatie met aantrekkelijke groeiperspectieven

3352632 some people are surprised that asian swimmers have won gold and silver at this olympics
3352633 but at this games i have won gold and silver and weve had zhang lin china win silver so we have shown the world that we can compete we got got medals and were both asian
3352634 i dont know what happened but when i looked back and saw a few smiling faces i realised i had done it
3352635 i went in with a lot of confidence because i had come second in athens but i still had to shoot my best it was a close call but at least it went in my favour
3352636 no longer will a gold medal surprise us never again will we plead with the constellations to allow luck to go our way
3352637 when i heard about it i felt really hurt inside
3352638 i cannot believe a writer could write something like that its the not the way that we want to be portrayed we have feelings we dont like the word retard we are people were just like any other people out there we want to be ourselves and not be discriminated against
3352639 there were parts of the movie where i laughed but it seems to me that the movie tried really hard to go too far and then pull back on everything that was offensive except the issue of people with intellectual disabilities i just think ben stiller and the people involved in this movie just didnt think it was going to be offensive

3352644 every prisoner who arrived at s21 was destined for execution
3352645 duch personally tortured or mistreated detainees at s21 on a number of separate occasions and through a variety of means
3352646 his leadership and participation were clear contributing factors to the overall functioning of s21 and demonstrated an intention that the staff of s21 carry out these crimes
3352647 the crimes committed at s21 themselves constituted a discreet widespread or systematic attack against the civilian population detained therein

3352652 the situation is under control and the matter is under review
3352653 but we have got our priorities straight in 2007 we deported the highest ever number of foreign lawbreakers up by a huge 80 and we are committed to removing those who have no legal basis to stay in the uk
3352654 it looks like the rabbit had been caught taken away skinned and theyve actually brought the skin back
3352655 i dont know if it was some sort of trophy for them because it looked as if the skin had been placed back down on the ground rather than thrown on the ground
3352656 i felt totally sick i was nauseated i just cant believe that somebody can do that especially to a pet
3352657 it was a deliberate act they knew what they were doing
3352658 i was overjoyed because shes very calm and timid so i really thought it was her that had died misty was fiery

3352672 the basic fundamentals look easier going forward and were pleased to see that
3352673 is this really the tipping point for the market that some pundits have identified we would hesitate before automatically extrapolating the recent price trend
3352674 but the underlying trends for the u s in particular remain weak

3352679 the direct descent of the essential program of the esoteric schools was entrusted to groups already well conditioned for the work the guilds trade unions and similar protective and benevolent societies had been internally strengthened by the introduction of a new learning the advancement of the plan required the enlargement of the boundaries of the philosophic overstate a world fraternity was needed sustained by a deep and broad program of education according to the method such a fraternity could not immediately include all men but it could unite the activities of certain kinds of men regardless of their racial or religious beliefs or the nations in which they dwelt these were the men of towardness those sons of tomorrow whose symbol was a blazing sun rising over the mountains of the east
3352680 a recurrent mythic model for revolutionaries early romantics the young marx the russians of lenins time was prometheus who stole fire from the gods for the use of mankind
3352681 the new reality they sought was radically secular and stridently simple the ideal was not the balanced complexity of the new american federation but the occult simplicity of its great seal an all seeing eye atop a pyramid over the words novus ordo seclorum
3352682 stole fire from the gods for the use of mankind
3352683 i come to berlin as so many of my countrymen have come before tonight i speak to you not as a candidate for president but as a citizen a proud citizen of the united states and a fellow citizen of the world
3352684 yes there have been differences between america and europe no doubt there will be differences in the future but the burdens of global citizenship continue to bind us together a change of leadership in washington will not lift this burden in this new century americans and europeans alike will be required to do more not less partnership and cooperation among nations is not a choice it is the one way the only way to protect our common security and advance our common humanity
3352685 it seems to me that the nature of the ultimate revolution with which we are now faced is precisely this that we are in process of developing a whole series of techniques which will enable the controlling oligarchy who have always existed and presumably will always exist to get people to love their servitude

3352691 lets say you log in to your brokerage account and see 100 000 in there then you log in a few months later and theres only 65 000 in there how would you feel about that could you stay the course and leave the money invested

3352694 in the face of russian aggression the very existence of independent georgia and the survival of its democratically elected government are at stake
3352695 must understand the severe long term negative consequences that their governments actions will have for russias relationship with the us and europe
3352696 no matter how this conflict started russia has escalated it well beyond the dispute over south ossetia and invaded another country
3352697 i reiterate my call for russia to stop its bombing campaign to stop flights of russian aircraft in georgian airspace and to withdraw its ground forces from georgia
3352698 in condemning this aggression and seeking a peaceful resolution to this crisis
3352699 the un must stand up for the sovereignty of its members and peace in the world
3352700 let me be clear we seek a future of cooperative engagement with the russian government and friendship with the russian people
3352701 there were eight whales altogether made up of two adult males four adult females and two young ones

3352753 mi modesta y breve aproximaci n a su idea de la condici n heroica est llamada a fracasar porque no parece posible reconocer ning n signo heroico en una literatura donde no se narran proezas ni prodigios ya que no hay en ella caracteres destacados ni pr ceres ni epopeyas sino como he apuntado la narraci n de actos que se refieren en o se citan de otras epopeyas m s o menos memorables cabr a reconocer aqu una primera figura para la idea de lo heroico en borges una primera representaci n que nos refiere a l como h roe sujeto de una desdicha o de una tragedia inconsolable estar dotado para reconocer el coraje y la virtud en los varones insignes y saber adem s que no le ha sido dada la capacidad de emular esa virtud t pica penuria o tribulaci n rom ntica no hay pues nada de an malo en la raigambre rom ntica de borges ni en su funci n como escritor fundacional de cierta argentinidad minoritaria o discutida pero sin duda reconocible lo peculiar si acaso es que su idea de lo heroico no responde a la pauta convencional del romanticismo sino que sorprendentemente recurre a un patr n que es cl sico en efecto el h roe borgeano no es un tit n sino un humano fr gil un ser finito en suma un desgraciado

3352768 that is a process that takes a couple of years
3352769 as a practical matter in these capital markets we cannot finance this thing today anyway i do not think anybody can if you are trying to build a big property
3352770 we are going into a little bit of a holding pattern while we spend small amounts of money on legal fees and stuff like that to try to inch towards having a project that can be built when the capital markets recover
3352771 the current political situation is not conducive the country may lose donor aid due to the ongoing political argument that has been there the last three years i have been in the country
3352772 if there is no budget in place donors will have to either reduce aid levels or provide it outside the budget
3352773 every agenda for regular meetings shall provide an opportunity for members of the public to directly address the legislative body on any item of interest to the public before or during the legislative bodys consideration of the item that is within the subject matter jurisdiction of the legislative body provided that no action shall be taken on any item not appearing on the agenda unless the action is otherwise authorized by subdivision b of section 54954 2
3352774 reasonable regulations to ensure that the intent of subdivision a is carried out including but not limited to r egulations limiting the total amount of time allocated for public testimony on particular issues and for each individual speaker
3352775 your new policy of only having fifteen minutes of public comment before the meeting starts its not democratic it shuts down opposition it shuts down good ideas i get inspired by listening to public comment from people it shows lack of flexibility and you are doing a great disservice to the citizens who want to participate in government and their sense of empowerment you wonder why people dont sign up to be on commissions well when you give them fifteen minutes public comment for all the issues it really shows that you are not interested in what people have to say i really urge you to get the citizens involved and not belittle us by allowing only fifteen minutes of public comment
3352776 the purpose of a council meeting is to address items on the agenda
3352777 just get to the meeting early and sit by the podium if you need to speak first its not that hard to be heard
3352778 i would think a better solution would be for city council to assess the length of each meeting and if need be spilt public comment to two parts before and during agenda items and then asking those waiting to give public comment if they could wait until later in the evening
3352779 the one caution i would give to the council though is to not set public comment at the end of their meeting which is almost always after 11 p m to do so would be an act of denying citizens reasonable access to public comment otherwise required by the brown act

3352805 is about to make one of the most important decisions of this campaign choosing a running mate
3352806 the answer is simple to power our country with 100 clean energy in ten years all we need is your help
3352807 its not that people think mccain will win its that they are realizing that mccain could win
3352808 this election is about barack obama not john mccain its about whether barack obama passes muster every poll shows that people want a democratic president the problem is theyre not sure they want barack obama
3352809 this is a country that is looking for a fundamentally different direction and john mccain offers nothing but the status quo
3352810 the idea that obama was going to win in a blowout was always preposterous
3352811 a big piece of this of course is whether white people are going to support a black guy if obama is a tall skinny white guy named paul jones its a different story
3352812 its the uncertainty that kills me we know its going to be factor but how big a factor
3352813 watch michigan the democrats think theyve got it but they dont
3352814 obama should be killing mccain there but theres a lot more racial tension in michigan than in other states
3352815 you dont look at john and say who the heck is he hes a veteran hes a guy who got pretty banged up in vietnam he can deal with crisis theres some uncertainty about senator obama
3352816 but it will be interesting to see if mccains able to close the economic gap
3352817 fairly or not folks think hes pretty liberal and nobody wants a pair of pelosis running things
3352818 he gore has been working on this global warming business for decades the country and world caught up to him
3352819 would you offer him a job in an obama administration
3352820 clinton dispatched the military overseas forty four times during his eight years the u s military had been deployed outside of america only eight times in the previous forty five years
3352821 clinton acting through nato also orchestrated a bombing campaign against serbia from march until june 1999
3352822 he did so without the consent of congress the house of representatives actually voted against authorizing clintons bombing war against the serbs no president in american history has ever waged war in the face of direct congressional opposition
3352823 my experience as a missionary teacher in africa opened my eyes to this simple fact without access to energy life is brutal and short
3352824 these battleground states are good reflections of the nation as a whole
3352825 the youth vote both religious and non religious are likely to show the same patterns at the national level if they religious youth can have an impact nationally they will have an impact in the battleground states
3352826 the abandoning of politics as usual an opportunity for the underrepresented to have a voice
3352827 obama is the face of the christian youth generation moreso than anybody else
3352828 a vast majority of my friends believe mccain is the face of the christian youth vote today
3352829 upholds the christian values and he acknowledges that god should be kept in public places
3352830 young religious voters are looking for a president who will keep our nation safe while expanding economic opportunity and promoting our common values in this election young religious voters will see that john mccain has the leadership values and vision we need in our next president
3352831 our campaign is reaching out to young people of all faiths including evangelicals by holding house parties hosting events with key supporters and even holding rock concerts faith has been an important part of senator obamas life and he shares the commitment that millions of young evangelicals and people of all faith have to changing the world around them
3352832 a lot of people who will vote for mccain because of his view on israel and a lot of people will vote for obama because of his view of change and his objectivity to tackle foreign policy issues
3352833 because of the nature of the contest this time around both parties having highly contesting races
3352834 in touch with issues that matter to young people and he views them as beneficiaries to todays policies
3352835 what i am when i hear him is inspired and i dont get that from other politicians
3352836 mccain has a stronger allegiance and better stance on israel
3352837 there is more to electing the next president of the united states than being a good speaker
3352838 turnout is critical and the only votes that count are the votes that are cast
3352839 they can buy a locomotive anyplace in the world they can buy it anyplace in the world but they buy it here because its the most fuel efficient and its the most environmentally sound and it requires the least maintenance
3352840 i want you and every american to tell the congress that when we start anew in january of 2009 lets sit down together republican and democrat libertarian vegetarian whoever it is lets sit down together and start working on these problems together and put our country first
3352841 now if youd just raise your hand we have some people with a microphone or if youd like to go back to work whichever
3352842 where did the internet come from besides al gore and by the way i have great respect for vice president gore
3352843 eighty four percent of the american people think that the countrys on the wrong track congress has a 9 percent approval rating now you get down to 9 percent youre down to paid staffers and blood relatives you cant get much lower than that
3352844 um call tom ridge to washington from whatever vacation he is taking and get him to work
3352845 who will be the next president of the united states
3352846 the most productive and most competitive worker in the world resides in the united states of america
3352847 drilling offshore isnt the answer either but its a bridge its an important bridge to exploit our own oil and natural gas reserves while were making this transition that we must make to energy independence
3352848 i liked what he had to say today i want to hear more of what hes going to do to solve our issues
3352849 its a very important thing to do in life vote for someone thats going to run your future
3352850 and the sad part is that it is keeping all of us from a having a real discussion on things that matter
3352851 as a black man in america i can never deny that race matters but i believe race is the red herring in this campaign folks have gone too far and are too sensitive
3352852 we should all agree that race is a part of this campaign once we acknowledge the elephant in the room perhaps we can start to figure out how to draw the line
3352853 we thought our climb was over but couldnt go down our ascent route
3352854 alpinism is not just death tragedy survival and heroism we hope our climb will serve as a reminder that mountaineers like us and many others climb mountains to live to enjoy to grow and to accept the verdicts of life and sometimes also of fate without arguing or lacking respect toward those who share the same value the value of life
3352855 this year a passing will be impossible for a small boat as you can see on the ice situation map end of july 2008
3352856 arctic ice has diminished but theres more ice in antarctica now truth is about 2 3rd of total north pole ice always melts by the end of the northern summer this summer it got down to about 1 4 of the winter amount it is much less alarming if you consider that the total between the 2 poles only represents about a 5 reduction from normal
3352857 this was such a road these were such gold splashed peaks

3352860 dear elsie speck did you know that the day after russia invaded georgia sen obama demanded for the un to pass resolution condemning russia but was unaware that russia has un security council veto power
3352861 personally i feel that any one that would even consider voting for a muslim or any other foreigner that is for the ruination of the beliefs and customs of our country should be shot for treason
3352862 a great slideshows is determined by the type of interaction a presenter has with their slides
3352863 if the presenter is addicted to reading bullet points then everyone in the room suffers
3352864 we can keep blaming software for the putrid output but in reality we need to take responsibility
3352865 as communicators learning to create visual stories that connect with our audience is becoming imperative especially in light of global competitive pressure
3352866 environmentalists will be forced to compromise next year and support the development of clean coal nuclear power and other alternative fuels
3352867 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
3352868 im having a belvedere in your honour the mountains are fantastic fabulous colours in the high desert will say hi at pasquals for you
3352869 i know there is a little mini panic going on in the ranks of not a few democrats and the chattering classes but with o in hawaii the nation on vacation the tv full of the olympics phelps romping in the pool and georgia on my mind i just want to say hey its august chill
3352870 the unreal is the paris britney obama glam rock nonsense the latest example of which is
3352871 the more team mccain does this as much as it obviously gets their ya yas out the more they demean their candidate
3352872 this country faces immense issues and it is not a time for insipid parodies and you know what the american people understand it and they want more from the men who are asking for their vote to be president of the united states so the mccain frat boys can act out as much as they want
3352873 the unreal is thinking that obama has peaked in the high 40s in virtually all the polls but not understanding that it is mccain who may have peaked in the low 40s where he has been stuck in virtually all the polls
3352874 what is real is race the industrial states and commander in chief
3352875 this election brings us into new territory the country has never gone through this before
3352876 you ask americans where georgia is and they think it is somewhere near atlanta
3352877 so the handwringers are wailing that we are only slightly up in august but guess what we are up in august and we will still peak in late october
3352878 hey you got sms in australia we want to text you on the vp the moment barack makes his decision as we told our troops
3352879 thanks for giving me an excuse to sip the belvedere love taos and santa fe chill baby
3352880 a new rasmussen poll of iowa shows that barack obamas lead is starting to slip
3352881 americas three great national challenges our economy national security and climate change can all be addressed by switching to renewable energy
3352882 the olympics are a time for all americans to reflect on our nations achievements and what we as a people can do together choosing the right path and repowering our nation is something we can do and something that will benefit us all
3352883 we all know our country faces tough challenges a weaker economy soaring gas prices growing dependence on foreign oil and a worsening climate crisis
3352884 we can switch to smarter cleaner forms of power and take advantage of free energy sources like the wind and sun the answer is simple power our country with 100 percent clean electricity within ten years
3352885 we are taking this message to a national audience because this goal is both ambitious and attainable
3352886 meeting the challenge to repower america will deliver the affordability stability and confidence our economy needs as well as a healthy environment and it will generate millions of good american jobs that cant be outsourced
3352887 could ralph naders entrance and exit have helped al gore the impact of decoy dynamics on consumer choice
3352888 we found that the entrance and exit of a third option the nader effect can profoundly impact consumers preference
3352889 the presence of the third alternative shifts the focus of the customer if you have two automobiles extolling their fuel efficiency while a third promotes style purchasers pay more attention to the fuel efficiency criterion then when one of the high fuel efficiency cars leaves the market the other fuel efficient car draws consumers in the case of automobiles it might be fuel efficiency and in the case of political candidates it might be health care when the third choice exits the remaining candidate with the most similar attributes becomes the favorite even if they werent before
3352890 we also call this effect the phantom decoy effect because like pre announced software that is never released these desirable options that become unavailable may never actually exist
3352891 the increase in affinity that a product may receive when a decoy option real or not is removed can mark a significant change in consumer choice
3352892 in terms of elections even a 5 percent increase in preference makes a huge difference at the ballot box
3352893 she left him twice she was scared for her life
3352894 historically presidential nominations were decided at the party conventions and as a result the vice presidential running mates were also selected at the conventions gallups jeff jones notes
3352895 that made it difficult to disentangle the effect of naming a vice presidential running mate on a candidates support from the
3352896 the small window of time after the announcement of a presidential candidates running mate but before the convention has taken place
3352897 similar to the pattern seen with clinton in 1996 support for gore held steady during bushs vice presidential selection phase at 41 percent
3352898 the voter registration officials simply take the word of the registrant with no follow up
3352899 some states that require some backup documentation merely ask for a utility bill or a drivers license neither of which prove citizenship in other words legal or illegal aliens can easily register to vote in local and national elections
3352900 while the news media perpetuated the assertion that bush and the gop stole the election it could very well have been illegal aliens voting in florida that made the outcome so close
3352901 bush may have beaten gore by more votes if illegals were excluded since immigrants tend to vote for democrats or gore could have won decisively had there been prior screening before people were allowed into the voting booths
3352902 there was absolutely no mention in the mainstream media regarding suspected voter fraud by illegal or legal aliens it was much easier for the agenda driven newspeople to accuse republicans of stealing the election
3352903 florida is not unique thousands of non citizens are registered to vote in some states and tens if not hundreds of thousands in total may be present on the voter rolls nationwide these numbers are significant local elections are often decided by only a handful of votes and even national elections have likely been within the margin of the number of non citizens illegally registered to vote
3352904 there is no reliable method to determine the number of non citizens registered or actually voting because most laws to ensure that only citizens vote are ignored are inadequate or are systematically undermined by government officials those who ignore the implications of non citizen registration and voting either are willfully blind to the problem or may actually favor this form of illegal voting
3352905 americans would be shocked to discover that hundreds of thousands of general election voters are illegal aliens green card immigrants and criminals whove murdered raped and robbed us citizens and guess which political party benefits the most from their votes the one thats pushing for amnesty and a bag full of free goodies
3352906 to keep non citizens from diluting citizens votes immigration and election officials must cooperate far more effectively than they have to date and state and federal officials must increase their efforts to enforce the laws against non citizen voting that are already on the books
3352907 while the liberal media and the liberal establishment ignore what is a huge scandal american voters are having their rights violated when an illegal aliens or felon or other person prohibited by law to vote their votes cancels out those of american citizens
3352908 liberals want illegal aliens and felons to vote they benefit from such rampant fraud
3352909 it is our choices harry that show what we truly are far more than our abilities
3352910 im thirsty can you point me to the soda pop aisle
3352911 people want choices people want the opportunity to make their own decisions
3352912 they come in and they look and they go were overwhelmed
3352913 since reagan the ideology in the united states has been that choice is good and more choice is better and to the extent that you can give people more choice in every area of life you are improving their well being
3352914 nobody has the time or the expertise to make informed choices about everything
3352915 when options are presented people have a tough time just ignoring them
3352916 its wonderful that we can sit down in our living room and order 20 000 things in a superficial way we are more informed than people used to be but its hard to get our attention and i dont see any way of turning that around
3352917 the era of choice the ability to choose and its transformation of contemporary life
3352918 follow me unless you have something more interesting going on
3352919 the only way were going to solve our problems in this country is if all of us come together
3352920 we are fellow americans and that shared distinction means more to me than any other association
3352921 theres no way were going back to the times of zachary taylor
3352922 its not is too much information bad its how do you manage within an environment that does provide all information and will continue to provide all information
3352923 with more choices out there if leaders want to bring issues to the attention of the public they have to bring it into our venues and speak it on our terms
3352924 institutions are breaking down and there are going to be new ways of doing things but the cream can still rise the signal can still make it through the noise in this new environment
3352925 you dont need 90 percent of the public informed on the issue and following it closely to get your policy passed
3352926 not everybody was running around yelling yeah yeah liberty death
3352927 this country is an experiment and for it to have endured for this long it requires the involvement of citizens citizens making choices
3352928 where are those conversations we had like patrick henry on the steps
3352929 americans overwhelmingly believe there is an urgent national need to find new sources of energy and this need is more important than reducing energy usage according to a new national telephone survey
3352930 see development of new energy sources as an urgent priority only 9 disagree
3352931 for nearly two thirds 65 finding new sources of energy is more important than reducing the amount of energy americans now consume twenty eight 28 think reducing current usage is more important
3352932 my guess is that the first big shock will come just after the election on november 4 shortly thereafter israel with the blessing of the white house will attack irans nuclear facilities in order to destroy or at least delay its program to develop weapons
3352933 i called my partners and said i think i just met a future president of the united states
3352934 i went from being a senator a young senator to being considered for vice president running for president being a vice presidential candidate and becoming a national public figure
3352935 all of which fed a self focus an egotism a narcissism that leads you to believe that you can do whatever you want youre invincible and there will be no consequences
3352936 he could have been a force in american politics for a very long time
3352937 the fact that he had not spent his life in politics was his greatest asset people at the time were saying he didnt have enough experience and hadnt been tested actually hed been tested in ways other people had not
3352938 if youre an incumbent one of your nightmares is a fresh face coming out of the woodwork with the resources to be competitive
3352939 has shown a remarkable disrespect for his office for the moral dimensions of leadership for his friends for his wife for his precious daughter
3352940 i suspect the first thing he thought about is im going to protect myself politically he was worried about his family finding out he was worried about the rest of the staff finding out he was worried about the press finding out
3352941 consistent moderation placed edwards among the center right of senate democrats
3352942 he climbed onto the slab at the funeral home laid there and hugged his body and promised that hed do all he could to make life better for people to live up to wades ideals of service
3352943 as he told me later edwards had recounted the exact story to him almost in the exact same words a year or two before and with the same preface that hed never shared the memory with anyone else
3352944 he wanted to be vice president and said what he had to
3352945 the thing that would surprise me is if he doesnt continue to serve in some way hes been underestimated many times
3352946 im not sure i had a political career for the future anyway
3352947 im not sure that politics was what i wanted to spend my life doing
3352948 i dont know whats possible and whats gone i dont think anythings ended i see no end my lord and my wife have forgiven me so im going to move on
3352949 i believe we would have won iowa and clinton today would therefore have been the nominee
3352950 our dependence on foreign oil means that we are buying from our enemies
3352951 how bout some friends and a few a holes that better
3352952 the american people know something is wrong as far as energy is concerned
3352953 i hope he grabs that part of middle america that we failed to reach
3352954 i want him to make more money in wind than he did in oil
3352955 it was my first experience in the takeover field expansion by acquisition
3352956 people had splashed water all over the counters thrown paper towels on the floor and boone pickens couldnt stand to see his investment in disarray so without a word he started picking up the paper towels and wiping down the counters himself
3352957 i think the rest of us were so embarrassed we started to clean up quietly around him
3352958 the god i believe in wants there to be a pipeline here
3352959 this was the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and the planet began to heal
3352960 anybody gone into whole foods lately and seen what they charge for arugula
3352961 as you may know a couple hundred thousand berliners made a lot of noise for my opponent ill take the roar of 50 000 harleys any day
3352962 normally there is something peculiar about us politicians we all have our foibles david cameron is remarkably free of such flaws he does very normal things like go down to tesco and having his bike stolen
3352963 anyone whos paid attention knows that obama makes many more gaffes than mccain
3352964 senator lieberman supports both democrats and republicans and he gave to the committee as a senior member of the caucus
3352965 people can relate to other people that they know or people in a similar circumstance they are therefore more inclined to take a chance and do something different
3352966 green marketing is totally an increased buzzword the average person doesnt check to see if the word holds any weight with the business
3352967 people should look at what companies are actually doing to be sustainable
3352968 everyday i would take an industrial sized trash bag and at least fill it to the brim with paper and cardboard despite the fact that there were recycling bins available on campus
3352969 the only real trash that we had was coffee grinds and those are biodegradable
3352970 our goal was to protect the military men and women from a vaccine that was neither safe or effective
3352971 if you decided to concoct a mystery thriller plot based on a story where an angry scientist put anthrax in the mail to somehow save a vaccine program it would strike most people as bizarre and far fetched
3352972 one theory is that by launching these attacks he creates a situation a scenario where people all of a sudden realize the need to have this vaccine
3352973 they tried to blame it on al qaida then scientist steven hatfill and finally reluctantly on an actual u s army employed scientist
3352974 they should have immediately been looking at the folks with something to gain by the vaccine program continuing or those who no longer would be embarrassed because their program and lifes work was under attack
3352975 apparently gore and maybe even bush is considering making the anthrax vaccine for the military voluntary or even stopping the program unfortunately since the bioport people arent scientists the task of solving their problem has fallen on us
3352976 i think the is about to hit the fan bigtime the final lot isnt passing the potency test and now theres nothing to back it up plus the control vaccine isnt working its just a fine mess
3352977 bruce had created new anthrax vaccines designed to replace bioports vaccine
3352978 this case wont be brought to closure in a court of law now so i expect there will be some kind of formal congressional setting to ask more questions
3352979 there are good muslims and bad muslims that i have to admit just like there are good and bad jews
3352980 no this was their place first they could take the hot weather and some of them went far in this world theyre not lazy
3352981 i know hes smart i dont think hes a dummy like bush
3352982 im fine i have to go for blood work again they keep me waiting for an hour im all sunburned like a berry i get in the water and i forget to get out i get in conversations
3352983 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
3352984 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view
3352985 this will be a very interesting experiment that can never happen again
3352986 it doesnt matter if global warming is true or not we all want cleaner air
3352987 our actions over the coming few decades could create risks of major disruption to economic and social activity later in this century and in the next on a scale similar to those associated with the great wars and the economic depression of the first half of the 20th century
3352988 it doesnt matter if global warming is true or not we all want cleaner air
3352989 it doesnt matter if iraq had weapons of mass destruction saddam was a cruel and ruthless dictator who oppressed and murdered his people
3352990 once they are gone youll go back to sucking down the equivalent of a cigarette drag every time you breathe outdoors
3352991 it is all just mist does anybody think that china would ever consider cooking the books on aug 10 ap measured 604 micrograms m 3 the bbc measured 278 in another location and beijings air quality index which is supposed to be the highest of many different readings measured 82
3352992 one can live in the shadow of an idea without grasping it
3352993 treason fled before us for resistance was in vain while we were marching through georgia
3352994 our ability to exploit agile development methodologies in partnership with exigen gives us an edge as we develop and maintain suns products

3353011 john and i will tell you there were interesting races four years ago and eight years ago but in many ways this is one of the most interesting races in all of american history we have a chance to lift our country to a new way of thinking this can be a transformative election but make no mistake its close closer than it should be
3353012 mccain has promised and reaffirmed his commitment to continue the same policies weve had these past eight years for another four
3353013 we cannot do that barack obama has lifted our spirits and led us to believe yes we can solve the global climate crisis address the other issues we have to take on and has said we can come together and create a new century with bright hope
3353014 you want some advice make iraq the 51st state and lets get the hell out of there
3353015 these are not normal times the relationship between the planet and ourselves has been irrevocably and dramatically altered were a bull in a china shop today as the sun sets we will have put another 70 million tons of global warming pollution into the atmosphere
3353016 just so you all know we did set a record
3353017 ive been involved in fundraising a long time and to have two incredible men who were nominees and both should have been president and also the fact i got a nobel prize winner and an academy award winner this is too much even for me
3353018 he promised america it would be a campaign of respect of ideas not insults and the american people wanted a better campaign and he gives you paris hilton and britney spears
3353019 if he cant keep his word about the campaign and he cant keep his word about the issues that are really important to the american people and he makes the wrong judgments about how to protect america then his candidacy is in fact dangerous in terms of americas security and you cant trust it and you cant trust him thats what this is about
3353020 its like magical thinking with no one bothering to scratch the surface
3353021 full on pander mode flailing around looking for anything that has traction in polls
3353022 saying that we can drill our way out of it this idea that every little bit helps is denying reality
3353023 it may not be good politics but its not fair to the electorate to let them think that a few little tweaks are going to fix the problem
3353024 if we want to enable the technologies of tomorrow like plug in electric cars we need electricity to plug into
3353025 state capitalism with direct intervention in a large sector of the economy
3353026 if wall street sees 4 8 plants built with important federal support over the next seven years on cost and on schedule i think youre going to see robust support from the financial sector
3353027 thats just not a feasible or responsible thing to say
3353028 if were going to cut down on greenhouse gases we have to find a way to sequester them and emissions in general
3353029 i have been an oil man my whole life but this is one emergency we cannot drill our way out of
3353030 on this issue i think that americans are ahead of the candidates of both parties
3353031 our energy economy is undergoing a transformation and were just in the early stages
3353032 if black people kill black people every day why not have a week and kill white people
3353033 are you better off now than you were four years ago
3353034 as we come closer to the peoples vote they get closer to corporate power
3353035 things are getting so bad for libertarians and liberals theres starting to be a convergence of interests
3353036 you cant focus on voters rights and ignore candidate rights
3353037 for all practical purpose we are no much better than the chinese political model expect that in china there is no gridlock and things are getting done
3353038 i am really beholdin to corporate interests they give me a great paycheck and have provided me with the highest standard of living in history comment by lackeynlovenit august 6 2008 at 5 05 pm
3353039 we have regular exchanges with malaysian diplomats in washington on a number of subjects including with the malaysian charge daffaires yesterday
3353040 anwar ibrahims case was one of the topics of conversation
3353041 we take note of the many serious questions raised within malaysia including by the malaysian bar council concerning this case
3353042 for the second time gore is goring us repeating the 1998 goring
3353043 we hope he will stop goring as it is about time he re examines the goring process within himself and his country
3353044 there is no way other countries should look down on us in the administration of our own laws our criminal procedure code and the penal code emanate from the common law
3353045 therefore there is no reason whatsoever for any other power in the world to criticise us in administering justice and the rule of law
3353046 at the same time were seeing our national security experts saying were highly vulnerable with 70 percent of our oil coming from foreign countries the largest reserves being in the most unstable region of the world the persian gulf
3353047 we are being told by scientists around the world particularly the international group that is charged with studying this and reporting to world leaders that we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
3353048 sitting next to someone on a senate committee has sparked more than a few deep friendships
3353049 obviously my name was linked to it but other than that theres nothing that can be said
3353050 he was a governor who tried to not ruffle feathers
3353051 as a debater i felt like i was in the twilight zone show you want to reach over and slit the arm to see if theres flesh and blood or just wires
3353052 one of my big accomplishments was at one point in the debate he started to sweat
3353053 is it boring to win five times as a democrat in a state thats overwhelmingly republican
3353054 obviously the people of indiana think theres something exciting about him
3353055 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
3353056 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
3353057 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
3353058 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous
3353059 despite all the talk about sexism in the presidential campaign the majority of women voters laid the blame for hillarys loss squarely on her and her strategists shoulders they largely reject gender as a cause of her demise
3353060 colorado obama 47 mccain 45 virginia obama 47 mccain 46 missouri obama 45 mccain 47
3353061 alabama too close to call arkansas too close to call
3353062 why is it that barack obama cant consistently overshoot 50 and john mccain cant comfortably crack 45 in the national polls
3353063 when he wasnt writing dirty jokes and yelling at people on the radio he found time to avoid paying his taxes in 18 different states
3353064 im not proud of every joke ive ever told but i know theres a difference between what you say as a comedian and what you do as a u s senator
3353065 the two candidates are polar opposites on many major issues notably the wars in iraq and afghanistan and drilling in the arctic national wildlife refuge coleman has been with bush on both and franken is energetically against both
3353066 theres no more important voter in this media market than the hispanic swing vote
3353067 i think people like me feel proud of being in a thinking process rather than just going with one party
3353068 i think it was one of those memos that was written looked at by the candidate and wisely discarded
3353069 i think its ugly and i think if hillary clinton had done that she would have permanently besmirched her reputation her legacy and her place in american politics
3353070 its interesting if somebody produces a memo that says we need to go after these invisibles lower income voters women blue collar voters and then produces a strategy that all through the summer and into the fall and almost up to iowa is cautious calculating triangulating and is basically a replica of president clintons 1996 reelection strategy when he had no competitive primaries i mean its undeniable that she ran on inevitability she ran as the candidate of the establishment she ran as a quasi incumbent in a year of change it was a terrible mistake so if mark penn understood what the targets were in march maybe they should have come up with a strategy that would have reached those targets
3353071 campaign it seems from these memos to have been at least as focused on the staff going after each other as they were on going after the nomination and getting past barack obama
3353072 by the way one thing we shouldnt ignore in all of this they can all stand around pointing fingers at each other theyre not pointing fingers at the one person who deserves the most blame for their defeat and that is barack obama
3353073 he was an extraordinary candidate who resonated with what america feels and felt and what democrats felt as he went through those primaries
3353074 theres a certain strength in the sense of centeredness and almost the serenity that the obama campaign has displayed
3353075 they have a strategy theyve executed it consistently they dont get thrown off by day to day polls i remember last september there were all these people who were saying obama is behind clinton hes got to go out and hes got to attack her hes got to run negative ads and some of his own people and fundraising people said that and he held a conference call and he said im not doing that i know what the strategy is i know what i want to say i know how to reach people now ill tell you something youre a lot better off in a campaign with a strategy consistently adhered to than with 20 people debating ten competing strategies moving day to day
3353076 i think its ugly and i think if hillary clinton had done that she would have permanently besmirched her reputation her legacy and her place in american politics
3353077 barry and his 300 advisors are no match for putin hed spin the junior senator like a top and play him like a fiddle
3353078 barack obama while on vacation still managed to handle the crisis between russia and georgia better than trigger happy mccain john mccain was ready to wage war with russia because he thought that they attacked atlanta if he had any soldiers in his army after his brilliant surge in iraq he could send them to fight russia
3353079 it took the race card to defeat the clintons and they resent the hell out of it
3353080 hillary fought a tough battle made mistakes that cost the nomination
3353081 it was written well before he went into politics and it was not ghost written
3353082 why are people still arguing about hillary and obama this entire election will boil down to one factor race like bob kerrey said if obama was a tall skinny white guy named paul jones the election is a different story
3353083 is there anything obama can learn from this story and these memos
3353084 its interesting if somebody produces a memo that says we need to go after these invisibles lower income voters women blue collar voters
3353085 the most insignificant office that ever the invention of man contrived or his imagination conceived
3353086 one major trend we have seen is going green and being eco friendly
3353087 lots of bold colors make functional storage another way to express personality
3353088 definitely we are moving toward what we are calling alternative art work
3353089 they can hang the panels over the screen its all about personalization
3353090 these products are great quality so something can last four years and beyond to the first apartment
3353091 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
3353092 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
3353093 hes charismatic hes a strong orator he has a presence that draws you in
3353094 al gore is one of the few public figures challenging my generation to do anything hes inspirational
3353095 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
3353096 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
3353097 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
3353098 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
3353099 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
3353100 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
3353101 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
3353102 the consequences of climate change are very real and very negative but cheney is not convinced of that he believes not quite as much as senator james inhofe that this is a hoax but that the earth has been changing since it was formed and to say that climate change is caused by humans is incorrect
3353103 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
3353104 from their own website yes the owl is scamming you but yes you lefty libs are so desperate to believe in ghosts and goblins that you will look the other way when the obvious smacks you upside the head
3353105 deliver superior investment performance by taking a long term investment view and integrating sustainability research within a rigorous fundamental equity analysis framework
3353106 tensions and hostilities between georgians and ossetians are in no way justification for russian troops crossing an internationally recognized border
3353107 russia to immediately and unconditionally withdraw its forces from the territory of georgia
3353108 the consequences for euro atlantic stability and security are grave
3353109 talks among all sides and said the united states the u n security council and other parties should try to help bring about a peaceful resolution
3353110 its both sides fault both have been somewhat provocative with each other
3353111 central front in their war against america and the home of the next caliphate
3353112 today the united states has no moral authority left whatsoever to talk about human rights and the respect of law
3353113 bullshit youre doing a circle jerk with your righty friends because you think its safe here
3353114 once we decide to put some muscle into the game the entire american narrative is nothing more than mythology
3353115 i pray that god heals everybody and replaces stupidity with wisdom
3353116 their tax plan operates under the old theory that the best way to feed the birds is to give more oats to the horse
3353117 i did something thats not normal for politicians but its normal for people
3353118 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
3353119 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
3353120 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
3353121 i think people across the country look at a debate such as this and they scratch their heads
3353122 how can people seriously think they are going to have a positive impact on energy prices in the medium term or the long term if they are not really doing anything about either supply or demand
3353123 only if you think that not doing so almost immediately would result in an uninhabitable planet
3353124 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of that has got to change
3353125 gore backed his case for renewable electricity with logical case studies
3353126 a significant shift in where the u s gets its power in 2005 coal supplied slightly more than half the nations 3 7 billion kilowatt hours of electricity nuclear power accounted for 21 percent natural gas 15 percent and renewable sources including wind and solar about 8 6 percent
3353127 i am really honored by the suggestion that some have made that i consider taking a position of some kind in the next administration
3353128 i want to convey my respect for the idea even as i explain to you why i dont think thats the best idea
3353129 to focus on and try and enlarge the political space in which we address this climate crisis
3353130 to bring about a sea change in public opinion across party lines
3353131 remember america i gave you the internet and i can take it away
3353132 i found it interesting that over the weekend i heard a sound bite on the news from al gore where he was also using the figure of the equivalent of a dollar a gallon
3353133 both obama and mccain need to make their running mate choices very carefully because after all the influence that cheney and gore developed people are going to analyze their choices very carefully
3353134 we will never go back to the days when the vice presidency held little influence the national government is involved in too many things for a president not to have a strong partner standing at his side
3353135 even selecting himself as the running mate something that has never been done in history
3353136 theres something healthy in the vice presidency becoming a separate entity
3353137 in the next month one man either the democratic presidential nominee or the republican presidential nominee will choose the next vice president of the united states
3353138 their choice will be ratified by their party conventions and we the people will accept it but the idea that one person will select somebody who has a one in three chance of becoming president of the united states is to my mind very problematic
3353139 presidential candidates usually get vetted for a couple of years but the vice president just gets picked by one guy
3353140 its kind of weird process if you stop and think about it
3353141 it ought to be a more competitive process at the early stages
3353142 maybe people should run for vice president i dont know but we should be talking about it because the process now is fundamentally unhealthy it is not democratic for one man or woman to be able to pick the next president of the united states
3353143 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
3353144 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
3353145 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
3353146 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
3353147 i have never seen an opportunity for the country like the one thats emerging now
3353148 at the least the have a lot of hatred of anybody who is enjoying life
3353149 we are honored to welcome u s vice president gore one of the worlds most respected leaders to west coast green
3353150 addressing both the challenges and significant opportunities that humanity is facing requires significant innovation in technology business and building and we are extremely excited to hear mr gores timely exploration of the intersection of these industries
3353151 by facing and removing the danger of the climate crisis we have the opportunity to gain the moral authority and vision to vastly increase our own capacity to solve other crises that have been too long ignored we must ensure that entrepreneurs and inventors everywhere on the globe have the chance to change the world

3353202 for us it is just another challenge to see where we are and to see if we can compete and we are quite confident that we can burnley have some quality players and they have spent heavily but at the end of the day it is even players versus eleven players we will see and we are in pretty good shape

3353217 our tv program production and broadcasting capabilities need to evolve as our network expands so we strive to embrace new technologies that can help advance our services
3353218 we work with companies such as proxim wireless and smartway digital to ensure that we continue to deliver state of the art multimedia solutions to our audience and provide superior real time information broadcasting
3353219 this deployment was especially challenging because we needed to integrate different kinds of wireless networks as well as av compression with wimax
3353220 proxims end to end wireless product portfolio is ideal for such a deployment since the equipment provides end to end qos which is critical for voice and video and enables us to customize a network to meet the precise wireless needs of our customers with the confidence that the equipment will interact well throughout the network
3353221 proxim has a long history as an innovator in the wireless broadband market and was an early proponent of wimax technology this deployment illustrates the benefits of proxims end to end solution by providing a more cost effective and higher capacity solution than the previous satellite based system enabling the delivery of wireless iptv to more people
3353222 taiwan is a key growth area for us offering significant market opportunities for wimax as well as other technologies in our broadband wireless product portfolio

3353590 il senso del sacro ci avverte che ci sono cose che non possono essere toccate poich avere a che fare con esse significa aprire una porta nel mondo degli oggetti cos da rimanere nellio del signore la visione dissacrante del mondo annienta quel senso e rimuove inoltre la pi importante delle nostre proibizioni il sistema totalitario e il campo di sterminio che ne lespressione pi estrema rappresentano la convinzione che non c nulla di sacro in tale sistema la vita umana affossata e le idee di libert e di responsabilit idee senza le quali si disintegra completamente limmagine delluomo come soggetto morale non hanno alcun riconoscimento pubblico e alcun posto nel processo amministrativo
3353591 per diversi anni rimasi socialista anche dopo il mio ripudio del marxismo e se ci fosse stato qualcosa come un socialismo combinato con la libert individuale sarei ancora oggi un socialista e infatti non potrebbe esserci niente di meglio che vivere una vita modesta semplice e libera in una societ egualitaria mi ci volle un po di tempo per riconoscere che questo non era nientaltro che un sogno meraviglioso che la libert pi importante delluguaglianza che il tentativo di attuare luguaglianza di pregiudizio alla libert e che se va perduta la libert tra non liberi non c nemmeno uguaglianza

3353596 its perfectly normal that russia would want to defend the interests both of russians in russia and russophones outside russia
3353597 it is also normal for the international community to want to guarantee the integrity sovereignty and independence of georgia

3353607 il matrimonio e la famiglia sono radicati nel nucleo pi intimo della verit sulluomo e sul suo destino la differenza sessuale che connota il corpo delluomo e della donna non dunque un semplice dato biologico ma riveste un significato ben pi profondo esprime quella forma dellamore con cui luomo e la donna diventando una sola carne possono realizzare unautentica comunione di persone aperta alla trasmissione della vita e cooperano cos con dio alla generazione di nuovi esseri umani
3353608 non pu essere pertanto la chiesa a indicare quale ordinamento politico e sociale sia da preferirsi ma il popolo che deve decidere liberamente i modi migliori e pi adatti di organizzare la vita politica ogni intervento diretto della chiesa in tale campo sarebbe unindebita ingerenza daltra parte la sana laicit comporta che lo stato non consideri la religione come un semplice sentimento individuale che si potrebbe confinare al solo ambito privato al contrario la religione essendo anche organizzata in strutture visibili come avviene per la chiesa va riconosciuta come presenza comunitaria pubblica questo comporta inoltre che a ogni confessione religiosa purch non in contrasto con lordine morale e non pericolosa per lordine pubblico sia garantito il libero esercizio delle attivit di culto spirituali culturali educative e caritative della comunit dei credenti alla luce di queste considerazioni non certo espressione di laicit ma sua degenerazione in laicismo lostilit a ogni forma di rilevanza politica e culturale della religione alla presenza in particolare di ogni simbolo religioso nelle istituzioni pubbliche come pure non segno di sana laicit il rifiuto alla comunit cristiana e a coloro che legittimamente la rappresentano del diritto di pronunziarsi sui problemi morali che oggi interpellano la coscienza di tutti gli esseri umani in particolare dei legislatori e dei giuristi non si tratta infatti di indebita ingerenza della chiesa nellattivit legislativa propria ed esclusiva dello stato ma dellaffermazione e della difesa dei grandi valori che danno senso alla vita della persona e ne salvaguardano la dignit questi valori prima di essere cristiani sono umani tali perci da non lasciare indifferente e silenziosa la chiesa la quale ha il dovere di proclamare con fermezza la verit sulluomo e sul suo destino
3353609 viviamo in un periodo storico esaltante per i progressi che lumanit ha compiuto in molti campi del diritto della cultura della comunicazione della scienza e della tecnologia in questo stesso tempo per da parte di alcuni c il tentativo di escludere dio da ogni ambito della vita presentandolo come antagonista delluomo sta a noi cristiani mostrare che dio invece amore e vuole il bene e la felicit di tutti gli uomini e nostro compito far comprendere che la legge morale da lui dataci e che si manifesta a noi con la voce della coscienza ha lo scopo non di opprimerci ma di liberarci dal male e di renderci felici si tratta di mostrare che senza dio luomo perduto e che lesclusione della religione dalla vita sociale in particolare la marginalizzazione del cristianesimo mina le basi stesse della convivenza umana prima di essere di ordine sociale e politico queste basi infatti sono di ordine morale
3353610 il marxismo ha elevato lutopia a fine esplicito questo impone una critica approfondita dellideale utopico poich esso ha dalla sua i pi antichi sogni dellumanit e ora sembra trovare nella tecnica anche i mezzi per tradurre in pratica il sogno lutopismo un tempo innocuo diventato la tentazione pi pericolosa proprio perch idealistica per lumanit odierna allimmodestia dei suoi obiettivi che mancano il bersaglio sotto il profilo sia ecologico che antropologico com dimostrabile per luno e argomentabile filosoficamente per laltro il principio responsabilit contrappone il compito pi modesto dettato dalla paura e dal rispetto di preservare alluomo nella residua ambiguit della sua libert che nessun mutamento delle circostanze pu mai sopprimere lintegrit del suo mondo e del suo essere contro gli abusi del suo potere

3353639 but jarrett was not thinking in terms of historical retrenchment whether towards bill evans or even toward the founding fathers of the great american songbook he was searching for a sentimental approach to the past both jazzs and his own but he meant the term in sense not as mawkishness but as something akin to a renewal or revitalisation of the old from the distance of another time and community to jarrett the standards formed a sort of common tribal language if these three men couldnt remember them he felt the language itself would fall into oblivion like the language of bebop only a fraction of whose potential had been exploited before it was buried beneath an avalanche of comparatively limited commonplace phrases to live is to remain in memory
3353640 thats an interesting idea 18th or 19th century concept by friedrich the na ve versus the sentimental is what is important those who try very hard for a particular thing force themselves into it and forcing it to work is sentimental in the na ve something else breaks through primitive art we call na ve which doesnt mean that its simplistic true genius like a bach or a shakespeare is na ve though the works are the ultimate in construction theyre na ve because they come straight through to you and enter into you you take a shakespeare play and its there pointing at his chest it speaks to you directly whereas if you take a play by marlowe or someone else who is not such a great talent what you recognise is that the author is working to make it work you are conscious of layers of trying buried in the work the work stays here pointing to the head its a kind of extreme argument but its interesting

3353682 researchers have pinpointed a mechanism in the brains of mice that could explain why some human mothers become depressed following childbirth
3353683 if you want to maintain a constant level of inhibition with more neurosteroids you need fewer receptors
3353684 after pregnancy when hormone levels drop off you need more receptors to maintain that level if you cannot maintain that level after pregnancy thats when the disorders manifest
3353685 our thinking is that postpartum depression and maybe premenstrual syndrome and premenstrual dysphoric disorder may be due to impaired trafficking of these gaba receptors to the neural membrane

3353701 our primary concern is for the safety of road users
3353702 over the past 30 years since the main blackburn meadows power station was demolished the agency has carried out extensive strengthening works on the adjacent m1 tinsley viaduct
3353703 we are now content that the demolition of the remaining towers as planned poses a very low risk of damage to this important structure
3353704 nevertheless a rigorous programme of inspection and testing will ensure that reopening of the motorway will only take place when we are entirely satisfied that it is safe to do so

3353751 ik ben verbaasd over de mensen die zorg dragen voor zichzelf door voedsel te eten uit angst om dood te gaan maar zichzelf niet beschermen tegen zondes uit angst voor het vuur

3353770 er zijn twee dingen die absoluut niet verworpen worden door allah dua die tijdens de azan wordt gedaan en de dua die tijdens een oorlog wordt gedaan
3353771 laat ieder van jullie al zijn behoefte aan allah vragen zelfs om de veters van zijn schoenen
3353772 degene van wie de smeekbede niet wordt aanvaard krijgt toch in plaats van dat n beloning in plaats daarvan
3353773 de smeekbede tussen de azaan en de iqamah is aanvaardbaar verricht uw smeekbede dus daartussen
3353774 de smeekbede na het uitlezen van de koran is ten alle tijden aanvaardbaar
3353775 de smeekbede na het verplichte gebed van hem die zijn gebed naar behoren verricht wordt aanvaard
3353776 allah zal op de dag des oordeels de schande bedekken van degenen die de schande en naaktheid van zijn broeder bedekken
3353777 laat een ieder die af wil van zijn verdriet van zijn zorgen en wil dat zijn smeekbede wordt aanvaard anderen te hulp schieten die in nood verkeren
3353778 als onze harten droevig zijn en vervuld van verdriet weet dan dat je grootste rijkdom de smeekbede is want de toestand waarin je verkeert is een teken van goddelijke manifestatie van barmhartigheid ontvankelijkheid en aanvaarding
3353779 de profeet allahs zegen en vrede zij met hem heeft gezegd wie zijn heer gedenkt en wie dat niet doet zijn te vergelijken met een levende en een dode
3353780 de profeet allahs zegen en vrede zij met hem heeft gezegd kennis vergaren is een plicht voor elke moslim
3353781 de profeet allahs zegen en vrede zij met hem heeft gezegd wie zijn heer gedenkt en wie dat niet doet zijn te vergelijken met een levende en een dode
3353782 de profeet allahs zegen en vrede zij met hem heeft gezegd kennis vergaren is een plicht voor elke moslim
3353783 draag voor o mohammed wat aan jou in het boek geopenbaard is en onderhoud de salaat voorwaar de salaat weerhoudt van de gruweldaad en het verwerpelijke zeker het gedenken van allah is groter en allah weet wat jullie bedrijven
3353784 zeg o mohammed voorwaar het is mij bevolen om de heer van deze stad mekka te aanbidden die hij wijdde
3353785 het zijn zelfs duidelijke verzen in de harten van degenen aan wie de kennis is gegeven en niemand verwerpt onze verzen dan de onrechtvaardigen
3353786 en voorzeker wij hebben de quraan gemakkelijk gemaakt ter vermaning is er dan iemand die er lering uit trekt
3353787 de maand ramadan is het waarin de quraan is neergezonden als leiding voor de mensheid en als duidelijke bewijzen van de leiding en de foerqan
3353788 voorwaar wij hebben hem de quraan neergezonden in de waardevolle nacht lailatoel qadr
3353789 voorwaar wij hebben hem de quraan in de gezegende nacht neergezonden voorwaar wij zijn waarschuwers daarin worden alle wijze zaken uiteengezet
3353790 degene die een enkele letter leest van het boek van allah zal beloond worden met n hasana goede daad weet dat een goede daad tien keer vermenigvuldigd wordt ik zeg niet dat alif lam miem n letter is waarlijk alif is n letter lam is n letter en miem is n letter
3353791 en wie dood was en wie wij daarna tot leven brachten en voor wie wij een licht maakten waarmee hij onder de mensen rondgaat is hij te vergelijken met hem die in de duisternissen verkeert waar hij nimmer uit kan komen
3353792 en wij zonden dat van de quraan neer wat genezing en barmhartigheid voor de gelovigen is
3353793 en als wij hem als een quraan in een vreemde taal hadden geopenbaard dan hadden zij zeker gezegd waren zijn verzen maar duidelijk in onze taal uitgelegd
3353794 en wanneer jij de quraan voordraagt brengen wij tussen jou en degenen die niet in het hiernamaals geloven een verhinderende afscheiding aan
3353795 en wij hebben v r hen een hindernis geplaatst en achter hen een hindernis en wij hebben hun ogen bedekt zodat zij niet kunnen zien
3353796 degenen tegen wie de mensen zeggen voorwaar de mensen hebben zich tegen jullie verzameld vreest hen dus
3353797 en als jij de meeste van hen die op aarde zijn volgt dan zullen zij jou doen afdwalen van de weg van allah zij volgen slechts een vermoeden en zij vertellen slechts verzinsels
3353798 en de meeste van hen volgen niets dan een vermoeden voorwaar het onzekere heft de waarheid niet op
3353799 zij kennen het uiterlijke van het wereldse leven terwijl zij met betrekking tot het hiernamaals onachtzaam zijn
3353800 en dan gezamenlijk allahs vloek afroepen over hen die liegen
3353801 voorwaar de gelovigen zijn slechts degenen wiens harten sidderen wanneer allah genoemd wordt en wanneer zijn verzen aan hen worden voorgedragen hun geloof neemt dan toe en op hun heer hebben zij hun vertrouwen gesteld
3353802 dit is een gezegend boek dat wij aan jou hebben neergezonden opdat zij zijn verzen zullen overpeinzen en opdat de bezitters van verstand er lering uit trekken
3353803 denken zij niet na over het woord de quraan of is er iets tot hen gekomen dat niet eerder tot hun voorouders gekomen was
3353804 denken zij dan niet na over de quraan en wanneer die niet van bij allah geweest was dan zouden zij daarin veel tegenstrijdigs vinden
3353805 denken zij niet na over de quraan er zijn zelfs sloten op hun harten
3353806 is het voor degenen die geloven nog geen tijd dat hun harten zich vernederen voor het gedenken van allah en wat is geopenbaard van de waarheid de quraan en laten zij niet worden als degenen aan wie de schrift de taurat voorheen was gegeven toen werd de tijd voor hen te lang zodat hun harten verharden en de meeste van hen zijn zwaar zondigen
3353807 de profeet allahs zegen en vrede zij met hem heeft gezegd wie zijn heer gedenkt en wie dat niet doet zijn te vergelijken met een levende en een dode
3353808 de profeet allahs zegen en vrede zij met hem heeft gezegd kennis vergaren is een plicht voor elke moslim
3353809 toen ik opsteeg naar de hemel rook ik een aangename geur die ik nooit eerder geroken had ik vroeg toen jibriel wat is dat voor een geur
3353810 dat is de geur van de kamster van de dochter van fir3awn en haar 4 kinderen
3353811 de profeet allahs zegen en vrede zij met hem heeft gezegd wie zijn heer gedenkt en wie dat niet doet zijn te vergelijken met een levende en een dode
3353812 de profeet allahs zegen en vrede zij met hem heeft gezegd kennis vergaren is een plicht voor elke moslim
3353813 hij allah schiep de dood en het leven voor u om u te beproeven
3353814 iemand die een dode wast en zijn of haar onplezierige kenmerken geheim houdt wordt door allah veertigvoudig vergeven
3353815 en bid voor hen uw gebed betekent zeer zeker rust voor hen
3353816 o allah laat diegenen van ons die door u in leven gehouden worden in de islam leven en laat diegenen die door u het leven ontnomen worden sterven in het geloof
3353817 allah schenkt het paradijs aan iedere dode achter wie zich drie rijen voor het gebed vormen
3353818 o gij die maar eet wat gij wilt en dan de medicijnen en de dokters vervloekt gij kunt slechts oogsten wat gij gezaaid hebt bereid uzelf voor op de ziekte die u zult krijgen
3353819 het leven wordt zoeter voor u als u een wijze man ontmoet en slechts diegenen die goed onderwezen zijn herkennen de uitmuntendheid van de kennis
3353820 de profeet allahs zegen en vrede zij met hem heeft gezegd wie zijn heer gedenkt en wie dat niet doet zijn te vergelijken met een levende en een dode
3353821 de profeet allahs zegen en vrede zij met hem heeft gezegd kennis vergaren is een plicht voor elke moslim
3353822 diegene die in de islaam een goede weg doet leven die zal hervoor beloning hebben en de beloning van degenen die hiermee te werk gaan tot de dag van de opstanding
3353823 dat niemand van jullie het namiddaggebed verricht dan in banie qoeraydhzah
3353824 en herinnert jullie dat in jullie huizen wordt voorgedragen van de verzen van allah en van de wijsheid van de soennah
3353825 en die hen het boek de quraan en de wijsheid van de soennah onderwijst
3353826 de wijsheid is de soennah van de boodschapper van allah 3alahi salaatoe wa salaam
3353827 en datgene de boodschapper jullie geeft en neemt het en datgene hij jullie verbiedt onthoud jullie daarvan
3353828 hij beveelt heb het goede aan en verbiedt hen het slechte hij staat hen de goede zaken toe en verbiedt hen het slechte
3353829 en gehoorzaamt allah en de boodschapper hopelijk zullen jullie begenadigd worden
3353830 de boodschapper van allah had zich van een ring van goud voorzien waarop de mensen zich ook van een ring van goud voorzagen vervolgens gooide de boodschapper van allah deze ring van goud weg waarop zij deze ring van goud ook weggooiden
3353831 hoe zal je oordelen wanneer er een zaak tot je komt
3353832 en wanneer je dit niet vindt in het boek van allah
3353833 ik heb jullie twee zaken nagelaten en jullie zullen niet dwalen zolang jullie hieraan vasthouden het boek van allah en mijn soennah
3353834 wanneer een zaak tot je komt oordeel van met het boek van allah en wanneer iets tot je komt dat niet zich niet in het boek van allah bevindt oordeel dan met dagtene er zich in de soennah van de boodschapper 3alayhi salaatoe wa salaam bevindt
3353835 de profeet allahs zegen en vrede zij met hem heeft gezegd wie zijn heer gedenkt en wie dat niet doet zijn te vergelijken met een levende en een dode
3353836 de profeet allahs zegen en vrede zij met hem heeft gezegd kennis vergaren is een plicht voor elke moslim
3353837 strijd tegen de polytheisten met jullie geld zielen en tongen
3353838 de profeet allahs zegen en vrede zij met hem heeft gezegd wie zijn heer gedenkt en wie dat niet doet zijn te vergelijken met een levende en een dode
3353839 de profeet allahs zegen en vrede zij met hem heeft gezegd kennis vergaren is een plicht voor elke moslim
3353840 en houdt jullie allen stevig vast aan het touw van allah en weest niet verdeeld
3353841 de kinderen van israa iel waren verdeeld in 72 stromingen en mijn volk zal zich verdelen in 73 stromingen al deze stromingen gaan naar het hellevuur behalve 1 degenen die volgen wat ik en mijn metgezellen volgen
3353842 er zal een groep van mijn volk zichtbaar met de waarheid strijden zij zijn degenen met kennis
3353843 de profeet allahs zegen en vrede zij met hem heeft gezegd wie zijn heer gedenkt en wie dat niet doet zijn te vergelijken met een levende en een dode
3353844 de profeet allahs zegen en vrede zij met hem heeft gezegd kennis vergaren is een plicht voor elke moslim
3353845 de profeet allahs zegen en vrede zij met hem heeft gezegd wie zijn heer gedenkt en wie dat niet doet zijn te vergelijken met een levende en een dode
3353846 de profeet allahs zegen en vrede zij met hem heeft gezegd kennis vergaren is een plicht voor elke moslim
3353847 mijn dienaar komt dichter tot mij door het verrichten van vrijwillige daden totdat ik van hem houdt
3353848 de profeet allahs zegen en vrede zij met hem heeft gezegd wie zijn heer gedenkt en wie dat niet doet zijn te vergelijken met een levende en een dode
3353849 de profeet allahs zegen en vrede zij met hem heeft gezegd kennis vergaren is een plicht voor elke moslim
3353850 liefdadigheid is dagelijks nodig of vereist voor elk deel van je lichaam elke heilig is allah is een liefdadigheid elke alle lof is voor allah is een liefdadigheid elke laa illaha ilallah er is geen god dan allah is een liefdadigheid elke allaahoe akbar allah is de grootste is een liefdadigheid het goede bevelen is een liefdadigheid het slechte verdelgen is een liefdadigheid wat voldoende is voor dat als een liefdadigheid zijn de twee rakaat van doha
3353851 er zijn er 360 gewrichten in een mens en men moet voor elk een liefdadigheid verrichten
3353852 men kan het slijm of viezigheid dat men vindt in de moskee bedekken of iets schadelijks van de straat verwijderen als men dit niet kan doen kan hij twee rakaat van doha bidden en dat zal voldoende voor hem zijn
3353853 deze twee ahadieth wijzen op de grootsheid voortreffelijkheid en belang van het doha gebed die de wettigheid benadrukken dat de twee rakaaat voldoende zijn voor 360 liefdadigheden zoiets als dit het doha gebed zou met regelmaat en vasthoudendheid uitgevoerd moeten worden de hadieth bevestigt ook het belang van het zeggen van en en laa illaha ilallah en het belang van het goede bevelen het slechte verdelgen verwijderen van speeksel verwijderen van dat wat schadelijk is van de weg en zulke andere handelingen die de nodige dagelijkse liefdadigheden vervullen
3353854 zoon van adam bid vier rakaat voor mij in de vroege dag en het zal voldoende voor jou zijn voor het latere deel van de dag
3353855 de boodschapper van allah zond een expeditie en zij verkregen veel buit en keerde snel terug
3353856 zal ik jullie niet leiden naar een nabijere overwinning een grotere buit en een snellere terugkeer iedereen die woedoe e verricht en dan naar de moskee gaat om de doha te bidden dat is een nabijere overwinning een betere buit en een snellere terugkeer
3353857 mijn vriend de boodschapper van allah adviseerde mij om drie dingen te doen en ik zal ze niet in de steek laten tot ik sterf 1 drie dagen per maan maand vasten 2 het doha gebed bidden en 3 voor het slapen het witr gebed bidden
3353858 niemand van de metgezellen of volgelingen zijn bekend die het begrenst hebben tot twaalf rakaaat
3353859 ja sommige baden twee rakaaat en sommige baden vier rakaaat en sommige baden tot de helft van de vroege dag om was
3353860 de profeet bad vier rakaaat voor de doha en voegde er aan toe wat allah wilde
3353861 de boodschapper van allah ging naar de mensen van qoebaa e en zij waren de doha aan het uitvoeren
3353862 het gebed van vroomheid moet worden uitgevoerd wanneer de jonge gespeende kamelen de hitte van de zon voelen
3353863 de profeet allahs zegen en vrede zij met hem heeft gezegd wie zijn heer gedenkt en wie dat niet doet zijn te vergelijken met een levende en een dode
3353864 de profeet allahs zegen en vrede zij met hem heeft gezegd kennis vergaren is een plicht voor elke moslim
3353865 de sleutels tot het leven van het hart zijn het nadenken over de qor aan en in stilte onderdanig zijn aan allah en zonden nalaten
3353866 een boek dat wij op jullie neer hebben gezonden vol met zegeningen dat hij die nadenkt over zijn verzen en dat hij die begrijpt er aandacht aan schenkt
3353867 wie ook maar mijn leiding volgt zal niet op een dwaalspoor terechtkomen noch zal hij in leed en ellende vervallen
3353868 de beste van jullie is degene die de qor aan leert en het dan onderwijst
3353869 en wanneer zijn verzen aan hen voorgedragen worden wordt hun geloof vergroot
3353870 denken ze niet na over de qor aan of zitten er sloten op hun harten
3353871 en wanneer mijn slaaf u vraagt o mohammed mij aangaande dan ben ik weliswaar dichtbij ik antwoord de aanroeping van de smekeling als hij om mij vraagt zonder een bemiddelaar dus laat hem mij gehoorzamen en in mij geloven zodat zij op de juiste weg kunnen worden geleid
3353872 indien de dienaar een zonde pleegt verschijnt er een zwarte plek op zijn hart en als hij dan naar vergiffenis zoekt wordt deze plek verwijderd en indien hij dan wederkeert naar deze zonde zal de plek wederkeren en groeien tot zijn hele hart zwart wordt allah heeft gezegd
3353873 neen hun harten zijn bedekt met de zonden raan die zij zelf maakten
3353874 de profeet allahs zegen en vrede zij met hem heeft gezegd wie zijn heer gedenkt en wie dat niet doet zijn te vergelijken met een levende en een dode
3353875 de profeet allahs zegen en vrede zij met hem heeft gezegd kennis vergaren is een plicht voor elke moslim
3353876 o kinderen van adam draagt jullie mooie kleding bij elke salaat en eet en drinkt en overdrijft niet voorwaar hij houdt niet van de buitensporigen
3353877 en wees niet verkwistend voorwaar de verkwisters zijn broeders van de shaytaan en de shaytaan is ondankbaar jegens zijn heer
3353878 en degenen die wanneer zij besteden niet overdrijven en niet gierig zijn maar het midden daar tussen houden
3353879 eet en drink en kleed je zoals je wilt zolang je deze twee eigenschappen niet bezit buitensporigheid en pronken
3353880 o kinderen van adam voorzeker wij hebben voor jullie kleding neergezonden om jullie schaamte te bedekken en versierselen en het kleed van het vrezen van allah dat is het beste dat zijn een aantal van allahs tekenen hopelijk laten zij zich vermanen
3353881 allah kijkt niet naar de uiterlijke verschijning of rijkdom van jullie maar hij kijkt naar jullie harten en daden
3353882 voorwaar de meest edele van jullie is bij allah degene die het meest allah vreest
3353883 de profeet allahs zegen en vrede zij met hem heeft gezegd wie zijn heer gedenkt en wie dat niet doet zijn te vergelijken met een levende en een dode
3353884 de profeet allahs zegen en vrede zij met hem heeft gezegd kennis vergaren is een plicht voor elke moslim
3353885 de profeet allahs zegen en vrede zij met hem heeft gezegd wie zijn heer gedenkt en wie dat niet doet zijn te vergelijken met een levende en een dode
3353886 de profeet allahs zegen en vrede zij met hem heeft gezegd kennis vergaren is een plicht voor elke moslim
3353887 ik ben een jonge vrouw ik leefde een gelukkig leven al was het on islaamitisch toen ik trouwde werd ik meer religieus alhamdulillaah maar sindsdien zijn mijn problemen begonnen ik denk altijd binnen in mezelf dat ik niet zo erg was in mijn leven voor mijn huwelijk en ik heb niet zoveel zonden begaan dus waarom gebeurt dit allemaal met mij en wat is de oplossing
3353888 alhamdulillaah en vrede en zegeningen zijn op rasuulullaah die zei
3353889 allaah geeft wereldse voorzieningen aan degenen van wie hij houdt en degenen van wie hij niet houdt maar hij geeft dien alleen aan degenen waarvan hij houdt dus degene aan wie religie wordt gegeven die er naar leeft en het begrijpt allaah houdt van hem
3353890 hoe wonderlijk is de zaak van de gelovigen want zijn zaken zijn allemaal goed en dit geldt voor niemand behalve voor de gelovige wanneer hem iets goeds overkomt is hij er dankbaar voor en dat is goed voor hem wanneer hem iets slechts overkomt draagt hij het met geduld en dat is goed voor hem
3353891 de mensen die het meest beproefd werden zijn de profeten
3353892 voorwaar tegenspoed heeft mij getroffen en u bent de barmhartigste der barmhartigen wees zeker dat je een antwoord zult krijgen en heb niet teveel haast want allaah is meer genadevol ten opzichte van zijn dienaar dan een moeder ten opzichte van haar kind met gehaast zijn wordt bedoeld dat je gelijk wilt zien dat je duaa verhoord wordt terwijl de hadith zegt dat het ook een tijd kan duren voordat je het antwoord op je duaa ziet of misschien bewaart allaah het voor jouw aakhirah streef ernaar om jezelf met dhikr te beschermen zoals deze beschreven is in de sharieah iets anders dat jou zal helpen om geduldig te zijn is de seerah biografie van de profeet te lezen en de beproevingen en moeilijkheden die hij moest doorstaan je moet ook de beloningen overdenken van degenen die in deze wereld geduldig zijn en een van de meest bruikbare boeken hierover is uddat al saabireen van ibn al qayyeem
3353893 ik probeerde een collega van mij te laten geloven in god en islaam hij zei dat zijn ergste barriere om te geloven in het bestaan van god de vraag was waarom onschuldige kinderen op aarde pijn lijden en hij kon niet begrijpen waarom als er een god bestond hij dit kon laten gebeuren
3353894 alle mensen moeten weten dat allaah alwijs is en dat er een grote wijsheid achter zijn bevelen en besluiten is
3353895 denk aan de wijsheid van allaah om kinderen veel te laten huilen en wat voor voordelen dat aan hun geeft de dokters en wetenschappers hebben de voordelen ervan bewezen zij zeiden er is een vocht in de hersenen van kinderen welke wanneer het in hun hersenen zou blijven grote schade zou aanrichten dus huilen brengt die stof naar buiten en laat het uit de hersenen wegstromen wat hen sterker en gezonder maakt bovendien zorgen schreeuwen en huilen ervoor dat de luchtpijpen en de aderen wijder en sterker worden en maakt het de zenuwen sterker als dit de wijsheid achter huilen is en de wijsheid hierachter is nog nooit in je hoofd opgekomen geldt hetzelfde voor het overige lijden van kinderen en de oorzaak ervan en de goede gevolgen er is een enorme wijsheid welke verborgen kan zijn voor vele mensen en waar zij over in de war zijn
3353896 deze pijnen zijn een van de menselijke kenmerken van iemands ontwikkeling waar geen mens of dier voor kan worden gespaard
3353897 ik ben een jonge man die moe van het leven is ik ben er uitgeput van is er iemand die kan helpen er is niemand die kan helpen behalve allaah
3353898 er zijn vele redenen om deze wereld te haten er zijn sommige mensen die niet van deze wereld houden en verlangen naar dat wat bij allaah is aan beloningen en die ernaar verlangen om allaah te ontmoeten
3353899 waarom belast allaah de gelovigen die veel goede daden van aanbidding verrichten met ziekten en andere beproevingen terwijl de zondaren van al het goede in dit leven genieten
3353900 deze vraag kan op twee manieren worden gesteld of als bezwaar of als een zoektocht naar begrip als het een bezwaar is laat dit de onwetendheid van de vrager zien want de wijsheid van allaah is te groot voor ons verstand om te begrijpen allaah zegt in soerah al isra 17 85
3353901 de ziel behoort tot de zaken van mijn heer en de kennis erover wordt jullie niet gegeven behalve een weinig
3353902 de zoetheid van de beloning laat mij de bitterheid van het dragen ervan vergeten
3353903 deze wereld is als een gevangenis voor een gelovige en als een paradijs voor de kaafir
3353904 waarom hebben jullie dan vroeger de profeten van allaah gedood als jullie gelovigen zijn
3353905 o mijn volk waarom kwetsen jullie mij terwijl jullie waarlijk weten dat ik voor jullie de boodschapper van allaah ben
3353906 een oor dat goed is voor jullie hij gelooft in allaah en hij gelooft de gelovigen en hij is een genade voor degenen onder jullie die geloven
3353907 aan niemand is een beter en meer omvattend geschenk gegeven dan geduld
3353908 wanneer je allaahs wijsheid overdenkt in datgene waarmee hij zijn dienaren test waarmee hij hen de hoogste doelen laat bereiken en de hoogste posities welke zij zonder deze testen niet zouden hebben bereikt zul je ontdekken dat al deze testen in feite een soort van respect zijn want al lijken zij beproevingen en testen in wezen zijn zij rahmah en zegeningen hoeveel grote zegeningen van allaah zijn het directe gevolg van testen en beproevingen
3353909 als je je bewust bent van allaah zijn bevelen en verboden zal hij zich bewust zijn van jou en als je je bewust bent van allaah zul je hem voor je vinden als je iets vraagt vraag het dan aan hem en als je hulp zoekt zoek het dan bij hem weet dat als alle mensen samen zouden komen om iets in jouw voordeel te doen dan kunnen zij jou alleen van voordeel zijn met wat allaah voor jou heeft voorbeschikt heeft en wanneer ze allemaal samen zouden komen om je kwaad te doen kunnen ze je alleen kwaad doen met wat allaah voor jou bepaald heeft de pennen zijn opgelicht en de bladzijden zijn opgedroogd
3353910 de profeten zijn degenen die het meeste lijden dan de saalihien dan de besten na hen en dan de besten na hen men wordt getroffen in overeenstemming met zijn dien geloof als de dien sterk is is de beproeving zwaar als de dien zwak is is de beproeving licht
3353911 degene die eeuwigdurende vrede en geluk wenst zonder problemen begrijpt niets van allaahs bevelen en heeft ook geen idee wat onderwerping aan allaah betekent elke ziel gelovig of ongelovig zal onvermijdelijk in deze wereld ervaren wat het is om te lijden want dit leven is gebaseerd op moeilijkheden
3353912 o rasuulullaah waarom roep je allaah niet aan om ons te helpen waarom verricht je geen smeekbede tot allaah voor ons
3353913 hebben jullie tegen hem gevochten en wat was de uitkomst van deze gevechten
3353914 de vergelijking van de gelovige is die met een verse en vochtige plant de wind blaast het alle kanten op en zo is de gelovige hij blijft steeds onderworpen aan moeilijkheden en de vergelijking van iemand die geen geloof heeft is die met een sterke cederboom wanneer een harde wind hem raakt ontwortelt hij
3353915 hoe wonderbaarlijk is de situatie van een gelovige in alles is er voordeel voor hem wanneer hem iets goeds overkomt is hij dankbaar en dat is het beste voor hem en wanneer hij door moeilijkheden wordt getroffen blijft hij standvastig en heeft geduld en dit is het beste voor hem
3353916 wanneer alllaah het goede voor een van zijn dienaren wenst vervroegt hij zijn straf in dit leven en wanneer hij vergelding voor een van zijn dienaren wenst bewaart hij zijn zonden zodat hij hem daarmee op de dag der opstanding kan beoordelen
3353917 moeilijkheden blijven de gelovige man en vrouw overkomen met betrekking tot hun lichaam familie en bezittingen totdat ze allaah zonder zonden ontmoeten
3353918 een muslim wordt niet getroffen door moeilijkheden verdriet pijn of zorgen zelfs al wordt hij alleen maar door een doorn geprikt zonder dat allaah hem zijn zonden daardoor kwijt scheldt
3353919 een aandoening word verergerd voor de rechtschapenen wanneer een gelovige getroffen wordt door moeilijkheden of het nu een doorn is of meer wordt een zonde daardoor van hem weggenomen en wordt een zonde daardoor van hem weggenomen en wordt hij een rang verheven in de jennah
3353920 de grootte van de beloning is in overeenstemming met de mate van lijden
3353921 wallaahi ik heb een idee dat nog niemand van jullie heeft genoemd en ik zie geen betere dan dit kies uit ieder stam een sterke sociaal verheven jonge man en geef ieder van hen een scherp zwaard dan vallen ze tegelijk muhammad met hun zwaarden aan en doden hem zij wordt zijn bloed door alle stammen vergoten zodoende zal zijn stam banu haashim zich realiseren dat zij geen oorlog kunnen gaan voeren tegen alle stammen van de quraysh en moeten zij wel bloedgeld betalen dan hebben wij onszelf comfort gegeven en hem gestopt om ons te storen
3353922 ik wou dat ik hiervoor was gestorven en vergeten was en uit het zicht
3353923 hoe kan ik niet verdrietig zijn terwijl jij bij me bent en ik geen man heb noch ben ik iemands dienstvrouw wat voor excuus heb ik bij de mensen wee mij was ik maar gestorven voordat dit gebeurde en een vergeten ding geweest en onbekend
3353924 haar mensen gingen naar haar op zoek zij was van een familie dat gezegend was met profeetschap en adelheid hoe dan ook konden zij geen enkel spoor van haar vinden zij kwamen langs een koeieherder en zij vroegen hem
3353925 heb je een meisje gezien wiens beschrijving zo en zo is
3353926 nee maar vanacht zag ik mijn koeien iets doen wat ik ze nooit eerder zag doen
3353927 vannacht zag ik hen buigen in de richting van die vallei
3353928 zij drijft zo erg de spot met ons dat zij ons zelfs beveelt om tegen dit kind te praten dat is nog erger dan haar overspel
3353929 jullie zijn slechts mensen zoals wij en de erbarmer heeft niets neergezonden jullie doen niets anders dan liegen
3353930 yaa abati laa o mijn vader aanbid de shaytaan niet
3353931 scheld jij mijn goden uit yaa ibraahiem ik zal jou straffen vervloeken en uitschelden
3353932 yuusuf nabieyyullaah ibnu yaqub nabieyyullaah abni ishaaq nabiyyullaah abni ibraahiem khalielullaah
3353933 yuusuf de profeet van allaah de zoon van yaqub de profeet van allaah de zoon van de profeet ishaaq de zoon van de vriend van allaah
3353934 waarlijk al kariema abnal kariemi abnal kariemi abnil kariemi yuusuf abna yaqub abni ishaaq abni ibraahiem
3353935 waarlijk de nobele is de zoon van de nobele is de zoon van de nobele die de zoon van de nobele is
3353936 toen ibraahiem met de rituelen begon verscheen de shaytaan bij hem deed hij een wedstrijd met ibraahiem maar ibraahiem was er het eerste

3353951 with regards to firing projectiles i think those who were behind it are traitors because all palestinian factions agreed to the ceasefire and those who did that have contacts with israel who wants to use that as a pretext to exert pressure on the palestinian people
3353952 the israelis want to combine this issue with the prisoners swap and we refused that from the beginning however the israelis are trying to maintain this policy and that is serious because once it continues people might be pushed out of the ceasefire agreement

3353975 there is no way the justice department can claim ignorance over ocpas rules which have been well known in government for years
3353976 the judicial appointments board currently operates on an administrative basis and is therefore not subject to ocpas regulations however the selection panel included an ocpas assessor and followed good recruitment practice in making the recommendations for appointment
3353977 we were not contacted by scottish government to assign an ocpas assessor to this appointments round as these are not regulated appointments at the current time we would not have in any case been able to provide an ocpas assessor to oversee the round the relevant scottish government sponsor team for appointments to this body will have entered into a private agreement with the individual anja amsel who oversaw the round
3353978 however the selection panel included an ocpas assessor acting in an independent capacity and followed good recruitment practice in making the recommendations for appointment
3353979 ocpas have written to the relevant sponsor team this afternoon asking for a second change to the press release such that reference to ocpas is removed
3353980 mr macaskill and the justice department seem to have felt that dragging ocpas into the appointments to the judicial appointments board would be advantageous to the government weakening the independence of ocpas and any possibility of a further investigation by anyone into mr mcallister amp lady smiths appointment to the judicial appointment board
3353981 ocpas has discussed the press release with the relevant scottish government sponsor team and explained our expectation that no reference should be made to the use of ocpas assessors oas unless they are working in that capacity oas may only work in that capacity on appointment rounds regulated by the commissioner as advised previously appointments to jabs are not currently regulated by the commissioner
3353982 the commissioner has already changed ocpas policy on the type of work that ocpas assessors may do such that in future no acting ocpas assessor may work as an independent assessor on unregulated appointments rounds revised service level agreements have been issued to all oas to reflect that change in policy
3353983 anja amsel and one other assessor who are working notice on the old service level agreements which allowed this practice are ceasing to work for ocpas this year
3353984 god is most glorified in us when we are most satisfied in him

3353990 so does that mean people become flip flopped in their belief before and after the movie which again means that perhaps they are not quite sure about it

3353992 do you think youll be scared at your late years
3353993 its just that they never take a shower or use deodorant
3353994 i find it strange that you consider all indians and sri lankans to be mobile health hazards and yet you keep running off to the airport every time one of the bollywood movie stars or tv stars come to maldives i think i would have to add hypocrite to your growing list of vices
3353995 forgive me if i disagree with you on that point as far as acting is concerned but the fact remains he is indian and as far as your personal universe is concerned he fits the bill of being a stinker
3353996 when i say indians i am referring to those indians you generally find in maldives working in houses and those kuni ukaa meehun
3353997 and these other indians the ones you adore on tv and movie screens they are an entirely different breed despite being the same nationality
3353998 exactly so shah rukh khan salman john and the others arent really real indians you know what i am saying
3353999 youre saying that a real indian will stink to the high heavens

3354063 o mijn vader ik zag elf sterren en de zon en de maan in mijn droom ik zag ze voor mij buigen
3354064 o mijn zoon vertel jouw droom niet aan je broers anders zullen zij tegen jou een plan beramen voorwaar de shaitan is voor de mens een duidelijke vijand
3354065 yoesef en zijn broer benjamin zijn geliefder bij onze vader dan wij terwijl wij een hechte groep zijn voorwaar onze vader verkeert zeker in een duidelijke dwaling
3354066 o onze vader waarom vertrouwt u yoesef niet aan ons toe voorwaar wij hebben het beste met hem voor laat hem morgen met ons mee gaan zodat hij zich kan vermaken en spelen wij zullen op hem passen
3354067 ik vrees dat de wolf hem zal opeten terwijl jullie niet opletten
3354068 onze vader wij hielden een wedstrijd en lieten yoesef met onze spullen achter en de wolf verslond hem maar u zult ons toch niet geloven ook al spreken wij de waarheid
3354069 jullie hebben voor jezelf iets moois verzonnen daarom is geduld passend en allah is het die om hulp wordt gevraagd bij wat jullie beschrijven
3354070 en wij openbaarden aan hem jij zult hen zeker inlichten over die zaak van hun wat zij hadden gedaan terwijl zij het niet beseffen

3354075 dat is wat mijn heer mij heeft geleerd het uitleggen van dromen ik heb de godsdienst afgezworen van een volk dat niet in allah gelooft en van de ongelovigen in het hiernamaals zijn
3354076 o mijn twee medegevangen zijn verschillende heren beter of allah de ene de onweerstaanbare wat jullie naast hem aanbidden zijn slechts namen die jullie en jullie vaderen hebben gegeven allah heeft hiervoor geen gezag gegeven het oordeel is slechts aan allah hij heeft jullie bevolen niemand anders dan hem te aanbidden dat is de ware godsdienst maar de meeste mensen weten het niet

3354106 you can be grumpy in your 30s you can be in the sisterhood
3354107 you can be just beginning to get on your high horse but it is a gradual sort of build up of being really grumpy until you get into your 60s 70s and 80s
3354108 full membership comes when you write your first letter to the council thats when you know when you take the time to put pen to paper and post a letter thats more than making a phone call
3354109 by that time you have dabbled in emails left a hoity toity voice mail message but when you have graduated to hard copy letters you know you are a grumpy old woman
3354110 then you become an elder of the sisterhood when you have a walking stick that you dont actually need and you carry it just to hit people in the ankles
3354111 we have got the hardcore who are still grumpy like jenny eclair and we have also had a new intake for season three sheila ferguson so we are not going to run out of grumps
3354112 i think we are getting better at letting it all out which is good and this series has more of the same passionate outbursts that we had in the first two seasons
3354113 one of the things i really wanted to touch on was the whole thing about being liberated but being busier than ever
3354114 i am so much busier than my mother ever was i feel like i am running some pathetic mission control i have got this massive air traffic controller job that is completely unpaid and i work as well
3354115 i look back on my mother and she probably didnt have a particularly interesting job but she never seemed to be as busy as i am
3354116 and theres more about empty nesters in this series than there was in the previous two seasons empty nesters and shopping with teenagers
3354117 we also do a lot on gardening which seems to be a hobby for when you get older but you have to be careful because gardening can just turn into housework that you do outside
3354118 we have done stuff about men in the past and there is a sequence in this series about men not being able to find something they need a grid reference to know exactly where to find something
3354119 but we have some people on this show who are honest about what gets up their nose so we dont have any trouble finding things to talk about

3354261 o boodschapper van allah swt de geboden van de islaam zijn mij te veel geworden vertel mij over iets waaraan ik mij vast kan klampen
3354262 laat je tong onophoudelijk bezig zijn met het gedenken van allah
3354263 eenieder die n letter leest uit het boek van allah zal n hasana ontvangen en n hasana komt met 10 gelijken ik zeg niet dat alif laam miem een letter is voorwaar alif is een letter en laam is een letter en miem is een letter
3354264 de boodschapper van allah saws kwam naar buiten terwijl wij in assoeffah zaten en zei
3354265 gaat niemand van jullie dan naar de moskee om 2 verzen te lezen of te bestuderen uit het boek van allah de almachtige dit is beter voor hem dan twee kamelen die hij zou halen en drie verzen zijn beter dan 3 kamelen en vier verzen zijn beter dan vier kamelen hetzelfde geldt voor een gelijke hoeveelheid kamelen
3354266 eenieder die plaats neemt in een zitting en de naam van allah niet gedenkt zal het een oorzaak van spijt vinden degene die ergens plaats neemt om te slapen en niet de naam van allah gedenkt voor het opstaan allah zal het hem laten betreuren

3354271 we have not journeyed all this way across the centuries across the oceans across the mountains across the prairies because we are made of sugar candy
3354272 israel should be proud of its military which trained georgian soldiers
3354273 we killed 60 russian soldiers just yesterday the russians have lost more than 50 tanks and we have shot down 11 of their planes they have sustained enormous damage in terms of manpower
3354274 the question is whether there should be a temporary suspension of arms exports to georgia during the war with russia
3354275 the defense ministry has been conducting a very wise policy
3354276 it has taken all factors into account defensive systems have been sent and they have not upset the strategic balance

3354281 it was cecilias idea to apply the technology to wine
3354282 when she spoke with people in the industry they would tell her they needed a quick way to determine the components of a wine without having to send it off to a lab
3354283 it should even be able to identify say a chardonnay regardless of whether it was grown in france or california
3354284 you could use it to verify that a wine was made from the proper grapes
3354285 for example there are only five authorized grapes for a rioja but lots of winemakers sneak in cabernet anyway this could help enforce the standards
3354286 this is a way for them to verify a vintage
3354287 wine is one of the most complex chemical substances out there and no human palate can quantify its makeup objectively this kind of electronic device can
3354288 the human palate is unable to detect that a wine is say 20 merlot a device with a full range would be an awesome tool for explaining the mystery of what goes into a wine
3354289 this kind of device is purely technical its the human palate that determines whether a wine is worth drinking
3354290 its hard to believe any computer can interpret the nuances of smell and taste as well as a humans olfactory gland
3354291 de profeet allahs zegen en vrede zij met hem heeft gezegd wie zijn heer gedenkt en wie dat niet doet zijn te vergelijken met een levende en een dode

3354297 de hel is omringd met lusten en het paradijs is omringd met zaken die de mens niet gemakkelijk afgaan
3354298 laat het niet zo zijn dat de dag dat je vast en de dag dat je niet vast gelijk zijn
3354299 o jongemannen degene onder jullie die het zich kan veroorloven om te trouwen laat hem dit doen want het is effectiever in het neerslaan van de blikken en het beschermen van de kuisheid wie dat niet kan doen laat hem vasten want het zal een schild voor hem zijn
3354300 bij allah ik heb in de laatste twintig jaar geen woord gezegd iets met mijn handen gepakt of mijzelf voorgenomen om iets te pakken of een stap voorwaarts danwel achterwaarts gezet of enige andere actie ondernomen voordat ik mij bedacht zou allah deze daad liefhebben zal hij tevreden zijn met deze actie
3354301 alle daden van de zoon van adam de mens zijn voor hem behalve het vasten dat is voor mij en ik geef er beloning voor
3354302 waarom huil je is dit vanwege jouw angst voor allah
3354303 uit oprechtheid van geloof en in de hoop verdiensten te krijgen
3354304 daawoed ibn abie hind heeft 40 jaar gevast terwijl niemand van zijn familie dit wist en hij was klerenmaker hij nam zijn lunch mee als hij bij hen wegging en gaf deze als liefdadigheid uit op weg naar zijn werk en als hij terugkeerde in de avond dan verbrak hij zijn vasten bij hen
3354305 wie leugens en vulgaire taal en het handelen ernaar niet laat hoeft van allah ook zijn eten en drinken niet te laten
3354306 ik ben slechts gestuurd om de goede manieren te vervolmaken
3354307 de maand ramadaan is het waarin de qor aan is neergezonden als leiding voor de mensheid en als duidelijke bewijzen van leiding en foerqaan
3354308 ik reciteer voor jou en op jou is het de qor aan geopenbaard
3354309 ik reciteerde soerat an nisaa e totdat ik aankwam bij
3354310 en hoe dan indien wij uit iedere gemeenschap een getuige een profeet naar voren brengen en wij jou o mohammed als getuige tegen diegenen van jouw gemeenschap die zondigden naar voren brengen
3354311 zijn jullie verbaasd over deze qor aan en lachten jullie en huilen jullie niet
3354312 degene die uit vrees voor allah huilt zal het hellevuur niet betreden
3354313 op de dag waarop de mensen voor de heer der werelden staan
3354314 u alleen aanbidden wij en u alleen vragen wij om hulp
3354315 hij die uit oprechtheid van geloof gedurende de gehele maand ramadaan vrijwillige nachtgebeden onderhoudt in de hoop verdienste te verkrijgen zal zijn begane zonden vergeven worden
3354316 en de dienaren van de erbarmer zijn degenen die bescheiden op aarde rondgaan en als onwetenden hen aanspreken zeggen zij salaman vrede en degenen die de nacht doorbrengen terwijl zij voor hun heer knielen en staan in hun salat
3354317 laat het verrichten van vrijwillige nachtgebeden niet na de profeet e heeft het niet nagelaten en als hij ziek was of zich daarvoor lui voelde verrichtte hij deze zittend
3354318 is de gehoorzame die een gedeelte van de nacht zich neerknielend en staand in salaat doorbrengt die het hiernamaals vreest en hoopt op de barmhartigheid van zijn heer
3354319 wie achter zijn imaam bidt totdat deze weggaat voor hem wordt het verrichten van nachtgebeden gedurende een hele nacht genoteerd
3354320 wij voeden jullie slechts omwille van het welbehagen van allah wij verlangen van jullie geen beloning en geen dank voorwaar wij vrezen van onze heer een angstaanjagende huiveringwekkende dag allah zal hen op die dag beschermen voor het kwaad en glans en blijdschap schenken en hij zal hen vanwege hun geduldige volharding belonen met het paradijs en met zijde
3354321 o mensen wissel met elkaar de vredesgroet en voed mensen en onderhoud de familiebanden en bid in de nacht terwijl de mensen slapen dan zullen jullie het paradijs met vrede binnengaan
3354322 ik heb veel liever dat ik tien van mijn vrienden uitnodig en hen iets te eten geef dat zij lusten dan tien zonen van ismael vrij koop
3354323 wie het vasten van een vastende verbreekt krijgt dezelfde beloning als die van de vastenden zonder dat er iets verminderd wordt van de beloning van de vastende
3354324 wie daarin het vasten van een vastende verbreekt zal dit een
3354325 allah geeft deze beloning aan degene die het vasten van een vastende verbreekt d m v een teugje melk of een dadel of een slok water en wie een vastende te drinken geeft zal allah te drinken geven uit mijn bassin waarna hij niet meer dorst zal krijgen totdat hij het paradijs betreedt
3354326 voorwaar wij hebben hem de qor aan neergezonden in de waardevolle nacht laylatoe l qadr en wat doet jullie weten wat de waardevolle nacht is de waardevolle nacht is beter dan duizend maanden
3354327 hij die uit oprechtheid van geloof gedurende laylatoe l qadr vrijwillige gebeden onderhoudt in de hoop verdiensten te verkrijgen zal zijn begane zonden vergeven worden
3354328 o boodschapper van allah als ik laylatoe l qadr meemaak wat moet ik zeggen
3354329 zeg o allah u bent vergevingsgezind en houdt ervan om te vergeven vergeef mij
3354330 is er een vragende dan zal ik die geven is er een iemand die om vergeving vraagt dan zal ik hem vergeven
3354331 en in de laatste uren van de nacht smeekten zij om vergeving
3354332 en aanbidt jullie rabb totdat de zekerheid dood naar jullie komt
3354333 reciteer de qoraan want op de dag der opstanding zal het als een bemiddeling voor zn metgezel komen
3354334 de profeet allahs zegen en vrede zij met hem heeft gezegd wie zijn heer gedenkt en wie dat niet doet zijn te vergelijken met een levende en een dode
3354335 de profeet allahs zegen en vrede zij met hem heeft gezegd kennis vergaren is een plicht voor elke moslim
3354336 de profeet allahs zegen en vrede zij met hem heeft gezegd wie zijn heer gedenkt en wie dat niet doet zijn te vergelijken met een levende en een dode
3354337 de profeet allahs zegen en vrede zij met hem heeft gezegd kennis vergaren is een plicht voor elke moslim
3354338 vandaag heb ik jullie godsdienst voor jullie vervolmaakt en ben ik tevreden met de islaam als godsdienst voor jullie
3354339 wie iets toevoegt aan de zaak van ons wat niet hiertoe behoort zal het verworpen worden
3354340 de slechte zaken zijn de nieuwe toevoegingen en iedere nieuwe toevoeging is een religieuze innovatie en edere religieuze innovatie is een dwaling en iedere dwaling leidt naar het hellevuur
3354341 wie aan de islam een religieuze innovatie toevoegt denken dat dit een goede daad is beweert waarlijk dat mohammed saws niet voldaan heeft aan zijn plicht als boodschapper omdat allah zegt
3354342 vandaag heb ik jullie godsdienst voor jullie vervolmaakt en ben ik tevreden met de islam als godsdienst voor jullie
3354343 wij dienen te weten dat het toevoegen van de kleinste religieuze innovatie door een persoon aan het geloof verboden is het toevoegen van religieuze innovaties behoort niet slechts zoals sommigen beweren tot het niveau van afkeurenswaardigheden makroeh

3354352 ik ben gezonden om de nobelste der goede manieren te vervolmaken
3354353 ik heb de neiging me in te laten met die en die ongehoorzaamheid wat moet ik daaraan doen
3354354 ik probeer s ochtends vroeg op te staan om het ochtendgebed te verrichten maar het lukt me steeds niet wat moet ik nu doen
3354355 de vervolmaking van het wereldse leven en de religie hangt af van geduld
3354356 ik zal deze ongehoorzaamheid vanaf nu laten en ik zal geduldig zij want allah swt is bij me en hij zal me bijstaan
3354357 de ziel nafs bestuurt de dienaar en leidt hem naar het paradijs of naar het hellevuur geduld is zijn teugels
3354358 o jullie die geloven zoekt hulp door middel van geduld en de salaat gebed voorwaar allah is met de geduldigen
3354359 en wij zullen jullie zeker beproeven met iets van vrees en honger en vermindering van bezittingen en levens en vruchten maar geef verheugde tijdingen aan de geduldigen
3354360 voorwaar het zijnde geduldigen die hun beloning zonder berekening zal worden gegeven
3354361 maar wie geduldig was en vergaf voorwaar dat behoort zeker tot de aanbevolen daden
3354362 ik draag een hoofddoek maar ik weet dat ik hem over een poosje af ga doen
3354363 degene die overtuigd waren dat zij allah zeker zouden ontmoeten zeiden
3354364 onze heer schenk ons geduld en maak onze voeten standvastig en sta ons bij tegen het ongelovige volk
3354365 en als er onder jullie 20 zijn die geduldig zijn dan zullen zij er 200 verslaan
3354366 oh heer sta me toe de zonnen van adam te verdrinken want ze eten van wat u ze geschonken heeft maar ze dienen iets anders dan u
3354367 oh heer sta me toe de zonen van adam in te sluiten want ze eten van wat u ze geschonken heeft maar ze dienen iets anders dan u
3354368 oh heer sta me toe om de zonen van adam in te slikken want ze eten van wat u ze geschonken heeft maar ze dienen iets anders dan u
3354369 laat ze als jullie ze geschapen hadden dan zouden jullie genade met ze hebben
3354370 voorwaar daarin zijn zeker tekenen voor iedere geduldige en dankbare
3354371 er is voor mijn allah gelovige dienaar geen andere beloning wanneer ik zijn naaste familielid bij me neem indien hij dan het oordeel aan mij overlaat dan het paradijs
3354372 o allah laat me behoren tot diegene die geduldig zijn
3354373 wanneer allah de schepselen op de dag des oordeels bijeenbrengt dan roept de oproeper
3354374 wanneer ons onrecht aan gedaan werd bleven we geduldig wanneer we slecht behandeld werden vergaven we wanneer we niet serieus genomen werden dan verdroegen we dit
3354375 ga het paradijs binnen en verheug je op de beloning voor degenen die goede daden verrichten
3354376 er overkomt de moslim niets aan nasab of wasab of hamm of pijn of verdriet zelfs de prik van een doorn of allah wist daarmee wat van zijn zonden uit
3354377 het meest beproefd zijn de profeten vervolgens de uitmuntenden en vervolgens degenen die daarop volgen in goedheid men wordt beproefd al naar gelang zijn dien wanneer zijn dien sterk is dan zal allah hem meer beproeven en wanneer er in zijn dien iets van zachtheid zit wordt hij beproefd al naar gelang zijn dien
3354378 dachten jullie dat jullie het paradijs binnen zouden gaan zonder dat allah degenen die streden van jullie gekend doet worden en de geduldigen gekend doet worden
3354379 allah zal de gelovigen niet in de toestand laten waarin jullie verkeren totdat hij het slechte van het goede scheidt en allah brengt jullie niet op de hoogte van het onwaarneembare
3354380 wanneer allah van een volk houdt dan beproeft hij het
3354381 de zoetheid van de beloning neemt bij mij de bitterheid van de pijn weg
3354382 zeven mensen zal allah in zijn schaduw laten schuilen op een dag waarop geen schaduw zal zijn buiten zijn schaduw
3354383 toen ik opsteeg naar de hemel rook ik een aangename geur die ik nooit eerder geroken had ik vroeg toen jibriel wat is dat voor een geur

3354388 de profeet allahs zegen en vrede zij met hem heeft gezegd kennis vergaren is een plicht voor elke moslim
3354389 en dat was jullie veronderstelling waarmee jullie over jullie heer veronderstelden die jullie in het ongeluk gestort heeft toen gingen jullie tot de verliezers behoren
3354390 de profeet allahs zegen en vrede zij met hem heeft gezegd wie zijn heer gedenkt en wie dat niet doet zijn te vergelijken met een levende en een dode

3354392 voor deze dag alleen zal ik mijn woorden verfraaien ik zal dan geen afstotende of vulgaire taal uitspreken noch zal ik iemand uitschelden of over iemand roddelen
3354393 ga onder net zoals jouw zon is ondergegaan ik zal niet om jou schreien noch zal je mij ooit zien aan jou denken immers je hebt ons verlaten en in de steek gelaten en je bent voor goed vertrokken en zal nimmer naar ons terugkeren
3354394 jij behoort tot het verborgene ik zal daarom geen zaken doen met de droomwereld noch zal ik mezelf verkopen aan de illusies of zal ik de geboorte verhaasten van wat ik ontbeer immers morgen is nog niet geschapen noch is er iets over hem verhaald

3354403 how quickly the south ossetian war has become more about russia and the united states east and west george bush and vladimir putin than about the poor south ossetians caught in the middle
3354404 when the bolsheviks drew up its republics autonomous regions and autonomous oblasts in 1936 the north caucuses was an artificially crafted mosaic where political borders ran counter to emergent ethnic ones
3354405 between 1989 and 1992 fighting flared in the south ossetian a o and in georgia between ethnic ossetian paramilitary troops and georgian interior ministry mvd units and paramilitaries south ossetia had demanded to secede and georgia cracked down on the renegade area by sending in troops approximately 100 000 ethnic ossetians fled georgia and south ossetia and another 23 000 georgians headed in the other direction one hundred villages were reportedly destroyed in south ossetia
3354406 when the soviet union collapsed in 1991 the south ossetians became one of the many internal others for the georgians to proclaim their new found nationalism against
3354407 however much people want to point to south ossetia as a russian proxy they still have to somehow account for the fact that south ossetians gleefully take those passports use russian currency and are running not into georgia but into russia to escape the violence i think we have to remember that however one wants to attribute blame for the conflict there are some real reasons why the south ossetians want to ditch georgia altogether yet in all the reporting that has come out in the last few days the south ossentian voice as an agent of his or her own present and future has been more or less muted in its place have stood a number of metonyms russia putin georgia rebels proxies oil pipelines nato the united states
3354408 from 8 august to the afternoon of 10 august the russian federal migration service recorded 24 032 people crossing the border to russia given that the population of south ossetia is a mere 70 000 that is quite a large percentage of the population
3354409 human rights watch visited a camp for the displaced in the village of alagir and interviewed more than a dozen individuals including those from tskhinvali and neighboring villages those from the city reported spending more than three days in the basements of their houses unable to come out because of the incessant shelling two individuals from tskhinvali a mother and her pregnant daughter said their apartment building was severely damaged by shells and they only dared to come out of the basement on the fourth day early in the morning of august 10 when russian troops took full control of the city and started transporting local residents to a safe zone they said the convoy consisted of six buses about 27 people each escorted by the military to the safety zone
3354410 residents of satskhenet village told human rights watch that after the village came under heavy artillery fire on the night of august 7 all women children and elderly more than 100 people started fleeing their homes most of them spent the next two days hiding in the woods and then trying to make their way toward the russian border they were assisted by the russian military in the village of ger and transported to north ossetia
3354411 eduard kokoity told interfax that up to 1 400 killed by georgian troops
3354412 i saw bodies lying on the streets around ruined buildings in cars its impossible to count them now there is hardly a single building left undamaged
3354413 russia has invaded a sovereign neighbouring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people
3354414 and what about the people caught in the middle south ossetians are finally beginning to bury their dead

3354455 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3354456 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3354457 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3354458 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3354459 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3354460 appointments to the judicial appointments board for scotland are not currently regulated by the commissioner we are not in a position to assign ocpas assessors to oversee appointments to the board of this body until such time as those appointments are statutorily brought within our remit we did not assign an ocpas assessor to oversee these appointments
3354461 there is no way the justice department can claim ignorance over ocpas rules which have been well known in government for years
3354462 the judicial appointments board currently operates on an administrative basis and is therefore not subject to ocpas regulations however the selection panel included an ocpas assessor and followed good recruitment practice in making the recommendations for appointment
3354463 we were not contacted by scottish government to assign an ocpas assessor to this appointments round as these are not regulated appointments at the current time we would not have in any case been able to provide an ocpas assessor to oversee the round the relevant scottish government sponsor team for appointments to this body will have entered into a private agreement with the individual anja amsel who oversaw the round
3354464 however the selection panel included an ocpas assessor acting in an independent capacity and followed good recruitment practice in making the recommendations for appointment
3354465 ocpas have written to the relevant sponsor team this afternoon asking for a second change to the press release such that reference to ocpas is removed
3354466 mr macaskill and the justice department seem to have felt that dragging ocpas into the appointments to the judicial appointments board would be advantageous to the government weakening the independence of ocpas and any possibility of a further investigation by anyone into mr mcallister amp lady smiths appointment to the judicial appointment board
3354467 use of the code as guidance the commissioner recognises that unregulated bodies may use the code as guidance in such instances the ocpas regulated logo may not appear in publicity or other materials relating to the appointment round leaflets and other information about ocpas may not be included in the application pack
3354468 ocpas has discussed the press release with the relevant scottish government sponsor team and explained our expectation that no reference should be made to the use of ocpas assessors oas unless they are working in that capacity oas may only work in that capacity on appointment rounds regulated by the commissioner as advised previously appointments to jabs are not currently regulated by the commissioner
3354469 the commissioner has already changed ocpas policy on the type of work that ocpas assessors may do such that in future no acting ocpas assessor may work as an independent assessor on unregulated appointments rounds revised service level agreements have been issued to all oas to reflect that change in policy
3354470 anja amsel and one other assessor who are working notice on the old service level agreements which allowed this practice are ceasing to work for ocpas this year
3354471 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3354472 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3354473 we are considering a way to better reflect these rising costs in the prices of our next pcs
3354474 lifting prices as competitors prices are sliding could spur consumers to move away from nec
3354475 one option might be to keep its prices level and lower performance specifications on its pcs
3354476 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

3354485 without warning a large wave hit the stern of the boat and jack headed towards me to help me bail out
3354486 as he did so the combined weight of us both caused the stern to submerge and within a matter of seconds the whole of the boat was submerged
3354487 i helped jack to reach a creel buoy and told him to keep hold of that while i swam for help
3354488 i headed for shore all the time thinking i had to make it for my wife and daughter and to get help for jack

3354528 in the 60s when tim leary and i began exploring inner space with psychedelics the music was always a groove that we could follow a route to take us higher music was at the forefront of the expansion of consciousness and the counter culture there was a group consciousness that evolved in some of the performances of the grateful dead jefferson airplane jimi hendrix and others that was transcendent and brought a sense of unity and a feeling of deep love and joy later when i made it to india i was introduced to other music and sounds that vibrate with the cosmos using it to get high the music itself is the high and you just become it like a surfer becoming one with the wave

3354756 if youre going to have annual plots it is counterintuitive to have things that have a long life like a shrub or a rose

3354762 the canadian national vimy memorial in france is a powerful and moving sight a massive structure it is for all canadians killed in wwi and inscribed with 11 000 names with no known graves
3354763 the monument to the 1956 budapest uprising is incredibly moving the arrangement of pillars is initially scattered then closer together ultimately forming a wedge which ploughs up the pavement like a ships bow though water
3354764 the memorial at choeung ek the killing fields cambodia is filled with human skulls of those killed
3354765 the peace park in hiroshima is incredibly moving the sight of the a dome with the background of modern day japan stops everyone in their tracks
3354766 the best memorial i have ever seen is the russian cemetery in east berlin a giant russian soldier with head bowed the significance and the human cost of freeing europe from fascism is very well portrayed
3354767 on a trip to oklahoma city i visited the site of the 1995 bombing the memorial as a reflective pool between two gates and the bronze and stone empty chair memorial is a simple stark and beautiful memorial
3354768 the space mirror memorial at the kennedy space center is particularly moving not just because of its simplicity or elegance but the large expanse of empty black granite ready for more names
3354769 the old testament in hebrew and the new testament in greek being immediately inspired by god and by his singular care and providence kept pure in all ages are therefore authentical so as in all controversies of religion the church is finally to appeal unto them
3354770 till heaven and earth pass one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law till all be fulfilled
3354771 that certain catholics were in such an humor of translating the scriptures into latin that satan taking occasion by them though they thought of no such matter did strive what he could out of so uncertain and manifold a variety of translations so to mingle all things that nothing might seem to be left certain and firm in them etc what is to have the faith of our glorious lord jesus christ with yea or nay if this be not again what is sweet harmony and consent if this be
3354772 if there come any unto you and bring not this doctrine receive him
3354773 if anyone comes to you and does not bring this teaching do not take him into your house or welcome him
3354774 the plain truth of the matter is that the version that is so
3354775 the king james version was a model for the development of the english language its elegant but simple style had an influence on english speaking writers
3354776 zeal to promote the common good whether it be by devising anything ourselves or revising that which hath been laboured by others deserveth certainly much respect and esteem but yet findeth but cold entertainment in the world it is welcomed with suspicion instead of love and with emulation instead of thanks and if there be any hole left for cavil to enter and cavil if it do not find a hole will make one it is sure to be misconstrued and in danger to be condemned this will easily be granted by as many as know story or have any experience
3354777 if it do not find a hole will make one
3354778 hear the word of the lord ye that tremble at his word your brethren that hated you that cast you out for my names sake said let the lord be glorified but he shall appear to your joy and they shall be ashamed
3354779 for such an high priest became us who is holy harmless undefiled separate from sinners and made higher than the heavens
3354780 the authorized versions scholars tended to remove the bible safely away from daily life
3354781 and he hath made my mouth like a sharp sword in the shadow of his hand hath he hid me and made me a polished shaft in his quiver hath he hid me
3354782 the word of god is quick and powerful and sharper than any twoedged sword piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit and of the joints and marrow and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart
3354783 the prevalence of very short words in english a succinct straightforward and simple tongue in some of its aspects in fact almost as a kind of baby talk
3354784 feeling for syllable and rhythm penetrating far below the conscious levels of thought and feelings invigorating every word
3354785 when we think of the high repute in which the authorized version is held by men of learning and renown we must remember too that in a special sense it has been the great book of the poor and unlettered the one book that every household was sure to possess was the bible kjv to many a poor man the english bible has been a university the kindly mother from whom he has drawn a way of great speech
3354786 it is the most beautiful of all the translations of the bible indeed it is probably the most beautiful piece of writing in all the literature of the world m any learned but misguided men have sought to produce translations in the plain speech of everyday but the authorized version has never yielded to any of them for it is palpably and overwhelmingly better than they are just as it is better than the greek new testament or the vulgate or the septuagint its english is extraordinarily simple pure eloquent and lovely it is a mine of lordly and incomparable poetry at once the most stirring and the most touching ever heard of

3354791 i was there at wec 35 hell yeah i wanted to see in person what brian bowles and damacio page are capable of inside the cage and they didnt disappoint i was impressed with both of them bowles is a bit young and inexperienced i saw a couple holes in his game damacio got the better of him a few times which forced bowles to shoot for the takedown i think damacio was doing pretty good actually until he got caught going in for that shot damacio made a mistake and just left himself wide open for that guillotine damacio should have kept that fight standing but thats what happens he made a mistake and you cant do that at this level he paid for it im itching real bad i want to get down i hate going to fights and sitting in the stands i would have loved to have stepped in the cage on sunday i guess i just have to wait my turn i think tapia is at the front of the line but he just messed up his knee so i dont know ill fight bowles he looks good and if he doesnt get the next shot im sure well cross paths one of these days if he keeps winning i dont really care ill fight anybody anywhere he doesnt even have to be 135 pounds

3354820 we regularly check our records and detect a record keeping anomaly on average once a year

3354831 when possible recommend actions that the applicant might take to place
3354832 sponsors of changes that must be made before an application can be approved with no implication as to the ultimate approvability of the application
3354833 that a not approvable letter sends an unintended message that a marketing application will never be approved which could adversely affect a companys ability to raise capital
3354834 is less important than the content of the letter and the certainty that such letters provide for pharmaceutical research company planning
3354835 consistent with our user fee bundling policy which allows certain related changes to be made in the same supplement with only one fee
3354836 this change clarifies that an efficacy supplement can be submitted to add or modify an indication or claim
3354837 it is possible that an efficacy supplement might be intended to provide evidence of effectiveness for the traditional approval
3354838 whether or not anybody will ever admit concede or believe that this influences in a bad way what doctors do with the medicine the perception is bad and getting rid of it we think is important if we are going to build credibility back into what is a very serious and important interaction
3354839 must be signed by the companys chief executive officer and chief compliance officer
3354840 any comments received by phrma relating to a companys observance of the code or conduct that is addressed by the code will be referred by phrma to the relevant companys chief compliance officer
3354841 in addition companies are encouraged to seek external verification periodically meaning at least once every three years that the company has policies and procedures in place to foster compliance with the code
3354842 phrma will prepare general guidance for such external verification and will identify on its web site if a company has sought and obtained verification of its compliance policies and procedures from an external source
3354843 we are talking about a code that covers everything from interactions with hospitals to consultants and speakers this is a pretty complex set of arrangements

3354847 were still trying to learn what the process might be what the triggers are what the expectations are so that we can convey those to you in a guidance
3354848 our hope is to be able to do that in the not too distant future so that you can help us by knowing what you need to submit and what you should expect from the process
3354849 my understanding im not an attorney would be that that would not be a change that triggered a rems
3354850 something special you do because ordinary processes wont work so theres a threshold you have to conclude that labeling directed at physicians in the usual manner plus ordinary reporting under aers adverse events reporting system or similar systems wont do the job
3354851 our problem is that we have to explain why we are requiring all of these things in great legally satisfactory detail
3354852 risks and benefits balances and what will be required a little bit more critically
3354853 requirement that has penalties associated with non compliance really forces people to get it right
3354854 because companies are struggling to get the rems piece right
3354855 i think it will be a while before we have clear standards that we can articulate about the next step beyond riskmaps although theyre quite similar

3354858 todays announcement sends a strong signal that educational funds must be used appropriately and that industry support is intended to fund education to improve health
3354859 this is a struggle weve faced in several episodes in the last several years where weve come to realize that the monograph process is not one that allows for rapid changes in response to new information
3354860 the legal conundrum of fda maybe making recommendations that differ from whats in the rule
3354861 they obviously dont have the manpower to do that for everything

3354864 while we dont yet know how much the user fees will increase they may go up about three fold to pay for a tripling of the number of medical device reviewers
3354865 japan has the slowest and most burdensome regulatory process of any of the major industrialized nations and it recognizes that
3354866 over the past year it has started to focus on areas to address the problems in its approval process so that it can adopt measures to speed approval
3354867 at the moment japan requires those sorts of minor changes to go through a full blown approval process which is a lengthy process and which clogs up the system and slows everything down
3354868 it is considering improvements that would allow certain minor changes to simply be notified to the approval authorities rather than have to go through a full approval process
3354869 it ultimately raised concerns around scope of agency authority whether or not fda had the clear authority to use risk management tools even under the new fdaaa to create such a de facto behind the counter status and so the guidance is likely not going forward
3354870 i suspect that the best alternative right now for them is to encourage sponsors to come in on an ad hoc basis with plans for using risk management proposals as a way to carve out a third pathway for select drugs
3354871 really been brought to fore by the new interests in some of the treatments for some of the chronic asymptomatic conditions being taken over the counter
3354872 that i think has led people to question could you improve access and maybe have improved outcomes by making some of these treatments for chronic asymptomatic conditions available without a prescription i think its an area thats clearly still in discussion and debate
3354873 there are views within the agency that there ought to be such a thing
3354874 the usual concern that people have had is that most pharmacies arent prepared to participate in the advice giving component of this to the extent that they would really need to
3354875 were about to change administrations that will probably have some impact on thinking about this issue
3354876 a lot of these things could be done in much easier to manage settings than its now done whether a pharmacist is ready to do those sorts of things even at the level of prescribing a low dose diuretic i think would be highly debated but you dont have to do it the way we do now
3354877 in the absence of a guidance spelling out a formal process the best fda can hope for is that enough sponsors will come in with proposals that they will essentially carve out a pathway by example
3354878 what is really needed is legislation in this area there is no reason that we shouldnt have a formal behind the counter option in the u s it would empower consumers lower costs extend care to more people and empower pharmacists to play a more active role in the provision of care
3354879 we could have had our last meeting of the year
3354880 the chairman believes that the appropriations process is going nowhere

3354883 nobody really knows yet how the appropriations will turn out and it could all change
3354884 cost was the driving factor in our decision to deploy the ibm system z9 ec
3354885 weve cut our operating costs significantly while ensuring that the z9 has sufficient processor capability to support winn dixie for years to come the use of the mainframe is integral to our success as we continue getting better all the time

3354897 considering its age its possible that this was one of those that helped put out the fires when the stowmarket gun cotton factory exploded on the 11th august 1871 almost 137 years ago to the day thats real local history for you
3354898 the fact that 300 members of staff have been on the receiving end of bullying behaviour but only five have had felt able to it report is indicative of the climate of fear that is hanging over the council at the moment
3354899 as a matter of urgency the council needs to strengthen the whistle blowing process for dealing with bullying
3354900 i think the labour group are just trying to manipulate this for party political purposes
3354901 we have a bullying and harassment policy based on an acas model and have done training for staff to show how the system works
3354902 there have only been two complaints upheld so there seems to be no reason at all for changing the current approach

3354912 if brain damage related to alzheimers disease begins earlier in adult life then having less reserve due to a smaller brain could compromise intellectual ability in those destined to get alzheimers and lead to them getting less education

3354966 takes too long to get permits to build on wetlands
3354967 i dont trust the federal government to come in and tell us what to do
3354968 the draconian nature of some of their actions has stopped businesses from expanding and creating jobs
3354969 the federal government has much more experience in the wetlands permitting process and will properly balance the protection of our natural resources with the inherent need for economic development
3354970 there has been strong opposition from environmentalists and the locals to the tadri project sanctioned by the centre against this backdrop we proposed to relocate the project
3354971 the centres policy mandates the location of thermal plant either near a port or the coal mines however the karnataka governments move to shift the project from tadri to bijapur district is against the centres policy as a result it cannot be allowed
3354972 the power project could not be started because of local resistance so we request the centre to facilitate relocation
3354973 we have agreed to acquire 12 5 per cent stake in mahindra rural housing finance for rs 5 8 crore we will keep this stake for the next two years after which we will consider to increase it or sell it
3354974 the j amp k situation is our biggest nightmare at this point we are devoting our entire attention to defuse the tension there
3354975 so to make a cabinet reshuffle at this point is meaningless
3354976 no in fact were looking at a couple of small divestment at the moment which would probably pay for anything like that but well be opportunistic if things turn up that cant be resisted but we dont see very much at the moment
3354977 we will raise tier ii capital within the current fiscal but we will wait for some time till the market looks up
3354978 we cant say now how much we will raise it will all depend on the market condition the growth in our business and other factors

3354993 it is not possible to draw a direct causal link between and distant observations of impacts affecting species such as polar bears
3354994 we need a regulatory framework that is consistent with the esa and will address new challenges such as
3354995 focusing the consultation process on those federal actions where potential impacts can be linked to the action and the risks are reasonably certain to occur
3354996 but in the unlikely story that is america there has never been anything false about hope
3354997 the beijing olympics with the heightened scrutiny on issues such as air quality in particular and energy demands in general represent yet another example being played out on the worldwide stage that the need for greentech is here to stay
3354998 the chinese understand what they live with every day they dont need the beijing olympics to explain their energy needs
3354999 when you see that even with all the efforts china has made athletes are unable to compete because of the air quality and you look at the energy demands needed in the country because they are underscored by the olympics you see the real substantive drivers behind the need for clean technologies
3355000 i do believe theres a lot of great national pride around the olympics but in the end when you evaluate it you have to see that they didnt make the goals
3355001 long term theres no doubt that the olympics had an impact
3355002 even though china has a central government with strong controls i think its partly going to take an uprising of the populace to make this happen and the inability of the government to reach its goals with all the effort it put toward this really shows the magnitude of the problem and may then invigorate more significant investment and solutions
3355003 my guess is the most lasting impact is chinas desire not to be seen as a dirty polluting old energy kind of country and i think allowing the world to come and see what things are really like on the ground there will hopefully motivate chinese leadership to clean up their image
3355004 maybe china will feel a little bit more pressure to clean up
3355005 the chinese government probably is somewhat disappointed that the very short term measures it tried to put into place to clean the air for a couple of weeks didnt work but it just reinforced the fact that its not easy to fix this problem
3355006 it requires long term action and significant investment to make it happen

3355012 l hanno fatto giocare con una frattura questo non doveva accadere hanno fatto un ecografia pensando che fosse un problema muscolare invece era una questione ossea successivamente poiche persisteva ancora il dolore dopo due ecografie negative e dopo averlo fatto giocare si sono decisi a fargli una lastra che ha evidenziato questo tipo di frattura probabilmente presi da mille cose hanno sottovalutato il problema

3355083 we were so determined that this was not to be our last game together but at 17 12 down in the third we were just fighting for our lives
3355084 it so difficult to get a run of points against chinese pairs but we managed it
3355085 in the first game we just came out and we were blinding
3355086 una mala mentalidad por pensar que el partido estaba ganado antes de jugarlo
3355087 empezamos con muy mala mentalidad porque nos dejamos envolver por el ambiente de que ganamos a grecia en el primer partido que china hab a perdido con los estados unidos y ya pens bamos que hab amos ganado a china salimos sin intensidad y eso nos dur todo el primer tiempo
3355088 en el descanso reflexionamos sobre eso se habl de que china pod a ganar y la actitud del equipo cambi china jug un partido extraordinario
3355089 malil and the victim had apparently been in a dating relationship which recently ended
3355090 this dilemma is already playing out as chinese officials who have resisted calls to place binding caps on their greenhouse gas emissions have argued that ip protections are making clean energy technologies too expensive for developing countries

3355149 with over 40 years experience in information security and having worked closely with the information security forum it is clear that its role is more important than ever
3355150 information security is no longer just a technical challenge it is a business imperative and is or should be on the top of boardroom agendas in every corporation the isf is a unique organization that provides a confidential peer to peer forum for members across different countries sectors and disciplines and is able to draw on their diverse skills and expertise to distill best practice and deliver an unmatched portfolio of research methodologies and tools

3355154 local councils can find out the number and cause of avoidable contacts which is the first step to reducing them
3355155 the fact that simple transactions are increasingly satisfied by consumer self service internet and systems means person to person contacts tend to be more complex and take longer
3355156 reducing avoidable contact gives more capacity to handle unavoidable contacts more effectively and reduce overall workload
3355157 the timing is right for this demonstration weve seen a massive increase of interest in targeted advertising and are already working with iptv broadcasters network owners and vendors not to mention advertising agencies and brands mobile tv is a vital part of the rapidly changing world of tv and is a vital part of our roadmap like packet vision udcast is a pioneer in its particular area of innovation with a proven track record and global reach so there is a natural synergy between the two companies
3355158 we expect targeted advertising to be an important element of mobile tv business models including free to air services where finding ways to generate revenue from advertising will be essential udcasts mobile tv solutions are compliant with majority of standards deployed across the world we are in an ideal position to provide the global platform for delivering mobile tv so it makes sense to work with packet vision which we believe is at the forefront of delivering targeted advertising technology on ip video networks
3355159 the rumour that the mpa is to be relocated is still circulating although how they intend to find desk space for another 100 people in city hall is beyond me unless this means 100 redundancies of city hall based staff

3355170 we have a long history of enhancing call centre productivity with sophisticated contact centre applications direct integration with mitel is a further demonstration of the openness of our technology and our ongoing commitment to offering the most flexible options to our customers
3355171 gizmo is a relatively young company and the capability of inspirationcompact to expand and adapt to our growth surpassed all our expectations the solution let us pinpoint the areas needed for agent training and even helped managers outside of our contact center identify areas they could improve

3355174 the results of the survey so far show that although most companies understand the importance of having business continuity and disaster recovery plans in place there seems to be a knowledge gap when it comes to understanding the technologies that are currently available to deliver reliable and fast recovery in the event of a system failure these days it is not enough to blindly trust that backups are being completed properly businesses and the regulatory environment in which we all exist demand fast and reliable recovery time objectives for it systems such is the pace at which a modern company transacts business these days that those who are without their it for any great length of time are losing serious money customers are also becoming a lot more aware of the information that companies hold and are getting less and less forgiving about delivery disruption let alone the thought of their sensitive data being transported in a an unencrypted and readable format
3355175 this change in causes of data loss can possibly be attributed to improvements in software and hardware resiliency in the last two years which has reduced the number of hardware and software failures affecting computers changing the way these threats need to be addressed in business continuity and disaster recovery plans moving forward
3355176 whether this is down to better parental control the effect of media scare stories or just a growing understanding of the risks of social networking they are now actively managing their digital fingerprints or is the social networking explosion starting to wane
3355177 just as uk plc is bracing itself for the financial impact of post graduates that expect the latest and greatest gadgets and mobile access technologies so should universities
3355178 universities that want to lure the best students will need to invest heavily to implement an it infrastructure that will meet the expectations of this group and maintain their competitive edge in the race for securing higher student intake to meet this 150m price tag it is inevitable that universities will be looking to the government uk plc and possibly students to put their hands in their pockets
3355179 this survey is deliberately targeted at an age group that is being asked to choose its education and career path whilst this science statistic should worry uk plc and the governments of today and tomorrow the message is clear if we can educate them on the correlation between science and the gadgets they cant live without and spark their interest before choosing their gcse options we can influence the future of british industry
3355180 educators and private industry need to collaborate closely on how sciences are taught businesses worldwide are increasingly dependent upon technology to create new markets and achieve better margins technology is a lucrative thriving career option that seeks to drive down operational costs and increase innovation in a climate whereby the future careers of the realtime generation could be impacted by the credit crunch this is an opportune moment for the science and technology industry to reach out to this digital native workforce
3355181 with advanced advertising cable operators can provide a unique value proposition to advertisers who want to target the subscribers who best fit their product or service this is accomplished by unlocking the many sources of audience qualification information that exist or are emerging across cable operators systems and subscriber bases as well the ability cable operators have to identify specific viewing preferences and habits and to track viewing behaviour on a granular basis is critical to the success of advanced advertising
3355182 based on their internet advertising experience advertisers are also increasingly looking for tv advertising to support a more rapid automated campaign creation and execution process along with accurate reporting of the campaign results
3355183 anyone who is starting up a distribution company or any other company for that matter will know what its like to get things going and constantly have issues that threaten the survival of the business my vision of being a distributor with bite was being seriously undermined by a lack of appropriate it infrastructure
3355184 realising that i had to set up an it system that was both scalable and robust enough to cope with massive data needs with a limited budget gave me a big headache
3355185 a supplier needed to convince me that they could deliver what they promised i knew intercept were on my wavelength when they explained how the system was setup when it could be delivered and the simple cost per user per month pricing model i liked the aggressive approach to getting things done thats something i can relate to
3355186 we have been using onlinedesktop for some time now and its as reliable as our electricity supply it is always there and its always on we just take it for granted
3355187 i need things done correctly the first time and i want them done with minimal fuss and to high standards of excellence my customers are like that too they do not want to hang around and also want their needs to be fulfilled pretty quickly thats why i think i found a real winner with intercept i can work with them knowing that winning is their passion too
3355188 only recently have people started to carry around so much personal information and entertainment content with them mobiles have become a digital treasure trove and we need to be made aware of their true value its not just about the glossy handset
3355189 our mobilator shows people just how much their mobile content is worth for many people mobiles are an extension of their daily lives with personal memories once in a lifetime contact details and the odd sexy text holding huge importance putting a cash value on it all seemed the best way to highlight the value of peoples mobile lives the one thing the mobilator cant put a pound sign on is the emotional attachment to your personal content so the message is clear you should protect what is valuable to you
3355190 if you lose your data then often the loss for the individual is much more than the value of the handset itself in most cases the information lost on a mobile is hardly ever retrieved if a handset is stolen the data loss has proven to be the biggest inconvenience and trauma during a theft as you never know who has your details this takes us into the realm of id theft and fraud

3355202 americas first priorities must be conservation and efficiency the green party has an effective plan to reorganize the economy create millions of new jobs in conversion to safe clean energy conservation and expansion of public transportation to replace car traffic
3355203 such an effort should be comparable to americas concerted and internationally cooperative effort to defeat the axis powers during world war ii but this time wed be uniting for peace since global warming threatens the security of the entire world in the coming decades
3355204 without such an effort the disaster we witnessed in new orleans during and after katrina will take place on a global scale billions of people will see their homes livelihoods health and lives threatened while corporate interests exploit the devastation for more money and power
3355205 both the mccain and obama energy plans privilege corporate profits over the urgent need to transforms our nations energy policies both mr mccain and mr obama are seeking ways to preserve corporate profits at a time when the future of our planet is at stake
3355206 barack obamas support for nuclear power and ethanol and his recent turnaround on offshore drilling prove that he like john mccain will not challenge the power and profits of the energy industry we need the kind of national leadership on energy and the global warming threat thats represented by our presidential and congressional green candidates
3355207 drilling in anwr would have little discernible impact on actual global oil supplies as its advocates well know the argument that it could nonetheless bring down oil prices is based not on hard economics but on market psychoanalysis drilling would send a message to the oil traders that more oil is on the way which would cause them to start betting down the price

3355215 in the short term it is business as usual we dont rely on dr thaksins money
3355216 when mark hughes makes a decision we go through the normal process which can include banks finance or a whole bunch of different things just like any other club
3355217 he dr thaksin is willing to look at whatever it takes to make city a great football club he loves city
3355218 we have talked about new player acquisitions and we have also talked over dinner about why he had bought the club and his intentions it was really clear he wants to be at this football club for the next ten years
3355219 he wants to build a dynasty and he was disappointed that people think he wanted to get in and back out

3355226 a major presidential candidate with a wife of 30 years with incurable breast cancer
3355227 im not going to recycle a supermarket tabloids anonymously sourced story
3355228 if the point of the story was to allege that mccain had an affair with a lobbyist wed have owed readers more compelling evidence than the conviction of senior staff members but that was not the point of the story the point of the story was that he behaved in such a way that his close aides felt the relationship constituted reckless behavior and feared it would ruin his career
3355229 nobodys ever had sex with that woman until suddenly they have
3355230 the betrayed and humiliated spouse there too grimly demonstrating support if not forgiveness
3355231 was she threatening to tell all given that hunter was a struggling single mother with a sensational story to sell wouldnt edwards have been the least bit curious about her financial circumstances
3355232 there is no such thing as a fixed identity i think we all construct multiple personae to deal with the world and virtual online spaces have extended and complicated that activity immensely
3355233 social factors play a large role in our behaviors youre not really seeing the real people as its all dependent on situational or locational aspects
3355234 our players on the forums theyve always had this history they will mock up incredibly elaborate ideas if they feel that theyve got something and sometimes theres a main consensus that well its gibberish

3355237 bagaimana kau ingin mengungkapkan kata kata yang ada didalam rasa jiwamu bila kau masih terselimuti oleh pancaran cahaya berwarna abu abu yang telah menjadikan dirimu berkumbang pada telaga rasa kegelisahan kata kata pun tak bercahaya remang redup dan hilang yang tertinggal hanya kata kata kosong tak bermakna mengali hakikat kata kata bagai kau seorang pertapa yang berdiam diri pada hutan belantara mencari sebuah makna dan arti dari kesejatian kehidupan

3355255 this is an obvious and predictable attempt to deflect attention from alpas illegal activity cited in our lawsuit which details the organized and concerted effort to harm our customers our employees and our performance
3355256 part of the unions ongoing two year campaign to intimidate united into reopening a contract that runs through december 2009
3355257 i think its the ual labor dynamic playbook its been that way for a long time just change 2008 to 2000 and it was roughly the same story
3355258 its very obvious that tilton is not running a good ship
3355259 we will continue to take the necessary actions that enable this company to compete in this environment and refuse to repeat the mistakes of the past when the interest of one stakeholder was put disproportionately above balancing the needs of our customers employees and shareholders to the harm of all

3355281 i didnt want to take the risk that oil prices would turn around and fertilizer would jump even more
3355282 oil went bananas and wheat and corn went so crazy the food companies kind of got caught out on that
3355283 now weve gotten to the point that theyre going to be very conservative with any price cuts they dont want to be caught being overoptimistic
3355284 theyre all coming to understand that this isnt going away any time soon
3355285 its going to get worse long before it gets better
3355286 as commodity prices go down the companies are going to keep prices up
3355287 theyre going to milk whatever they can to recoup the losses theyve had over the last year or two
3355288 is that the founders of these disciplines envisioned the same thing that you have this broad dispersal of all of the organisms that each happened to be studying and that they would colonize the surface of the earth depending on whether the environment was suitable for them
3355289 before now all biologists could do was look at the biodiversity of microbes that could be cultured in a petri dish we now know that the vast majority of microbial life cannot be kept in captivity now we have the ability to grab dna from the environment and try to characterize different species or taxonomic groups using genetic material allowing our field to blast off
3355290 we are just beginning to scratch the surface of what these patterns look like
3355291 was that the diversity gradient more correlated with temperature than primary productivity
3355292 sackler colloquium in the light of evolution biodiversity and extinction
3355293 from our study we saw that environmental selection seemed to play a larger role and was more important for microbes than the plants
3355294 you have to be careful about the conclusions that you make
3355295 so on a 2 000 meter elevation gradient for example the spatial scale relative to the body size of a plant is much much larger when you consider what the universe looks like to a microbe
3355296 diversity patterns on mountainsides have been studied mostly on plants and animals for hundreds of years
3355297 yet microbes are the most diverse set of organisms on earth and they are really important for how ecosystems work our study establishes the first elevation gradient pattern for microbes we found that yes microbes do have a diversity pattern that is similar to what has been studied for plants and animals but the pattern is different than what you see for plants in the rockies and there is much to be done to understand why microbes might have a different biodiversity pattern

3355304 our group volume doubled withing one month and his continued to dramatically increase each continuing month we are successful because we work together as a team
3355305 i basically told them to do whatever they had to do to get the money together for the initial start up
3355306 my son was initially a skeptic but he joined up when he found out how great his sisters were doing
3355307 you should see the smiles on their faces when they got their first trivita checks
3355308 i like the fact that trivita is one of the few companies where you can buy actual customers not just leads but real customers
3355309 i dont have to beat the bushes looking for new customers i buy actual customers through the map program and i continually re apply my profits into buying more customers its amazing how fast ive been able to build my business with this very simple formula
3355310 i wouldnt be nearly as successful without the solid team that i have working with me
3355311 i can see myself having five teams and earning at least six figures a month its a very realistic goal when i first joined trivita i knew that this opportunity would change our family forever not that my entire family is benefitting from trivita im filled with gratitude and great hopes for the future
3355312 malil and the victim had apparently been in a dating relationship which recently ended
3355313 this year we had to cope with exceptional heavy ice coverage
3355314 we are happy and content that we were able to recover and exchange the equipment considering the extreme ice conditions
3355315 we have been documenting this water mass for years near greenland
3355316 it was almost impossible to provide evidence of it since 2004
3355317 for these purposes we had to relocate the equipment anchored at the seafloor last year further to the north to follow the receding ice and to ascertain that they stood at least temporarily in the sphere of influence of the ice edge
3355318 our study was also able to demonstrate that for patients at an average risk for gi bleeding starting ppi cotherapy at a younger age was marginally cost effective while starting ppi cotherapy at an older age was highly cost effective
3355319 ultimately physicians should discuss the gastrointestinal risks of low dose aspirin with their patients and consider ppi cotherapy
3355320 the stomach normally has a protective coating to prevent acid related injury but aspirin and other non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs or nsaids impair the stomachs ability to form this barrier coating potentially leading to ulcer formation
3355321 furthermore these drugs may themselves cause injury directly to stomach cells and can impair the ability of platelets to form a plug in the event of bleeding
3355322 many americans are currently taking low dose aspirin for coronary heart disease and we know that ppis are effective in reducing ulcer bleeding in patients on aspirin
3355323 what we didnt know however was whether it is worth paying for these drugs for patients on low dose aspirin who had no other risk factors
3355324 auditory or visual auditory responses in the primary visual cortex are highly probable given the presence of direct projections from the primary auditory cortex
3355325 we looked for modulation of the neuronal visual responses in the primary visual cortex by auditory stimuli in an awake monkey
3355326 we already know that ptks are associated with several types of aggressive cancers including colon breast and lung cancers
3355327 what we have discovered is that ptks have an important role to play as cancer cells grow and mutate to become potentially more aggressive tumours
3355328 the more we can learn about how tumours develop the more we are able to prevent their growth in the future there are already drugs that inhibit particular ptks in the late stages of treatment our discovery could change the timing of when and how those or similar drugs are administered
3355329 our studies have shown that ptk pathways are intimately associated with the regulation of checkpoint responses during dna replication
3355330 we have identified one mechanism by which ptks may remain activated and allow cancer cells to bypass the molecular warden of dna replication they may lack a key enzyme called tcptp
3355331 but the big question remains what happens in the real world of human cancers
3355332 stabilizing the size of the human population and reducing its consumption
3355333 maintaining living hedges around agricultural plots and preserving remnant trees in pasture
3355334 fitting coincidence because homo sapiens is now behaving in ways reminiscent of a spoiled teenager
3355335 we know where biodiversity will go from here up in smoke toward the poles and under water into crops and livestock onto the table and into yet more human biomass into fuel tanks into furniture pet stores and home remedies for impotence out of the way of more cities and suburbs into distant memory and history books
3355336 the support system for civilization will be destroyed and the world as we now know it will disappear
3355337 some of these same gene regulatory networks are re activated in the adult to direct the growth of new blood vessels
3355338 this can be beneficial as in the case of a heart attack
3355339 finding that a single factor regulates a large part of the angiogenic process creates a significant target for therapeutic development for any disease involving the vascular system
3355340 the next step is to find ways to modify this microrna in the setting of disease and test its ability to alter the disease process

3355348 according to information from suspects already in custody he is believed to be involved in smuggling weapons and fighters across the iraq iran border

3355350 the man admitted to designing websites for hezbollah brigades in order for the group to publicize their iram attacks on iraqi and coalition forces
3355351 we believe that hezbollah brigades does receive support from iran
3355352 they are also believed to receive guidance or direction from the iranian revolutionary guard corps qods force

3355358 load and performance testing is the killer application for cloud computing

3355360 i welcome president medvedevs decision i believe this means we are moving closer to a ceasefire and to the desperately needed follow up humanitarian efforts
3355361 i also strongly believe this decision reflects the strenuous diplomatic efforts of the osce the eu and other international actors
3355362 the overriding priority of the osce and the eu is to broker that ceasefire as soon as possible after that we need to launch a humanitarian effort given the number of civilians who have suffered in this needless fighting
3355363 the osce is the only international organization with the infrastructure people and experience already in place in georgia we can clearly play a key role in any further mediation monitoring and any humanitarian work taking into account the european unions crisis management expertise and other international players

3355368 the georgian olympic war is quickly becoming a measuring stick of washingtons squandered international power after years of war in iraq and afghanistan and severely strained relations with allies

3355370 the cas panel was of the opinion that the decision of the uci to proceed to a new analysis of the b sample was in accordance with the letter and spirit of the uci anti doping regulations
3355371 it was a very bad experience because i didnt understand what was happening but everything has turned out as i expected
3355372 ive spent many years cycling and i cant chuck it all in but sometimes you feel like it because there are so many injustices
3355373 the fans who like cycling dont want to see this sort of thing cycling is a spectacle that involves sacrifice if not you dont get the results
3355374 weve asked people in the grassroots game about what they want changed in the game and we had some excellent responses from over 40 000 people facilities and better pitch were among the responses but number one by a mile was the issue of respect for referees
3355375 its also important that pushy parents are put in their place and as a parent who goes to watch his son play every sunday i understand that from those responses we went forward with a pilot scheme for ten weeks that involved a lot of referees players and coaches and work towards a solution
3355376 we were criticised and people at the time said we were going for the soft end of the market but in truth that is were the majority of people play their football and that is where you can have the most effect
3355377 this is a very important initiative and my own view is that in this job that you have a rare opportunity to make a difference and i want to make a difference
3355378 one of the things we have gained from the timing when we brought him in is that fabio has been able to watch the players a lot of times
3355379 he has also been able to get them together a number of times for friendly games and see them up close and personal
3355380 it was interesting in the summer when he picked 30 players and we only lost one or two through injury

3355391 ive been tempted for awhile especially with this horse to try american racing
3355392 when it was time to go i begged him to let me go and he wouldnt let me through
3355393 rene has beat me a couple of times in other races so when i had the chance to get him on this horse so i took it dont be surprised if you see him back for the breeders cup turf
3355394 so i wasnt worried about the ones in front of me i just didnt want anyone coming from behind to get me

3355417 pcs are the hidden energy hogs of the home and most users have no idea that they are needlessly throwing away 80 percent of their pcs energy
3355418 if just 1 percent of all pcs used edison we could potentially reduce environmental impacts by 7 billion pounds of co2 which is equal to taking more than a half million cars off the road by finding ways to embed offsets in our daily life even something as simple as downloading software we will create permanent reductions in energy use and have a huge impact on our environment and resource sustainability

3355433 we have found that no one in the pharmaceutical industry has had fruitful discussions about what is needed in an rfid tag from a security perspective
3355434 many people think of securing the pharmaceutical supply chain as encrypting data when in fact many different security tools should be used in different combinations the security protocol that is appropriate for particular pharmaceutical applications such as anti diversion e pedigree track and trace and cold chain management will vary and must be balanced against the apparent and real risks

3355449 instead of complaining about the state of the education system as we correct the same mistakes year after year ive got a better idea
3355450 university teachers should simply accept as variant spelling those words our students most commonly misspell
3355451 there are enormous advantages in having a coherent system of spelling
3355452 it makes it easier to communicate maybe during a learning phase there is some scope for error but i would hope that by the time people get to university they have learnt to spell

3355483 saat ini masih kami kaji apakah akuisisi indover dapat memberikan nilai tambah bagi kinerja perseroan
3355484 bank indover memang punya kelebihan karena memiliki full operasional dan lisensi di belanda hal yang sangat jarang karena biasanya bank bank lokal yang punya cabang di luar negeri hanya representatif saja

3355499 we regularly check our records and detect a record keeping anomaly on average once a year
3355500 its perfectly normal that russia would want to defend the interests both of russians in russia and russophones outside russia

3355505 but at this games i have won gold and silver and weve had zhang lin china win silver so we have shown the world that we can compete we got got medals and were both asian
3355506 i dont know what happened but when i looked back and saw a few smiling faces i realised i had done it
3355507 i went in with a lot of confidence because i had come second in athens but i still had to shoot my best it was a close call but at least it went in my favour
3355508 no longer will a gold medal surprise us never again will we plead with the constellations to allow luck to go our way
3355509 i have taken the decision to end the operation to force georgian authorities into peace
3355510 the purpose of the operation has been achieved the security of our peacekeeping forces and the civilian population has been restored
3355511 if we have received the order to ceasefire this does not mean that we have stopped all actions including reconnaissance
3355512 its perfectly normal that russia would want to defend the interests both of russians in russia and russophones outside russia
3355513 it is also normal for the international community to want to guarantee the integrity sovereignty and independence of georgia
3355514 i dont think russia will feel like talking with mr saakashvili after what he did to our citizens
3355515 russia has invaded a sovereign neighbouring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people
3355516 make no mistake the new radeon hd 4870 x2 marks atis return to the top of the 3d graphics food chain it took a few years but through steady improvements in multi gpu software support and a new strategy regarding the design and manufacture of high end graphics cards that utilizes two mid sized chips in lieu of a single monolithic one amd was able to produce a graphics card capable of outpacing the best nvidia currently has to offer
3355517 our gameplay experiences with the ati radeon hd 4870 x2 were phenomenal especially once we raised the antialiasing setting to high levels who would have thought wed ever be seeing oblivion at 2560x1600 with 24x aa this means you can load up old games and set crazy high aa settings amd deserves huge kudos for really kicking aa up a notch
3355518 the radeon hd 4870 x2 is looking like it beat the gtx280 as it spanked even the overclocked geforce gtx 280 in our testing amd has pulled off another one with the radeon hd 4870 x2
3355519 the radeon hd 4870 x2 undeniably is the fastest performing product on the market right now
3355520 we need to focus our efforts where they will do the most good
3355521 it is important to use our time and resources to protect the most vulnerable species it is not possible to draw a link between greenhouse gas emissions and distant observations of impacts on species
3355522 it is not possible to draw a link between greenhouse gas emissions and distant observations of impacts on species
3355523 the aggressor has been punished and suffered very significant losses its military has been disorganized
3355524 russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century
3355525 raised serious questions about its intentions in georgia and the region
3355526 i do think we learn more because we can do more things
3355527 they have this thing that says drill offshore in the protected areas
3355528 we can do that we can have a vote on that
3355529 but it has to be part of something that says we want to bring immediate relief to the public and is not just a hoax on them
3355530 its going to be a big challenge but were up for the challenge and were going to get the mail delivered
3355531 the impact of this on my life and my family is hard to imagine
3355532 it is an exciting day for all of us who have long worked to secure vital services for children and adults who through no fault of their own face tremendous burdens every day just getting by
3355533 so look i am not unaware of the shack phenomenon
3355534 the borders should be according to the 1967 borders thats in the road map and the annapolis understandings a palestinian state with east jerusalem as its capital what we heard today is not new and is unacceptable and shows again that israel is not serious concerning the peace process this is an attempt to escape from a just peace
3355535 what is the ultimate proof of indian citizenship if even a foreigner can get an indian passport
3355536 a passport is a document issued by our government permitting us to travel to other countries how many countries will agree to give us visas on our passports once it becomes known that even a foreigner or a terrorist from another country can acquire an indian passport without verification
3355537 let alone admitting to the fact that more and more bangladeshi nationals are getting themselves registered as indian citizens thanks to their easy access to crucial documents like ration cards and even passports the state government seems to be reluctant even to admit the presence of infiltrators and has all along been maintaining a casual approach on the issue if the state government needed any further proof of cross border influx as also the evil designs behind the infiltration the high court ruling should wake it up from its slumber
3355538 if the government is really serious in detection and deportation of foreigners without harassment of genuine indian citizens the process of updating the national register of citizens nrc should be expedited and photo identity cards should be given to all genuine indian citizens on the basis of that
3355539 dad how did you ever get rich enough to afford this yacht
3355540 well there was an ultra limited edition variant cover run of atomic robo dogs of war issue 1 and

3355542 el m s guapo el m s listo el mejor
3355543 we will now investigate whether this can be regarded as a trend that was previously not recognised if this is the case it is out task to report this
3355544 retaliation is obligatory against anyone who kills a human being purely intentionally and without right
3355545 a father or mother or their fathers or mothers for killing their offspring or offsprings offspring
3355546 every other weekend thats how often you see a friend
3355547 when the law is dictating that one parent is better than the other the kids see that
3355548 we took the approach to not have custodial or non custodial
3355549 were just going to have parents who then agree on a parenting plan that focuses on the child
3355550 it will also help to unclog the courts a little i hope
3355551 women typically get custody because we still think in traditional ways men provide women nurture
3355552 but that doesnt mean that women are better parents or that men cant or shouldnt be involved
3355553 it might even help push us to another level by recognizing in a pointed way that children need their parents regardless of sex or gender to engage in the shared responsibilities of parenting
3355554 ill do whatever i need to do to get 50 percent interest in my kids as far as their lives go
3355555 he should keep focused on whats right for the children
3355556 a study of the gender wage gap conducted by economist june o neill former director of the congressional budget office found that women earn 98 percent of what men do when controlled for
3355557 the tashahhud the way he taught them surahs of the quran
3355558 the messenger of allah sal allahu alayhi wa sallam taught me the tashahhud with my palm between his palms the way he taught me all compliments prayers and pure words are due to allah peace be on you o prophet and also the mercy of allah and his blessings peace be on us and on the righteous slaves of allah i bear witness that none has the right to be worshipped except allah and i bear witness that muhammad is his slave and messenger
3355559 the messenger of allah sal allahu alayhi wa sallam used to teach us the tashahhud the way he taught us the quran he used to say all compliments blessed words prayers pure words are due to allah peace be on you o prophet and also the mercy of allah and his blessings peace be on us and on the righteous slaves of allah i bear witness that none has the right to be worshipped except allah and i bear witness that muhammad is the messenger of allah in one narration is his slave and messenger
3355560 all words which imply peace sovereignty and eternity are due to allah
3355561 all supplications which are used to glorify the majesty of allah for he is fully entitled to them and none but him is worthy of them
3355562 all good and pure words suitable for praising allah not those ones incompatible with his attributes with which kings were greeted
3355563 im trying not to talk about it too much i havent even got there and played the game yet
3355564 the guys have been chirping me at practice about it but we all know we have to focus on the tri nations the next three weeks and that all starts this saturday and winning there
3355565 i dont think it could happen to a greater rugby player the professional he is now and the experience he brings to the side is massive he is an extraordinary person who is willing to share everything he knows with everyone in the side even if he is not playing he is still the same character who doesnt change it is a privilege to work with him
3355566 we all know percys strengths and he helped us in dunedin when he started and the boks beat the all blacks we will need to use those attributes again this weekend
3355567 it may have rejuvenated me after four or five years of international rugby fatigue couldve been setting in the key to returning in 2004 under jake white was that i had a good pre season and my fitness came through from there
3355568 it was easy to come back when peter approached me i love playing for my country and i know ive got a lot to offer younger players like frans steyn ruan pienaar and conrad jantjes
3355569 by augustine j kposowa ph d at the university of california at riverside the study showed that being single versus being married made no difference in suicide rates
3355570 it is better to perish that to live as slaves
3355571 the courts in the united states are in a position now whereby money is given to the woman or the man is forced to pay alimony child support the man is also asked in some perhaps most cases to vacate the house
3355572 if a man loses custody of the children and the woman keeps those children there are situations whereby she may not allow the man to see the children and that causes some depression
3355573 women process their experiences with friends they discuss their feelings seek feedback and take advice
3355574 they are much more likely to tell a physician how they feel and cooperate in the prescribed treatment as a result women get better treatment for their depression
3355575 an attempted suicide is not really an attempt at suicide in about 95 percent of cases it is a different phenomenon its most often an effort to bring someones attention dramatically to a problem that the individual feels needs to be solved suicide contains a solution in itself
3355576 so it really goes back to the same thing that women when they intend to do it can be just as effective as men in committing suicide but they arent so inclined
3355577 shell consider not just her feelings but also the feelings of others her family the children even acquaintances and how those people will be affected by a decision like suicide
3355578 a man is much less likely to take those things into account he makes his decision and its about him so he doesnt feel the need to share it with anyone else
3355579 half of all people who commit suicide have seen a physician within a month of their fatal act
3355580 mostly they didnt get diagnosed and if they did they didnt get treated very vigorously
3355581 here is the first hard evidence that men are biologically prepared for fatherhood
3355582 in fact this is the first evidence that to nurture is part of mans nature
3355583 here is the first hard evidence that men are biologically prepared for fatherhood
3355584 in fact this is the first evidence that to nurture is part of mans nature
3355585 im grateful to have the opportunity my father never had
3355586 i have always suspected that fatherhood has biological effects in some perhaps all men
3355587 now here is the first hard evidence that men are biologically prepared for fatherhood
3355588 let the nurturing side of men come to center stage
3355589 we spend an awful lot of time looking for differences between the sexes and trumpeting them when we find them
3355590 but our brains are remarkably similar built from the same dna
3355591 if mother nature wanted to turn on parental behavior in a male
3355592 the easiest thing would be to turn on pathways already there for maternal behavior
3355593 my best guess is that womens hormone levels are timed to the birth and mens hormone levels are tied to their partners
3355594 a validation of the experiences that men know they have had it also goes a long way to bumping testosterone off its pedestal as the only hormone that is important to men
3355595 men are much more androgynous than we think we have the capability to be aggressive and nurturing the traditional view of men as predominantly aggressive really sells men short and denies their capability to experience the range of human emotions
3355596 it is as cruel to take away a child from his mother than to take away a child from his father
3355597 our action plan is targeted and customized to help the most vulnerable meet their urgent needs
3355598 i will not announce a success before the ink is dry but the information we are getting makes the acceptance of my governments demands by the u s more probable than only a few weeks ago

3355600 three million shillings was withdrawn from the cdf account but there is no project at the locations where they are supposed to be
3355601 not through speeches and majority decisions will the great questions of the day be decided but by iron and blood
3355602 i will not live to see the world war but you will and it will start in the east
3355603 regardless of patient safety or need with disregard for best clinical practice and no resources for the safe delivery of quality care
3355604 i personally believe that my clinical work is the most important and with locum cover being less feasible due to financial constraints and other current issues i believe i cannot continue to serve both the network and the patients of the region to an appropriate standard and as such my priorities lie with patients
3355605 this is not a luxury it is an absolute necessity if future mistakes and inquiries are to be avoided and patient health protected

3355634 wenn sie meinen dass sie die stadt krank reden k nnen dann sollen sie es tun die bev lkerung sieht es anders
3355635 bem hen der vp die wiener sp als abzocker hinzustellen
3355636 offensichtlich passt es der vp nicht dass wien eine gut verwaltete stadt ist
3355637 wir werden uns bem hen die steigerungen nicht an die kunden weiterzugeben und sie durch rationalisierungsma nahmen zu schlucken
3355638 daran denken dass es nach dem 28 september auch den 29 september gibt
3355639 wenn die sp n glaubt sie kann sich ihre eigene wahrheit zusammenzimmern dann ist das ihre sache die menschen haben hingegen nicht vergessen wer auf ihrer seite stand als es darum ging die soziale k lte buchingers von nieder sterreich abzuwenden und wer buchinger aus rein parteipolitischem kalk l die mauer gemacht hat es war landeshauptmann dr erwin pr ll der das n pflegemodell im sinne der betroffenen ins leben gerufen und umgesetzt hat w hrend die sp mit voller unterst tzung ihrer n genossen den pflegebed rftigen das geld aus der tasche ziehen wollte an dieser wahrheit kommt auch der gehorsamste partei apparatschik der sp n nicht vorbei
3355640 die noch koalitionspartner sp und vp haben sich auf einen linie geeinigt die wir seit dem bekanntwerden des aua rechnungshofberichtes vertreten haben
3355641 die aua privatisierung darf nicht in einem totalausverkauf der sterreichischen interessen enden gerade die sicherung des standortes wien als drehscheibe und headquarter ist entscheidend f r den erhalt tausender arbeitspl tze am flughafen aber auch bei den vielen zulieferern das bz vertritt daher den standpunkt dass die headquarterfunktion in sterreich erhalten bleiben und eine arbeitsplatzgarantie ausverhandelt werden muss
3355642 wir werden von fr h bis sp t in den abend im stra enbild pr sent sein mehr als 4 000 wahlwerberinnen werden der bev lkerung nahe bringen welche ziele und w nsche wir an die politik haben
3355643 seit jahren versuche ich dass diese form der wahlwerbung nicht mehr im stra enbild pr sent ist immer wieder bin ich sehr dar ber betroffen dass unser angebot nicht angenommen wird
3355644 nur gegen jene die vor allem kindern lteren personen oder behinderte gef hrdet und auch f r die autofahrer ein sichtproblem darstellt
3355645 sollten sich darunter dreiecksst nder der sp befinden werden diese von uns umgehend umgestellt oder entfernt denn es ist mir ein gro es anliegen diese gef hrdung so rasch als m glich zu entsch rfen
3355646 denn bei 1 100 stehern pro partei entspricht das fast 9 000 st ck f r wien innerhalb einer zeitspanne von f nf wochen ich m chte erreichen dass die zeit auf vier wochen reduziert wird und die anzahl auf 700 bis 800 steher pro partei zur ckgeschraubt wird
3355647 typisch f r die kulturpolitik der sp ist dass sie konzeptlos viel geld an freunde verschenkt es sollten keine weiteren subventionen von seiten der stadt wien an das birdland flie en
3355648 die suche nach talenten an universit ten und hochschulen ist eine echte herausforderung satyams eigeninitiative engagement und unterst tzung sind sehr lobenswert bisher ist noch kein anderes unternehmen an uns herangetreten um uns mit solchen programmen zu unterst tzen

3355656 afghan political elites are focused more on the struggle for power than governance

3355686 the time that remains is very short so husbands should not let marriage be their major concern happiness or sadness or wealth should not keep anyone from doing gods work those in frequent contact with the things of the world should make good use of them without becoming attached to them for this world and all it contains will pass away in everything you do i want you to be free from the concerns of this life

3355796 for me that happened at quite a young age i had to make major decisions in my life that upset the image i had of myself i had to accept i had to lose the image of myself
3355797 just little things like that change your perspective of who you are
3355798 touring america changed me a lot i became greedy it was all about wants and needs and thats not me as a human being

3355808 after that its just been constant care and attention ive been sober for two and a half years now

3355932 the most important thing is the fact that in 36 of the states women are doing better than they were in 1997 and by better i mean as a comparison of the percentage of women in leadership posts compared with the percentage of women in the state
3355933 if a woman had 10 years that she stayed at home with her family a traditional assessment would have been that she did nothing in those years
3355934 my assessment was different because i know when i was home with my kids i was active in the schools and community organizations and of course you learn a great deal from bringing up children
3355935 it has nothing to with real life nothing to do with justice its politics and politicians
3355936 this is more of a kick at the mayor by the governor
3355937 yes i know chicago is chicago and its a big city and mayor daley is the mayor there but im the governor of all of illinois
3355938 when communities are being dominated by gangbangers i think we have a responsibility to be as helpful as we can
3355939 youd have to strip some section of the state bare to provide enough state police to make any sort of impact
3355940 and its not like there are 200 300 sitting around a barracks somewhere waiting to get a call
3355941 if the idea was there is a need for more police theyd hire more chicago police officers
3355942 absolutely ron george should be thrown out for voting for gay marriage
3355943 he has a very radical view of whats a family
3355944 i really felt that as chief justice i had to have the broad shoulders because i knew there would be substantial controversy about it
3355945 most people thought his legacy would be the modernization of the courts
3355946 i think the gay marriage decision will now be his principal legacy

3355983 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
3355984 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
3355985 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
3355986 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
3355987 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
3355988 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
3355989 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
3355990 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
3355991 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
3355992 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
3355993 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
3355994 who are open to doing something on the production side
3355995 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
3355996 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
3355997 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
3355998 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
3355999 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
3356000 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
3356001 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
3356002 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
3356003 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
3356004 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
3356005 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
3356006 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
3356007 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
3356008 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
3356009 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
3356010 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
3356011 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
3356012 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
3356013 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
3356014 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
3356015 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
3356016 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
3356017 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
3356018 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
3356019 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
3356020 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
3356021 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
3356022 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
3356023 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my hope that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come

3356031 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
3356032 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
3356033 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
3356034 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
3356035 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
3356036 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
3356037 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
3356038 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
3356039 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
3356040 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
3356041 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
3356042 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
3356043 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
3356044 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
3356045 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
3356046 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
3356047 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3356048 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
3356049 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
3356050 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
3356051 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
3356052 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
3356053 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
3356054 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
3356055 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
3356056 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
3356057 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
3356058 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
3356059 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
3356060 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
3356061 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
3356062 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
3356063 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
3356064 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3356065 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
3356066 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
3356067 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
3356068 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
3356069 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
3356070 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
3356071 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
3356072 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
3356073 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
3356074 emissions of greenhouse gases from human activities are changing the atmosphere in ways that affect the earths climate
3356075 the evidence is incontrovertible global warming is occurring if no mitigating actions are taken significant disruptions in the earths physical and ecological systems social systems security and human health are likely to occur we must reduce emissions of greenhouse gases beginning now
3356076 because the complexity of the climate makes accurate prediction difficult the aps urges an enhanced effort to understand the effects of human activity on the earths climate and to provide the technological options for meeting the climate challenge in the near and longer terms the aps also urges governments universities national laboratories and its membership to support policies and actions that will reduce the emission of greenhouse gases

3356095 it is encouraging that the growth in health care costs is going down but there is still more work to be done
3356096 when costs go up as great as this theres a lot of market pressure brought to bear on all of the parts of the market to bring those costs down and i think thats whats been happening over the last six years or so

3356107 we need a jeffersonian revolution if it doesnt happen our democracy will continue to weaken and things will get worse right now we have a two party electoral dictatorship with each party looking for the highest corporate bidder
3356108 a people that values its privileges above its principles soon loses both
3356109 a democracy will continue to exist up until the time that voters discover they can vote themselves generous gifts from the public treasury
3356110 we are not blind we are men and women with eyes and brains and we dont have to be driven hither and thither by the blind workings of the market or of history or of progress or of any other abstraction

3356115 one of the greatest delusions in the world is the hope that the evils in this world are to be cured by legislation
3356116 naturally the common people dont want war neither in russia nor in england nor in america nor in germany that is understood but after all it is the leaders of the country who determine policy and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along whether it is a democracy or a fascist dictatorship or a parliament or a communist dictatorship voice or no voice the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders that is easy all you have to do is to tell them they are being attacked and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger it works the same in any country
3356117 preventive war was an invention of hitler frankly i would not even listen to anyone seriously that came and talked about such a thing
3356118 the purpose of the law is not to prevent a future offense but to punish the one actually committed
3356119 ultimately we need to restore the understanding that in a democracy the rights of citizens to govern themselves are more important than the rights of corporations to make money
3356120 it does not require a majority to prevail but rather an irate tireless minority keen to set brush fires in peoples minds
3356121 when people who are honestly mistaken learn the truth they will either cease being mistaken or cease being honest
3356122 during times of universal deceit telling the truth becomes a revolutionary act
3356123 america will never be destroyed from the outside if we falter and lose our freedoms it will be because we destroyed ourselves
3356124 the things that will destroy america are prosperity at any price peace at any price safety first instead of duty first the love of soft living and the get rich quick theory of life
3356125 democracy is two wolves and a lamb voting on what to have for lunch liberty is a well armed lamb contesting the vote
3356126 whoever controls the volume of money in any country is absolute master of all industry and commerce
3356127 if tyranny and oppression come to this land it will be in the guise of fighting a foreign enemy
3356128 the tyrant grinds down his slaves and they dont turn against him they crush those beneath them

3356135 we are at the parting of the ways we have not one or two or three but many established and formidable monopolies in the united states we have not one or two but many fields of endeavor into which it is difficult if not impossible for the independent man to enter we have restricted credit we have restricted opportunity we have controlled development and we have come to be one of the worst ruled one of the most completely controlled and dominated governments in the civilized world no longer a government by free opinion no longer a government by conviction and the vote of the majority but a government by the opinion and the duress of small groups of dominant men
3356136 facts do not cease to exist because they are ignored
3356137 i believe that banking institutions are more dangerous to our liberties than standing armies if the american people ever allow private banks to control the issue of their currency first by inflation then by deflation the banks and corporations that will grow up around them will deprive the people of all property until their children wake up homeless on the continent their fathers conquered the issuing power should be taken from the banks and restored to the people to whom it properly belongs
3356138 banking was conceived in iniquity and was born in sin the bankers own the earth take it away from them but leave them the power to create money and with the flick of the pen they will create enough deposits to buy it back again however take it away from them and all the great fortunes like mine will disappear and they ought to disappear for this would be a happier and better world to live in but if you wish to remain the slaves of bankers and pay the cost of your own slavery let them continue to create money and control credit
3356139 it was not accidental it was a carefully contrived occurrence the international bankers sought to bring about a condition of despair here so that they might emerge as rulers of us all
3356140 so you think that money is the root of all evil have you ever asked what is the root of all money
3356141 we shall have world government whether or not we like it the only question is whether world government will be achieved by conquest or consent

3356144 while each of us is entitled to his own opinions none of us is entitled to his own facts
3356145 find out just what the people will submit to and you have found out the exact amount of injustice and wrong which will be imposed upon them and these will continue until they are resisted with either words or blows or with both the limits of tyrants are prescribed by the endurance of those whom they oppress
3356146 those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it
3356147 a morsel of genuine history is a thing so rare as to be always valuable
3356148 any intelligent fool can make things bigger more complex and more violent it takes a touch of genius and a lot of courage to move in the opposite direction

3356169 you are directed to come in to the party headquarters and explain your comments and why you should remain a national delegate

3356172 having conversations on the pros and cons of those candidates i dont think this is an unusual thing at all in the democratic party
3356173 anytime we receive a complaint we are required by our rules to hear that complaint and decide whether or not it should be taken to the rules committee

3356175 we have used documents memos other things in the past where complaints have been filed we have used whatever comes to us that does not mean it goes to the rules committee
3356176 i do think there are some delegates on both sides with some wounded feelings because this has been a very difficult hard fought campaign
3356177 from our point its over with shes chosen not to come in and talk with us and so were two weeks away from the convention and well continue to work with the delegates who want to be worked with
3356178 i think that it was calculated to have an impact on other delegates and i think this kind of communication does have a very chilling impact on other delegates because people become afraid to speak up they become afraid to say what they think
3356179 you cant get unity by telling people to shut up

3356296 the conflict has been sparked by the race for control over the pipelines carrying oil and gas out of the caspian region the russians may just bear with the pro us georgian president mikhail saakashvilis ambition to bring his country into nato but they draw a heavy line against his plans and those of western oil companies including israeli firms to route the oil routes from azerbaijan and the gas lines from turkmenistan which transit georgia through turkey instead of hooking them up to russian pipelines jerusalem owns a strong interest in caspian oil and gas pipelines reach the turkish terminal port of ceyhan rather than the russian network intense negotiations are afoot between israel turkey georgia turkmenistan and azarbaijan for pipelines to reach turkey and thence to israels oil terminal at ashkelon and on to its red sea port of eilat from there supertankers can carry the gas and oil to the far east through the indian ocean

3356305 the actions of georgia have led to deaths among them are russian peacekeepers the situation reached the point that georgian peacekeepers have been shooting at russian peacekeepers now women children and old people are dying in south ossetia most of them are citizens of the russian federation as the president of the russian federation i am obligated to protect lives and the dignity of russian citizens wherever they are those responsible for the deaths of our citizens will be punished

3356313 some people have more interesting things to amuse themselves with
3356314 about the rocket firing i think those who are responsible are those who collaborate with israel because there is a consensus by all palestinian groups to respect the truce
3356315 linked to israel as they provide a pretext to exercise pressure on the palestinian people

3356317 man muss schlie lich entscheiden ob der spieler verkauft wird oder im verein bleibt das ist keine einfache frage in dieser woche treffe ich mich mit dem pr sidenten von zenit alexander djukow ich denke wir werden uns schon einigen
3356318 i am absolutely devastated at the loss of jack who was a great friend to me
3356319 one of my biggest regrets is that we didnt have life jackets and i just hope that other people will learn from this tragic accident the importance of safety equipment
3356320 without warning a large wave hit the stern of the boat and jack headed towards me to help me bail out
3356321 as he did so the combined weight of us both caused the stern to submerge and within a matter of seconds the whole of the boat was submerged
3356322 i helped jack to reach a creel buoy and told him to keep hold of that while i swam for help
3356323 i headed for shore all the time thinking i had to make it for my wife and daughter and to get help for jack
3356324 das problem gibt es vor allem m ssen wir in der tat ihr feuer ad quat beantworten
3356325 wir unsererseits werden alles daran setzen dass der frieden im kaukasus m glichst schnell wiederhergestellt wird wir arbeiten darauf hin das szenario zu verhindern das der georgische pr sident den kaukasischen v lkern aufdr ngen wollte
3356326 wir werden diese feuernester hart unterdr cken damit meine ich scharfsch tzen und vereinzelte k mpfer die auf ossetische zivilisten schie en
3356327 das einsatzziel ist erreicht die sicherheit der friedenstruppe und der zivilbev lkerung ist wiederhergestellt der aggressor ist bestraft und erlitt schwere verluste
3356328 durch ein schnelles ausbreiten des krieges im kaukasus k nnte dieser in den n chsten tagen ber die georgischen grenzen schwappen und europa w rde sich mit der schwersten krise an seiner schwelle nach dem zweiten weltkrieg konfrontiert sehen der krieg in jugoslawien k nnte im vergleich zum kaukasischen kessel auf die letzten seiten der geschichtsb cher verschwinden nach der implosion der sowjetunion war die welt einem neuen kalten krieg noch nie so nahe die zweifel an einer r ckkehr russlands unter die weltm chte sind nun endg ltig verflogen die beziehungen zwischen moskau und dem westen werden neu definiert die urangst vor dem russischen b ren hat neuen auftrieb bekommen
3356329 wir die f hrer der fr her versklavten nationen osteuropas jetzt mitglieder der europ ischen union und der nato estland lettland litauen und polen u ern unsere gro e beunruhigung ber das vorgehen der russischen f deration gegen ber georgien als antwort auf die einseitigen milit rischen aktivit ten der russischen streitkr fte werden wir alle mittel nutzen die uns als pr sidenten zur verf gung stehen um sicher zu gehen dass die aggression gegen ber einem kleinen staat in europa nicht verschwiegen oder mit unbedeutenden erkl rungen abgetan wird die die opfer mit den t tern gleichsetzen die eu und die nato m ssen die initiative ergreifen und sich der verbreitung der imperialistischen und revisionistischen politik im osten europas widersetzen
3356330 micheil saakaschwili ist in n ten obwohl er mit seiner rhetorik die weltpresse beherrscht mal von einem klaren sieg mal vom r ckzug der truppen spricht mal von der aggression russlands mal von demokratie und westlichen werten schwadroniert nachdem er demonstrationen zerschlagen wahlbetrug begangen und die s dossetische hauptstadt zchinwali in schutt und asche gelegt hat ist trotz des r ckenwindes aus dem westen eines deutlich zu sehen der georgische pr sident hat sich ordentlich verkalkuliert saakaschwili und georgien haben m glicherweise den gr ten internationalen konflikt seit jahren vom zaun gebrochen der georgische pr sident hat seine w nsche mit der realit t vermischt und er hat sich dabei sichtlich versch tzt so rechnete er nicht ernsthaft mit gegenschritten moskaus oder sein kalk l bestand schlechthin darin russland die aggression in die schuhe zu schieben saakaschwili hat jedenfalls ein m chtiges eigentor geschossen
3356331 russland zeigt offen das bed rfnis seinen einstigen gro macht status zur ckzuerlangen die leichtigkeit mit der die russische f hrung die entscheidung ber die bombardierung georgischer st dte getroffen hat muss schlimmste erinnerungen wecken gerade deshalb entschlossen sich die baltischen l nder die ukraine und aserbaidschan blitzartig zu diplomatischer zusammenarbeit innerhalb der deutschen regierung kann man eine beunruhigende spaltung der positionen zum georgisch russischen konflikt beobachten die deutlich pro russische deklaration des deutschen au enministeriums und die wesentlich gem igteren u erungen aus dem kanzleramt geben zu denken
3356332 nicht nur estland sondern auch die anderen nato neumitglieder m ssen ihre versprechen an georgien halten und die regierungen m ssen russland klar machen dass die allianz auf keinen fall untersch tzt werden darf estland sollte sich auf keinen fall der hoffnung hingeben dass uns nicht dasselbe widerfahren k nnte wie georgien russland hat bereits mehrfach deutlich gemacht dass es seine b rger berall sch tzen will und in der letzten zeit waren wieder h ufig klagen aus moskau zu h ren in estland w rden russen benachteiligt
3356333 dieser krieg war von beiden seiten gewollt und provoziert die regierung in tiflis geht dabei allerdings recht unerfahren vor ein krieg gegen einen m chtigeren nachbarn ist sicherlich nicht die geschickteste art und weise die integrit t seines territoriums zu verteidigen denn die bem hungen in georgien eine demokratie westlichen typs zu errichten und den nato beitritt zu erreichen sind russland ein dorn im auge
3356334 georgien will vern nftigerweise enge verbindungen mit dem westen es sieht die baltischen staaten als pr zedenzfall daf r dass ehemalige sowjetrepubliken die mitgliedschaft der nato suchen der neoimperialismus der von moskau praktiziert wird ist ein klarer grund f r georgien auf dieser strategie zu bestehen russland kann nicht als ein plausibler schiedsrichter in streitf llen in dieser region angesehen werden wenn es nicht die legitimen ziele anderer staaten anerkennt die westlichen regierungen wie jede andere auch wollen keinen konflikt in dieser region aber es hat seinen preis stumme oder zweischneidige botschaften auszusenden russlands verhalten ist unversch mt es sollte gewarnt werden dass es den status eines international ge chteten riskiert sollte es sich nicht zur ckziehen
3356335 von verh ltnism igkeit im sinne der vielen theoretiker und v lkerrechtler kann keine rede sein der brutale einsatz von kampfbombern und raketen gegen georgisches territorium und wohnh user von zivilisten als antwort auf wahrscheinlich provozierte bergriffe gegen sogenannte russische friedenssoldaten zeigt dies berdeutlich verh ltnism ig ist das vorgehen in russischen augen dagegen schon eine bewusst berproportionale reaktion um dem nachbarn eine lektion zu erteilen die dieser nicht vergisst und um dem westen vorzuzeigen dass seine macht enge grenzen hat
3356336 der verlauf der k mpfe zeigt nur wie recht die balten polen georgier ukrainer und andere direkte nachbarn russlands haben nur die feste integration im westen einschlie lich der nato mitgliedschaft bietet schutz gegen russische einmischung
3356337 die diplomatische phase die sich in s dossetien er ffnet wird komplizierter sein als die begonnenen kampfhandlungen jenseits des schicksals einer separatistischen provinz georgiens und bald einer zweiten abchasiens sind es die gesamten beziehungen zwischen russland und dem westen die in der waagschale liegen als f hrer europas befindet sich frankreich in einer hauptposition um eine entscheidende vermittlung f r die zukunft zwischen osten und westen durchzuf hren zwischen den vereinigten staaten und russland spielt die eu die wichtigste rolle indem sie die deutsche initiative bez glich abchasien verl ngert muss die europ ische diplomatie den weg finden eine vermittlung mit moskau zu er ffnen um frieden auf unserem kontinent zu bewahren dies ist eine schwere verantwortung f r die franz sische pr sidentschaft
3356338 europa ist in der georgien frage gespalten und erst am mittwoch wollen die eu au enminister formell ber die krise diskutieren mit hinblick auf das bisherige auftreten der union gegen ber russland besteht wenig anlass zu optimismus zu gro ist die abh ngigkeit von russischen energielieferungen trotzdem muss die eu deutlich machen dass sie das milit rische vorgehen russlands gegen sein nachbarland nicht akzeptiert und ein m gliches druckmittel w re die frage der abschaffung des visumzwangs f r russische b rger
3356339 die entscheidung des georgischen pr sidenten michail saakaschwili zur milit rischen intervention in s dossetien war ein tragischer fehler der staatschef durfte trotz aller provokationen der separatisten das recht nicht in die eigene hand nehmen das gewaltsame vorgehen gegen ossetien ist nicht zu rechtfertigen die entscheidung stellt aber obendrein auch einen politischen fehler dar und daraus versucht russlands ministerpr sident wladimir putin nun kapital zu schlagen
3356340 w re georgien schon nato mitglied wie es vor allem die usa wollten dann h tte die allianz jetzt einen verteidigungsfall amerikaner deutsche kanadier spanier sie alle m ssten den georgiern zu hilfe eilen und die anlaufende invasion der kaukasusrepublik zu beenden versuchen man kann es aber auch weiterdenken w re georgien mitglied der nato kommenden dezember wollten die nato minister ber den beitrittsplan beraten w re es gar nicht erst zu dem krieg gekommen russland h tte nicht gewagt georgien anzugreifen und saakaschwili h tte es sich zweimal berlegt mit freundlicher nachhilfe des westens ob er die anderen nato staaten in einen konflikt um eine winzige separatistenprovinz ziehen darf
3356341 saakaschwili hatte f lschlicherweise angenommen er k nne mit den usa und dem westen im r cken moskau nach seiner pfeife tanzen lassen doch er hat nicht die notwendigkeit gesehen die vor und nachteile seiner handlungen f r die usa und den westen sorgf ltig abzuw gen zwar sind diese immer weiter in den strategischen einflussbereich russlands vorgedrungen aber eine milit rische intervention war gar nicht in ihrem sinne denn die passt berhaupt nicht zu der heutigen zeit in der man auf ausgleich bedacht ist und versucht konflikte auf dem verhandlungswege zu l sen

3356424 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3356425 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3356426 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3356427 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3356428 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

3356430 if the anti democratic individual is disposed to see in the outer world impulses which are suppressed in himself
3356431 and we to know what these impulses are then something may be learned by noting what attributes he most readily but unrealistically ascribes to the world around him it seemed that the greater a subjects preoccupation with evil forces in the world as shown by his readiness to think about and to believe in the existence of such phenomena as wild erotic excesses plots and conspiracies and danger from natural catastrophes the stronger would be his own unconscious urges of both sexuality and destructiveness
3356432 homosexuality is a particularly rotten form of delinquency and ought to be severely punished
3356433 no matter how they act on the surface men are interested in women for only one reason
3356434 the sexual orgies of the old greeks and romans are nursery school stuff compared to some of the goings on in this country today even in circles where people might least expect it
3356435 sex crimes such as rape and attacks on children deserve more than mere imprisonment such criminals ought to be publicly whipped
3356436 a strong inclination to punish violators of sex mores homosexuals sex offenders may be an expression of a general punitive attitude based on identification within group authorities
3356437 but it also suggests that the subjects own sexual desires are suppressed and in danger of getting out of hand
3356438 moralistic and punitive attitude toward the supposed sexuality of others
3356439 the authors investigated the role of homsexual arousal in exclusively heterosexual men who admitted negative affect toward homosexual individuals participants consisted of a group of homophobic men n 35 they were assigned to groups on the basis of their scores on the index of homophobia w w hudson and w a ricketts 1980 the men were exposed to sexually explicit erotic stimuli consisting of heterosexual male homosexual and lesbian videotapes only the homophobic men showed an increase in penile erection to male homosexual stimuli homophobia is apparently associated with homosexual arousal that the homophobic individual is either unaware of or denies

3356461 what is now seen as a universal cold war between science and religion is i think really a more local clash between a particular scientistic worldview much favored recently in the west and most other peoples worldviews at most other times

3356470 this year was a little scary especially trying to catch pop ups that was impossible we learned to be under the ball as it comes down rather than be running to meet it
3356471 he showed me that every time i missed a pitch was because i let my back shoulder go down
3356472 when i kept the back shoulder up i did much better
3356473 the players taught us to never say sorry when we overthrow but then they said sorry every time they did it
3356474 the pitching is interesting learning the overhand baseball pitch and ill never get it down
3356475 its going to be a little more upscale with a seasonal menu and maybe organic
3356476 we saw how many people were coming to fairways caf on the weekends
3356477 and there not many places for people to go to eat aside from good fork and baked
3356478 i didnt even know we had access to that area he said his voice oozing with believability
3356479 what kid wouldnt lie about drinking beer in the backyard
3356480 here we are on the edge of the great precipice again
3356481 it looks like it will be astroland or vacant land and if we go dark it will be sad for coney island
3356482 weve had a successful relationship with them thor and wed like it to continue but we dont know yet
3356483 astroland is signed until january 2009 in the meantime thor remains focused on this seasons summer of hope a season in which thor has already brought the world famous reithoffer shows to coney island sponsored several events including the annual sand castle building competition and continues to provide free admission to astroland for numerous community groups
3356484 the vourderis family own the wonder wheel and the land around it and will be running a family friendly amusement park for generations to come just as they have done for the last 25 years
3356485 not one board member or myself have been contacted about this
3356486 i think you can read between the lines on that one
3356487 the attorney generals office has told us not to give out information
3356488 i dont know of any issues that have come up
3356489 additionally this office is not equipped to conduct investigations grand jury or otherwise
3356490 we employ no investigators rather we rely on police agencies to provide our investigative services
3356491 the das not going to convene a grand jury unless he has something
3356492 its a sad day for this county when the district attorney wont meet with a citizen group
3356493 it seems the district attorney in franklin county is more than willing to investigate wind companies
3356494 i said we had evidence of wrongdoing in steuben county including members of the legislature which is something entirely different
3356495 has anyone ever told you youre like martha stewart on steroids or crack

3356512 ever since charles darwins discovery of giant ground sloth remains in south america debate has ensued about the cause of early extinction of the worlds megafauna now 150 years on from the publication of darwins seminal work the origin of species the argument for climate change being the cause of this mass extinction has been seriously undermined it is sad to know that our ancestors played such a major role in the extinction of these species and sadder still when we consider that this trend continues today
3356513 over all ubs today reported a negative set of figures
3356514 this is probably a conflict where the united states would not be accepted by both sides as a mediator
3356515 the georgians would welcome american participation i suspect the russians would probably not accept us because in moscow we are seen as too close to georgia
3356516 i expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn bombing outside of south ossetia
3356517 it feels to me just like a natural step for us to take
3356518 its always exciting to shake things up a bit and to grow and to do things differently
3356519 weve been challenged at the newsstand recently which is an industry wide trend and the decline pretty much mirrors where we are vis a vis our competitors
3356520 i think people from watching the simple life where i was playing this airhead rich brat kind of character years later people still picture me like that even though im completely different from that
3356521 just getting a role like this is huge for me because i always get offered the same role basically playing myself but this is different i had loads of auditions to do for singing and dancing and acting luckily i nailed them all
3356522 skype is one of the most influential forces in the communications industry and continues to provide innovation as the company and product expands
3356523 that is why i truly believe that attendees of itexpo will really appreciate the presentation from jonathan christensen who will share insights into the future of both skype and the industry as a whole
3356524 communications is shifting rapidly from hard wired hardware dedicated for things like phone calls and faxes to ip connected multi purpose computing platforms including mobile devices that can handle universal conversations
3356525 as the industry does this were seeing a greater opportunity for software that delivers richer multimodal conversations that span chat presence voice video moods sms and file sharing in real time

3356531 shorty after 9 03 p m pacific time the cassini spacecraft began sending data to earth following a close flyby of saturns moon enceladus during closest approach cassini successfully passed only 50 kilometers 30 miles from the surface of the tiny moon
3356532 we are happy to report that cassinis begun sending data home
3356533 the downlink will continue through the night and into tomorrow morning
3356534 there is a lot of anticipation and excitement about what todays flyby might reveal
3356535 over the next few days and weeks the cassini teams will be analyzing the photos and other data to tease out new clues about this tiny active world

3356537 our electronic court records ecr system is a big time saver for kcdc employees and legal professionals who regularly access court records
3356538 the cost savings are huge because countless hours and reams of paper have been cut from the process
3356539 it required a huge amount of space to store our records
3356540 a lot of time was consumed hunting for physical files and moving them around the organization
3356541 every 12 hours the centera servers send me a report on how much data is on them and how much space is available
3356542 currently the total capacity for each is 9539 gb with remaining free capacity of 6038 gb on each one
3356543 some of our police agencies now report probable cause statements to the booking facility using their laptops or a kiosk in the jail and the prosecutor transmits them electronically to the emc information infrastructure
3356544 weve automated the process to the extent that human hands seldom have to touch paper documents and the documents themselves have never existed in paper
3356545 my next big project is to bring more tickets over into our digital system
3356546 we have to pay attention to various different mandated periods for document retention
3356547 centera can be set to automatically delete certain documents when they reach their end of life in compliance with policy and the applicable regulations

3356552 it is my understanding that there are three escalators at 34th street herald square that are not working in sleep mode feature due to warranty related issues and that the fourth is running in normal mode
3356553 someones going to walk on it thinking its not working and then its going to start
3356554 its just that shes not used to it at all
3356555 its not of primary importance to have motion activated escalators
3356556 a group of teenagers were nice enough to ask if she wanted them to carry her
3356557 sure its a good idea to save energy but these escalators are never working anyway
3356558 in fact pnb was able to increase the net after tax value of the escrowed funds by 20 percent over the last five years when 624 million out of a total 658 million in recovered marcos swiss deposits was turned over to the government in 2004 upon orders of the supreme court

3356562 these are precisely the consequences of armed conflict because you are displacing them from their homes families livelihood and basic necessities she told reporters in camp crame
3356563 where unnecessary loss of lives and properties are displayed and the right against internal displacement highlighted she said
3356564 since they were already displaced it would be a further violation of their rights if concerned agencies do not ensure these provisions food shelter clothing she said

3356573 we have an obligation to work diligently to minimize the impact on the academic program
3356574 its important that the governor and legislature not take any actions that would force local governments to raise their local taxes to make up for a shortfall from albany
3356575 i have reached a decision to halt the operation to force the georgian authorities to peace
3356576 the aggressor has been punished and has incurred very significant losses its armed forces are disorganized
3356577 the statement on the halt of the military action by russia is the news we had expected its good news

3356581 referees decisions will tip the scales when athletes are relatively well matched but have relatively small influence when one is clearly superior
3356582 although there is a need for further research including research on the effects of different colours our results suggest a need to change the rules or support referees by providing electronic decision making aids in those sports in which this colour bias may be a problem
3356583 i was under the impression that you could not use the alcohol based markers with an embossed image as there would be a reaction you didnt have any problems

3356586 ive never played singles at the olympics so this has been really cool for me
3356587 every time i walk out there its like im playing in my match but at the same time i have the whole u s team on my side its good i really like that feeling
3356588 obviously its a long ways away but the third round makes it closer im really excited for both of us to be playing really well for the u s
3356589 its hard to train for singles and always dealing with swelling ive just really been playing careful with it i really wanted to be here in whatever capacity it was and it became painfully obvious to me that role was doubles i was very happy to accept that and move forward
3356590 but with the time difference im still waking up like at 5 in the morning so its good i like the early matches
3356591 my way of improving on it is to keep it up
3356592 i played really clean matches in the past the next one would be kind of streaky i dont want to do that any more i just want to keep playing the same consistency
3356593 i felt like any time that i needed to serve well i did if i was down love 30 or a 30 all point
3356594 thats good for me going on in the later rounds that im tough on my serve
3356595 i do think they could have waited a bit if they want a worldwide hit i have them all up here pointing to her beehive

3356601 saya ingin memperjelaskan di sini bahawa tidak ada satu pun pemalsuan dokumen yang pernah saya buat

3356620 quickly otto i dont know how much time we have
3356621 go into my room and on the bookshelf under grimoires is the grimoire of nectrotus bring it to me
3356622 i suppose no one but tell me how could you have been so stupid as to make a portal that connected our world to the netherworld it was foolish at best
3356623 sometimes i feared your big heart would get in the way of common sense
3356624 you always were an annoyance to me even in my weaker human days but i wont have to worry about you or your visions any longer
3356625 thank you for sparing me the trouble of coming after you
3356626 do you remember when the dark one worm broke free and antauri fell into the pool of evil the day we lost him
3356627 the green energy ball that came out of the pit flew both through chiro and the super robot as far as i can tell that green energy was antauri
3356628 so according to my calculations i believe that a piece of antauris very essence was left in the super robot
3356629 fine then i should say give me the cold hard evidence that antauris soul is in the super robot
3356630 i cant sprx im just going on theory besides i sensed a change in the super robot after that day something was different it explains why he was suddenly able to think for himself because he was using antauris essence and the fact that antauri could summon the robot after he was reborn
3356631 okay okay ill buy it so what are we gonna do
3356632 if youre gonna try to kill me could you at least be more accurate
3356633 this is chiros fight let him do what he must do
3356634 under the might of the dark ones your chosen one will be destroyed
3356635 when lin was singing she may not have realized that it was not her own voice

3356638 humpbacks and southern right whales are making a comeback in much of their range mainly because they have been protected from commercial hunting
3356639 this is a great conservation success and clearly shows what needs to be done to ensure these ocean giants survive
3356640 there are a number of potential reasons why proton pump inhibitors might have this effect but we need to do further research to answer those questions
3356641 someone might have very mild heartburn that could easily be managed with other medications such as tums or zantac who are prescribed a proton pump inhibitor
3356642 and then it works but no one ever thinks of stepping down the therapy
3356643 and there are a lot of people we know who arent on these medications
3356644 however there are also people who get prescribed these medications and dont know why there is obviously appropriate use but there is inappropriate overuse and inappropriate underuse
3356645 im comfortable at this point with saying if youre only going to be on this medication a short time dont worry if youre going to be on it a long time the jurys still out as to what you should do
3356646 if youre on one of these medications and think you may be at risk for osteoporosis or you have osteoporosis or youve had a fracture in the past its a good time for you to make an appointment with your doctor to discuss why youre on these medications
3356647 i think the message is that first of all we need a different approach to try to confirm this
3356648 our action plan is targeted and customized to help the most vulnerable meet their urgent needs

3356653 this disturbing set of data will not go down at all well at the bank of england
3356654 hundreds of thousands of families have the threat of negative equity hanging over them and this mornings inflation figures are yet another worrying signal for those desperately trying to make ends meet
3356655 after everything weve heard from the prime minister about his fantastic economic record rpi inflation is five per cent today it was 2 6 per cent in 1997 and cpi is 4 4 per cent today and it was 1 6 per cent in 1997
3356656 with the cost of living soaring and inflation doubling in six months families are crying out for some leadership from their prime minister but all we get is confusion dithering and economic incompetence with the prospect of yet more tax rises
3356657 although it is difficult for the mpc to consider rate cuts while inflation is still rising it should not hesitate to cut rates later in the autumn
3356658 there must be no attempt to undermine the independence of the bank of england even if its decisions prove to be unpopular in the short term

3356660 they were having a wonderful trip they had finished their holiday and were coming home
3356661 at that stage the fighting was still largely in south ossetia but it was about to break in to gori
3356662 we obviously had to re route them away from the central valley
3356663 we have people in some difficult places and sometimes we have to get them out of tricky situations but ive never had to deal with a full advancing army before
3356664 they wouldnt have known much about the war until they got to kutaisi
3356665 at that stage the fighting wasnt as serious as it became but we knew from our experience of that part of the world gori was a possible target
3356666 as it turned out they were literally 48 hours in front of the russian army and directly in its path
3356667 they were very lucky they werent in svaneti this week they would have a very difficult time getting out because its now behind the front line
3356668 they should know georgia will never surrender i directly accuse russia of ethnic cleansing
3356669 the bombs hit in front of us and beside us
3356670 several people were wounded and lying in the street we got straight out of there
3356671 russia has invaded a sovereign neighbouring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century
3356672 there is of course a variety of other measures political or economic

3356674 unfortunately aeci did not have the full support of another employer body
3356675 no one releases their threat modeling results because its the keys to the kingdom
3356676 but were going to show each threat weve found and the mitigations we have for them and then ask people to give us feedback on the whole thing
3356677 we want the feedback on the mitigation while were still in the design and implementation phase when its just a code change on a whiteboard rather than having to go and re architect a component
3356678 it will be useful for the rest of the development world to see what a large complex application looks like when its broken down into components like this
3356679 but we think with the feedback we get from this initiative well have people helping us identify new threats that we havent considered yet
3356680 we want to make this available to smaller development organizations so that they can get started on these kinds of processes as well
3356681 even if they dont have a lot of resources they can use this to teach themselves
3356682 we want the feedback on the mitigation while were still in the design and implementation phase when its just a code change on a whiteboard rather than having to go and re architect a component

3356687 the most recent quarter has been a transitional one for our business we are encouraged by the results of the growth initiatives that weve been working towards such as the continued roll out of our alot toolbar and homepage brand and the continued growth of destination sites like spill com in addition our new miva media technology platform remains on schedule for a us release in the fourth quarter of this year
3356688 it is very complicated and difficult so i am even more happy with the my result
3356689 we read a lot of stuff people say about us and it gets us fired up
3356690 so many articles said the u s team was not going to make it to team finals or if they do there would be no chance of a medal
3356691 anything that got thrown at this team we rolled with it we never counted us out we never doubted ourselves i guess that were all first time olympians we never counted ourselves out
3356692 we felt like we were the only ones who could do this
3356693 i understand when two of the best gymnasts in the world drop out of the team theres going to be some doubt when we first read this stuff we didnt have a chance we were like what but i could kind of see what theyre the media thinking but this is an incredible team we have so much heart and we just put everything out there on the floor today we knew we could do it we pulled it off and now weve got these incredible medals around our necks
3356694 she was really looking forward to the whole season of pulling
3356695 we do not believe the law allows auction sites like ebay to continue to turn a blind eye to this problem while reaping profits from the listing and sale of counterfeit merchandise trademark law does not impose a duty on tiffany to police ebays site ebay designed the site and has the responsibility to police it

3356699 either it is an anti malware solution and the iphone has a switch somewhere to vaporise any app or its not an anti malware solution and is really designed to kill applications that interfere with apples business model such as unsanctioned traffic navigation software

3356708 the greatest problem china faces going forward is not that its government is incurably evil it is the risk that its government will lose the ability to hold things together a problem that encompasses but goes well beyond spiraling decentralization
3356709 chinas pace of change is exposing the weaknesses of its community party and state bureaucracy for several years the governments monopoly on power allowed it to make massive reforms quickly it could direct people and resources where needed but one product of its decisions is economic social and political turmoil and the insular and hierarchical structure of the party makes it less competent to navigate these waters

3356714 instead on the homepage you should flash rotate your bestsellers so that the users can start to see items right away that will draw them in so that they wont leave as quickly
3356715 its fine in the logo but its too bold on the sides
3356716 either make it a lighter shade or a friendly pattern

3356718 the title tag on the homepage should have keywords that can improve your listing

3356730 how do you measure how fast your connection actually is
3356731 you provide 4 10 and 20 mbit the speed i have been getting fits neatly into the definition of the 4 mbit service so what exactly are the 10 and 20 mbit services and why would anyone pay more for them

3356733 the pattern of attacks three in a row during the games with security forces on high alert is an act of defiance that is unparalleled in recent xinjiang history
3356734 the global focus on china is an opportunity for people who believe their plight is ignored and invisible to take action
3356735 the concern here is that at a minimum this is going to add volatility to the region and polarize the uighur and chinese communities
3356736 there is also a fear the government will launch a widespread indiscriminate repressive campaign targeted far beyond the groups advocating use of violence
3356737 we can see that the attackers are merciless fugitives so the government should be on high alert
3356738 because they cannot carry out such attacks in their most desirable cities like beijing they have to turn to local locations
3356739 their methods are quite similar to some other international terrorist attacks

3356742 the sales tax is up to the people and i hope they pass amendment 5 the legislature will decide on what source they will use to replace the current property tax funding i believe amendment 5 will stimulate the economy and bring 12 billion in increased revenue to the state
3356743 amendment 5 is the next step im going to keep fighting hard for the people and for reducing property taxes
3356744 the economy has already started we have a 43 percent increase in home sales on the treasure coast
3356745 i dont think well feel the impact if the amendment is passed until next year and it may be hard for some cities if it passes
3356746 its an unknown revenue source how can the city base a budget when we dont know where the income is going to be coming from
3356747 im sorry crist is for it im vehemently opposed to it because i believe it will close the door for transportation needs if they increase the sales tax with the amendment they would have to increase the sales tax even more if the county wants to improve its transportation system
3356748 hows the economy what can we do to help you

3356768 we have obama and clinton going at it for months after the republican primary has been decided john mccain couldnt buy media attention at that time because everybody is focused on the attributes that obama and clinton were arguing about

3356784 hes had a little bit of experience in the league and gives us a little depth in an area where we need it

3356786 my first thought was obviously how do i get there ive got to get to my wife and ive got to support her
3356787 lifes not fair but its never going to be about that kind of stuff
3356788 at the end of day it happened and it seems the sooner we can come to grips with that the better off were going to be

3356790 i believe random acts of violence are random acts of violence
3356791 there was no indication of any premeditation unfortunately it was a case of the wrong place at the wrong time
3356792 its just hard to imagine a nicer person that this tragic and senseless event could happen to
3356793 this was a man of great personal integrity he stood for the all the right things and he lived them

3356803 you go around and theres been a lot of guys who have helped us get to this point some with limited playing time
3356804 a few of these guys are going to get more at bats and more playing time and we have confidence they will help keep us in the position that were in today
3356805 were still seeking medical opinions to come up with the best course of action
3356806 obviously its a tough situation but this team has shown great perseverance all year and i expect it will continue
3356807 well continue to monitor the waiver wire but this underscores the emphasis that weve placed on depth we havent gotten to this point on the back of any one player its been a team effort all year and i expect that to continue

3356896 im reviewing everything to determine what it is thats blocking us
3356897 perhaps after these games it will be clear they will be the only outliers and have to allow women to compete
3356898 id be surprised and disappointed if we took such draconian action
3356899 all that would do is have the athletes of that country suffer
3356900 i dont think that can be considered parallel to the effort to bring women into absolutely equal gender balance
3356901 the entire gulf region and the whole arab world everyone man and woman should simply work hard at their sport there are no limits at all

3356917 i chose to support the university because i want to do my bit to ensure that future generations are able to enjoy the same experiences that i did during my time at sheffield i have very fond memories of my time there and loved every minute of it i know it s getting financially harder for people to get through university and i would like as many people as possible to have that opportunity i d strongly encourage other graduates to think about making their own donation to support future sheffield students
3356918 we re always extremely touched by the generosity of our alumni and friends because it has a real and visible impact on the work of the university and the lives of its students and staff we hope that as many people as possible will take advantage of the matched funding scheme to help the university maintain its position as one of the leading universities in the uk
3356919 the things i thought were so important because of the effort i put into them have turned out to be of small value and the things i never thought about the things i was never able to either to measure or to expect were the things that mattered

3356957 vandaag nog kernenergie verdedigen is een domme en gevaarlijke keuze
3356958 als er zich een ongeluk voordoet in een kerncentrale kunnen de gevolgen nooit op voorhand worden ingeschat en als het goed fout gaat zoals in tsjernobyl jaren en jaren aanslepen dat is dan nog maar een deel van het verhaal het andere deel is de afvalstoffen die we cre ren en waarvan we tot op vandaag na 50 jaar wetenschappelijk onderzoek in tal van landen nog steeds niet van weten hoe we ze kunnen opbergen het kernafval zal minstens tienduizenden jaren actief blijven en dus tienduizenden jaren lang een hypotheek werpen op de toekomst van onze kinderen en kleinkinderen de vier incidenten waarvan we helaas getuige mochten zijn de voorbije maand in frankrijk bewijzen dat er wel heel wat risicos zijn verbonden aan kerncentrales als er zich ongelukken voordoen valt er steeds een constante op te merken de overheden en de betrokken instanties proberen telkens de accidenten eerst te ontkennen of te minimaliseren na het lek in tricastin maakten de franse autoriteiten het accident pas uren na de feiten bekend en minimaliseerden de impact nochtans lag volgens onafhankelijke onderzoekers de straling honderd keer boven de toegelaten straling voor een heel jaar niet alleen frankrijk heeft te kampen met incidenten in haar kerncentrales maar ook andere europese landen onlangs nog op 16 juni werd bekend dat er al sinds 1988 20 jaar lang radioactieve vloeistof lekt uit de ondergrondse opslagplaats voor kernafval asse ii nabij braunschweig in het duitse nedersaksen het was pas onder druk van de duitse pers dat het helmholtz institute for scientific research staatsbedrijf het lek in asse ii heeft toegegeven in eigen land bleek uit een aantal parlementaire vragen van tinne van der straeten federaal parlementslid voor groen dat er problemen zijn met vaten waarin middelradioactief afval wordt opgeslagen in totaal gaat het hier over 13 000 vaten afval van de vroegere eurochemic fabriek die vaten zijn gestapeld in bunkers bij controle alleen aan de buitenkant van de stapels bleek dat er problemen zijn met maar liefst 91 vaten het niras dat de controles uitvoert stelt dat naarmate de controles vorderen er meer niet conforme vaten opduiken u en ik en niet de elektriciteitssector zullen vele tientallen miljoenen euros moeten betalen om dat afval in nieuwe vaten te steken de uitstap uit de kernenergie zoals die in 2002 beslist werd door de paars groene regering in belgi en door andere regeringen in europa is een logische maatregel het is beter eindelijk werk te maken van een echte energierevolutie groene hernieuwbare gedecentraliseerde energieproductie in een goed werkende energiemarkt dat is veiliger goedkoper en democratischer het is zelfs een must als we willen dat het licht niet uitgaat de uraniumvoorraad is immers ook eindig wetenschappers hebben aangetoond dat de huidige voorraad slechts zal volstaan voor maximaal 50 jaar kernenergie beweren dat kernenergie ons als land energieonafhankelijk zal maken van andere landen is dubbel bedrog ten eerste zijn we voor onze kerncentrales sowieso afhankelijk van frankrijk zie suez en ten tweede zijn we dan misschien wel minder afhankelijk van de opec landen waar olie wordt opgeboord maar wel meer afhankelijk van landen waar het nodige uranium wordt ontgonnen in europa maar niet in frankrijk wordt veel meer ge nvesteerd in hernieuwbare energie dan in kernenergie de financi le markten hebben geen belangstelling voor kernenergie ons land moet in feite kiezen tussen het energiebeleid van frankrijk dat zich vastklampt aan het verleden of het toekomstgericht beleid van duitsland ondanks alles vandaag nog kernenergie verdedigen is een domme en gevaarlijke keuze dom want het vervangt het ene probleem door het andere en gevaarlijk omdat kernenergie niet alleen onze toekomst maar ook die van vele generaties na ons in het gevaar brengt

3357098 the shooting death of a canadian soldier this weekend provides a grim example of how chaotic the security situation can often be in southern afghanistan
3357099 according to coalition military officers a convoy that included groups from two different security companies compass and uspi was traveling the main highway west of kandahar when they passed a group of canadian soldiers engaged in a firefight with taliban fighters in the spin beer district

3357141 luomo vuole essere felice e vuole soltanto essere felice e non pu non voler essere tale
3357142 tutti gli uomini nessuno eccettuato cercano di essere felici per quanto impieghino mezzi diversi tutti tendono a questo fine quel che spinge alcuni ad andare alla guerra e altri a non andarci sempre questo desiderio la volont non fa mai il minimo passo e se non verso questoggetto e il movente di tutte le azioni di tutti gli uomini anche quelli che simpiccano

3357164 listen you cant do that because the five billion creators of this free software will be very angry
3357165 itwire com professionals who work on the basis of billable hours rarely take the time out to write an article for publication unless they have a valid reason for doing so
3357166 the learning curve for linux and freeware is enormous because it involves relearning computing from scratch with software that is not user friendly
3357167 so instead of coming from large reputable companies freeware comes from students underemployed programmers and fly by nighters from distant continents who ask for donations rather than payment who seem to have little idea of what american commercial users want and expect in a professional environment
3357168 windows is typically bundled with the purchase of a new computer buying it that way really only adds about 75 under bulk licenses to computer makers and that is money that cant really be saved by avoiding windows because computers sold without any os or with linux as an alternative are hard to find and dont sell cheaper
3357169 a linux diy installation like a diy auto repair is extremely complex convoluted time consuming and often dicey
3357170 re installations of windows may restore the desired level of functionality at minimal cost and yet provide more utility for middle aged computers that are not powerful enough for new versions of linux

3357175 the good news is that legal greed is used to leverage attorneys to represent their clients to the best of their ability or bill a lot of hours trying
3357176 so for those inclined to try linux for free the break even point is about 15 billable minutes far less time than is needed to actually install it assuming that you find a deal for a computer without a proprietary os
3357177 linux on a desktop pc currently doesnt save money for people with an income of x00 dollar hour
3357178 in one case i went into detail about the article and pointed out some of the areas in which it was deficient in reasoning

3357183 it is a measure of the extreme cowardliness and cynicism of the airport authorities that there was no one from baa in that baggage hall
3357184 there was no one from servisair the baggage handlers whose entirely foreseeable staff shortages had caused the problem the only representative of authority was a nice but increasingly rattled young man from the lost luggage department he knew nothing we offered to mount an entebbe style raid to liberate our luggage and were told we couldnt do that for health and safety reasons
3357185 one of the most snivelling and insincere letters i have ever read
3357186 most assuredly i say to you unless you eat the flesh of the son of man and drink his blood you have no life in you 54 whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life and i will raise him up at the last day 55 for my flesh is food indeed and my blood is drink indeed 56 he who eats my flesh and drinks my blood abides in me and i in him 57 as the living father sent me and i live because of the father so he who feeds on me will live because of me 58 this is the bread which came down from heaven not as your fathers ate the manna and are dead he who eats this bread will live forever
3357187 does this offend you 62 what then if you should see the son of man ascend where he was before 63 it is the spirit who gives life the flesh profits nothing the words that i speak to you are spirit and they are life 64 but there are some of you who do not believe
3357188 therefore i have said to you that no one can come to me unless it has been granted to him by my father
3357189 lord to whom shall we go you have the words of eternal life 69 also we have come to believe and know that you are the christ the son of the living god
3357190 most assuredly i say to you unless you eat the flesh of the son of man and drink his blood you have no life in you whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life and i will raise him up at the last day for my flesh is food indeed and my blood is drink indeed
3357191 we have come to believe and know that you are the christ the son of the living god

3357210 afghan political elites are focused more on the struggle for power than governance
3357211 deals will need to be forged similar to what general david petraeus did with sunnis in iraq
3357212 theres only one communal wide entity in afghanistan that enjoys large support and has the firepower to impose itself and thats the taliban
3357213 they may well stop our air and ground logistics access across pakistan and place our entire nato presence in severe jeopardy
3357214 i am waiting to see the commitments they will make on issues like international justice refugees and how to address the needs of children in crisis around the world
3357215 my visit left me even more deeply convinced that we not only have a moral obligation to help displaced iraqi families but also a serious long term national security interest in ending this crisis
3357216 what we cannot afford in my view is to squander the progress that has been made
3357217 actually we dont disagree as much as youd think i think people assume im a democrat but im registered independent and im still undecided so im looking at mccain as well as obama

3357226 the hispanic community is heavily involved in the operations of hotels with spanish spoken at approximately 90 percent of all hotels in the region
3357227 historically the latino community has not been a major player in ownership largely because of the hotel industrys complexity and understanding of investment opportunities that is why hhoa was founded to educate the hispanic community and provide a forum to exchange ideas and build networking relationships we now have more than 300 members and significant support from the leading hotel companies hhoa members have been involved in the acquisition or development of nearly 50 hotels in the past 12 months and we see that number accelerating
3357228 the event space throughout the hotel had to inspire creativity excite the leaders in attendance foster new internal alliances and encourage attendees to share best practices with one another
3357229 cramer was also charged with using the space to help reinforce brand values among the zurich managers
3357230 we had extremely high hopes for this meeting and cramer more than delivered on its promise to create a world class conference
3357231 our vision and themes were brought to life digitally and were constructed with the expertise and extraordinary quality we expected
3357232 the event space throughout the hotel had to inspire creativity excite the leaders in attendance foster new internal alliances and encourage attendees to share best practices with one another
3357233 cramer was also charged with using the space to help reinforce brand values among the zurich managers we used creative materials signage and inventive fabric sculptures to saturate every area the attendees walked through including the large conference rooms hallways and meeting areas to create an all encompassing zurich experience
3357234 we had extremely high hopes for this meeting and cramer more than delivered on its promise to create a world class conference
3357235 our vision and themes were brought to life digitally and were constructed with the expertise and extraordinary quality we expected the meetings and presentations were a tremendous success and helped reiterate our global brand positioning to our global team in an immensely memorable fashion we are impressed with how cramer helped us communicate these important brand messages to our employees

3357238 as a practical matter in these capital markets we cannot finance this thing today anyway i do not think anybody can if you are trying to build a big property
3357239 we are going into a little bit of a holding pattern while we spend small amounts of money on legal fees and stuff like that to try to inch towards having a project that can be built when the capital markets recover

3357257 separate groups of georgian armed forces are periodically trying to shoot at russian positions in various locations in south ossetia
3357258 we are somewhat perplexed by the modest silence of the belarussian side you need to express yourself more clearly on such issues especially as we have a union state
3357259 let me say at this point that there are no good solutions either we have to try to remove them the russians by force or accept a humiliating defeat
3357260 it is not a happy situation and we did not have to have this situation and i think the bush administration has considerable responsibility for that
3357261 saakashvili was discouraged from attacking russian troops in south ossetia but he clearly never was told point blank if you do it you are on your own
3357262 i think in many respects saakashvili got too close to the united states and the united states got too close to saakashvili
3357263 it made him overreach it made him feel at the end of the day that the west would come to his assistance if he got into trouble
3357264 when you have very thin relations it doesnt give you a lot of diplomatic tools
3357265 there are not a lot of things in terms of u s russian cooperation that we can threaten to stop that the russians care about
3357266 we need somebody much higher to go to tbilisi to demonstrate to russia that we support this government
3357267 at the opening ceremony they cordoned off an area at the back of the stadium for smokers it did last nearly five hours
3357268 id say 70 out of 100 athletes in the olympic village smoke

3357298 some people are surprised that asian swimmers have won gold and silver at this olympics
3357299 but at this games i have won gold and silver and weve had zhang lin china win silver so we have shown the world that we can compete we got got medals and were both asian
3357300 i dont know what happened but when i looked back and saw a few smiling faces i realised i had done it
3357301 i went in with a lot of confidence because i had come second in athens but i still had to shoot my best it was a close call but at least it went in my favour
3357302 no longer will a gold medal surprise us never again will we plead with the constellations to allow luck to go our way

3357308 this rise just confirms what our members have been telling us for months they are facing unparalleled hikes in the cost of basics like milk bread cheese petrol gas and electricity
3357309 the governments unjust public sector pay policy means that teaching assistants nurses librarians care workers home carers nursery staff and hospital cleaners are having to cope with the biggest rise in inflation since records began on a real pay cut
3357310 instead of targeting the public sector workers who keep this country running smoothly the government should turn their firepower on to the big city bonuses and corporate fat cats who are the real villains when it comes to fuelling inflation
3357311 inflation is impacting on the economy differently in different sectors
3357312 food manufacturing for example is being squeezed leading to severe job losses other sectors like oil and energy are printing inflation by hiking prices
3357313 even when their costs are falling they are slow to pass these lower prices to consumers
3357314 while the victim did not require hospital treatment he still sustained injuries as a result of this apparently unprovoked assault and he is understandably shaken by his ordeal
3357315 the three suspects were noticeably drunk and we are appealing for anyone who witnessed the assault or who saw the suspects that evening to get in touch
3357316 in particular we are keen to speak to a couple who tried to help the victim and a woman who was walking with her three children and may have seen what happened
3357317 he saw this picture and obviously for him it was very easy recognising the girl accompanied by a woman in a veil
3357318 i am very pleased that this little girl has been identified clearly for kate and gerry it is a disappointment but we have had many of these before and the search for madeleine will continue
3357319 stop the operation to force the georgian authorities to peace
3357320 the security of our peacekeepers and civilians has been restored the aggressor has been punished and suffered very significant losses its military has been disorganised
3357321 if there are any emerging hotbeds of resistance or any aggressive actions you should take steps to destroy them
3357322 i think what you have confirmed here is good news a ceasefire now has to take shape
3357323 the coaches are for those britons who are unable to make their own arrangements to leave the country mainly families with children or the elderly
3357324 the guy whos on hunger strike for some political cause is still relying on his midbrain dopamine neurons just like a monkey getting a treat
3357325 his brain simply values the cause more than it values dinner
3357326 its clear that you need some way to compare your options even if your options come from very different categories
3357327 but apparently my thumb is beyond the limits of science
3357328 i spent a lot of time thinking about how the brain should work if i had designed it
3357329 you cant have all these cells interacting with each other unless theres some logic to the interaction
3357330 it just looked like noise though no one could crack the code
3357331 there are so many different ways to describe what the brain does
3357332 you can talk about what a particular cell is doing or look at brain regions with fmri or observe behavior but how do these things connect because you know they are connected you just dont know how
3357333 you cant really understand the brain until you understand how these social behaviors happen or what happens when they go haywire
3357334 we are what we think all that we are arises with our thought with our thoughts we make our world
3357335 everybody seen that it was the perfect time to do this they dont have to pay for advertisements and promotion so he did that dude came and shook my hand and i guess hes mad because i call myself the president because i am the president of h town i run this city
3357336 after we shook hands and had words he went his way and i went my way next thing i know he snuck up behind me and tried to swing at me

3357338 the generators used in solar thermal are the same as coal fired generators
3357339 they provide reliable power from when the sun comes up in the morning to when the sun goes down at night
3357340 at around 10 investors would not be too enthusiastic 20 is better and 50 is a very strong signal
3357341 the ideal location for a thermal solar power station is a desert type location you want maximum solar with the least cloud cover or interference and our dry desert locations are ideal
3357342 no civilization can survive the physical destruction of its resource base

3357725 t he grand jury records are the sole government documents regarding the rosenberg case to remain secret
3357726 concerned that this process may not be capable of providing adequate protection against hazards that will only come to light once the spacecraft is in operation
3357727 that has made some folks uncomfortable but guess what were not done yet
3357728 if we tried to please everybody the spacecraft would not get off the ground
3357729 the positive sentiment seen at the end of first quarter 2008 that the credit crisis may be easing was short lived as trading conditions deteriorated significantly in the second half of may in particular for assets related to u s residential real estate as well as other structured credit positions
3357730 this occurred in the context of continuing credit market turbulence and its impact on the firms operating performance and reputation
3357731 the uncertain near term outlook for global financial markets and potential changes in regulatory capital requirements
3357732 our review has clearly revealed the weaknesses associated with the integrated one firm business model
3357733 some of these weaknesses such as the blurring of the true risk reward profile of individual businesses are the source of substantial risk as we have seen in the past few months
3357734 i am determined to make the management of ubs more effective
3357735 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
3357736 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
3357737 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
3357738 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
3357739 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
3357740 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
3357741 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
3357742 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
3357743 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
3357744 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
3357745 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
3357746 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
3357747 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3357748 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3357749 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
3357750 the show that made phrases yada yada yada master of your domain shrinkage and no soup for you part of american culture is every bit as compelling today as it was during its original run
3357751 seinfelds continued strength with the adults 18 49 demographic coupled with its growth among a new generation of viewers is a testament to the programs superior quality timelessness and longevity as a result we think the seinfeld campus tour will serve as the ideal way to reinforce the shows iconic comedy and perpetual humor among college students and participants across the country
3357752 not only did we judge the esteemed members on their voting records for supporting working families we also examined the benefits that their own employees receive like paid leave and flextime
3357753 there are no rules about flextime or paid leave for congressional staff they are stepping up voluntarily because they believe in progressive policies and act on their beliefs in the real world managing their staff
3357754 the recipients of the best of congress award serve as models for what can be accomplished through legislation and a personal commitment to policies that benefit working families
3357755 as our nation wrestles with a host of economic and other issues involving working families these members of congress deserve to be congratulated and recognized nationally for their leadership and support
3357756 on the basis of your report ive decided to conclude the operation to force the georgian authorities into peace
3357757 the aim of the operation has been achieved the safety of our peace keeping forces and the civilian population has been restored
3357758 the aggressor has been punished and has suffered very significant losses
3357759 we can discuss the question of a definitive settlement if two conditions are met
3357760 first georgian troops should return to their initial position and be partly demilitarised second we need to sign a binding agreement on non use of force
3357761 i think what you have confirmed here is good news a ceasefire now has to take shape
3357762 we must draw up a rapid calendar so that each side can go back to the positions of before the crisis
3357763 as you can see i did not listen to all the advice of all those who told me not to come
3357764 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
3357765 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
3357766 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
3357767 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
3357768 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
3357769 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
3357770 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
3357771 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
3357772 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
3357773 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
3357774 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
3357775 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
3357776 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
3357777 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
3357778 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
3357779 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
3357780 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
3357781 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
3357782 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
3357783 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors

3357786 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3357787 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3357788 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
3357789 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
3357790 ate here last night check it out before it gets discovered
3357791 the freedom to travel anonymously is fundamentally important to our right to peaceably assemble
3357792 and they made it clear that my reasons for not having id would be a factor

3357794 investing in the asia pacific region and especially china represents another step in our journey to transform schering plough into a global high performance health care company with a long term presence in china schering plough now takes a significant step forward in its strategic development to further build growth and strength in this important market
3357795 our long standing relationships with our former joint venture partners shanghai pharmaceutical industry co ltd and shanghai pharmaceutical group co ltd have been an integral part of the successful establishment of schering plough in china
3357796 we have built a solid foundation in the chinese market which continues to offer great potential todays news demonstrates our commitment to partner with our customers and to further contribute to the health care needs of chinese patients
3357797 i wouldnt for the world go around making fetishes yet i am unable to feel that a writer can be complete without humor and i dont mean by that and you know it perfectly well the creation or the appreciation of things comic i mean that the possession of a sense of humor entails the sense of selection the civilized fear of going too far a little humor leavens the lump surely but it does more than that it keeps you from your respect for the humor of others from making a dull jackass of yourself humor imagination and manners are pretty fairly interchangeably woven

3357799 the important thing to remember right now is to call your insurance professional first
3357800 let them handle the claims process is the ideal way to do it you have the right to choose your own contractor but we would strongly recommend that you get in touch with your insurer and ask them who they would recommend that you use
3357801 javo is at an inflection point we believe the company is in the beginning stages of explosive growth the company is on pace to have more than 10 000 hot and iced beverage dispensers installed by year end which amounts to approximately 35 to 45 million in consolidated annual revenues on a go forward basis we strongly believe in the companys prospects and believe javo is one of the best small cap companies investors will come across
3357802 i turned around to my dad and said thats exactly what i want to do
3357803 he goes its not how many times you get knocked down but its how many times you get back up and go forward carl latz said his son told him
3357804 and i told him thats exactly what this is all about and if nothing else this letter just taught you a life lesson
3357805 well the law prohibits it and the legislature enacted the laws to protect the health safety and welfare of all children
3357806 it seems totally unbelievable that somebody would even go to that extreme to send a letter to somebody let alone looking to find something about child labor laws
3357807 if my doors close and i never open again and this boy becomes successful then i will be the happiest person in the world
3357808 its strange that a kid at this age would glean onto this particular kind of music and show the intensity and kind of the ability to function as kind of 8 year old blues guy
3357809 it would be unusual to find an 8 year old who can play joe satriani licks
3357810 ive had more people tell me they say its a kids body but it has a 70 year old dude inside
3357811 i think its so much you can do on the guitar
3357812 because i got more inspiration i got more sadness in me
3357813 the hispanic community is heavily involved in the operations of hotels with spanish spoken at approximately 90 percent of all hotels in the region
3357814 historically the latino community has not been a major player in ownership largely because of the hotel industrys complexity and understanding of investment opportunities that is why hhoa was founded to educate the hispanic community and provide a forum to exchange ideas and build networking relationships we now have more than 300 members and significant support from the leading hotel companies hhoa members have been involved in the acquisition or development of nearly 50 hotels in the past 12 months and we see that number accelerating
3357815 increasing the share of clean energy globally and making personal mobility more sustainable are two tremendous challenges we face today
3357816 this will benefit not only our environment but also the economy the icelanders who will buy electric cars in the coming years can reload them during the night for a few dollars compared to the cost of filling up your cars at the petroleum station today these will involve enormous savings for ordinary people and the entire nation i am therefore pleased to be able to give my support to initiatives focusing on energy solutions such as the driving sustainability conference
3357817 these are tremendous production numbers and all the credit goes to john brownlie and his team in mexico he was able to increase our gold production while the upgrades and expansion were taking place
3357818 we continue to be on target to meet our stated goal of a 70 000 ounce production rate in 2009
3357819 we have installed additional carbon columns giving us the capacity we require for future planned production additionally the acid wash module will be commissioned next week followed by the carbon strip module and the refinery upgrades
3357820 the final component a new carbon regeneration kiln is being manufactured in the u s and is scheduled for an october delivery once completed we will be able to process solution at a rate in excess of 70 000 ounces per year of gold production

3357826 it was an opportunity to go over to china and do something that has probably not been done in the past go to china and do some comedy
3357827 there were days when we got promising news and days when we got not so encouraging news
3357828 but we decided to stick it out until the end and it paid off
3357829 our motto was lets just go until they tell us to stop
3357830 there were moments where you were just being watched very closely
3357831 we still did what we wanted to do but i was hurrying it up saying come on come on lets go it was a subconscious thing
3357832 jon always has a very good sense of whats in good taste and bad
3357833 and well try to stay within the bounds of what we think is good taste we didnt go in there to make fun of the chinese people at all
3357834 the implications of russian actions go beyond their threat to the territorial integrity and independence of a democratic georgia

3357840 based on a unique and sustainable model with built in competitive advantages diversified and rapidly expanding sales revenue profit growth and target market penetration
3357841 research leads us to conclude that for investors avts current valuation means significant returns at an unsustainable discount having done our homework this company is down 70 percent from last year while having markedly increased sales and revenue growth during the same period
3357842 we are seeing demonstrated evidence of the application and integration of technology and the adoption of avts technology being driven by value added business solutions that the companys end users and customers are quick to recognize
3357843 we are pleased with this recognition combined with recent buy recommendations from the prestigious pechalas reports and lenny dykstras respected wall street investment advisor we believe it shows that those who follow stocks closely realize both the achievements and the enormous potential at avt

3357846 the limestone county jail population continues to soar the population this year is exceeding all expectation
3357847 last year we optimistically increased the budget for housing inmates outside our jail from 300 000 to 400 000
3357848 we are already well over that number and the fiscal year isnt over until the end of september we are looking at having to budget between 800 000 and 1 000 000 for the next year our jail population now stays well above 100 inmates

3357855 unlike some other healthcare trend surveys aon consultings survey reports the expected future increase in employer provided health plan claims cost before any plan changes based on the opinions of health plan actuaries
3357856 we provide this trend data to help employers evaluate the competitiveness of health insurance premium renewals for employers with self funded health plans this trend data helps them and their actuaries develop future claim estimates for budgeting purposes
3357857 while the medical trend rate is still more than twice the consumer price index it is encouraging to see that health care cost rate increases are continuing to slow down this is a step in the right direction for companies nationwide that continue to feel significant health care price pressures
3357858 but more must be done to truly stem the tide of rising health care costs this includes greater senior management support for these programs better employee communications and more consistent cooperation from the medical community
3357859 we are encouraged by the increase in our same store net operating income despite lower same store sales as expected our investment in new stores in houston dallas and st louis added additional revenue and operating expenses which contributed to the loss in the quarter and six months we may continue to operate at a loss and our cash on hand may decrease as a result of the early operating losses at the new stores until they achieve the test volume necessary to break even we are working extremely hard with our new store projects and look to improve on our results going forward

3357883 declaration about intentions for the further stages of development of kashagan oilfield choice of the land for on land set up for oil preparation and choice of the routes of pipelines
3357884 presented declaration does not meet the requirements of nature protection legislation does not ensure ecological safety preservation of biological resources of the caspian sea does a harm to environment and health of the population of the region
3357885 presented project was worked out by agip kco company it is the first stage of the assessment of its impact on environment the title itself does not correspond to the essence of the presented documents as there is an issue of not only choice of an on land plot and choice of the routes for pipelines but also an issue of the full scale development of the biggest unique kashagan oilfield which is situated in the kazakhstan shelf of the caspian sea earlier presented documents strongly differ from the ones that we saw we were presented again this project and we saw big differences
3357886 the company settles all technological lines linked with sulphurreted hydrogen processing developing of oil and gas directly in the sea at the artificial islands what was changed compared to the previous concept and a great number of engineering objects will appear

3357896 a british rate cut within the next couple of months looks well off the agenda
3357897 the largest upward pressure in july came from food and non alcoholic beverages where prices rose this year but fell a year ago
3357898 within this division there were large upward effects from meat bread and cereals and vegetables
3357899 this is a really disturbing set of data that will not go down at all well at the bank of england
3357900 the rise in consumer price inflation to a series high of 4 4 percent in july was well above expectations
3357901 although it is difficult for the mpc to consider rate cuts while inflation is still rising it should not hesitate to cut rates later

3357919 most criminal prosecutions occur when a person subject to usdot regulations has intentionally provided false or fraudulent records or statements to the agency
3357920 examples would be driver records maintenance records application forms and in some circumstances statements to inspectors and investigators
3357921 such tragedies are becoming all too common and many of these deadly accidents are preventable
3357922 it certainly would appear to me theres reason to believe that seatbelts wouldve saved lives in this particular tragedy

3357930 we have decided that georgia will leave the cis we urge ukraine and other countries to also leave the commonwealth of independent states which is dominated by russia
3357931 the 32 and 42 inch plasma tvs were very effective in their respective market positions during the second quarter

3357938 were really working hard and i really think were getting somewhere
3357939 qantas discovered an irregularity with paperwork for these aircraft during an internal integrity check of maintenance records
3357940 in line with our prudent response to any maintenance issue however minor we have elected to suspend the operation of the six aircraft while we ensure all our records are 100 per cent accurate and we have advised the civil aviation safety authority casa
3357941 we regularly check our records and detect a record keeping anomaly on average once a year
3357942 it used to be that 50 watts per square foot was very dense but now we are doing 200 300 watts per square foot without blinking an eye and there is talk of going to even more dense configurations
3357943 that starts putting more strain on the infrastructure to deliver airflow that can do that level of cooling
3357944 five years ago i stayed up nights worrying about how space constraints would hinder my business and data center growth
3357945 but with form factors shrinking concerns about space were replaced by concerns about heat density
3357946 with the tremendous heat loads we have to get rid of the heat more efficiently which means getting the cooling closer to where the heat is generated
3357947 in general this means running something out there that will remove the heat water or refrigerant
3357948 the campus data center could provide us with only about 5kw per rack and enough cooling for that amount of equipment
3357949 we go a lot more dense than that about 20kw per rack so they were not able to meet our needs
3357950 all my systems are now working at a consistent level
3357951 for the most part we are keeping them all at 72 f
3357952 i have dealt with smaller data centers 20 to 30 cabinets where it was decided that doing the entire data center in liquid cooled cabinets made sense
3357953 but when you start getting up into the hundreds or thousands of cabinets in a large data center we have far better solutions today than to do the entire room in liquid cooled cabinets
3357954 if a facility is well designed and the return air is pretty hot the outside temperature will be more favorable for energy than the return air from the hot aisles
3357955 you have the choice to switch to outside air and keep the chiller plant operating or as the outside air temperature drops even more you have the option to save even more money by turning off the chiller plant
3357956 i log onto the resorts web site in order to make some reservations ahead of our arrival

3357958 the most disappointing thing the most incredible thing is that nobody caught it
3357959 we will continue to be vocal about the destructive effect of this film we are asking people not to go to the movie and hope to bring a consciousness to people about using derogatory words about this population
3357960 its sort of edgy territory but we felt that as long as the focus was on the actors who were trying to do something to be taken seriously thats going too far or wrong that was where the humor would come from
3357961 the joke is on actors reaching for roles in terms of hopefully winning awards
3357962 some people have taken this as making fun of handicapped people but were really trying to make fun of the actors who use this material as fodder for acclaim
3357963 the last thing you want is for people to think youre making fun of the victims in this who are having their lives turned into fodder for people to win oscars
3357964 movies about the mentally retarded is something we talked about for a long time my grandfather was adopted by a mentally retarded man a man who shouldnt have been allowed to adopt a kid
3357965 when he saw forrest gump you never saw a guy angrier than him it was not such a picnic to be raised by that guy
3357966 the film is in no way meant to disparage or harm the image of individuals with disabilities we have had productive discussions with representatives of disability advocacy organizations and look forward to working with them closely in the future
3357967 however no changes or cuts to the film will be made
3357968 da h ngen ja familien dran wenn mir in 10 jahren gesch tzte 2400 einwohner fehlen k nnen wir hier im erzgebirge bald den schl ssel rumdrehen
3357969 he opened his eyes on his own and looked at his wife rhonda
3357970 she called his name and he opened his eyes and nodded to her she smiled at him and told him dont leave me he shrugged his shoulders and she said thats when she knew he was tired he signaled to her that his body was tired
3357971 i think he will always be remembered as one of the original kings of comedy
3357972 i think what made him so special to people was that even though he was a celebrity he just seemed so down to earth and so much like a part of your family
3357973 he was a hard man and he made no apologies for that
3357974 when it came to me and my mother and my daughter he was the softest
3357975 he represented a kind of hood attitude and cultural phenomenon that was under exploited in america but had great potential
3357976 he was always honest and that honesty was what he exuded and what made him so great
3357977 its a terrible loss i mean you need funny in your life at all times he was definitely one who brought it one of the best comedians ive ever really experienced and condolences go out to everyone in his family
3357978 bernie is just ridiculous with it or he was so god bless his family god bless his soul but bernie was that dude for real so rest in peace man
3357979 the rate of internet connection is expanding so that consumer bandwidth is eventually going to be what telephone cable is for all of us now it is rapidly losing its exclusivity and gaining availability immensely everyday

3357982 there are things that we did with watchmen that could only work in a comic
3357983 lets just make some versions of that with photoshop magic and re create them almost exactly
3357984 i lost my mama i went through so much drama i went through so much drama im for obama
3357985 its not a black or white thing its not a rap or rock and roll thing
3357986 its a good music thing we jam about good things from the heart how can you pick between me and trent reznor
3357987 i hope you had a good time f that the time of your life
3357988 not like the writers and producers at motown or quincy jones but he was on that level in my opinion
3357989 he gave me my voice he taught me showed me and nurtured my voice he didnt teach me how to sing he taught me how to be a better singer that was isaac
3357990 he didnt have a choreographer he didnt have a show
3357991 isaac would just get up there and sit down and become one with the song he was doing and you would look out and the women would be hanging on every word it made me wish my voice was that deep
3357992 i met isaac hayes when i was on the road with james brown in the 70s
3357993 we played a few festivals together in my later years i got to know the man behind the music he was the first official black man to be known as a real rapper and he had nothing but praise for his queens and women of the world
3357994 hayes was so musically advanced and timeless in his compositions he was loved and appreciated by so many he was an enduring symbol of the struggle of the african american man and was a shining example of soul at its best
3357995 although he was under the weather he was still performing
3357996 he was the man he had the show must go on spirit in his absence he will be remembered through his great music he will forever be in our hearts and souls
3357997 i am deeply saddened by the loss of isaac hayes a true historic world music figure
3357998 isaac hayes was the first african american to win an oscar for a music score but never lost sight of his commitment to his community and the betterment of mankind he was more than an artist he was a trailblazer he was an innovator
3357999 i tried to be as real as i possibly could
3358000 and i keyed in on the character shaft the character himself
3358001 i think the songs out there today when the kids talk about romance i think theyre too blatant they dont leave enough for the imagination
3358002 i like to use metaphors thats right and take it slow and easy and then build its kind of like foreplay you dont want to get there too soon else its all over its like eating candy just gobbling it down and then i want some more and its gone you have to savor it
3358003 o impacto da converg ncia digital no comportamento do consumidor e do mercado
3358004 lenovo has engineered a new breed of mobile workstation with the thinkpad w700

3358006 warped tour was great but we cant wait to get back into venues that actually have roofs over our heads and arent 110 degrees
3358007 touring with the roots was something weve wanted to do for a while and were real excited its finally happening and estelle opening things up its over tour of the year fans are in store for a real special treat who knows whats gonna happen out there
3358008 tomorrow the new record releases its just a really amazing time in our lives
3358009 were so excited were going to go to virgin megastore across the street and wait in line a little bit longer
3358010 we do anything for our fans and we owe everything we have to them
3358011 we cant tell what were performing but it will be our second single
3358012 these monsters had started to eat me up on the inside
3358013 for us to accomplish that mission we needed to shed a lot of extra baggage
3358014 we needed to focus a little more we needed to make quicker decisions we needed to be ok saying no to certain stuff and we needed to weed through stuff quicker
3358015 one of the coolest things was rick actually suggested that we all stand up and rock out like we would live
3358016 and we did and it put a lot of life into the basic tracking of it all it was almost to the point where when i was retracking stuff i was standing up headbanging id never done that in a recording situation before hes a great song doctor and he has great ears
3358017 the great thing about working with rick is hes never around
3358018 i would say thats a very strong point in that it leaves the four of us to take on the entire brunt of the work and the planning that goes into the songwriting process and the recording process
3358019 bob would add a lot of his own musical input and with that came a lot of his own influences and style and jurisdiction and idiosyncrasies
3358020 and it would eventually make it into our sound but with rick because he wasnt there its almost 100 percent undiluted metallica hed come in and say thats good that isnt change that and we would have to figure that out for ourselves this is the most pure weve sounded in a long time
3358021 rick is not the kind of producer like a bob rock whos there every moment holding your hand making you step up
3358022 rock arranged everything all the time and wore many hats in the studio rick rubin no hat rick comes in and goes well wheres the songs ok thats good thats not so good more of this less of that see you in a few months goodbye and thats what we needed that brutal honesty to get through it and it worked
3358023 the slipknot that he did the system of a down records he did and even the johnny cash stuff where its the essence of him and you hear him you hear whats going on thats what i want i want people to really hear metallica
3358024 so in a way its got somewhat of an older sound songs and arrangement wise weve got a lot more diversity on the record instrumentals fast shorter songs epic ballady moments its quite different from st anger where if youre angry this is your album and if youre not it might take some work

3358050 i dare you to move like today never happened today never happened before
3358051 other than that weve been quite aggressive in selling pubs
3358052 there are very few people driving to this festival its a huge mass transit event and i think that alone must save a tremendous amount of fuel and help from an emissions standpoint
3358053 i think its great how transportation by ferry is being so encouraged
3358054 and they made it really hard to get parking passes so that keeps it green
3358055 the line was so long i was like what is this
3358056 that takes a lot of extra effort and extra money but the artists were very conscious about not throwing stuff away
3358057 were not adding tons of plastic and paper plates backstage but its a small thing and theres probably a ways to go there
3358058 my girlfriend drives a hybrid and i quit turning my lights on when i go to the restroom
3358059 these artists are out there not to beat people over the head but to increase awareness of a lot of different issues
3358060 in a pretty easy way it creates a little consciousness about what happens when you throw it away
3358061 lets pick it all up lets get a little reward for doing so and it will also keep the grounds looking a lot nicer for everyone throughout the weekend
3358062 i had butterflies in my stomach since i left atlanta i knew my family would all come and i should have known theyd bring the whole town
3358063 this is my way showing my perseverance and tenacity this is my beast
3358064 i came home and wrote the whole song myself i have been rapping pretty much all my life i didnt know i had the gift but the gift had been with me
3358065 when i was in high school i was focused on being a lyricist my lyrics were mind blowing to the people i was rapping around
3358066 when you rap against southern rappers theyre talking about riding in their car with big rims i had a lot of punch lines
3358067 they would always tell me the honest truth either they wouldnt mess with it because they had so much going on at the time or it wasnt what they were looking for
3358068 i was like if yall dont like this im giving up
3358069 right now they got a lot of dances out theres not a particular dance that goes with the song so when it comes on you just do what you wanna do to it
3358070 im so explicit but i cant help it my flow is ridiculous the boy got a gift like its gotta be christmas
3358071 its still punch lines but now its more universal i see the bigger picture i want everybody to understand me
3358072 my style is southern because i was raised here but im snapping you can tell when you hear me rap that i have a northern influence
3358073 my last album lost hotel was about soul searching and finding a new direction in my life
3358074 this record is about being happy with your life even within all thats going on inside and around us it reflects my hope that theres a better future for us all and finding a better place a peaceful place while the world seems as if its going in the other direction its not a record you can listen to once and get everything its about
3358075 the old school rule of rocknroll get some friends together and start a band
3358076 it seemed to make much more sense and be so much more fun to me to have some success by playing on the road its such a great way to do it and it shows you every aspect of a career
3358077 im a big fan of bruce springsteen and how he did it before he became nationally known its fun to build it from ground zero and watch it grow
3358078 i feel like what i am good at is taking something thats in my head or that i want to write about and creating music that means something to people
3358079 i like for everything to not be taken for granted but im also not always serious and when i play live i want the audience to have as good a time as i do making music for them
3358080 i just keep doing what i am doing and stick to it
3358081 even around the making of the first album i wanted to call this one down to earth
3358082 jeff actually loves making all types of music which is awesome we really clicked
3358083 hes an old friend and he has a great musical sensibility so i thought it would be great to do some tracks with him
3358084 i was thinking along the lines of edge 1 for any hardcore fans still out there 1991 uk dance movement led by the prodigy preceded drum n bass and gregs electronic skills were perfect
3358085 my first version of that song was so sexy it was ridiculous
3358086 i just had this vision of two people meeting on the dance floor and basically wanting to ravish each other right there
3358087 i had never heard of astley but the song was so beautiful it just hit my heart
3358088 part of what i love about music is because im not trained in a certain way i dont have worries about can you do this or that
3358089 it was just about having a different texture and flavor on the chorus
3358090 why not i remember listening to french hip hop and having no idea what they were saying but really loving the melody and the tracks
3358091 ever since watching there will be blood ive been thinking about daniel day lewis
3358092 the vehicle just rolled off a hill from what i understand
3358093 this is making us look at each and every job
3358094 it took us a couple of years to get to this point
3358095 while we are confident in our safety protocols and procedures we are reviewing them to determine if there are other steps or policies that can be implemented that go beyond the existing standards to better detect prevent or deter these types of events in the future
3358096 there has never been a tool published a set of questions to ask a blood test to run there has never been an instrument or a tool to predict who will kill themselves and who wouldnt
3358097 its not surprising at all considering what happened to our son
3358098 the system just failed him whatever the systems supposed to be
3358099 but minor infections rashes colds flu earaches eye irritation those are just some of the things you could come to mdweblive for
3358100 without the actual drive time the wait and the like
3358101 you see the physician first establish patient physician relationship do a complete physical exam
3358102 you can utilize the online consultation as an adjunct in your relationship but not as a substitute for your relationship
3358103 look into the nose for example if you think sinus touch the sinuses if theres any sensitivity
3358104 its all about where you put the horizon said the great john ford to the young man rising
3358105 its where to plant the camera and when to say action when to print the legend and when to leave the facts in
3358106 cause the point of a gun was the only law that liberty understood when it came to shooting straight and fast he was miii ghtyyyy good
3358107 he stripped his woman he stripped her bare but there was a pterodactyl there
3358108 he stretched the creatures mouth until it split then like a child began to play with it
3358109 the only thing we knew for sure about henry porter is that his name wasnt henry porter
3358110 oh if theres an original thought out there i could use it right now
3358111 to put the world in order we must first put the nation in order to put the nation in order we must put the family in order to put the family in order we must cultivate our personal life and to cultivate our personal life we must first set our hearts right
3358112 we can store drop filter mutilate grope or modify data heading to you
3358113 we construct the man in the middle attack on the internet
3358114 internet routing is inherently trust based we told the route that we know the best way to an address a hacker could blast a lot of spam or launch a lot of phishing attacks
3358115 you can hijack stuff from china or the opposite it may already be happening who could tell
3358116 in the face of russian aggression the very existence of independent georgia and the survival of its democratically elected government are at stake
3358117 must understand the severe long term negative consequences that their governments actions will have for russias relationship with the us and europe
3358118 no matter how this conflict started russia has escalated it well beyond the dispute over south ossetia and invaded another country
3358119 i reiterate my call for russia to stop its bombing campaign to stop flights of russian aircraft in georgian airspace and to withdraw its ground forces from georgia
3358120 in condemning this aggression and seeking a peaceful resolution to this crisis
3358121 the un must stand up for the sovereignty of its members and peace in the world
3358122 let me be clear we seek a future of cooperative engagement with the russian government and friendship with the russian people
3358123 it is not possible to draw a direct causal link between greenhouse gas emissions and distant observations of impacts affecting species such as polar bears
3358124 we need a regulatory framework that is consistent with the esa and will address new challenges such as climate change
3358125 focusing the consultation process on those federal actions where potential impacts can be linked to the action and the risks are reasonably certain to occur

3358387 all right there must be something else we can fail at something lets think now
3358388 i wish to bring to the urgent attention of this house the very grave and volatile situation faced in the northeast and jaffna in particular due to the conduct of the sri lankan armed forces
3358389 on friday the 16th of december 2005 a young girl by the name of ilayathamby tharshini 20 years of age and a resident of punkuduthivu went missing on hearing this disturbing news the local villagers began searching for her whereabouts on saturday the 17th of december 2005 her naked dead body was found sexually assaulted in an abandoned well in close vicinity to a sri lankan naval camp in punkuduthivu her body had been severely mutilated
3358390 circumstances under which the body was recovered clearly indicated the sri lankan navys hand in this most despicable act of state terror consequently on sunday the 18th of december 2005 the people of the area began to agitate against the sri lankan armed forces these protests began to spread spontaneously and the sri lankan armed forces began to retaliate against the unarmed civilians by firing live ammunition at the crowd and using brute force during which a postal peon who was also a resident of punkuduthivu suffered gunshot injuries and is currently hospitalized in a serious condition
3358391 on hearing the news of this cruel murder and the subsequent oppressive conduct of the sri lankan armed forces towards the protesting crowds the students of the jaffna university decided to attend the funeral of young tharshini the jaffna university students were also accompanied by the honourable selvarajah kajendran member of parliament for the jaffna electoral district whilst they attempted to leave for punkuduthivu from parameswara junction in jaffna the sri lankan armed forces prevented them from proceeding consequent to this the students began to agitate against the actions of the armed forces who in turn started using violence against the students including the use of firearms
3358392 on the following day monday the 19th of december 2005 the jaffna university community inclusive of the vice chancellor heads of departments professors lecturers administrative staff members and students decided to hand over a petition to the sri lanka monitoring mission regarding the incidents
3358393 while they were proceeding the sri lankan armed forces once again violently prevented the people from proceeding
3358394 the tamil national alliance vehemently condemns the conduct of the sri lankan armed forces not only with regard to the practice of state terror against unarmed innocent tamil civilians but also the brutal suppression of the tamil peoples right to peacefully protest against the shameful and despicable sexual assault and murder of an innocent vulnerable young girl incidents of this nature have been systematically used by the armed forces against tamil civilians as a weapon of war that similar incidents continue to occur during times of a peace process seriously calls into question the sincerity of the sri lankan armed forces to the ceasefire

3358397 i think lilly is going to buy amylin if it doesnt make a move another company can come in and take byetta away
3358398 hes not just after the money its the confrontation and the contest he loves to humiliate the other guy
3358399 unless hes planning on grabbing a hammer to help build the new plant im not sure how icahn is going to help management get the drug to market more quickly

3358407 it was like he was looking for ideas and strategies to come to mind staring at this ransom note
3358408 hes a funny guy but he doesnt like anyone carl grew up as a lower middle class jewish kid in queens and he felt the brahmin patrician society was looking down its nose at him
3358409 hes really devoted his life to making money and humiliating the ceos of the world because he feels they came from some kind of privileged background he didnt have
3358410 so from where i sit i dont think lilly has anything to worry about
3358411 lilly needs to keep this drug in the worst way
3358412 i think lilly is going to buy amylin if it doesnt make a move another company can come in and take byetta away
3358413 i think lilly is going to follow the same path that they did with the icos acquisition

3358434 thirty five thousand people per year can benefit from vocational education that will provide for them secure employment in this country
3358435 whether your field is technical youre a skilled or unskilled worker you were laid off the economic benefits from green jobs spread from the highly educated to the noneducated
3358436 adopting clean energy practices is critical to our nations well being but these efforts wont succeed if we dont invest in the people who will actually do this work we need people to install millions of solar panels build and maintain alternative energy plants make buildings more energy efficient and maintain and repair hybrid vehicles

3358456 although local governments have put a lot of cash into education government run schools cant meet the needs of the public due to the large population of china
3358457 vouchers represent an attempt to commodify education and an abrogation on the part ofgovernment for ensuring planned provision of education
3358458 rather the structure and funding of vet has to give students and industry the power to get providers to respond to their needs
3358459 there are a number of ways of achieving this reform but an ill thought through badly implemented voucher program like the howard governments work skills vouchers isnt one of them
3358460 the last voucher system was trialled but it really was both poorly targeted and inadequately funded
3358461 we are just keen to see that in the next commonwealth and state agreement that comes in force in july next year whatever funding agreement is ultimately agreed that theres a lift in training funding

3358500 it is clearly a very upsetting event that has led to indiscriminate market selling and russias perception in the west will suffer as a result
3358501 however it has no significant impact on russias economic fundamentals and corporate earnings and at the end of the day we firmly believe this is what ultimately drives the markets rather then emotions and swings in investor sentiment
3358502 this conflict will have a negligible effect on the russian economy

3358513 i dont think people have an idea a lot of times especially if youre not from the urban south that there is such a variety of different people here
3358514 if you see a movie set in the south its always kind of the same people
3358515 a lot of the things in the movie are kind of based on people that i knew here like people i worked with family and friends
3358516 what i always wanted to do was do a movie like what midnight in the garden of good and evil did for savannah ga you see all these unique people the beautiful locations and you just want to visit it so i hope people will get a big kick out of it its really a sweet movie

3358544 resulted in only 11 news reports and only a few of those stories linked the historic level of teen joblessness to one of the most obvious factors the 41 percent increase in the federal minimum wage from 5 15 to 7 25 per hour

3358622 in its purest form the term samurai describes a type of intellectual warrior whose closest european parallel might be the knights templar except that the samurai were an entire class in society for many centuries these warriors had an absolute monopoly on the bearing of arms and epitomized the ideas of patriotism and devotion to military duty

3358633 vince i cant find any audio company in america that will do the audio on the book
3358634 mr bugliosi the reason theyre not having you on television is because of who you are
3358635 if some nut wrote a book with a title like this the prosecution of george w bush for murder we would probably have him on because its colorful its entertaining it doesnt mean anything it doesnt go anywhere but youre a very serious person and you write very serious books

3358642 excessive speculation in any commodity under contrasts of sale of such commodities for future deliver causing sudden or unreasonable fluctuations or unwarranted changes in the prices of such commodity is an undue and unnecessary burden on interstate commerce in such commodity

3358648 america stands in firm opposition to chinas detention of political dissidents and human rights advocates and religious activists
3358649 for a free press freedom of assembly and labor rights not to antagonize chinas leaders but because trusting its people with greater freedom is the only way for china to develop its full potential

3358666 it is not possible to draw a direct causal link between and distant observations of impacts affecting species such as polar bears
3358667 we need a regulatory framework that is consistent with the esa and will address new challenges such as
3358668 focusing the consultation process on those federal actions where potential impacts can be linked to the action and the risks are reasonably certain to occur
3358669 this is exactly what happened in the democratic primaries this year
3358670 we have obama and clinton going at it for months after the republican primary has been decided john mccain couldnt buy media attention at that time because everybody is focused on the attributes that obama and clinton were arguing about
3358671 the presence or absence of the third option influences people whose attribute preferences are labile they dont know which attribute is important

3358677 we now know that millions of women might have been spared hiv unwanted pregnancies and empowered themselves in the process if they had access to this simple method
3358678 the female condom is 18 times more expensive than a male condom its obvious why women are not using it more
3358679 it is about the right for women to have access to protection and their right to make choices for themselves schools should be teaching boys and girls about the female condom but sadly most of them are not
3358680 the male condom was promoted so hard in advertising through school education n and advocacy we need the same effort for the female condom
3358681 i am glad we went i will never go to something like that again
3358682 there are different approaches within the democratic party about how best to achieve the commitment of universal coverage
3358683 united behind a commitment that every american man woman and child be guaranteed to have affordable comprehensive health care
3358684 coverage should be made affordable for all americans with direct financial assistance through tax credits and other means
3358685 as affordable coverage is made available individuals should purchase health insurance and take steps to lead healthy lives
3358686 partys decision to embrace guaranteed health care is bound to become a leading yardstick by which illinois sen barak obamas d presidency will be measured if he wins in november
3358687 whose credentials as a tax cutter are suspect among many on the right was the author and driver of the bill
3358688 leading conservatives today are generally willing to forgive the arizona senator for what they view as his transgression on the tobacco measure
3358689 take a bill from that era and put it in modern times
3358690 the purpose of a party platform is pandering to the faithful under the assumption that only they will read it
3358691 mystery phrases that suggest a triumph for one side in some obscure policy battle
3358692 frenzy of health care promises basically after the plan is fully implemented in 2050 no one will be permitted to get sick the democrats advocate creating a generic pathway for biologic drugs
3358693 whether this is a triumph for health and common sense or the miserable handiwork of a drug industry lobbyist or both i have no idea
3358694 ordinarily it is not possible to overuse the word american or to overpraise this great country and its magnificent people
3358695 a uniquely american health care system is what weve got
3358696 in practice supporters of health care reform myself included will be hanging on by their fingernails until legislation is actually passed
3358697 every wealthy country except the united states already has some form of guaranteed health care
3358698 politics of guaranteed care are also easy at least in one sense if the democrats do manage to establish a system of universal coverage the nation will love it
3358699 its hard to get universal care established in the first place
3358700 on health care the contrasts are stark and indicate the difference between the two candidates obama is all about mandates while mccain relies more on market forces
3358701 how the two major parties view health care points to a difference in basic philosophy
3358702 democratic plans stressed providing increased preferably universal access to health care while gop proposals addressed costs believing more americans could get health insurance if health care was more affordable
3358703 employer mandates also would do little to address the cost of health care
3358704 likely would boost the prices charged by insurance companies and health care providers
3358705 thats when bureaucrats and politicians see their meddling isnt producing the desired results usually because it cant so they pile on more mandates requiring more comprehensive coverage
3358706 the way health care is provided in this country doesnt work well for everyone
3358707 improving it for those on the lower end of the economic ladder doesnt have to come at the cost of making it worse for everyone else
3358708 federal government which already provides taxpayer funded health insurance to the elderly the destitute and increasingly to minors should extend health care coverage to everyone
3358709 its troubling they are getting into care late and not getting diagnosed as early and we need to pay attention to that
3358710 at once a part of much of what square enix and other jrpg makers have produced and also a fresh break from the formulas those games seem destined to continue it is distinctive and quirky and the teen world j pop feel is not likely to please everyone but if you can step out of the sword and sorcery world for a bit you will be rewarded with one of the coolest games youll play this year

3358714 we believe ubs investment bank will be not fully owned and even potentially disposed of by ubs over the next two years
3358715 it might be that we keep or divest or enter into joint ventures or collaboration
3358716 for the time being there are no plans to divest
3358717 weve been able to take advantage of the situation clearly
3358718 this has been a great environment for boutiques and regional firms
3358719 but people are very opportunistic when attracting good people and theres a lot of hiring going on right now
3358720 this particular market condition affords rare recruiting opportunities and we are able to find people and make the types of economic agreements with them that one doesnt normally see
3358721 we ve really started to see some high quality talent come out and looking for jobs
3358722 we have been a direct beneficiary of the dislocations in the larger firms
3358723 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
3358724 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my hope that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
3358725 we continue to see unprecedented growth in u s gas production that will eventually overwhelm the u s gas markets
3358726 even if that number were to increase 100 fold in the next ten years to 11 000 000 or roughly 5 percent of the entire vehicle market a formidable goal the impact on natural gas supplies and the natural gas delivery infrastructure would be small equating about 4 percent of total u s natural gas consumption

3358741 it was just so unexpected so clear that bernard was going to win this race and in the last meters it was like a switch was flipped
3358742 bernard is pulling away from him the united states trying to hang on to second they should get the silver medal australia is in bronze territory right now but lezak is closing a little bit on bernard can the veteran chase him down and pull off a shocker here
3358743 bernard is losing some ground here comes lezak unbelievable at the end hes done it the u s has done it
3358744 he is not i didnt tell him he had to do it by a certain date he acknowledged hes gonna do something and i believe he will do it

3358763 esta violencia puede hacernos perder el raciocinio y de ah las consecuencias pueden ser fatales
3358764 hay un uso excesivo de la facultad de los fiscales que han ordenado el ingreso de funcionarios de fuerzas especiales y del grupo de operaciones especiales
3358765 de mantenerse esta l gica lo m s probable es que vamos a cosechar desgracias
3358766 en nuestro pa s han sido declarados enemigos los j venes que expresan su descontento por la ausencia de perspectivas de futuro los estudiantes que se oponen a la mercantilizaci n de la educaci n los trabajadores sindicalizados que luchan por condiciones laborales dignas y los mapuches que exigen la restituci n de sus tierras ancestrales
3358767 aceptaron la herencia del sistema pinochetista al comienzo por fuerza mayor pero se dieron cuenta que es m s f cil gobernar dentro de un sistema casi dictatorial que dentro de un sistema democr tico donde los gobernantes tienen que justificar sus acciones
3358768 no podemos comparar y lo digo yo que viv muy de cerca recibiendo testimonios durante la dictadura hoy hay un estado de derecho que funciona hay canales para presentar denuncias la gente puede interponer acciones en los tribunales
3358769 el esp ritu del gobierno no es reprimir las manifestaciones sino dejar espacio para la participacion de la ciudadan a y se han dado m ltiples permisos para actividades en la calle
3358770 esper bamos otra actitud del gobierno porque consider bamos a la presidenta bachelet como una militante de los derechos humanos
3358771 pensamos que el aumento de la represi n va paralelo a ese aumento de la organizaci n popular que lleva a que los movimientos sociales empiecen a luchar por sus derechos
3358772 me da mucha rabia que una manifestaci n de 50 personas portando s lo carteles sea disuelta por 200 carabineros en tres minutos

3358801 las personas privadas extranjeras que operan en el pa s como es la empresa manquiri subsidiaria de la minera americana coeur dalene como en el presente caso y que tienen adem s instancias encargadas de velar que el desempe o de sus inversiones es la tarea de opic no derive en da os a las comunidades ind genas y originaria son bien acogidas sus iniciativas de soluci n de conflictos que permitan alcanzar una real y efectiva restituci n de los derechos vulnerados o en riesgo de ser vulnerados

3358814 our behaviour in this present generation does not match in any form with those of our ancestors so we are taking ownership of lives that do not belong to us and such lives will only mislead us
3358815 every now and then you hear about rape cases and in many circumstances it involves very young girls of even five years i think there is a problem and the only solution is for the law to take its full course
3358816 i believe such inhuman and unwarranted acts will soon be a thing of the past if the recent strong words of president jammeh about rape and murder in this country are anything to go by the president was recently quoted as saying that he will set an example of those engaged in such acts and this is no doubt a welcome move because it would not have come at a better time than now
3358817 government should be seen doing something regarding this issue culprits should not be left to go free like that if you murder somebody you should be murdered and if you rape you should be sent to jail this is as simple as that
3358818 we should also as elders in society learn to discipline our children lack of discipline is also a major cause of such terrible incidents i think if every parent takes the initial responsibility to discipline his or her child at home then we will not today be talking about these matters
3358819 government is doing all it can to create job opportunities for our youth and it is now left to them to make best use of those opportunities rather than involve in criminal activities

3358830 it presents several new aspects which were not present in previous incidents in xinjiang
3358831 one is the sophisticated coordination of the attacks it was not just one attack its a string of bombings that requires much more planning and a larger organization to carry out especially at the time of the olympics when the security is so high

3358841 my family love the wonderful countryside and friendly people michael likes north devon too as no one bothers him
3358842 its about the respect and principle of the matter not money i lent tito the money on the basis that it would be repaid we flew him over on may 22 and worked with him on the making of the documentary
3358843 he had been due to be godfather to my two year old daughter lola but we had to cancel that after tito disappeared we just couldnt get hold of the guy
3358844 ive been calling him leaving messages getting our lawyers to send him letters but weve had no response

3358847 while we call it a classic car show its a very broad spectrum the oldest cars might be more than 80 years old while others might be only three or four
3358848 i think people have a closer relationship with classic cars you can generally work on them yourself whereas modern cars are too technologically advanced
3358849 we get a lot of people who actually own the cars but also a lot of tourists people tend to stay for the whole weekend so its good for the local economy

3358860 then in the first place do you agree with me that i have a right to be a little masterful abrupt perhaps exacting sometimes on the grounds i stated namely that i am old enough to be your father and that i have battled through a varied experience with many men of many nations and roamed over half the globe while you have lived quietly with one set of people in one house
3358861 that is no answer or rather it is a very irritating because a very evasive one reply clearly
3358862 i dont think sir you have a right to command me merely because you are older than i or because you have seen more of the world than i have your claim to superiority depends on the use you have made of your time and experience
3358863 humph promptly spoken but i wont allow that seeing that it would never suit my case as i have made an indifferent not to say a bad use of both advantages leaving superiority out of the question then you must still agree to receive my orders now and then without being piqued or hurt by the tone of command will you
3358864 i was thinking sir that very few masters would trouble themselves to inquire whether or not their paid subordinates were piqued and hurt by their orders
3358865 paid subordinates what you are my paid subordinate are you oh yes i had forgotten the salary well then on that mercenary ground will you agree to let me hector a little
3358866 no sir not on that ground but on the ground that you did forget it and that you care whether or not a dependent is comfortable in his dependency i agree heartily
3358867 and will you consent to dispense with a great many conventional forms and phrases without thinking that the omission arises from insolence
3358868 i am sure sir i should never mistake informality for insolence one i rather like the other nothing free born would submit to even for a salary
3358869 humbug most things free born will submit to anything for a salary therefore keep to yourself and dont venture on generalities of which you are intensely ignorant however i mentally shake hands with you for your answer despite its inaccuracy and as much for the manner in which it was said as for the substance of the speech the manner was frank and sincere one does not often see such a manner no on the contrary affectation or coldness or stupid coarse minded misapprehension of ones meaning are the usual rewards of candour not three in three thousand raw school girl governesses would have answered me as you have just done but i dont mean to flatter you if you are cast in a different mould to the majority it is no merit of yours nature did it and then after all i go too fast in my conclusions for what i yet know you may be no better than the rest you may have intolerable defects to counterbalance your few good points
3358870 i have plenty of faults of my own i know it and i dont wish to palliate them i assure you god wot i need not be too severe about others i have a past existence a series of deeds a colour of life to contemplate within my own breast which might well call my sneers and censures from my neighbours to myself i started or rather for like other defaulters i like to lay half the blame on ill fortune and adverse circumstances was thrust on to a wrong tack at the age of one and twenty and have never recovered the right course since but i might have been very different i might have been as good as you wiser almost as stainless i envy you your peace of mind your clean conscience your unpolluted memory little girl a memory without blot or contamination must be an exquisite treasure

3358883 i know a lot of players who smoke it is part of life when i was a player a lot of my friends and team mates smoked it depends if he smokes five cigarettes or 20 cigarettes
3358884 more than feeling nervous we cant wait for the match to get here weve waited for so long to experience this moment and the only thing that we want is for wednesday to get here already
3358885 i think that the qualifying tie is 50 50 theres going to be a great environment but we hope that the game will go our way were aware that were going to face a tough team but we have to focus on ourselves
3358886 we have to plan read the match well and impose our style of play its important to leave there having scored
3358887 i dont like to make predictions it wouldnt be bad to score although what we have to try to do is keep a clean sheet as that way wed play at vicente calder n more tranquilly

3358899 it must be stressed that the situation in tblisi has currently stabilized with no food water or electricity shortages
3358900 the vaad budget in tblisi is approximately 55 000 per month this includes of course education housing and food costs borne in the soup kitchen
3358901 russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century
3358902 thus far food supplies in all the supermarkets are being hoarded but there are no current shortages
3358903 the status in georgia is currently a developing situation and it is anticipated that in the event of any further deterioration funding will be needed to address needs of food transportation and housing the soup kitchen operations have already been stepped up

3358916 i think were a hard side lets enjoy it and lets go and put a few spokes in the wheels of other clubs
3358917 the first game youve just got to get it out the way and if youre going to have a clean sheet thats utopia really
3358918 i have no desire to play in england my club know my decision and it will not change
3358919 if i leave valencia my dream will be to go to barcelona i know there is interest from some big clubs in england but i do not just want to move for the money
3358920 the strongest team played against manchester united but the players in this match need to be fit to show they can play in the first team
3358921 we need to compete with the other players this type of match is something we need it is just a practice match but we are stronger for games like this
3358922 we have to be as fit as possible for the start of the season so its good to get this one in the bank
3358923 we have been all over the world and it has been a bit stop start
3358924 its not an excuse though and we cant say it is
3358925 this has come as a surprise and i am disappointed carlos cuellar has been a great player for the football club and inevitably there has been speculation about him playing in the premiership
3358926 we came to the conclusion that hes not good enough for our first team
3358927 we informed his agent about the situation and hes looking for a solution for fagner
3358928 we planned an expensive ct scan for him but he just didnt show up
3358929 i can do that its my lawn mower and my yard so i can shoot it if i want
3358930 he is an ipswich town footballer on a three year deal we dont want to sell him we want to keep him if stoke are showing serious intent in getting jon then they should do something about it if not they should leave alone and let us get on with it
3358931 even as president bush denounced the russian actions in the strongest terms to date the united states and its european allies faced tough choices over how to push back they seemed uncertain how to adjust to a new geopolitical game that threatened to undermine two decades of democratic gains in countries that were once part of the soviet sphere
3358932 administration officials said military options were almost certainly off the table but the united states did airlift georgian troops stationed in iraq back home answering a plea from the georgian government and prompting a sharp response from russia washington could also press to ostracize moscow on the international stage perhaps by kicking it out of the group of 8 industrialized nations yet there was no immediate indication that western powers could exercise much leverage over russia if it chose to ignore their warnings
3358933 for mccain and obama the war in georgia has forced a pivot in a campaign where the foreign policy debate has focused primarily on the middle east and terrorism the issue poses challenges for both as they balance the need to condemn russias actions while addressing the reality that the next administration will need moscows assistance in confronting potential nuclear threats from iran and north korea
3358934 mccain had sought to highlight his support for u s russia cooperation on nuclear security issues delivering a major address in may in which he declared that russia and the united states are no longer mortal enemies mccain used that address as a public break from bushs unpopular foreign policy embracing a new treaty with russia and other efforts to reduce the number of nuclear weapons but in recent days mccain has signaled that he intends to focus more on hard line criticism of russian prime minister vladimir v putin and his government
3358935 obama too faces challenges as he tries to stake out a more conciliatory foreign policy that includes his willingness to negotiate with enemies his softer language toward moscow leaves him open to criticism at a time when the u s is clearly aligned with georgia an emerging democracy but obama aides say this in fact can be an advantage
3358936 mccain who has met the republic of georgias president and whose chief foreign policy adviser has lobbied for the country responded to the news friday with visceral anger condemning russian forces crossing into georgia and warning of grave repercussions in long term relations between moscow and washington
3358937 while senator hillary rodham clinton campaigned for president by offering herself as a sure handed competent successor to president bush her campaign team of highly paid advisers was riven by back biting poor management and conflicting strategies that contributed to her loss to senator barack obama according to a magazine report released monday
3358938 clintons top campaign strategist advised her to cast presidential rival barack obama as having questionable roots to basic american values and culture and use the theme to counter the image that his background is diverse and multicultural i cannot imagine america electing a president during a time of war who is not at his center fundamentally american in his thinking and in his values mark penn wrote in a march 2007 memo to clinton
3358939 so far in the 2008 contest neither candidate has connected with any ads that explosive but fresh information about their past views in their own words could shake up the race obamas commercials so far have been very positive he has used advertising mostly to amplify his speeches and some of his programs and he has a rubicon to cross he has presented himself as representing a new politics uplifting inspiring and not negatively driven though he has been willing to go after his opponents sharply on the stump
3358940 hillary clinton has been privately enumerating her doubts about obama to supporters according to people who have spoken with her clintons pollster mark penn recently unveiled a powerpoint presentation red flagging obamas lukewarm leads among white female voters and hispanics while predicting a five point swing could turn a presumed obama win into a mccain landslide
3358941 clearly an exit from the time warner equity state into a cash generating asset would be attractive but at the current time none have been proposed that we could take action on
3358942 but we would continue to try and maintain the relationship with jeff and the time warner folks in the event that such a transaction would present itself
3358943 they would come talk to us given our ability to create tax efficient transaction for both parties we have good dialogue with them
3358944 outraged christian supporters of obama say it does that it is intended to further internet fueled rumors that obama is the antichrist deconstructing and analyzing the ad they say the images and language play into apocalyptic themes including those featured in the best selling left behind series fictionalized accounts of the end of the world in the left behind series the antichrist is a charismatic young political leader who is founder of the one world religion and promises to heal the world
3358945 outraged christian supporters of obama say it does that it is intended to further internet fueled rumors that obama is the antichrist
3358946 bayhs support of authorizing force in iraq stands in sharp contrast to mr obamas oft stated view that he showed the good judgment to oppose the conflict from the start after his vote mr bayh in early 2003 joined mr mccain as an honorary co chairman of the committee for the liberation of iraq which made regime change in iraq its central cause
3358947 he was not only wrong he was aggressively wrong said tom andrews national director of the win without war coalition referring to mr
3358948 on average the announcements of running mates have given presidential candidates about a five percentage point bounce in their standing in the polls immediately after the news breaks
3358949 look hes a top contender for vice president and hes a u s senator but does he have anything good to say no
3358950 the last thing the world needs is another forgettable lawmaker its the equivalent of a speech on c span
3358951 republicans are moving to examine surges in voter registrations in some states a republican lawyers group held a national training session on election law over the weekend that included campaign attorneys for sen john mccain and other republican leaders one session discussed how party operatives can identify and respond to instances of voter fraud
3358952 republicans said they are particularly worried about prospects for fraud in virginia and pennsylvania and are beginning to comb thousands of new registrations in those states for ineligible applicants in some cases the huge numbers threaten to swamp their efforts and those of state and local governments to verify and process applications election officials in virginia and other states say there is no evidence of widespread fraud so far numerous studies have found fraud and other voting irregularities in past elections to be infrequent and generally not prevalent enough to influence the outcomes of most contests some republican lawyers say that despite the huge numbers of new registrations in some areas this years problems could be fewer compared to prior years because of improved procedures and tougher rules
3358953 regardless of how the voters got on the rolls johnson said the sheer number of democrats is a concern this year as is the fact that more hispanics are now registered democrats about 455 000 hispanics are now in the democratic party which only this year surpassed republicans who count 425 000 in their ranks compared to the last presidential election the numbers are even more dramatic for african americans more than 207 000 have joined the democratic party since 2004 accounting for 44 percent of the new voter growth
3358954 the boom that turned swamps and pastures into a suburban mecca has stopped dead now the talk is about plummeting home values rising food costs and gas prices that make the once painless half hour commute to tampa a financial strain its enough to give some here the sense that maybe this time around the republicans do not deserve their votes
3358955 even as younger voters are showing signs of breaking with years of lackluster turnout to support him obama is facing singular resistance from voters over 65 that age group turns out at the highest rate on election day and is disproportionately represented in the swing states of florida and pennsylvania bill clinton and al gore both relied on it in winning the democrats only popular vote majorities of the past two decades
3358956 with polls showing obama dominating among those under 40 and running even among middle aged voters republican john mccains lead among those 65 and older is the main reason he remains close overall his margin is largest among older white voters without a college education accounting for much of obamas problem with the white working class
3358957 by this time in 2004 president bushs re election campaign had spent 13 5 million on television in florida the president went on to win the state in november sen obamas ads have touched every media market in florida which is the most expensive for advertising among the closely fought states
3358958 to call tom ridge to washington from whatever vacation he is taking and get him down there and get him to work
3358959 youre going to be seeing a lot of me in this state and were gonna be on the bus and were gonna go from town to town and were gonna tell people that we know that they love the second amendment and cherish their religion because they believe in america because they believe in the strength and the greatness of america
3358960 to call tom ridge to washington from whatever vacation he is taking and get him down there and get him to work
3358961 he offered some praise of mr ridge that made it sound decidedly unlikely that mr ridge would be taking up residence in the naval observatory
3358962 the resolution does not contain a specific provision to raise tax rates but rather assumes that most of the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts expire as scheduled in 2011
3358963 obama has stated repeatedly that his plan would increase taxes only for those making more than 250 000 per year
3358964 im tired of hearing people arent you saying we cant
3358965 we cant reprocess spent nuclear fuel we cant store spent nuclear fuel we cant compete with other countries we cant develop clean coal technology we can thats what americas thats the history of the united states of america we can and we will and sometimes it requires government assistance
3358966 for the first time in recent memory mccain avoided all talk of obama during his remarks today
3358967 mccain also used two of his opponents buzzwords today saying that while some people are despondent about the economic situation in america
3358968 im tired of hearing people arent you saying we cant
3358969 we cant reprocess spent nuclear fuel we cant store spent nuclear fuel we cant compete with other countries we cant develop clean coal technology
3358970 in my three weeks back home in baghdad 179 people were killed and no baghdadi ever mentioned the surge to me
3358971 we want to see the russians stand down and to stop attacks on georgia
3358972 most importantly we want to see an immediate ceasefire i understand that the georgians have offered to be party to a ceasefire the russians have not responded

3358976 much too fun to waste on just one set of game rules
3358977 a more namby pampy mode for the lighter people out there
3358978 i am not going to buy dodgy drugs off dodgy dealers
3358979 this was a cottage garden industry to supply their own drugs needs
3358980 they were not cultivating for commercial reasons it was a relatively small scale operation servicing their own needs
3358981 the authors do a fine job of combining their ideas into a coherent text that is a must for researchers and advanced students of the subject
3358982 this book covers basic results of approximation theory it contains also new developments in the theory of moments and sinc approximation n widths s numbers and the relationship of these to computational algorithms this important book can be of great interest to graduate students and researchers in approximation constructive function theory and numerical methods

3358984 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3358985 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3358986 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3358987 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3358988 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3358989 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3358990 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3358991 doing a small leed commercial project is more difficult than doing a large one because there is no volume discount
3358992 it is harder to source things here small local or regional manufacturers arent as likely to track their products for such things as recycled content toxicity and renewability that makes it difficult to fulfill the documentation requirements for leed regardless of the size of the project
3358993 its fine it doesnt have a different taste to anything really try it at least its food
3358994 do you think that god has provided this for us
3358995 mikhail try it its not bad at all its not even sandy even though the wolf vomited it up on the sand
3358996 ive been in australia filming big brother house in which my housemates and i are confined and sealed off from the outside world much like the chickens who are crammed inside barns for kfc
3358997 our data indicate that the mouse can yield human sperm cells
3358998 a law degree will no doubt aid my slowing ascent up the corporate ladder and keep the yapping jaws of the generation below me who already boast multiple paper qualifications thanks to the somewhat new university policy of maximising revenue through double degrees away from my heels for just that little bit longer
3358999 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
3359000 a billion here a billion there before you know it your talking real money
3359001 thats totally out of the question we dont make enough from the antennas on that tower to make it worthwhile
3359002 some of the kids didnt even know how to do a push up
3359003 i dont think i was pushing myself before as much as i really could
3359004 once i got in the fit program i figured why not just push myself
3359005 it was really hard to break that kind of habit
3359006 i did it with them to show them that hey im personally challenging myself too
3359007 im starting to realize some people are actually here to help you
3359008 3 out of 10 children are sitting ducks for disease
3359009 she said i just need you to know that im ashamed of you as our public health director
3359010 she was there in 30 minutes and i cancelled two meetings
3359011 thats the job public health cannot be done if you dont care passionately about the individual because the population is comprised of individuals
3359012 hes just one of the most passionate people ive ever met and he was always able to channel that passion into great deeds
3359013 i always tried to ask myself what does this look like from 10 000 feet
3359014 and what can life be like if we work together to behave differently
3359015 and they were living in conditions worse than animals would live in there were two outhouses that hadnt been serviced in months
3359016 he really stuck his neck out and he worried that the owner might pull out a shotgun
3359017 youve got to look at injecting drug users as people we care about they are our children they didnt come from another planet
3359018 but i respected chuck in that he represented his constituency very well
3359019 yet in every institute that brought in a smoke free policy sales went up
3359020 of course business is better because 85 percent of us dont smoke
3359021 do you think were going to get it done with personal protection
3359022 is an obvious and predictable attempt to deflect attention from its illegal activity cited in court papers filed by united last month the airline asked a federal judge to stop four pilots and their union from abusing sick time and refusing to fly extra hours

3359024 rtd has experienced unprecedented increases in our diesel fuel costs as well as reductions in our sales tax revenues
3359025 to be able to continue to provide appropriate levels of services we are considering revenue increases including adjustments to our entire fare system
3359026 our ridership is the highest weve ever wanted its just going gangbusters
3359027 were looking at our total operating budget and seeing where we can trim
3359028 we have no idea what they might be right now
3359029 one of the things were really looking at is how it will impact our truly transit dependent folks and how we can accommodate them
3359030 it used to be the term stay at home mother was an oxymoron because you had to get out of the house for your sanity
3359031 to the mall the playground playdates to target just to go somewhere
3359032 if youre a stay at home mother youd better have a darned good reason to go somewhere you wonder where can i stop by on my way home from another errand
3359033 we just dont have as much money as we used to
3359034 the longmont police department wants to send a strong message to motorists for the rest of the summer and during the national crackdown labor day enforcement period that drunken and drugged driving will not be tolerated
3359035 theres a variety of tactics that employers have been employing over the last 3 to 6 years that has had an impact on the market
3359036 every day its about how many turnovers you can get
3359037 the other day i had a couple in practice and it was like id had the best practice of my life
3359038 were just making a big deal out of it if you get the ball back you not only have a stop but you have field position and it turns games around we know that so if every day we emphasize that by the time the games come around itll come natural
3359039 everybody just has to focus on their job and as long as we do that well be ok i think obviously a couple of those were mishaps with the young guys with the reads they were making on certain hand off plays when people are uncertain it makes it tough to handle the ball
3359040 you like to have speed versus speed and if theyre going to put speed on the field you have to have speed on the field thats really what it comes down to
3359041 i looked at rid special teams coach kent riddle and said did you call that
3359042 each night at the convention will look very different than any convention weve ever had
3359043 from monday through thursday our convention program will highlight the people of this country who want positive change and who believe barack obama is the leader who will listen to their concerns and get our country moving in the right direction again
3359044 anyone who sen obama picks as vice president will be more than prepared to address those issues
3359045 its been the longest hardest slog to get back to my normal shape after having chester
3359046 thats it im 40 now my body shape has changed forever
3359047 its my flattest bit and i never thought id get it back
3359048 i dont understand how my skin could stretch that far and then come back to how it is now
3359049 would i be comfortable saying this to the persons face
3359050 they do play boring hockey thanks to former devils coach claude julien but you never know when milan lucic will channel his inner cam neely and go nuts the scary thing he is still learning how to play in the nhl and their ice girls are pretty nice to look at
3359051 another way for somebody with enough money to get around the regulations
3359052 too many current and potential homeowners have already felt the stifling effects of the current county guidelines
3359053 i foresee that this house size issue will only strengthen the resolve of many would be county residents to seek other places to live
3359054 our current county commissioners are setting up boulder county for substantial unnecessary litigation in the future
3359055 the whole concept of buying and selling of development rights should be preposterous to every american rights are something that we have and are not negotiable or for sale
3359056 is really about the notion that there are impacts to the county from very large homes
3359057 helps mitigate the impact of those larger structures by helping preserve smaller structures and preserve undeveloped ground in the county
3359058 however you slice it landowners who may have sweated and scrimped to buy a piece of property have now been screwed
3359059 have determined that they do not want people to have the full use of their land
3359060 any government that thinks it can take away personal property rights unless it is a time of war or emergency is looking to find a constituency that will become angered
3359061 theres so much running but ill get used to it
3359062 you get jitters always double think stuff but once you get flowing with everything then you feel comfortable and youll eventually have fun right now im just a little hesitant going over all of my plays and all of my techniques once i get all of that done ill be cool

3359066 you have to make a play every day make a play every practice
3359067 they have to get battle tested those guys have to grow up
3359068 obviously i feel really comfortable with the guys and i think we had a great very productive first week of camp
3359069 and so when you can come out here and show that and play i think youre going to be very satisfied with the results were not completely satisfied we have a lot of camp left and we have to keep working forward but as long as we keep practicing as intense as we have been this last week were going to have good results

3359091 i just wanted to be out at the 50 meter point and thats where i was
3359092 i was in open water and it was difficult for the other guys to see me
3359093 i knew park is strong in the last 50 meters

3359095 i just tried to swim my own race hes going to go out but i cant let that affect my race strategy
3359096 to be tied for the most olympic golds of all time with those names in olympic history

3359100 hes not just winning hes absolutely destroying everything its awesome to watch
3359101 its his physical ability its his ability to race its his ability to keep focused to get excited when he needs to and to come down when he needs to come down
3359102 im so glad to have this race behind me because theres so much pressure
3359103 i tried to keep myself as mentally strong as possible
3359104 last year in melbourne at the world championships one swim started it and then swims just started happening one after another after another we had a great morning this morning and hopefully we can set up some more good swims tonight and keep the ball rolling
3359105 it almost felt like less pressure because it wasnt initially my event
3359106 i dont think its necessarily fair what happened but rules are rules and im just doing what im told
3359107 i just wanted to win my heat and set everything up for tomorrow
3359108 just get through that and prepare myself for tomorrow thats the most important thing an afternoon off and its time to just sort of get as rested as i can recover and i probably have to re shave get all of that stuff down
3359109 i just wanted to be out at the 50 meter point and thats where i was
3359110 i was in open water and it was difficult for the other guys to see me
3359111 i knew park is strong in the last 50 meters
3359112 so i knew i had to be fast and concentrated
3359113 i knew when i saw the 1 by my name because at first i thought i saw the clock wrong its a great feeling
3359114 im going to be talking about how to get more dollars into the classrooms the huge opportunity we have if we become even a little bit more efficient

3359122 we will need more evidence everyone in this situation needs a signed binding agreement
3359123 until that happens we are mobilised we are prepared for everything
3359124 i do appreciate it medvedevs gesture but there has been more damage to infrastructure and civilian casualties today
3359125 it could be that the executive order hasnt trickled down to the rank and file or it could mean something else
3359126 president saakashvili has signed the four point kouchner plan which is being discussed in moscow right now signing that would be a start

3359144 ci despre un gest de educatie de a interzice in scoli un grup de alimente care pot avea efecte nefaste asupra sanatatii copiilor
3359145 in scoli nu exista cantine ci doar chioscuri in care nu se pot vinde alimente recomandate de aceea ele devin inutile daca ar exista prevederea ca o scoala sa aiba cantina sau sa fie interzisa comercializarea de produse alimentare in incinta sa atunci s ar stradui sa faca o cantina

3359149 clearly an exit from the time warner equity state into a cash generating asset would be attractive but at the current time none have been proposed that we could take action on
3359150 but we would continue to try and maintain the relationship with jeff and the time warner folks in the event that such a transaction would present itself
3359151 they would come talk to us given our ability to create tax efficient transaction for both parties we have good dialogue with them

3359160 on the basis of your report ive decided to conclude the operation to force the georgian authorities into peace
3359161 the aim of the operation has been achieved the safety of our peace keeping forces and the civilian population has been restored
3359162 the aggressor has been punished and has suffered very significant losses
3359163 we can discuss the question of a definitive settlement if two conditions are met
3359164 first georgian troops should return to their initial position and be partly demilitarised second we need to sign a binding agreement on non use of force
3359165 i think what you have confirmed here is good news a ceasefire now has to take shape
3359166 we must draw up a rapid calendar so that each side can go back to the positions of before the crisis

3359173 therefore we do need as a region to evolve a mechanism which enables a quick speedy and coordinated deployment of armed forces assets to meet the challenge of natural disasters as and when they arise
3359174 but if we pool our resources and if we coordinate our assets we can do more and we can get better results

3359176 ive lost one of my best buddies and it is not easy to reckon with i know one can never put a question mark where god puts a period so i will not question the almightys decision to call him home we all know when that call comes we all will answer personally my buddy will be missed for many reasons by me he was family
3359177 he will be a part of my musical life each time i sing the song d j vu as this was a birthday gift to me from him his renditions of songs that i had recorded especially walk on by in my opinion the definitive version will always be another memory each time i sing it and the humorous side that he showed few that i knew so well my family and i send sincere heartfelt condolences to his family for their enormous loss and we will hold them in continuous prayer

3359179 it has to be analysed from a technical point of view and that cant really happen until after the festival
3359180 the system is working as it stands what they fringe officials will need to do is work out if it will work at 100 per cent capacity at the moment the allocation of tickets involves using two systems allowing it to function fully until they go and do other work in the autumn i have absolutely no idea what will happen but now is not the moment to start trying that out
3359181 it has been taken to a very serious financial position because theyve had to bring in an awful lot of new personnel and hardware theyve introduced a second system which is obviously going to have a cost implication and because the message has gone out that its been so difficult to buy tickets there will be a revenue implication

3359194 lo que todos sabemos es que el se or rodr guez zapatero aprob un estatuto y ahora por lo que se ve no est dispuesto a cumplirlo y eso ha originado un problema grav simo dentro del psoe pero a mi no me preocupan los problemas del psoe sino que me preocupan los problemas de los espa oles

3359197 la sensaci n que se est transmitiendo es que el gobierno est absolutamente a la deriva
3359198 yo lo que le ofrezco al se or rodr guez zapatero es un consenso y un acuerdo en esta materia pero es su responsabilidad aceptar esta oferta que el partido popular le est haciendo
3359199 afecta a la propia estabilidad del psoe y por tanto a la propia estabilidad del gobierno en un momento de crisis econ mica
3359200 lo peor que nos puede pasar a todos los espa oles es que encima los apoyos del gobierno est n divididos

3359216 this second shuttle car will help increase our production immensely as it cuts down the time needed to move coal from the mine face to the belt feeder before we had to periodically pause operations to wait for coal to be cleared away from the miner since this shuttle car holds up to five 5 tons working alongside our first shuttle car holding up to four 4 tons we can now maintain our production efforts with much less down time
3359217 our main goal is to mine coal we will continue to make the necessary adjustments until the volume levels exceed our expectations

3359224 we had originally put our weight behind the council ceremony in the hope that would be a unified event
3359225 but it has become clear in the last few weeks some families would have found attending that event extremely difficult
3359226 it is not for us to question what they are going through this is a very difficult time for them
3359227 so our decision to attend sundays event is a pastoral response to the situation
3359228 our aspiration was for a unified ceremony but we are aware of the difficulties that many families have with the council ceremony
3359229 what is interesting about the us response is that you have the mccain campaign in one corner immediately understanding the significance of russias aggression and in the opposite you have the bush administration standing with the obama campaign taking a much more diluted stance

3359243 thats why im glad finals are in the morning because you wake up you race and youre not sitting around thinking about it all day
3359244 i was totally clear not too many nerves excited but pretty calm it almost didnt feel like the olympic games that was probably good in a sense
3359245 you hype it up so much in your head and then you get out there and youre like wow this is just another meet im here to do the same thing
3359246 but at the same time that was still a dream come true for me just to be able to race in the games
3359247 the first one is always the worst one to get under your belt im just glad that one is over with
3359248 im right where i need to be it was tough race but i know theres a little bit more in there
3359249 it was definitely difficult because last night was a finals situation
3359250 i really didnt have the focus i did yesterday i was just looking to get out of my heat ive got more races ahead of me that are more important
3359251 i just wanted to get to the semifinals and not make the same mistakes as athens so i went out hard
3359252 i think emotionally it probably did take a little bit out of me but ive been very careful about what ive been doing and reacting to that
3359253 just play it down and enjoy the moment and focus on the days ahead thats why i was trying to hold back a little bit so i didnt blow my tank and i can swim fast tomorrow morning
3359254 im fourth knowing that at the end i slowed down a bit so everythings cool
3359255 it was hard after losing the race yesterday but afterwards i realized i am happy with the silver medal
3359256 i was so excited the whole day it was just truly spectacular
3359257 now we need to move on and swim fast i know im capable of doing a lot and thats what i plan on doing

3359294 thanks for the info there is a probelm between textexpander and pthpasteboard we are working on a solution
3359295 i think generally canadians are perceived as a little more cautious and tend to follow trends rather than charging out in front
3359296 in the united states and in europe there are many companies using this model of distributed work in canada it has yet to emerge
3359297 all of those stars are beginning to align which i think is providing a lot of motivation for organizations to get serious
3359298 whats very interesting is its not just the price of the gas but the total cost of the commute that i think has now become apparent
3359299 a good part of it has to do with a total lack of support and promotion by our governments especially at the federal level
3359300 they recognize the many benefits and advantages and strongly support it
3359301 here we dont use the carrot and we dont use the stick theres not even a donkey
3359302 we have engineers we have psychologists we have lawyers we have many professional people who just like distributed workers dont need full time access to an office
3359303 we needed to know that we could grow because our business was growing we were entering the u s market and we werent sure if we were going to need four people or 40 people if you grow to 40 people you need 40 desks and 40 laptops and 40 of everything
3359304 suiteworks already had a system in place to accommodate our staff regardless of how big it grew so for us i tell them were adding three more people and 48 hours later im ready to go

3359309 we are now waiting for him to wake up and speak so we can find out more details about what happened
3359310 it presents several new aspects which were not present in previous incidents in xinjiang
3359311 one is the sophisticated co ordination of the attacks it was not just one attack its a string of bombings that requires much more planning and a larger organization to carry out especially at the time of the olympics when the security is so high
3359312 if you look at the streets everything seems calm and peaceful

3359333 on behalf of the pra team england rugby and the players i am delighted that we have successfully negotiated a new long term commercial agreement that will protect the players interests going forward for the next four years
3359334 the agreement is another positive move for english rugby it confirms a secure commercial working relationship between the players and the rfu and allows everyone involved with team england to focus purely on playing performance going forward
3359335 on behalf of the players i would like to thank damian hopley and the pra for their work in securing this new agreement we are very pleased to be able to go into the new international season having concluded negotiations so promptly and smoothly
3359336 its important that these off the field matters were resolved ahead of the 2008 09 season so everyone involved in the squad knows where they stand on commercial issues

3359354 were speaking to some people at the moment in terms of potential permanent moves to bring a player in
3359355 were very active in trying to sign someone to play that position id hope wed do so in the a week or so
3359356 hes reading boss steve coppell still very comfortable in terms of the balance of the team and very happy to play stephen hunt at left back very happy to play liam rosenior at left back and graeme murty at right back so weve got options within the squad
3359357 but we are trying to bring another left sided player into the squad and balance us up and obviously give hunty the opportunity to move forward again depending on what the manager decides
3359358 i thought hunty grew as the game went on and i thought he played exceptionally well second half
3359359 we didnt create as much as wed like but i thought we grew as the game went on and i felt if someone was going to win it was going to be us
3359360 youre always looking for three points but its a good point for us and i think we finished strongly which was encouraging their keeper made an unbelievable save from kev to keep it out and stop us taking three points

3359377 the natural prolongation of the land territory to the continental margins outer edge
3359378 it appears that there was never any intention to reverse these closures and that is absolutely appalling
3359379 the consultation has been farcical and one sided with a real lack of feedback by on the part of the consultation team
3359380 this is all about saving money we have had petitions and 1 500 people have given us their support this is one of the most deprived parts of the country and this is a lifeline for local people
3359381 i believe this is part of a scheme to close the entire sub post office network
3359382 overall any branch closing is going to inconvenience somebody people are not going to be happy about this

3359432 if the ioc international olympic committee wants its sponsorships to retain the current level of value steps must be taken to protect sponsors significant investments ambush marketing on any level is distasteful and unethical when it involves tens of millions of dollars it can be financially devastating too
3359433 if a conservation easement is granted in perpetuity the landowner is entitled to claim a deduction on his or her federal income taxes furthermore since the conservation easement lowers the value of the property it also lowers the value of the landowners estate and ultimately the estate tax burden as well as the property tax burden
