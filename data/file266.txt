2660257 the wisdom that comes from heaven is first of all pure then peace loving considerate submissive full of mercy and good fruit impartial and sincere peacemakers who sow in peace raise a harvest of righteousness
2660258 so give it all to god your past regrets your present problems your future ambitions your fears dreams weaknesses habits hurts and hang ups put jesus christ in the drivers seat of your life and take your hands off the steering wheel dont be afraid nothing under his control can ever be out of control mastered by christ you can handle anything
2660259 i am a fan of the budget that spends saves and gives
2660260 in so many of our societies side by side with material prosperity a spiritual desert is spreading an interior emptiness an unnamed fear a quiet sense of despair gods love can only unleash its power when he is allowed to change us from within we have to let it to break through the hard crust of our indifference our spiritual weariness our blind conformity to the spirit of this age
2660261 i know that everything god does will endure forever nothing can be added to it and nothing taken from it god does it so that men will revere him whatever is has already been and what will be has been before and god will call the past to account
2660262 apart from god every activity is merely a passing whiff of insignificance
2660263 you will keep him in perfect peace whose mind is stayed on you
2660264 gods grace is not a static attribute whereby he passively accepts hardened unrepentant sinners
2660265 to deny ungodliness and worldly desires and to live sensibly righteously and godly in the present age
2660266 i just got to thinking you know what these guys have never been together on the same stage it would be a neat way to cap the primary season before they both go to the conventions and things go dark for a couple of weeks
2660267 ive known both the guys for a long time theyre both friends of mine and i knew them before they ran for office so i just called them up
2660268 the primaries proved that americans care deeply about the faith values character and leadership convictions of candidates as much as they do about the issues
2660269 while i know both men as friends and they recognize i will be frank but fair they also know i will be raising questions in these four areas beyond what political reporters typically ask
2660270 when your primary concern is maximum security you will soon find yourself living in a prison
2660271 do not build a wall until you know what you are walling in and what you are walling out
2660272 often dont tell a complete story about how americans attend religious worship services
2660273 satan promises the best but pays with the worst he promises honor and pays with disgrace he promises pleasure and pays with pain he promises profit and pays with loss he promises life and pays with death
2660274 do not fear for i am with you do not be dismayed for i am your god
2660275 spiritual growth is impossible apart from the practice of prayer just as the key to enhanced relationships with other people is time spent in communication so the key to a growing relationship with the personal god of heaven and earth is time invested in speaking to him in prayer and listening to his voice in scripture
2660276 and all these blessings shall come on thee and overtake thee if thou shalt hearken unto the voice of the lord thy god
2660277 and all the men of israel when they saw the man fled from him and were sore afraid
2660278 what who is this uncircumcised philistine that he should defy the armies of the living god
2660279 who are you youre nothing but a stable boy that tends the sheep by the way whos taking care of the sheep while youre playing hooky here youre just here as a spectator
2660280 youre just a boy goliath will eat you up and spit you out just like that
2660281 all life is holy if we are truly oriented toward god then our slightest activities shaving reading the newspaper putting out the cat are a form of prayer
2660282 no temptation has seized you except what is common to man and god is faithful he will not let you be tempted beyond what you can bear but when you are tempted he will also provide a way out so that you can stand up under it
2660283 god always gives us strength enough and sense enough for every thing that he wants us to do
2660284 it was my generation and the generation that preceded me that forgot the younger generation is not primarily to be blamed those who are struggling today those who are far away and doing that which is completely contrary to the christian conscience are not first to be blamed it is my generation and the generation that preceded me who turned away today we are left not only with a religion and a church without meaning but with a culture without meaning
2660285 70 of americans with a religious affiliation say that many religions not just their own can lead to eternal life
2660286 my religion is the one true faith leading to eternal life
2660287 only if your god can say things that outrage you and make you struggle as in a real friendship or marriage will you know that you have gotten a hold of a real god and not a figment of your imagination
2660288 many are willing that christ should be something but few will consent that christ should be everything
2660289 ah sovereign lord you have made the heavens and the earth by your great power and outstretched arm nothing is too hard for you
2660290 some people pray just to pray and some people pray to know god
2660291 and all these blessings shall come on thee and overtake thee if thou shalt hearken unto the voice of the lord thy god
2660292 hmm maybe people would like to shit and piss in a closet so ill shove a toilet and a sink in here and well be able to say our little house has a bath and a half
2660293 simplicity simplicity simplicity i say let your affairs be as two or three and not a hundred or a thousand instead of a million count half a dozen and keep your account on your thumb nail
2660294 seeing these young men on death row locked up its heartbreaking
2660295 im glad i got be a part of this and share the gospel
2660296 we have uncovered what we believe to be the first church in the world dating from ad33 to 70
2660297 the very strength and facility of the pessimists case at once poses us a problem if the universe is so bad or even half so bad how on earth did human beings ever come to attribute it to the activity of a wise and good creator men are fools perhaps but hardly so foolish as that the direct inference from black to white from evil flower to virtuous root from senseless work to a workman infinitely wise staggers belief the spectacle of the universe as revealed by experience can never have been the ground of religion it must have always been something in spite of which religion acquired from a different source was held
2660298 in our fast paced world it is a challenge to slow down and remember god is in control
2660299 if you feel overwhelmed bogged down or burnt out add one more activity to your daily schedule spend time with almighty god it is the only way to reach the depth needed to find true calm in the midst of any storm
2660300 we live in a world that is losing respect for christianity people dont like christians all that much but they do like jesus at least the jesus they have created in their own image
2660301 lifeway research discovered some sobering facts during two surveys conducted in 2007 of 1 402 people who had not attended a religious service at a church synagogue or mosque in the past six months the following statements were agreed to somewhat or strongly
2660302 perhaps the most sobering statistic is that 44 of people agreed somewhat or strongly with the statement christians get on my nerves
2660303 marriage in the united states shall consist only of the union of a man and a woman
2660304 americans have traditionally recognized this definition as being the most beneficial arrangement for the creation of stable family structures and for the upbringing of children
2660305 americans have repeatedly shown their preference for the traditional definition of one man one woman marriage by passing state and federal laws or by amending state constitutions to preserve the traditional definition
2660306 there simply is no basis for the suggestion that homosexual marriage is a right protected by the united states constitution
2660307 before the mountains were born or you brought forth the earth and the world from everlasting to everlasting you are god for a thousand years in your sight are like a day that has just gone by or like a watch in the night
2660308 and all these blessings shall come on thee and overtake thee if thou shalt hearken unto the voice of the lord thy god
2660309 i was nervous for the first 10 shots with this being my first olympics
2660310 at the end of the day i gave it my best shot and i have no regrets because i stuck with my game plan and saw myself improve throughout the competition
2660311 we feel that a customer would want to buy products that cesar recommends since hes a specialist in his field
2660312 das geh rt sich nicht f r ein m dchen
2660313 um abzuziehen m ssen wir sicher sein dass es dort keinen v lkermord mehr gibt
2660314 people get very excited about their causes and lack the sense to see if the information backs them up
2660315 you dont see their bodies going blotchily red and hear them howling like a banshee
2660316 wir sind sehr gut in das spiel gekommen chris war von anfang an sehr aggressiv das hat uns sicherlich geholfen
2660317 sie war mit jemandem zusammen der sie nicht gut behandelt hat
2660318 ik voelde me vooraf niet goed had vooraf koude rillingen
2660319 na de finish keek ik omhoog en ik zag president bush zijn duimen omhoog steken naar me en hij hield de amerikaanse vlag omhoog dat was best cool
2660320 i strongly condemn the in georgia and urge an immediate end to armed conflict now is the time for georgia and russia to show restraint and to avoid an escalation to full scale war georgias territorial integrity must be respected all sides should enter into direct talks on behalf of stability in georgia and the united states the united nations security council and the international community should fully support a peaceful resolution to this crisis
2660321 i never thought anything weird happened at night to me until i remember that this happened to me many times
2660322 i want to stand physically with my body keeping back people from disparaging what hundreds of sisters have done
2660323 i call on people literally i call on people to say you may disagree with me and us about this issue and cant you see that we are still doing something good
2660324 the foundation of the tradition is the human dignity of the individual
2660325 first book of genesis man and woman are created in the image and likeness of god and invited to co create with god there is human dignity thats the strand within this tradition of how important human dignity of the individual is
2660326 the findings are important because of the role drink plays in for example unsafe sex
2660327 the fulfillment of these eight prophecies alone proves that god inspired the writing of those prophecies to a definiteness which lacks only one chance in 10 17 of being absolute
2660328 i think the thing here with fuelwatch and obviously with grocerychoice is were about empowering people to make the best possible decisions
2660329 its one thing to wander yourself from supermarket to supermarket checking prices and many people do when theyre doing the weekly shop its another thing to have that information given to you in a convenient format thats what were trying to achieve
2660330 that shows that the community is very interested in the information it can provide
2660331 the liberal party wanders around saying its all a waste of time presumably they would abolish it presumably they believe in less information for consumers
2660332 treasurer wayne swan could learn from the shopsmart website how to provide information that is really relevant to shoppers
2660333 shopsmart also provides consumers a range of money saving and financial planning tips as well as a downloadable unit pricing matrix
2660334 this is really giving motorists the chance to call for a tender for their petrol and really the conservatives in the senate should get out of the way and let motorists have that opportunity
2660335 the liberal party ran around before the election drawing attention to that now they are trying to run around saying that wed said something different
2660336 when this recruitment drive is complete we will take the total number of police in wa to a new record of almost 6 000
2660337 research has shown that rate has now passed 25 per cent
2660338 i do not believe this will have an impact on the olympic games i do not think it is related to the olympics
2660339 its a fairly cold air stream so snow was likely in those places
2660340 there was snow this morning it started at about 6am and went on for about an hour and a half to two hours
2660341 now its just cloudy a bit overcast and real dark
2660342 there were a couple of cars that needed to be helped out of the snow
2660343 there is no snow on the ground in town but there is outside of town
2660344 ive been running this race since i was 13 years old
2660345 third was my best coming into today and to win it is a dream come true for me
2660346 im really excited to win it was my second time running it competitively
2660347 i wanted to run the first 10km hard i didnt want to leave it until the final 4km because its pretty easy from there
2660348 i started running when i was at school so it would be 50 or 60 years
2660349 ran away from the teachers to wag and hide and ive never stopped
2660350 this year i was just happy to make it over the finish line
2660351 last year i was waiting at the finish with a bandana on my head and no hair
2660352 i was in the ready room i didnt feel so good i got like these cold chills
2660353 afterwards i looked up and saw president bush giving me the thumbs up and holding up the american flag that was pretty cool
2660354 its probably going to be the most watched game in the history of the world
2660355 its going to send a lot of chills through my body just to be there and be part of it
2660356 i wanted to show this team the entire olympic team is here to compete we wanted to come out with an undying canadian honour and throw it down
2660357 i feel like im a leader on this team and i wanted to show im going to perform as i know how
2660358 really it came down to knowing what we can do were very capable of surprising the world by swimming really fast
2660359 like a deer in the headlights i think itll be better in sunday mornings final
2660360 we know we can race with the best in the world
2660361 its super exciting just walking around the village and seeing the rainbow of nations with every countrys colours and the different shapes and sizes of the athletes
2660362 its just really really cool it just kind of brings that olympic spirit to a head
2660363 its the first time where we actually meet all of us most of us have been here for two three four five days but its the first time that we gathered were here for the flag raising so it was very special and you could feel that the whole team is happy to be here the village is incredible so were ready to compete now
2660364 i won exactly on the sixth of august 1984 so to see the canadian flag go up like this and now in the position of chef de mission it was very special for me
2660365 for us it is pretty much the last thing we will do as the olympic team until august 17th so it was important for us to be here
2660366 we had to rush through the workout but it was important for us to be here and the kids really wanted to be here good mood great village we had a great camp so people are excited
2660367 one coach had a good analogy he said you know what
2660368 we belong here we belong in the playoffs we might not be the red wings yet but were going to be right in there anything can happen and thats the fun thing
2660369 i was thinking that today i was out on the line and thinking this is just gorgeous it never does get old
2660370 gli sono andato dietro di soppiatto ha poi raccontato alla radio abc zitto zitto e lho preso per la coda perch lo volevo tirare sopra il pontile ma poi si e girato e ha cercato di mordermi
2660371 quando sono tornato sobrio ci ho pensato e mi sono detto sono stato un po idiota a farlo
2660372 wir sind verheiratet da darf man sich auch schon mal k rperlich n hern
2660373 das h rte sich die tage aber noch ganz anders an
2660374 ja sag doch mal was nettes was man so sagt
2660375 el estado tambi n puede jugar su rol ah de manera de poder ir mirando los distintos problemas y tensiones e ir buscando las soluciones y evitar dentro de lo posible una mayor conflictividad social
2660376 se puede crecer con equidad y que esa situaci n no s lo es posible sino que adem s es fuente esencial de la capacidad de contar con democracia m s estable para que efectivamente se pueda seguir creciendo de mejor manera
2660377 en tanto no se reconozca a la libertad econ mica en su capacidad de derrotar la pobreza y no se valore el rol social de la empresa continuar n las desconfianzas los temores y las discusiones inconducentes las que provocan en definitiva la imposibilidad de compartir una visi n de futuro entre los distintos sectores de la sociedad
2660378 you pay for this ticket and you might as well spend the whole day
2660379 the mother dies in nature but the mothers imagery lives on
2660380 so i am saying that this poem in fact acts as a breast it is a poem that takes on takes over the function of the breast as that thing which connects people to each other and in fact is the thing that is the womans to give the special the thing of her body that makes her a mother and also is a relationship that is begun in a natural way by the child feeding at the breast and then is transferred as the child grows up to another space which is the passing on of culture of the lore of womens work but also the particular gift of language
2660381 how we defeat our biological destiny through a uniquely human power
2660382 that is the power of transferring our inner lives into external forms ill call that the power of inscription
2660383 we have nothing we are nothing thats why everyone scorns us
2660384 i wouldnt try the place i know its bad already any place with an american name is meant for tourists and non chinese and isnt good
2660385 i have probably had rice just about every day of my life
2660386 dear lord in the ensuing pandemonium please allows boobs and or a boob to pop out
2660387 this is one of my favorite sushi spots in all of sf
2660388 non sexual because their cmts are professional enough not to solicit your horny bastard asses for a rub and tug
2660389 mommy look at me look at me watch me do this mommy look lookie mommy look
2660390 all my people right here right now dy know what i mean
2660391 first wednesday of each month 9 00 am 4 00 am is going to be free beginning october 1 this will replace current free second saturday afternoons
2660392 being that i am of the male gender i have no taste for shopping when it comes to my significant other let alone for myself
2660393 hey since u lyk t shirts lets go into true they got some bombass ts there
2660394 one in a series of reviews for the larger than average guy
2660395 this is the kick in the butt i needed to crank out a film every 4 months
2660396 i wondered at the last minute whether it would be in english
2660397 i totally spaced on sunday and realized my passport expired a month before when i was supposed to fly the next day to prague
2660398 youll have to leave now youve way overstayed your time
2660399 move my car now or im going to tow it
2660400 i know what freddie did last halloween with snakes on a plane
2660401 so im picking you up at the bus station tonight
2660402 hey ron those are some good looking sandals whoa you know what would look even better than that tube socks and sandals
2660403 ever since i discovered unicorn via dining out for life the foodie fundraising event i coordinate ive been a fan
2660404 wait wait i dont speak cambodian just give me the number
2660405 ooh i cant believe its only 5 50 yeah well do you just name the price whatever you feel like all the time unbelievable
2660406 i wouldnt mind if it was brown but i find black hair too bitter on the palette
2660407 fish ball fish slices amp pork kidney with choice noodles in clear broth with beef stew sauce
2660408 not only this is below my apartment but its really typical italian and the owners are great very welcoming
2660409 i want the calamari and salad first then the soup and then the main course
2660410 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
2660411 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
2660412 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
2660413 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
2660414 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
2660415 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
2660416 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
2660417 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
2660418 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
2660419 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
2660420 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
2660421 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
2660422 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
2660423 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
2660424 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
2660425 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
2660426 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
2660427 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
2660428 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
2660429 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
2660430 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
2660431 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
2660432 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
2660433 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
2660434 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
2660435 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
2660436 i was so dreading bike shopping because so many used bike shops in the bay area have gotten bad reviews or mediocre reviews
2660437 building a bike is not easy why dont you have a look at out bikes
2660438 richard and charlotte are super good people who have a sincere interest in creating community
2660439 super good people who have a sincere interest in creating community
2660440 after reading countless reviews of this place i had to take my sushi loving booty here
2660441 in japanese cuisine sushi is vinegared rice usually topped with other ingredients including fish various meats and vegetables
2660442 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
2660443 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
2660444 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
2660445 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
2660446 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
2660447 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
2660448 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
2660449 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
2660450 love and decadence is what masaa named their february nine course tasting menu
2660451 im going to subtract a star because the waiter probably manager or owner or something make a little grimace when my friend ordered her burger medium well
2660452 monsieur youve had a ehvee buhgur why not have a crepe suzette and a cafe
2660453 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
2660454 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
2660455 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
2660456 but methane can be produced by non biological means so when you see it in the atmosphere of a planet biology was not necessarily involved and thats why we want to know about isotopes
2660457 feast and famine in biodiversity and severe climatic oscillations due to changes in density in the interstellar medium scientists have confirmed for the first time that an important component of early genetic material which has been found in meteorite fragments is extraterrestrial in origin in a paper published on 15 june 2008 the finding suggests that parts of the raw materials to make the first molecules of dna and rna may have come from the stars the scientists from europe and the usa say that their research published in the journal earth and planetary science letters provides evidence that lifes raw materials came from sources beyond the earth because meteorites represent left over materials from the formation of the solar system the key components for life including nucleobases could be widespread in the cosmos as more and more of lifes raw materials are discovered in objects from space the possibility of life springing forth wherever the right chemistry is present becomes more likely
2660458 if you have a universe that was just the mirror image of the one we know about then in fact presumably it would have right handed amino acids thats why im only half kidding when i say there is a guy on the other side of the universe with his heart on the right hand side
2660459 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
2660460 as soon as we have good enough computers we will be able to divide the phenomena of meteorology cleanly into two categories the stable and the unstable
2660461 for example we deduce the formulas for the riemannian curvature of a group endowed with an invariant riemannian metric
2660462 one trouble is that as some climate uncertainties are resolved new uncertainties are uncovered some modellers are now warning that feedback mechanisms in the natural environment which either accelerate or mitigate warming may be even more difficult to predict than previously assumed
2660463 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
2660464 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
2660465 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
2660466 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
2660467 ive driven by many a time but was turned off by the wait
2660468 everyone i know would love to eat here beer and chicken beer and fried chicken
2660469 holy hell i could get a 20 bucket of chicken over there but they wouldnt throw in a 2 liter of beer with it holy hell
2660470 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
2660471 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
2660472 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
2660473 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
2660474 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
2660475 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
2660476 let us imagine a palm tree growing peacefully near a spring and a lion hiding in the bush nearby all of its muscles taut with blood thirsty eyes prepared to jump upon an antelope and to strangle it the symbiotic theory and it alone lays bare the deepest mysteries of this scene unravels and illuminates the fundamental principle that could bring forth two such utterly different entities as a palm tree and a lion the palm behaves so peacefully so passively because it is a symbiosis because it contains a plethora of little workers green slaves chromatophores that work for it and nourish it the lion must nourish itself let us imagine each cell of the lion filled with chromatophores and i have no doubt that it would immediately lie down peacefully next to the palm feeling full or needing at most some water with mineral salts
2660477 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
2660478 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
2660479 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
2660480 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
2660481 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
2660482 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
2660483 thirty different kinds of cone bearing trees including species allied to the gigantic wellingtonia at present growing in california with other trees such as beeches oaks planes poplars maples walnuts limes a magnolia hazel blackthorn holly logwood and hawthorn these were represented not merely by leaves which occurred however in vast profusion but by fossil flowers and fruits including even cones of the magnolia thus proving
2660484 that they did not maintain a precarious existence but ripened their fruits
2660485 we call for a post 2012 international climate change arrangement that strengthens broadens and deepens the current arrangement and leads to reduced global emissions of greenhouse gases
2660486 the right recipe is to reduce the gap between production and consumption
2660487 indeed a closer inspection of the spatial structure of climate variability in particular on seasonal and longer time scales shows that it occurs predominantly in preferred large scale and geographically anchored spatial patterns
2660488 closeness of the boundary to the point of bifurcation and the error in linear equations
2660489 secular variation in aerosol transparency of the atmosphere as the possible link between long term variations in solar activity and climate
2660490 countries have been able to reassess the big picture of what is needed by identifying the key building blocks for an effective response to climate change
2660491 there is a consensus that the response needs to be global with the involvement of all countries and that it needs to give equal importance to adaptation and mitigation
2660492 the report clearly shows that energy efficiency can achieve real emission reductions at low cost
2660493 it also shows that many cost effective opportunities for reducing emissions are in developing countries but also that industrialised countries need aggressive emission reduction strategies
2660494 problem perceived or otherwise as we analyzed here paradigm shift in policy mechanisms for energy security from the g8 will produce more realistic outcomes then kyoto part 2
2660495 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
2660496 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
2660497 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
2660498 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
2660499 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
2660500 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
2660501 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
2660502 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
2660503 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
2660504 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
2660505 and of course this also affects the understanding of the current conditions
2660506 several countries are counting their forests as vegetative sinks for carbon dioxide

2660553 an immediate halt to the violence and a stand down by all troops
2660554 to launch international mediation and working with all sides in the conflict to restart their dialogue
2660555 immediately and unconditionally cease its military operations and withdraw all forces from sovereign georgian territory
2660556 russia should not be in the g 8 and by the way continued russian behavior indicates that russia is moving further and further from the principles and values and ideals of the g 8
2660557 russia should immediately and unconditionally cease its military operations and withdraw all forces from sovereign georgian territory
2660558 what is most critical now is to avoid further confrontation between russian and georgian military forces the consequences for euro atlantic stability and security are grave
2660559 bully democratic neighbors such as georgia and attempts to manipulate european dependence on russian oil and gas
2660560 because it plays well with some of the gop base
2660561 the whole point of lobbyists is to influence how politicians think
2660562 if these people have had an association for a long time how do you tell if it is because they think alike or one has told the other how to think because he is getting paid
2660563 any time youve got a guy who has been lobbying for somebody as opposed to a regular observer it sort of makes you wonder
2660564 my guess is that you cannot completely disentangle the influence

2660576 we have convened a joint parliamentary party meeting of our coalition partners on monday afternoon to devise a strategy against his impeachment
2660577 today many opposition members have publicly started saying president musharraf should resign
2660578 the committee will hand over the draft resolution to top leaders of the parties for final approval
2660579 it will be finalised in next four or five days
2660580 we anticipate that there could be a signing after the leaders have met to thrash out the remaining issues
2660581 will walk away with the mandate of his party if he is offered anything short of full executive power

2660610 what is the goal or endgame of the pro growth scheme

2660622 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates

2660624 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2660625 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2660626 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2660627 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2660628 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2660629 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2660915 this is one of the best times to buy a house interest rates are still low and there are a lot of price reductions
2660916 its a sad market and i think weve got at least two years of this before it gets better
2660917 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2660918 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2660919 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2660920 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2660921 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2660922 you fucking cock sucking hack youre taste in poetry is meaningful and unbiased as a christian at a porn festival i hope you burn motherfucker

2660926 ive been in rooms with bodies rotting there for a week and it never stunk that bad
2660927 theres just no way to describe it urine and feces dog cat and human excrement smeared on the walls mashed into the carpet everything dank and rotting
2660928 it sounded like you were walking on eggshells you couldnt take a step without crunching german cockroaches
2660929 they were in the lights in the furniture even inside the freezer the freezer
2660930 the pile of dirty diapers in that room must have been 4 feet high
2660931 the glass in the window had been broken and that child was just lying there surrounded by her own excrement and bugs
2660932 i put her over my shoulder and that diaper started leaking down my leg
2660933 but the only ones i found were covered in maggots and roaches
2660934 the mothers statement was im doing the best i can
2660935 if this child doesnt get to a hospital shes not going to make it
2660936 the child will be disabled for the rest of her life
2660937 there was no light in her eye no response or recognition we saw a little girl who didnt even respond to hugs or affection even a child with the most severe autism responds to those
2660938 in the first five years of life 85 percent of the brain is developed
2660939 those early relationships more than anything else help wire the brain and provide children with the experience to trust to develop language to communicate they need that system to relate to the world
2660940 its mind boggling that in the 21st century we can still have a child whos just left in a room like a gerbil
2660941 no food no one talking to her or reading her a story she cant even use her hands how could this child be so invisible
2660942 my hope was that she would be able to sleep through the night to be out of diapers and to feed herself
2660943 we were so distraught over her condition we agonized over what to do
2660944 her behavior was different than any child id ever seen
2660945 if you put food anywhere near her shed grab it
2660946 she had a lot of episodes of great agitation yelling flailing her arms rolling into a fetal position shed curl up in a closet just to be away from everyone she didnt know how to climb a slide or swing on a swing she didnt want to be touched
2660947 in my entire career with the child welfare system i dont ever remember a child like danielle
2660948 it makes you think about what does quality of life mean whats the best we can hope for her after all shes been through is it just being safe
2660949 that one is dangerous she cant be with other children
2660950 i guess she wanted to make sure the food was still there
2660951 okay lets put your shoes on do you need to go potty again
2660952 i know my son will never stand on his own will never be able to climb onto a horse you have no idea what your daughter might be able to do
2660953 id like her to at least be able to master a sound board so she can communicate her choices even if she never finds her voice
2660954 i think she understands most of what we say its just that she doesnt always know how to or want to react
2660955 i drive her around in my jeep and she honks the horn
2660956 you got your wormie you ready to go to sleep
2660957 thats okay too for me its all about getting the kisses and the hugs
2660958 left unattended for days with a retarded older brother never seen wearing anything but a diaper
2660959 the home is filthy there are clothes everywhere there are feces on the childs seat and the counter is covered with trash
2660960 is still wearing a diaper and drinking from a baby bottle on going situation worse since last august mom leaves grant and danielle at home for several days in a row while she goes to work and spends the night with a new paramour danielle is never seen outside the home
2660961 its not automatic that because the home is dirty wed remove the child
2660962 and what they found in 2002 was not like the scene they walked into in 2005
2660963 im concerned though that no effort was made to interview the child
2660964 if you have a 4 year old who is unable to speak that would raise a red flag to me
2660965 im not going to tell you this was okay i dont know how it could have happened
2660966 i tried to potty train her she wouldnt train i tried to get her into schools no one would take her
2660967 was that she didnt speak much she talked in a soft tone shed say lets go eat but no one could hear her except me
2660968 miss polly had a dolly she was sick sick sick
2660969 id been sick and it got away from me but i never knew a dirty house was against the law
2660970 he said she was starving i told him me and my sisters were all skinny till we were 13
2660971 she tended to blame her difficulties on circumstances while rationalizing her own actions
2660972 is more concerned with herself than most other adults and this could lead her to neglect paying adequate attention to people around her
2660973 they say i made her autistic but how do you make a kid autistic they say i didnt put clothes on her but she just tore them off
2660974 bought a bike but hey dont tell anybody but i already dumped it twice
2660975 will when did you get back from iceland be the last words my father ever speaks to me in this life

2661043 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection
2661044 we had one that we used in a sting for school zones
2661045 hopefully well have the new one by the time school starts again
2661046 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
2661047 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
2661048 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
2661049 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings

2661051 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
2661052 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
2661053 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
2661054 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
2661055 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
2661056 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
2661057 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
2661058 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
2661059 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
2661060 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
2661061 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
2661062 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
2661063 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
2661064 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
2661065 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
2661066 run to win the prize the nature of warnings in new testament theology
2661067 many christians seem to believe that gods relationship with the universe is deterministic that god has already filmed the future in his mind and what were seeing unfold in history is the showing of a movie thats already in the can so to speak i dont believe that i believe gods relationship with creation including us is interactive god gives us warnings which are an invitation to change our ways god gives us promises which are an invitation to persevere when the going gets tough a great example is the prophet jonah he was sent to nineveh to prophesy doom in hopes that the people would repent so the prophecy wouldnt come true
2661068 those who were enlightened who tasted who were made partakers who tasted and who fell away
2661069 the old testament background of the warning in hebrews 6 4 8
2661070 it is impossible to restore again to repentance those who have once been enlightened
2661071 those who once were made partakers of the holy spirit
2661072 those who once tasted the good word of god and the powers of the coming age
2661073 if you go on sinning deliberately there no longer remains a sacrifice
2661074 now if you unintentionally fail to keep any of these commands the lord gave moses any of the lords commands to you through him from the day the lord gave them and continuing through the generations to come and if this is done unintentionally without the community being aware of it then the whole community is to offer a young bull for a burnt offering as an aroma pleasing to the lord along with its prescribed grain offering and drink offering and a male goat for a sin offering
2661075 but if just one person sins unintentionally he must bring a year old female goat for a sin offering
2661076 but anyone who sins defiantly whether native born or alien blasphemes the lord and that person must be cut off from his people

2661114 now the question with respect to this doctrine of perseverance is not whether those who have obtained a true saving faith could not if left to themselves lose it again by their own fault and sins nor whether sometimes all the activity boldness and comfort of faith actually ceases and faith itself goes into hiding under the cares of life and the delights of the world

2661122 was there as a silent witness to the battle to the aftermath to the burials to the dedication of the cemetery
2661123 i have no doubt that union soldiers sat under it for all three days of the battle
2661124 when its something this bad its highly doubtful that a tree like that can survive
2661125 its a shame when you lose the last living entities on this battlefield
2661126 i am not a candidate i am not interested in doing that
2661127 elections in florida tend to be close and hed have some effect

2661133 and youre going to guide him and bring him home safe
2661134 im just making them small so he can put them in his pocket
2661135 there was a general sense of paranoia that they were going to get somebody no matter what
2661136 you do the best you can and its not always pretty

2661142 add the fact that its where lincoln is buried you have a lot of symbolism lincoln was a live memory to a lot of people
2661143 i found it hypocritical that in this town its all about lincoln we want to embrace him then you find out this is who we are this is springfield

2661164 two members of the commission brought up the fact that they still were not convinced that the president had been shot from the sixth floor window of the texas book depository
2661165 these members failed to understand the trajectory of the slugs that killed the president he stated he felt this point would be discussed further but of course would represent no problem
2661166 though we did experience some difficulty with all the members of the warren commission ford was of considerable help to the bureau

2661170 the er has become the front door to the hospital
2661171 millions more people each year are seeking emergency care but emergency departments are continuing to close often because so much care goes uncompensated
2661172 this report is very troubling because it shows that care is being delayed for everyone including people in pain and with heart attacks
2661173 we never expected a whole lot of people to get them but it did make sense to allow the use of raptors to control problem flocks of birds agricultural pests because in many ways thats probably more environmentally sound than other methods people might use
2661174 i expect the kinds of uses will expand in the future but its still early in the game
2661175 if you lose a peregrine or prairie falcon that is native to north america its not as big an issue as losing something thats not native
2661176 im not downplaying this race by any means but i have to put that race behind me
2661177 i have to act like it never happened because i have so many tough races ahead of me
2661178 going into the last 50 and looking to my right and seeing that i was ahead of ryan and laszlo i sort of started smiling
2661179 i looked up and he waved the flag and nodded his head
2661180 that was a pretty cool feeling to have the president say congratulations and have him in the crowd
2661181 we had a deal i told bob that i wanted this to be my last 400 im he said i have to end on a record
2661182 looking and seeing all three of us together pretty much at the 200 i wasnt really comfortable with having that close of a race
2661183 i usually have more of a gap but it made my breaststroke a lot stronger
2661184 i saw lochte was going slower and i tried to do everything to go better than phelps but i dont have enough power for that
2661185 i did everything i could so thats all i can ask for
2661186 that was amazing setting another world record you cant ask for anything else that was a great way to start off the meet for usa
2661187 i sort of turned around and thought i saw 4 31 and i was thinking that hurt a lot for a 4 31
2661188 but when i walked over and saw the 4 29 i thought thats amazing
2661189 it was a tough race but i cant really be mad
2661190 i was only like a half second off my best time so im happy to get my first medal of the olympics
2661191 everyone did a great job and were really happy with silver because i dont think we were even expecting that

2661194 theres a feeling behind the word squaw and its not positive
2661195 vacating settlements which were previously approved for these families has rubbed raw the wounds of september 11 it has caused disappointment and for some anger
2661196 i think a certain amount of tension is very healthy and a certain amount of different views
2661197 because of the bubble that a president is in and the bubble that a candidate is in sometimes you find out afterwards something that oh boy i wish i had heard thus and such and so and so so i appreciate and want some of the tension i dont want too much of it obviously because we have to have certain efficiencies but i think there is a balance there
2661198 we are certainly seeing the signs of the economic downturn in people falling behind in their payments and more of them getting to the point where theyre getting their service shut off
2661199 people are coming to our office in record numbers with very high utility bills
2661200 its pretty pathetic when the only thing saving someone from disconnection is being flooded out

2661208 i am operating in a twilight zone because there are no rules
2661209 i need to be careful about how i do this
2661210 some places were unprepared some places just couldnt handle it
2661211 people know its going to be a historically high turnout whether they can do anything about it is another question
2661212 tens and sometimes hundreds of thousands of voters are disenfranchised sometimes raising serious questions about whether the intended choice of the voters was certified as the winner
2661213 the first couple of primaries get all the attention its decided and nobody turns out for other elections later on in the primary season
2661214 and that didnt happen this time and i think thats where some elections administrators in later primaries got caught
2661215 some might get lost or replaced or the person didnt fill out all the information and theyre not on the rolls
2661216 not content to merely predict failure in iraq my opponent tried to legislate failure
2661217 it will be notional and aspirational dates but it will be based on conditions i know that
2661218 they will be times that we hope they can be out by they will be based on conditions on the ground not according to hard deadlines
2661219 we have no regrets about going year round our children like it and our teachers like it after five weeks off in the summer they are ready to go back
2661220 the two week break in october is great because no one else is off
2661221 the demand here is very high so its an easier transition to high school
2661222 figment of the tabloid press i dont want that garbage in with the puppy story
2661223 that i would ski naked down mount everest in the nude with a carnation up my nose if he asked me to
2661224 we go to church and serve the lord and try to lead good lives and do good things
2661225 they want us to expand it to five days a week
2661226 not all the guys have all their marbles but what they have left of their marbles they bring to the table
2661227 theyre very funny very pleasant raining shining snowing theyre always here they make the best of themselves
2661228 one projection we can make about the stock market is it will fluctuate
2661229 then he passes out for the rest of the week
2661230 i just knew i did not want to go to school right now
2661231 i was tired of learning in a classroom i want to immerse myself in the hands on real world
2661232 they sit so much in high school and have people talk to them
2661233 i think part of our role is to take students out of park and put them into drive
2661234 i wouldnt call it mainstream yet but i would say theres been a real tipping point in the past few years
2661235 its one thing to talk about poverty and see it on tv
2661236 its something completely different to be on the streets of calcutta in the middle of it working at mother teresas center
2661237 i think its hard going from having a daughter whos here all the time to someone who is more of an adult and is living in switzerland
2661238 once john mccain began catering to his new friends in big oil the spigot clearly opened
2661239 undercuts his accusation that mccain is in the industrys pocket
2661240 to tax one industry to subsidize consumption doesnt do anything to encourage supply
2661241 im sure that having a couple weeks off and enjoying the olympics is probably what the doctor ordered for everybody
2661242 mccains people have said theyre not looking for a fight theyre not looking to change the platform
2661243 if the record date is less than a certain day get this semantic value from this field otherwise
2661244 consumers are eager for clean energy solutions and a small wind system is one of the most productive ways to generate clean reliable fuel free electricity
2661245 to fully meet growing customer demand we need policies that make it easier and less costly to invest in small wind systems
2661246 aiyo von ar how come you suddenly so blur wan har never see you liddis before le you okay ar
2661247 the country has the potential to generate electricity from wind in excess of its current total national power consumption and without the harmful effects of fossil fuel and nuclear powered generation plants
2661248 we are stuck with technology when what we really want is just stuff that works
2661249 a man with a cruel tendency to squeeze his squeaky rubber duck at inopportune moments
2661250 why me why do i have to be the one sitting here across from the queen of the spazzes
2661251 you see kids your father and i thought if we went ahead and lost the genetic lottery for you from the start you wouldnt have a chance to feel as bitter
2661252 we are stuck with technology when what we really want is just stuff that works
2661253 i wish those devil twins would wait until they are out of school to test their evil stuff
2661254 i think its outrageously funny what these first years will do for two sickles
2661255 these boys are going to make it big in the business ill tell you that much
2661256 well have really low prices cause its all made by us
2661257 at the very least its embarrassing for the company that its own stock of demo machines are still susceptible to the problem
2661258 any material impact on the xbox 360 platform or our position in the marketplace
2661259 the wind was up all day and the greens were firm and there were an awful lot of really tight pin placements that made it really tough to get it close and there were not any easy birdies out there
2661260 you never want to end your round with a three putt or any bogey
2661261 that hole is so tough that a par always feels like birdie
2661262 this has a greater significance than anything ive ever been part of
2661263 it will be the highest energy game ive ever been part of
2661264 if they dont understand this they dont know what theyre talking about its simple youre playing for your country
2661265 thats the first time id ever heard those usa chants in person and it was the most amazing thing ever
2661266 nobody in l a wants to win for the lakers more than me everybody knows it but this is something totally different
2661267 if we dont win the gold medal i might not be a u s citizen anymore
2661268 carmelo anthony would be puerto rican lebron would be russian and ill be italian just call me antonio
2661269 the market has opened up now well see how the league responds to it
2661270 we dont want people to have the wrong impression that we are selfish and cant play team basketball
2661271 we have to change the way people look at us
2661272 we speak out for a free press freedom of assembly and labor rights not to antagonize you but because trusting your people with greater freedom is the only way for your country to develop its full potential
2661273 and we press for openness and justice not to impose our beliefs but to allow your people to express theirs
2661274 my country stands in firm opposition to your countrys detention of political dissidents
2661275 i am optimistic about your future young people who grow up with the freedom to trade goods will ultimately demand the freedom to trade ideas
2661276 i knew it was going to be a tough race all the way through
2661277 looking and seeing all three of us together pretty much at the 200 i wasnt really comfortable with having that close of a race
2661278 i usually have more of a gap but it made my breaststroke a lot stronger
2661279 i looked up and he waved the flag and nodded his head
2661280 that was a pretty cool feeling to have the president say congratulations and have him in the crowd
2661281 i did everything i could so thats all i can ask for
2661282 that was amazing setting another world record you cant ask for anything else that was a great way to start off the meet for usa
2661283 theres no way to replace what you had exactly but were going to try to get you something similar if not even more awesome
2661284 developers should simply accept that there is no way to efficiently and easily close the loop on the o r mismatch and use an o r m to solve 80 or 50 or 95 or whatever percentage seems appropriate of the problem and make use of sql and relational based access such as
2661285 late to the game i know but i just spotted this post as it is getting some fresh link love from a few parties today
2661286 a dialog was started only because of the professionalism of the ef team
2661287 we hear you but everything you raise is out of scope
2661288 linq2sql is simply an active record implementation that is not using self serving objects
2661289 every time we take this approach we find that the class we surface represents an insight into the domain
2661290 my first problem with orms in general is that they force you into a

2661292 both works are dark comedies both works provided thoughtful social commentary on the mall culture zeitgeist in addition to serving up a sizable portion of sensationalistic violence
2661293 i dont know if either one of us has a lot to be proud of today
2661294 i think both of us will be looking to get some momentum in the morning hoping it will carry us through on whats going to be a long day
2661295 this isnt the ryder cup week we have three weeks to go i want a guy who is confident and if the guys confidence is shattered when he left here join the club
2661296 i spent a lot of time in the fitness trailer ive got an elbow issue
2661297 so i was warming it up and then id go practice then re warming it up and then going to practice again and i was eating and watching the olympics and talking and taking a nap i just kind of covered all the bases
2661298 it will be like college again playing 36 in one day
2661299 it happens and everyone else has to do it too so we just have to go out there and deal with it theyve got 12 hours to work on the golf course and it needed the rain
2661300 i think it is fair to say they will be significantly more receptive
2661301 almost perfect yesterday i finished very mad with my round and now after this 18 holes i cant believe it i will have a chance for tomorrow i have to wait but its great to be here
2661302 i guess the course is going to change quite a bit
2661303 its still going to be playing difficult but probably not to the extreme it was playing the last couple of days
2661304 as you grow older you tend to try to calm down a little bit more and realize what you have to do that its going to help you be the best player you can be out there
2661305 obviously its a tough major and we know that we are not used to seeing this kind of major on a pga championship but its still a major so you just got to realize it and just keep playing hard and hopefully you will be there on sunday
2661306 i knew he was a little bit slow and i could see us catching him and to get him on the last corner was pretty fantastic
2661307 i think this is the view dario had on the last lap in chicago last year
2661308 i just feel like a weight is off my shoulders just a huge relief
2661309 weve come close we havent been able to close the deal
2661310 i can count the number of days on one hand where youre sweating already before the race even starts
2661311 we had ice packs on our backs already and that never happens
2661312 i dont know whether thats got anything to do with it
2661313 you cant put all the gloominess on china its a worldwide issue
2661314 it was a reaction that i dont even have to describe you have to understand what liz bachman is to usa volleyball shes probably the nicest person in the entire world her and her family
2661315 her family is like our family because they traveled with us she fought in the 2004 olympics with us she was my roommate in 2004
2661316 he averaged 28 3 points a game during the regular season
2661317 most chinese fans love yao ming but they also love bryant lebron james dwight howard and carmelo anthony
2661318 if theres an olympic event where chinese will cheer for another nation its basketball
2661319 i wont talk about any specific cases or individuals but we wouldnt offer a scholarship if we knew they had problems with the law
2661320 texas is one of the hardest schools when it comes to looking at character
2661321 when youre looking at a guys physical attributes you can just watch him and find out if hes got what youre looking for you dont know if hes always going to develop but you know if the foundation is there
2661322 but its the character that weve got to do a lot of research on now
2661323 this is a hard deal we try to research guys the best we can we talk to coaches high school counselors principals parents teachers opposing coaches we talk to everybody and its still not an exact science
2661324 i think they almost ask more questions about character now than they do about a players athletic ability
2661325 well the ones that do more research some of these schools offer kids scholarships before they even come talk to us
2661326 they see them at a recruiting camp and they offer him there then they come and ask questions not texas or texas a amp m they ask questions first then offer
2661327 one of the main issues some schools have is all these high school coaches want players to go to big time programs
2661328 its a big deal when youre a high school coach and one of your players goes to texas or oklahoma florida or usc its more attention more press so these coaches want their players going to these big schools
2661329 i dont know if high school coaches lie to college coaches but they might not be 100 percent forthcoming about the kids background youve got to know a high school coach is being honest with you
2661330 if theyve got good values in their family and they tell you the truth they call you when theyre supposed to they show up when theyre supposed to they e mail back when you e mail them and theyve done things for the school and leadership with the community theyre responsible those are no brainers but that makes sense
2661331 we prefer kids from two parent families because they tend to be more stable
2661332 more recently weve accepted kids from one parent families because half the kids come from those homes now our rule is that there has to be one strong parent as a role model
2661333 if we have trouble with the parents we dont recruit the kid
2661334 if hes got a high test score and low grades it means he hasnt really been working as hard and isnt putting as much effort into school
2661335 a confident kid is going to have success and isnt as prone to falling into something because of peer pressure
2661336 youve got to talk to the assistant coaches coaches of their opponents the coaches of the opponent might not know as much about character but theyre good to talk to the more people you talk to the more you know the kid youre recruiting
2661337 youd like to think that youre aware of most of the stuff that happens off the field
2661338 even in a class 5a program you hear about most the stuff that happens off the field
2661339 the way i see it is if i have kept a kid on my football team hes worth any college recruiting if he wasnt worth it he wouldnt be on my team
2661340 there have been some times throughout my career i dont know if its 20 percent 15 percent or 10 percent sometimes guys who you think are good for your place somewhere along the line they do something that you know theyre not a fit for your place
2661341 you get fooled for a while but usually the kids characters reveal themselves
2661342 its a pretty difficult offense to learn itll take some time but i think well be fine

2661348 in my 20 plus years on the water in texas bays ive never caught a fish that looked like this
2661349 they were very aggressive fighters for their size with a mouthful of razor sharp teeth their skin was not at all slimy and felt almost snake like the first was about 13 inches long and the second closer to 11
2661350 hes so aggressive right now i think brian orakpo has been good for sam to tell him get here faster or you gotta be tougher
2661351 this senior class the older guys are doing a lot better job of coaching the younger ones than our previous two years we think its bringing some of those younger ones on quicker
2661352 sam acho eddie jones and henry melton gave us the chance to move lamarr houston inside and not have a dropoff
2661353 its not that much of a difference to me i played left tackle all through high school and when i started out here i played left
2661354 as a swing guy i went to right tackle when cedric dockery went down its just switching from right technique to left technique its not a big deal
2661355 hes pure size hes 320 something pounds but he doesnt look like it you look at him and he can really move
2661356 hes a great christian young man you put him on that field and all he does is block people and get after them it doesnt feel outwardly as nasty but hes got a great tenacity level
2661357 if they dont have that theyre going to have a hard time playing so all of them i would like to think have a good degree of it
2661358 i get a little bit of time with john chiles every day quite a bit hes doing a nice job i think you can definitely see spurts where hes very comfortable there
2661359 working on the little things is always a challenge for any wide receiver john taking a bunch of snaps at quarterback and then coming out in certain packages and playing wideout its just going to be a learning process for him
2661360 weve had several prices increases that have totaled 60 70 percent from all the manufacturers in the past year and a half so prices for most shells are going to reflect those increases

2661371 generally there is no wealth and very little regard in helping the needy
2661372 its supposed to be hard if it wasnt hard everyone would do it

2661378 the er has become the front door to the hospital
2661379 millions more people each year are seeking emergency care but emergency departments are continuing to close often because so much care goes uncompensated
2661380 this report is very troubling because it shows that care is being delayed for everyone including people in pain and with heart attacks
2661381 im hopeful this will mark a new approach for mental illness
2661382 it should provide a tool to diagnose the condition and test therapys effectiveness
2661383 most people actually become a little generous when the other player sends a stingy amount trying to coax cooperation back

2661386 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2661387 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2661388 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2661389 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2661390 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2661391 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2661392 this is a very sad day for many of us who knew and loved bernie
2661393 he brought so much joy to so many he will be missed but heaven just got funnier

2661403 its truly the passing of one of our favorite sons

2661405 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2661406 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2661407 weve got to get out of the habit of thinking that we only need to focus on improving the technology that we can invent our way out of this situation

2661425 in short we will better understand aldhelms extraordinary achievement if we think of him as a well connected prince bishop rather than a retiring monk whose only link to reality was expressed through deliciously difficult latin prose and verse
2661426 senator mccain talks about putting our country first but he is running for a third term of the very same policies that have set our country back i believe that we need to move in a new direction
2661427 even the most stirring speeches are easily forgotten when theyre short on content taking in my opponents performances is a little like watching a big summer blockbuster and an hour in realizing that all the best scenes were in the trailer you saw last fall in the way of running mates senator obama should consider someone with a knack for brevity and directness to balance the ticket
2661428 first there was his call for americans to check their tires which is common sense advice but hardly has the makings of a national energy strategy if we cant drill our way out of the problem it seems even more unlikely that we can inflate our way out of it

2661437 we are still putting all the pieces of this investigation together
2661438 it is too early for us to look at just one thing
2661439 it got pretty hectic with people wanting to know where their loved ones were
2661440 it was very poignant your heart goes out to people
2661441 their families have come up from other areas to identify their parents or loved ones it is heartbreaking

2661451 its as keyboard driven as it is organic but gone are the drum machines gone are the super fluffy pop synths instead the record is taking more of a road of a band that merges queens of the stone age with old skinny puppy dipped in peter schilling with a little flash gordon sprinkled on top ripping rock guitars and all toms on the drums instead of straight rock beats with 100 analog synths slicing through everything around it
2661452 everything is a duet at the top of all vocal range fast moving and loaded with more percussion than the blue man group
2661453 this record is made to decapitate and remove legs at the knees but melody still rules our world every song could be played on an old guitar around a campfire

2661458 i hope my opponent will join me to demand that these out of state groups keep out of kansas
2661459 let anybody come tell their story and let the voters sort it out
2661460 this is terrific news for anyone who believes that kansas voters should control kansas campaigns
2661461 by canceling their ads the dccc has given kansas the opportunity to run our election without washington interference
2661462 it appears that the dccc doesnt think nancy boyda can beat lynn jenkins and has decided to spend their dollars elsewhere
2661463 rep boyda is well on her way to victory and this is nothing more than delusional spin coming from the wounded and divided republican party
2661464 la rue de planches et toutes les maisons taient soutenues par des tais en contrebas
2661465 creo que ganamos un punto m s que rescatar porque el rival fue muy dif cil en el segundo planteamos bien y eso fue importante

2661467 obviamente cuando uno no gana siempre se marca m s los errores pero nosotros tenemos un buen equipo y tenemos tiempo para mejorar
2661468 the first thing i want to talk about is a bunny trail from our actual topic today but its about the two thirds world moving into the first world the two thirds world churches are moving into the first world with power right now there is little power in the first world church but the two thirds world is bringing it back
2661469 we often look at the disciples like they were perfect but peter was impetuous fearful and bold to speak he wasnt perfect yet jesus chose him to build his church on god wants to prepare us for persecution we all get a little bit of something in part the christian life will bring persecution
2661470 god doesnt write us off even when we back off our promises we are all to step forward look at genesis 12 1 3 we have to yield and be willing to be a great people and this greatness looks like jesus abram left his country and his family and was dependent upon god he yielded and god made him great we are to have an attitude of dependence on him we were created to be dependent on him god looks at us and see the greatness we will be we are complete in him he doesnt size us up he sees us fully
2661471 i want to play a song called the vow and i want to call anyone forward who wants to live for something greater than themselves
2661472 god is in the wind and now you can hear him
2661473 today god was in the wind and he was speaking we need to catch the wind what is real the spirit realm what is passing what is always changing the natural realm when god created us he gave us a deep hunger for things of the spirit greater than those things of the natural
2661474 the kids need to be fed god is raising up a generation of people who understand the spirit and wont take it lightly once aware of the things of the spirit you will know how to behave in any nation because you will see the things of the spirit in the natural what do you
2661475 we dont need words words have been misused in his spirit words are unnecessary this is no accident we have been lead here we have been hand picked hes been raising up a generation we dont need a bonfire to start a fire just a matchstick which is small and unnoticed
2661476 if you want to know the spiritual realm more pray for it
2661477 which i know some of you have gotten come up and share it
2661478 the son is rising over the world and closed countries will become open countries
2661479 there will be no need for missionaries because the whole world will know jesus as lord
2661480 in the second vision i saw a huge pile of grain no matter how much was taken out the pile never got smaller this is the storehouse of heaven it never empties and there is always enough food for our spirit
2661481 that is right each time you get low you will get lower the only way up is to rise by my spirit see in this time i have killed you and now raise you with my spirit
2661482 hoyo hoyo hoyo hoyo hoyo hoyo salama en manchina na yesu
2661483 have you seen anyone coming out of there with bread
2661484 no but then again i havent been watching either im going in to town this afternoon if you would like to go
2661485 yeah i need to pull out some cash so id love to go what time are you looking at leaving
2661486 sounds good ill probably be around the compound but in case i happen to leave at least i know when to be back
2661487 destroy blow away and cleanse in that order everything not of me leaving only that which is mine
2661488 yes especially when god gives you a vision in the midst of it
2661489 you need to write that out and give it to lesley theres a lot of opposition right now and i know that would encourage her greatly
2661490 this is one of the reasons i brought you to mozambique
2661491 jesus i stand in the gap and i say depression must go it must flee in the light of your love and your wonder and beauty it cannot stay we say depression you are not welcome you are not allowed
2661492 you are caught entirely fire and i see sparks flying off of you and catching other people ablaze
2661493 today is the day today is the day where everything changes your mind is renewed
2661494 if this is from you tell me why and if its not i dont want it
2661495 hi i was wondering if you could pray for me i struggle a lot with depression and im on medication but i would love to not have to be
2661496 severe depression runs in my family and while i dont have it now i feel this sense of hopelessness that im going to get it
2661497 what a gift needs to be is super valuable to the recipient the value of a gift is based on perception
2661498 gifts dont have to be free stuff like books or ipods gifts can be in the form of knowledge intellectual property insider access or blogger exclusives gifts can be informational gifts can solve a community problem or customer service issues
2661499 everything must flow out of intimacy with god if it doesnt youll feel like a robot
2661500 god lets us choose how close we get to him
2661501 most have settled for a lower standard of christian living
2661502 in the old testament some caught a glimpse of god why did some get to get a glimpse
2661503 many have caught a glimpse but it hasnt resulted in permanent transformation
2661504 we listen to what we need to lay down we lay down when conviction comes the higher the call the narrower the path the fewer the people
2661505 joshua never left the tent because wanted to be where the presence of god was when we come face to face with him we get a revelation of who he is and who we are it changes everything we have no more fears
2661506 we were created for a face to face its here and now i want to be where you are
2661507 intimacy is number one with each encounter you get closer to being who god made you to be we become more willing to down our lives for a nation
2661508 the song i want to play during this time is from the moravian missionary movement the moravians sold themselves into slaver to reach the west indies would you be willing to give yourself for a nation
2661509 and your quiet times will truly be quiet times with me anything that has come before me will no longer come before me
2661510 thank you for the yes that you have put in this girls heart
2661511 i need to be alone to be with god i can spend all the time in the world with people but when it comes to experiencing god and drawing near to him i need to spend time alone
2661512 be strong do not fear your god will come he will come with vengeance with divine retribution he will come to save you
2661513 he put on righteousness as his breastplate and the helmet of salvation on his head he put on the garments of vengeance and wrapped himself in zeal as in a cloak
2661514 from the west men will fear the name of the lord and from the rising of the sun they will revere his glory for he will come like a pent up flood that the breath of the lord drives along
2661515 we are about to be marked by a family inheritance
2661516 we experience life by every word coming from his mouth faith comes from hearing not having heard
2661517 imagine if abraham had only lived by what he heard and not kept listening isaac would have been slaughtered on the mountain
2661518 when you think of god as the punisher you become unable to discern when to rise up and fight hes better than we think after all how many storms did jesus bless if you see death loss and destruction guess who was there god can use storm for good but it doesnt mean he initiated it
2661519 the reality of the kingdom within you is bigger than the world around you if you know what you have you will use it and you know what you need to seek you cant pray enough to get revival but you can yield enough to have one
2661520 jesus was born in a manger hes not picky about where he shows up hell go to whomever is yielding
2661521 everytime we do what we were made to do its broadcast among the heavens to show to the angels why god is wise in bankrupting heaven for us
2661522 their internal reality became the israelites external reality a wanderer in heart becomes a wanderer in the desert
2661523 the reality of the kingdom is realized through touch the more you lay hands the more the spirit flows you pray in the spirit constantly so it is always there learn how the spirit manifests on you if we dont learn the the way he affects us we wont realize the anointing
2661524 but only one has a resurrection if yielding doesnt demonstrate power we miss the purpose of yielding
2661525 pray to release a family inheritance on you with benni as some of you may know i have a strong generational inheritance of pastors in my family and we just want to release that on you were running out of time because we have to get to the airport but we can do it quickly if you file past us
2661526 if i gave it to you would you use it
2661527 you heard gods call and you came you sacrificed greatly to be here you are missionaries
2661528 i couldnt help but think we should be running with them to the nations
2661529 oh no this is going to be a long summer
2661530 shes not used to having strangers in the house but shell get used to it dont worry about it
2661531 for such a beautiful start to my day and it makes my heart want to sing
2661532 nations will come to your light and kings to the brightness of your dawn
2661533 for i the lord love justice i hate robbery and iniquity in my faithfulness i will reward them and make an everlasting covenant with them 9 their descendants will be known among the nations and their offspring among the peoples all who see them will acknowledge that they are a people the lord has blessed

2661549 do you know where we could find a long ethernet cable
2661550 its definitely intimidating but being there is a good way for us to see other talented dancers and be inspired by other talented people
2661551 i had all these horrible feelings about playing and not being able to interface properly with my instrument
2661552 but by working with sandpaper files and his good knowledge lee can put the necessary curve on the mouthpiece to make it respond just right it seems so arcane but it is so necessary to making clarinetists happy
2661553 he has a beautiful sound and wonderful lyricism a clarinet player who is world class in every way
2661554 i know my response is kind of roundabout but this is where my thinking has been
2661555 most people think poster and its so much more than that its not really that at all
2661556 if im 90 percent clean why not be 100 percent clean
2661557 i dont have to run my jokes through a committee
2661558 we met at the grammy awards ive always thought that given her pop stardom and her connection to the lds church she would be a natural for a concert with the utah symphony i wish i were conducting
2661559 singing in front of the future director of the mormon tabernacle choir
2661560 ive been so impressed with the way hes stepped up
2661561 he has moved forward in a very humble way yet he knows his ability and goes forward with a lot of confidence
2661562 mack is the single most talented musician ive ever known in my life
2661563 a mack wilberg comes into a community once in a century maybe and its not just one area he could have been a concert pianist a composer an arranger a conductor a scholar
2661564 it was very obvious when he was a youngster that there was much talent there
2661565 the thing i remember most about him as a student besides his stellar talent and musical ability was that he was always always available to accompany other students in a vocal recital an instrumental recital anything
2661566 i worked with great and talented students i really thought i would be there most of my career
2661567 i came not knowing if id made the right decision but really from my first day on the job ive had no regrets
2661568 so much of what we did was a team effort if it hadnt been that way i would have felt very much out of my element
2661569 mack is so quiet and unassuming that he almost succeeds in masking the intensity of his musical brilliance
2661570 it speaks loud and clear though in the wonderful catalog of arrangements and compositions he has created over the years as well as in his knowledgeable and incisive direction
2661571 its a bit of a sacrifice not only for the choir members but for their families
2661572 there is a treasury of material there that hasnt been tapped but that is a perfect fit for what we do here
2661573 i just love the folk element a lot of that has to do with my background being from a smaller more removed place that element really speaks to me
2661574 gina poked her own nose into the folds of the little neck and drank in the fragrance all babies had it her sister elisas baby had it a dewy freshness that comes with newborn skin and lasts for months unlike any other it was a scent that mothers couldnt get enough of that made non mothers feel cheated

2661586 were going to be real young but we do have some good senior leadership
2661587 im not predicting well be great this year but i think we will be competitive
2661588 i think were definitely going to compete for a playoff spot
2661589 just everywhere out here laid out on the ground they are bloody
2661590 everybodys in camp because they havent run this specific style before everybodys in the running
2661591 were going to put the best four receivers on the field you never know how good a man is until you push him
2661592 coach rib knows what hes doing it works for me
2661593 if each person does their part its going to make the team better
2661594 we chart every pass thats thrown who threw it who caught it what play it was and did it work
2661595 weve got a lot of ground to cover in preseason i dont know when all those questions will be answered some might now be answered until we get into the season
2661596 of course the college game is a lot faster than high school
2661597 but its a big change between blocking every play and running routes
2661598 with the people that eventually come out on top well be pretty hard to stop
2661599 my goal is to be successful in college and hopefully make it to the pros
2661600 here my main goal is to contribute to the team and be a go to guy
2661601 i believe the nicest and sweetest days are not those on which anything splendid or wonderful or exciting happens but just those that bring simple little pleasures following one another softly like pearls slipping off a string
2661602 i am waiting for you vizzini you told me to go back to the beginning so i have this is where i am and this is where ill stay i will not be moved
2661603 love is like quicksilver in the hand leave the fingers open and it stays clutch it and it darts away
2661604 follow your heart but be quiet for a while first ask questions then feel the answer learn to trust your heart
2661605 its not so much that were afraid of change or so in love with the old ways but its that place in between that we fear its like being between trapezes its linus when his blanket is in the dryer theres nothing to hold on to
2661606 yeah man im out there manning a machine gun killing people blowing stuff up
2661607 the culture in utah is very family oriented and its a family oriented play i think theres a lot of synergy between that and the mormon culture
2661608 its about whats human in us as opposed to any other identifying label
2661609 the story of fiddler resonates with a lot of people you dont have to be jewish to understand it
2661610 in directing a play one of the most important things is to figure out what the basis of the story is and for me the story is about a family
2661611 you could take that story and set it in 100 different cultures and it would still resonate
2661612 while there are a lot of divisions there are also a lot of commonalities
2661613 utah itself was largely founded because there was a people who were driven from their homes because of their religious beliefs
2661614 its such a great message about the traditions and the breaking of them
2661615 by november when we were done fixing it up and ready to sell the market had completely crashed
2661616 part of me thinks im a realtor i should have known better
2661617 ill probably be lucky to sell it for half a million
2661618 the carrying costs are just killing me the house is empty
2661619 seventy five percent of the sales in salt lake county are below 300 000 anything above that you have to make sure youre priced very competitively to get it sold
2661620 were hearing of homes that were priced at 600 000 to 700 000 are selling for 400 000 to 500 000
2661621 this is one of the best times to buy a house interest rates are still low and there are a lot of price reductions
2661622 its a sad market and i think weve got at least two years of this before it gets better
2661623 we have seen steady and material deceleration in googs organic revenue growth
2661624 everyone has asked me what they can do to help right now this second as you read this i would like to ask you to make a pledge to yourself out loud
2661625 talk to your teenage drivers about this your neighbors friends and family whoever will listen have them take the pledge as well
2661626 a new apollo project needed to solve the energy crisis
2661627 from 2001 to 2007 when the republican party controlled congress and the white house
2661628 declaring all this country needs is a second dance with costly oil shale
2661629 we dont have to this is an off leash park
2661630 the message you send to people when you book and release them is that the criminal justice system is completely ineffective and that they can act without any risk of consequence
2661631 we are simply overwhelmed with gratitude at the outpouring of sympathy and well wishes from all over the world
2661632 a steady hand a calm hand at the wheel at all times
2661633 to me that is a strong indication of her love
2661634 i cant imagine coming to work and him not being here
2661635 i cant imagine what it must be like for barbara and her daughters were just praying
2661636 i can only offer the deepest shock and sorrow we all feel here because the bachman family was always so close to our program
2661637 basically even though she went to ucla todd and barbara would often come to matches at the u because of the friendship we made earlier
2661638 im sitting in the volleyball programs office at the sports pavilion
2661639 and on the door is a plaque from todd and barbara they refurbished this room so it hits home in a major way here for the volleyball program it hasnt set in yet im still in a state of shock
2661640 todd was a guiding force for not only bachmans but the entire floral industry our thoughts and prayers are with the bachman family including their extended employee family during this difficult time
2661641 a total random act of violence that makes absolutely no sense
2661642 help so i dont feel guilty about it if things go wrong
2661643 where can i get some next big thing for myself
2661644 a house is built with boards and beams a home is built with love and dreams
2661645 thats when genius struck for klein a mother of three who lives in california she was tired of digging around for old check stubs and stray gum wrappers every time she wanted to give another mother her phone number suddenly she knew what she needed she needed business cards klein who designed her own cards and now sells them online isnt the only mom to have this revelation business cards for moms also called mommy cards and mommy calling cards
2661646 michalk says it was such a great idea she copied it and since then at least two of her friends have borrowed the idea and started handing out cards of their own
2661647 i wanted them to look like a moms she says

2661651 if you travel the ancient trails even today theres a good chance youll meet him
2661652 theres nothing out there in the forest any educated person today knows this
2661653 today the senate stood up to washington special interests by voting to reverse the fccs disappointing media consolidation rules that i have fought against
2661654 our nations media market must reflect the diverse voices of our population and it is essential that the fcc promotes the public interest and diversity in ownership
2661655 in recent years we have seen an increase in coarse and violent programming coupled with a decrease in local news and hard hitting journalism
2661656 to say these trends are not in the best interest of the american people and especially our youngest citizens is clearly an understatement
2661657 take vat away and you and i abdicate our responsibility as leaders and pull the rug from under our present and future progress which may be compromised by the global crisis
2661658 we ended 2007 with the strongest economic growth in a generation inflation was low the peso strong and a million new jobs were created
2661659 leadership is not about doing the first easy thing that comes to mind it is about doing what is necessary however hard
2661660 one more thing ellandbackagain60 dont be so sure currently warrington and saints are the best sides in the league so why not who else is going to stop them both
2661661 faith was full of hope and full of the possibilities for the future
2661662 for some it will come sooner for others it will take time
2661663 it was there as a silent witness to the battle to the aftermath to the burials to the dedication of the cemetery
2661664 its a shame when you lose the last living entities on this battlefield
2661665 i have no doubt that union soldiers sat under it for all three days of the battle
2661666 if it was high enough at the time it would have been able to see the battle of culps hill
2661667 would have been able to see the union guns there on the crest of cemetery hill firing at picketts men
2661668 and looking to the south it could have seen the entire union line stretching from cemetery hill to the round tops
2661669 the top of it is totally broken off and the storm severely damaged 70 to 80 percent of the tree
2661670 that means theres not a whole lot left of it but it didnt kill the tree
2661671 its highly doubtful that a tree like that can survive
2661672 anywhere but there how pathetic would that be going to my parents paper
2661673 you neednt be in a hurry its all done they shot the poor devils and finished them off
2661674 it cant possibly be they have murdered the prisoners in cold blood
2661675 oh yes theyre all dead sure enough and a good job too

2661695 strongly states its commitment to the sovereignty and the territorial integrity of georgia and its internationally recognised borders and urges russia to respect them
2661696 underscores that the military actions against georgia could affect eu russian relations
2661697 we have urged an immediate halt to the violence and a stand down by all troops
2661698 from a legal point of view our actions are absolutely well founded and legitimate and moreover necessary
2661699 in my opinion they are already elements of some kind of genocide of the ossetian people

2661705 you go out there and run as hard as you can to see what youve got
2661706 whether we win or whether we run out of gas just doesnt matter at this point weve got to win
2661707 its important especially for the first two or three races of the chase when everybody is so worried about the points and where youre at
2661708 it really buys you some sleep and peace of mind at the start of the chase
2661709 weve got to get at least two weeks in a row to get good finishes to solidify our place its not like were getting caught up in wrecks its just dumb stuff that we get caught up in were inconsistent right now we run top 10 and then run in the 40s

2661717 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2661718 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2661719 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2661720 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2661721 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2661722 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2661723 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2661724 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2661751 the trouble is not that the ussr broke up that was inevitable the real trouble and a tangle for a long time to come is that the breakup occurred mechanically along false leninist borders usurping from us entire russian provinces in several days we lost 25 million ethnic russians 18 percent of our entire nation and the government could not scrape up the courage even to take note of this dreadful event a colossal historic defeat for russia and to declare its political disagreement with it

2661755 they have to concentrate on competition but its very tough
2661756 we know it is the olympic games and all of us sportsmen want everything to be normal
2661757 here in a sporting context and theyve confirmed their participation very much in the light of respect friendship athlete to athlete we have no reason to have any concerns on that
2661758 when the war is in your country at such a time it is very difficult for them for all of us
2661759 we are trying to say hey lets have a truce for at least the olympic games so we bring some peace to the world even for two weeks the timing couldnt be worse war is not great at any time but to have it on the first day of the olympic competition was pretty bad timing

2661763 i have two associate degrees a bachelors degree and an illegal masters degree do you love it
2661764 degrees issued by canyon college have the same validity as degrees issued by les schwab tires or a neighborhood grocery zero
2661765 their credits will not transfer into any state supported college inside idaho
2661766 idaho does not consider canyon college credits or diplomas valid
2661767 takes great pride in offering educational opportunities that would not otherwise be available to a number of individuals at an affordable price
2661768 if you operated from or purported to operate from a location in idaho you are an idaho school
2661769 seven sorry sisters the states with the worst regulation of private colleges
2661770 taxpayers are putting out taxpayer money and not getting the quality of education expected of an accredited agency
2661771 idaho needs to step up to the plate they are allowing them to do this i would hope officials in idaho could see that and help us out
2661772 one of the institutions many violations included conferring honorary doctorates on individuals based on life and work experience a one time application fee and a monetary contribution to the institution
2661773 we are disappointed that canyon college continues to take money from oregon residents
2661774 t his kind of crude plunder really needs to stop
2661775 with criminal prosecution if she listed having a degree from canyon college on her resume
2661776 the laws of washington nevada north dakota south dakota illinois texas maine new jersey and virginia disallow the use of degrees from canyon college
2661777 for canyon simply to cease offering its products to oregon residents would serve little purpose unless it also agreed to cease offering them to residents of the other states
2661778 this house is supposed to be a place where people come and enjoy it but its a home its family what better way to symbolize the governors mansion as home and family than to have a wedding

2661780 idahos lack of drug treatment is the real problem he asked for treatment

2661788 i love you gavin i really do but no i think its just kind of proof of pudding look we did it and simple
2661789 i think this really proves the grassroots model can work that was something the world hadnt really seen before and our technology made it possible so what were hoping is that this will convince more people they can take matters into their own hands and just deploy a network in their community

2661838 this was a sensational scandal that the los angeles times and other mainstream papers passionately did not want to uncover when edwards was a formal candidate and now that the enquirer seems to have done the job for them it looks like they want everyone to shut up while they fail to uncover it again
2661839 ill just pound out a few paragraphs and see what happens

2661843 the dog has 6 nipples why because usually dogs give birth to usually 6 dogs and it needs to breastfeed all the children lets look at sheep how many nipples does the sheep have they have only one sheeps usually give birth to one sheep right how many of you eat dogs if you live in china you might be but how many of us eat sheep almost all of us for example we in bahrain slaughter around 5000 sheeps a day so imagine how many sheeps does saudi arabia slaughter especially with saudis being more voracious and they always eat kabsa 3 times a day so they slaughter sheep 10 times more than us the question that arises is how come there is more sheep in the world more than dogs ha the answer is simple god blessed sheeps he didnt bless dogs same for banking god likes and blessed islamic banking he didnt bless conventional banking
2661844 tang has no criminal record his neighbors said they hadnt seen any abnormal behavior from him before left hangzhou
2661845 this appears to be an isolated act with no connection to the olympics we have no reason to believe that the assailant targeted the victims as american citizens
2661846 rich foreign stranger who has a bodyguard to keep people like me away
2661847 to live is to pray an introduction to carmelite spirituality

2661850 we started investigation on this case immediately and will handle it seriously in accordance with the law we will keep contact with the u s side and inform you of the new developments
2661851 this is already the fourth visit you pay to our country which has made you the u s president paying the most visits to china in the presidential terms
2661852 this has fully demonstrated the great importance mr president has attached to the development of sino u s relations
2661853 in certain areas of north cotabato with a specific group of milf all peaceful means have been exhausted to resolve the conflicts and we are now compelled to resort to the application of justifiable force
2661854 china is a main contributor to the increase of the bosch business in asia we attach a special importance to the recruiting training and retaining of skilled associates
2661855 we see great growth potential in asia for all our business sectors especially as it relates to green technologies to conserve resources and protect the environment
2661856 china is a main contributor to the increase of the bosch business in asia we attach a special importance to the recruiting training and retaining of skilled associates
2661857 we see great growth potential in asia for all our business sectors especially as it relates to green technologies to conserve resources and protect the environment
2661858 clearly there was anxiety about what sort of model we should have to move towards a republic so i think the community debate will continue there will be a day in this nation im absolutely confident when we will be a republic
2661859 but labor is taking this in a measured way we understand that ultimately this is a matter that the community needs to settle a view on
2661860 they had absolute possession of the sticks which i think must have impressed everybody there and around the world
2661861 three billion people must have seen the effort that they made and the discipline that they showed
2661862 the gift of prophecy one of the gifts of the holy spirit is prophecy
2661863 ellen g white 1827 1915 was the author of 55 volumes translated internationally into 100 languages with close to 20 000 000 copies in circulation she is considered to have been inspired by god many of her prophecies about world events and the modern day condition of man have already been dramatically fulfilled her insights into the fields of medicine and nutrition are being progressively substantiated by scientific research her words have lifted mankind and have helped bring the truths of christianity to uncounted millions the world over
2661864 at this time 20th century the special endowment of the divine grace and power is not less needful to the church than in the apostolic day through the illumination of the holy spirit the scenes of the long continued conflict between good and evil have been opened to the writer of these pages from time to time i have been permitted to behold the working in different ages of the great controversy between christ and satan
2661865 as the spirit of god has opened my mind the great truths of his word and the scenes of the past and the future i have been bidden to make known to others that which has thus been revealed
2661866 although i am as dependent upon the spirit of the lord in writing my views as i am in receiving them yet the words i employ in describing what i have seen are my own
2661867 in ancient times god spoke to men by the mouth of prophets and apostles in these days he speaks to them by the testimonies of his spirit
2661868 if you lessen the confidence of gods people in the testimonies he has sent them you are rebelling against god as certainly as were korah dathan and abiram
2661869 when i went to colorado i was so burdened for you that in my weakness i wrote many pages to be read at your camp meeting weak and trembling i arose at three oclock in the morning to write you god was speaking through clay you might say that this communication was only a letter yes it was a letter but prompted by the spirit of god to bring before your minds things that had been shown me in these letters which i write in the testimonies i bear i am presenting to you that which the lord has presented to me i do not write one article in the paper expressing merely my own ideas they are what god has opened before me in vision the precious rays of light shining from the throne
2661870 what voice will you acknowledge as the voice of god what power has the lord in reserve to correct your errors and show you your course as it is if you refuse to believe until every shadow of uncertainty and every possibility of doubt is removed you will never believe the doubt that demands perfect knowledge will never yield to faith faith rests upon evidence not demonstration the lord requires us to obey the voice of duty when there are other voices all around us urging us to pursue an opposite course it requires earnest attention from us to distinguish the voice which speaks from god
2661871 elder bates was resting upon saturday the seventh day of the week and he urged it upon our attention as the true sabbath
2661872 in the ark was the golden pot of manna aarons rod that budded and the tables of stone which folded together like a book jesus opened them and i saw the ten commandments written on them with the finger of god on one table were four and on the other six the four on the first table shone brighter than the other six but the fourth the sabbath commandment shone above them all for the sabbath was set apart to be kept in honor of gods holy name the holy sabbath looked gloriousa halo of glory was all around it i saw that the sabbath commandment was not nailed to the cross if it was the other nine commandments were and we are at liberty to break them all as well as to break the fourth i saw that god had not changed the sabbath for he never changes but the pope had changed it from the seventh day to the first day of the week for he was to change times and laws
2661873 the pope has changed the day of rest from the seventy to the first day
2661874 and yet my dear friends she did one of the greatest works that i have ever known since john the revelator
2661875 the bible and the writings of ellen white are inerrant
2661876 as samuel was a prophet of israel for his day as jeremiah was a prophet of israel in the days of captivity as john the baptist came as a special messenger of the lord to prepare the way for christs coming so we believe that mrs white was a prophet to the church of christ today
2661877 i do not believe that here is a difference between the degree and quality dimension of the inspiration of any biblical writer and ellen white i believe that the desire of ages for example is just as high in quality or degree of inspiration as the gospel according to luke what is the best way to keep it all in perspective and end up with ellen white being for this church what luke was for his generation and not one whit less in contribution and authority
2661878 her authority transcends that of all non inspired interpreter of the scriptures
2661879 second i began to realize how creative ellen white had been in interpreting the old testament
2661880 id like to take this position that if you do not believe in the gift of prophecy based on what the bible has to say on it that you dont believe in the bible the primary purpose of the gift of prophecy in relationship to scripture is to confirm scripture truth we took the position last time that the gift of prophecy has equal authority with the bible and equal inspiration with the bible
2661881 the bible speaks to all the world the writings of ellen white were addressed primarily to the remnant church herein lies the only significant difference between them the person who listens to both with an open mind will hear the same voice speaking through both with equal authority
2661882 the quality of inspiration of ellen white is equal to that of the bible writers
2661883 ellen g white was inspired in the same sense as were the bible prophets
2661884 she was inspired by god as were the biblical writers
2661885 insofar as ellen whites role in the church is concerned whether pastoral or canonical i think we must here give pause and rethink the acceptance with ease of ford
2661886 no excuses are made for her contributions i speak these words after nearly forty years of denominational service her writings help us understand the bible
2661887 the writings of ellen white are inspired in the same sense as the bible is inspired
2661888 thank you for your letter of february 6 in which you made reference to elder walter reas meeting in glendale california
2661889 our position on the testimonies mrs whites writings is like the keystone to the arch take that out and there is no logical stopping place till all the special truths of the message are gone nothing is surer than this that this message and the visions of mrs white belong together
2661890 be received the same as were the messages of the prophets of old as samuel was a prophet to israel in his day as jeremiah was a prophet to israel in the days of captivity as john the baptist came as a special messenger of the lord to prepare the way for christs appearing so we believe that mrs white was a prophet to the church of christ today and the same as the messages of the prophets were received in old days so her message should be received at present times
2661891 seventh day adventists hold that ellen g white performed the work of a true prophet during the seventy years of her public ministry as samuel was a prophet as jeremiah was a prophet as john the baptist so we believe that mrs white was a prophet to the church of christ today
2661892 in these letters which i write in the testimonies i bear i am presenting to you that which the lord has presented to me i do not write one article in the paper expressing merely my own views they are what god had opened to me in vision the precious ray of light shining from the throne
2661893 god was speaking through clay in these letters which i write in the testimonies i bear i am presenting to you that which the lord has presented to me i do not write one article in the paper expressing merely my own ideas they are what god has opened before me in vision the precious rays of light shining from the throne
2661894 we believe she has been empowered by divine illumination to speak of past events which have been brought to her attention with a greater minuteness than is set forth in any existing records and to read the future with more than human foresight
2661895 the visions of mrs e g white are the revelations of god
2661896 when i send you a testimony of warning and reproof many of you declare it to be merely the opinion of sister white you have thereby insulted the spirit of god
2661897 those who are reproved by the spirit of god should not rise up against the humble instrument it is god and not an erring mortal who has spoken to save them from ruin
2661898 a week after her first happy vision ellen received a second vision in which god called her formally to work for him as a prophet
2661899 in ancient times god spoke to men by mouth of prophets and apostles in these days he speaks to them by the testimonies of his spirit the lord has seen fit to give me a view of the needs and errors of his people
2661900 god was speaking through clay in these letters which i write in the testimonies i bear i am presenting to you that which the lord has presented to me i do not write one article in the paper expressing merely my own ideas they are what god has opened before me in vision the precious rays of light shining from the throne
2661901 when i send you a testimony of warning and reproof many of you declare it to be merely the opinion of sister white you have thereby insulted the spirit of god
2661902 those who are reproved by the spirit of god should not rise up against the humble instrument it is god and not an erring mortal who has spoken to save them from ruin
2661903 seventhday adventists hold that ellen g white performed the work of a true prophet during the seventy years of her public ministry as samuel was a prophet as jeremiah was a prophet as john the baptist so we believe that mrs white was a prophet to the church of christ today
2661904 a week after her first happy vision ellen received a second vision in which god called her formally to work for him as a prophet
2661905 i have seen that the 1843 chart wm millers was directed by the hand of the lord and that it should not be altered that the figures were as he wanted them
2661906 it was just as impossible for them those that gave up their faith in the 1844 movement to get on the path again and go to the city as all the wicked world which god had rejected they fell all the way along the path one after another
2661907 until we heard the voice of god like many waters which gave us the day and hour of jesus coming the living saints 144 000 in number knew and understood the voice while the wicked thought it was thunder and an earthquake when god spake the time he poured on us the holy ghost and our faces began to light up and shine with the glory of god as moses did when he came down from mount sinai
2661908 i have not the slightest knowledge as to the time spoken by the voice of god i heard the hour proclaimed but had no remembrance of that hour after i came out of vision
2661909 in our frequent change of location in the earlier history of the publishing work and i have crossed the plains no less than 17 times i lost all trace of the first published works
2661910 and here i pause to state that any of our people having in their possession a copy of any or all of my first views as published prior to 1851 will do me a great favor if they will send them to me without delay
2661911 it is well known that many were expecting the lord to come at the 7th month 1845 that christ would then come we firmly believed a few days before the time passed i was at fairhaven and dartsmouth mass with a message on this point of time at this time ellen was with the band at carver mass where she saw in vision that we should be disappointed
2661912 now time is almost finished 1851 and what we have been 6 years in learning they will have to learn in months
2661913 for a time after the disappointment in 1844 i did hold in common with the advent body that the door of mercy was then forever closed to the world i was shown in vision and i still believe that there was a shut door in 1844
2661914 thus the work was hindered and the world was left in darkness had the whole adventist body united upon the commandments of god and the faith of jesus how widely different would have been our history
2661915 in one of her visions her accompanying angels told her that the time of salvation for all sinners ended in 1844 she now claims the door of mercy is still open in another vision she discovered that women should wear short dresses with pants and she and her sister followers dressed this way for eight years but the ridiculous custom has now been abandoned
2661916 handed me a green cord coiled up closely this he directed me to place next to my heart and when i wished to see jesus take from my bosom and stretch it to the utmost he cautioned me not to let it remain coiled for any length of time lest it should become knotted and difficult to straighten
2661917 thousands have been induced to enlist with the understanding that this war to exterminate slavery but now that they are fixed they find that they have been deceived that the object of this war is not to abolish slavery but to preserve it
2661918 this nation will yet be humbled into the dust england is studying whether it is best to take advantage of the present weak condition of our nation and venture to make war on her when england does declare war all nations will have one interest of their own to serve and there will be general war general confusion
2661919 eggs should not be placed upon your table they are an injury to your children
2661920 we bare positive testimony against tobacco rich cakes spirituous liquors snuff tea coffee flesh meats butter spice mince pies
2661921 children are allowed to eat flesh meats spices butter cheese pork rich pastry these things do their work of deranging the stomach
2661922 in the latter times some shall depart from the faith commanding to abstain from meats which god had created to be received
2661923 soon we heard the voice of god like many waters which gave us the day and hour of jesus coming when god spoke the time he poured upon us the holy spirit
2661924 but of that day and hour knoweth no man no not the angels in heaven but my father only
2661925 the 1843 chart was directed by the hand of the lord and that it should not be altered that the figures were as he wanted them that his hand was over and hid a mistake in some of the figures so that none could see it until his hand was removed
2661926 said the angel deny self ye must step fast some of us have had the time to get the truth and to advance step by step but now time is almost finished and what we have been years learning they will have to learn in a few months
2661927 some are looking too far off for the coming of the lord time has continued a few years longer than they expected therefore they think it may continue a few years more and in this way their minds have been led from present truth i saw the time for jesus to be in the most holy place was nearly finished and that time can last but very little longer the sealing time is very short and will soon be over
2661928 in 1844 attended by heavenly angels our great high priest entered the holy of holies and there appears in the presence of god to engage in the last acts of his ministration in behalf of man to perform the work of investigative judgment and to make atonement for all who are shown to be entitled to its benefits
2661929 christ put away sin once by the sacrifice of himself
2661930 christ was once offered to bear the sins of many
2661931 by the which will we are sanctified through the offering of the body of jesus christ once for all
2661932 for by one offering he hath perfected forever them that are sanctified
2661933 at the close of the 2300 days in 1844 began the work of investigation and the blotting out of sins
2661934 it is those who by faith follow jesus in the great work of atonement who receive the benefits of his mediation in their behalf while those who reject the light as given by egw which brings to view this work of ministration are not benefited thereby
2661935 the seal of god is revealed in the observance of the seventh day sabbath
2661936 they who labor with their hands must nourish their strength to perform this labor and those also who labor in the word and doctrine must nourish their strength they should eat of nourishing and strengthening food to build up their strength i saw that your an sda brother views concerning swines flesh would prove no injury to you if you have them to yourself but in your judgment and opinion you have made this question a test if god requires his people to abstain from swines flesh he will convict them on the matter if it is the duty of the church to abstain from swines flesh god will discover it to more than two or three
2661937 thus the work was hindered and the world was left in darkness had the whole adventist body united upon the commandments of god and the faith of jesus how widely different would have been our history
2661938 it the bronze medal was a small victory for my country but my true hope is that in the sports family we could all be friends
2661939 its a tough race the whole way through thats a pretty emotional race
2661940 although the weather was not good today it certainly was a truly nice day for me
2661941 i turned around and thought i saw 31 seconds and i thought wow that hurt a lot more than the 31 seconds i did at trials
2661942 it hasnt sunk in yet i thought no one would go under four minutes and 30
2661943 whenever i thought of china two pictures would slip into my mind the great wall and clusters of factories
2661944 what i have seen tonight has totally smashed my fixed ideas and concepts about china
2661945 china is a great nation that is culturally and economically rich
2661946 the opening ceremony has helped erase that big question mark that has puzzled me for many years
2661947 the big screen seized my attention instantly after i casually cast a side look at the big screen
2661948 i bet that this opening ceremony that carries a very strong message of peace and friendship will help those who do not understand china well recast their concept of the country
2661949 the opening ceremony is the best and also the most appropriate advertisement for china
2661950 i am very disappointed he all luck his horses name got very tense and angry i think he is just having a bad day unfortunately
2661951 its possible they intended to use the beijing games as a platform to amplify the effects of their secessionist activities
2661952 i dont think these will have any impact on the beijing olympics but of course well further tighten security in the region
2661953 in 1980 when the boycotts were all on for the moscow olympics i was in favor of that
2661954 and with hindsight a lot of hindsight the only people who suffer are the athletes
2661955 theres a lot of new wineries we havent heard of
2661956 instead of driving to place to place they come to us
2661957 some people come because of the name of the winery some come for the grape of the wines and some come for the label because it has a coyote on it
2661958 you come up to the ramp to go to terrace heights at the yield sign and try to look under the bridges to see if traffic is coming
2661959 some people arent coming to a stop there are a lot of people who have had accidents there
2661960 the reality is the increase of traffic with development in terrace heights our business and wal mart the frequency of incidents has increased it is really a public safety question
2661961 i have never made but one prayer to god a very short one o lord make my enemies ridiculous and god granted it

2661974 sie war mit jemandem zusammen der sie nicht gut behandelt hat
2661975 the fact that deputy tollison took his closed fist and struck the suspect in the face 13 times in my opinion was excessive
2661976 then they have the audacity to treat this man as if hes a piece of meat and taser him with electrical jolts to his body and then thats not enough
2661977 the open web rules and the proprietary web is evil
2661978 its not a steppingstone its the job ive always wanted its really neat to be involved in the formative years of a historic court body
2661979 the first touchdown felt good because the first team was in there against their first team
2661980 it was crazy my first block out there was zach thomas
2661981 once you do that nothing really worries you anymore once you get out there its football
2661982 we didnt turn it over or have any penalties in the first half thats a good sign that youre not making any silly mistakes in the first preseason game
2661983 ive been definitely able to see progress at training camp and we were able to carry it over from practice to the game
2661984 hopefully by the last preseason game ill be ready and focused to go my timing is messed up right now but ill be alright man
2661985 we didnt play our first group very long offensively and defensively
2661986 that was on purpose one they looked sharp when they were in there two we needed to look at the rest of the guys
2661987 in buddhism there is a saying in life there will always be pain suffering is optional he went on to say that the things that cause us the most pain are the things that we cling to the hardest this got me thinking

2661996 if we mess up well fix it but only if you paid us money to cover our mistakes
2661997 henne made some nice plays out there one down in the red area kind of a fringe area threw the ball away these are some of the situations we work on in practice that doesnt sound like a big play but it is a pretty big play for a young guy to make he put that shoulder throw out there in one of our run pass checks and i thought his location was pretty good and he did some nice things there as well
2661998 obviously some mistakes it was a good learning experience getting my feet wet out on the field and making some plays i think some of those third downs a lot of good passes down the field i made some of those throws i missed a receiver on a go route and missed some other receivers there are different things out there that i can correct overall i thought i did all right
2661999 i thought it would be great if i just touched the ball and had a touchdown the first carry just broke out a long run
2662000 but it felt pretty good obviously going in and being able to participate in camp has been real big for me to kind of get some licks and i think everybody saw channing crowder knock me down last week so i think that was big just being able to go through camp and just kind of ease my mind about coming back and getting adjusted to everything has been really good
2662001 im not worried about that its just getting used to game speed because its a different tempo
2662002 you can only simulate so much in practice when you get into a game its different
2662003 i thought early on i felt our first group in there id seen them make some plays i felt rookie de philip merling really did some decent things in there as did nose tackle jason ferguson i was pleased with what happened there we got into a situation later on where we were on the field way too long i think they had the ball for a 17 play drive at one point they might have been 11 19 or something on third down 11 20 which is not good enough i think time of possession was 25 or 35 minutes 36 11 not good enough were not going to win a lot of games that way put nine penalties into that mix and weve got a lot of work to do
2662004 i just had to get those first game jitters out of my system really only like the first play and after that i was pretty much good
2662005 overall i was happy about the way i performed out there i know i can definitely perform a lot better than what i displayed but like i said before is a stepping stone for me and today was my first icebreaker
2662006 it helped a lot working with the first unit all week because when we were out there communicating with each other it was just like practice wed make certain line calls and sometimes we wouldnt even have to say anything i could just peak over at the guy and wed know what were doing just having those 10 days you jell together so much in a short period of time
2662007 i felt pretty good the whole game as far as the speed and all those things because i think our offense did a great job in practice preparing us for the speed of the game
2662008 i think i did well but i also think there are some things i need to work on im going to go back and look at the film and just try to come out and get better next week
2662009 for it to be my first game it was definitely something i was looking forward to just getting out there being out there with the boys again and getting familiar with playing in the nfl now im just thankful for the opportunity and im just looking forward to making more plays in the future

2662016 apple iphone 3g when you are outside and next to a cell tower but even then dont expect full 3g
2662017 why do you think a new sim card will solve this problem
2662018 we understand that some users are reporting 3g reception issues and we are looking into this
2662019 yeah i have an idea of what the problem is
2662020 thats the problem it wont work with the old sim card
2662021 wow this isnt even a 3g sim card this phone will be working perfectly for you
2662022 iphone 3g reception problems youre not alone continued part 3
2662023 they have to concentrate on competition but its very tough
2662024 we know it is the olympic games and all of us sportsmen want everything to be normal
2662025 here in a sporting context and theyve confirmed their participation very much in the light of respect friendship athlete to athlete we have no reason to have any concerns on that
2662026 when the war is in your country at such a time it is very difficult for them for all of us
2662027 we are trying to say hey lets have a truce for at least the so we bring some peace to the world even for two weeks the timing couldnt be worse war is not great at any time but to have it on the first day of the olympic competition was pretty bad timing
2662028 i see all the nations get together i am very upset about it i wish everybody would be at peace especially during the olympics
2662029 we heard a plane go over and then a big explosion
2662030 whatever side is used to bomb civilians and the positions of peacekeepers this side is not safe and they should know this

2662032 complete genocide putin also said georgia had effectively lost the right to rule the breakaway province an indication
2662033 i really wasnt thinking he was going to play he wanted to go tonight and he had had a good week of practice he went in and caught the ball well he took a couple of hits and he did what he wanted to do and that was good to see
2662034 he caught a couple of balls he looked like he was in a groove he looked like he could do pretty much whatever he wanted on whoever was out there covering him it was good to see hopefully we can get some more playing time next week go at guys and do more things
2662035 it really is pretty much for him being on a normal schedule
2662036 this is like the no 1 preseason game he got his 15 plays and did what he was supposed to do i think he was happy and we all came out of it feeling good
2662037 its big its just fun to see him out there its fun to play with him its just good to see him get his confidence back and get the flow back for him i think this was a big game for him
2662038 i think he found it very helpful to start getting that rust chipped off and get back out there its been a while for him
2662039 any time the lights are on you want to make a good impression
2662040 it was one of those nights where you got an opportunity to make some plays and the balls were right there fortunately i made them
2662041 the opportunities he had he took advantage of them he played awesome and made some big time plays out there against some good defenders its definitely a confidence builder for him
2662042 jared put the balls right there all i had to do was catch them
2662043 it was a good night in that respect as a rookie you cant ask for anything more than to get a chance to make some touchdown catches i just try to get in there and do my job its a one day at a time type of thing this happened to be a day where i got a chance to get out and make some plays
2662044 he put the balls right there tonight jared was right on the money with both of them all i had to do was catch them he played a great game
2662045 theres a lot of stuff i still need to get better on it starts up front i had all the time in the world to do whatever i wanted and my receivers outside were working well and making plays for me it makes the game a lot easier when that comes along
2662046 i thought our second group did a good job of bringing us back and making things close and getting some things done
2662047 our first group on either side of the ball wasnt really sharp and that was disappointing wanted to play better than we did last week and i didnt think we did that
2662048 the third drive went well we put some points on the board the first couple of drives it was tough well have to watch the film and see what happened
2662049 it was the same game plan as last week we were hoping it would be just like last week one drive knock it out do well and go home it didnt happen that way this week we had some things out there but we didnt capitalize and we have to see why
2662050 i wish we could have found a way to finish it off
2662051 it is the preseason but you have to keep working to get better
2662052 they had a lot of good players on their defense it was just a rough start all you can do is watch the film and see how you can improve and what you can do better
2662053 we still had some good individual performances especially with our young offensive guys so well get a chance to get on a normal week next week
2662054 thats the bad thing about it we had plenty of opportunities to go out there and win the game and we didnt we have to figure out how to close it
2662055 it was a shock that all of a sudden hes a raging alcoholic

2662069 i am absolutely thrilled and overwhelmed with the amazing response from the public and the critics for the railway children
2662070 it has been a wonderful experience teaming up with the national railway museum and for me its been wonderful seeing generations of families coming together for what is a truly magical experience
2662071 we have had people from all over the country coming to see this wonderful production and there are still plenty of tickets left for what many people are saying is the event of the summer dont miss out on a once in a lifetime opportunity
2662072 stirling single the real locomotive starring in the railway children is undoubtedly the largest leading lady ever to take to the stage and its great to see this new adaptation of the classic childrens story breathe life into items from the national collection
2662073 this has been such an exciting new venture for us and has hopefully opened the doors for more ventures of this kind
2662074 the nrm is a popular venue for a fabulous family day out and a trip to see york theatre royals amazing production is the perfect way to round off or begin a visit

2662077 i was pretty emotional after that race i was not comfortable in the first 200 meters
2662078 im emotional excited its a really good way to start
2662079 afterwards i looked up and saw president bush giving me a thumbs up and holding up the american flag that was pretty cool
2662080 i tried to find my mom but i couldnt find her its an exciting time
2662081 i told bob that this would be my last 400 im so ive got to go out there and get a good time and this was a good time
2662082 i wanted to get 4 03 to be honest i didnt feel so great i was in the ready room i didnt feel so good i got like these cold chills
2662083 i just remember coming into the wall it was kind of the same feeling as athens
2662084 as i was coming into the last 25 to 50 meters in athens i saw myself out there and smiled
2662085 i expected to be about 20 points behind the australians after the dressage the difference is 19 with the germans and americans currently second and third in the mix now the pressure is on them its for them to lose and us to win
2662086 i did not know her i dont think any of the team did but of course our sympathy goes out to her family
2662087 has settled in really well here i think he must like the heat
2662088 i hope so because he goes across country late normally i like to go early and get it over but here im happy as ill be able to see how it the course is riding
2662089 now that we have walked the course three times it seems more manageable but youll need to be accurate and the time will be hard to get im looking forward to it it is what the sport is about
2662090 this is what i have dreamed about for 20 years
2662091 had never seen anything like it such an atmosphere hes never even done a four star event like badminton or burghley but hes been in three 3 stars and hes ready for the challenge
2662092 outside he was quite spooky and in the arena he was terrified of the camera but he usually accepts what i ask him to do
2662093 you have to do enough but dont want to over do it in this heat
2662094 so great walking the cross country course with william fox pitt and mary king is so helpful showing where we can shave a few seconds

2662096 no state has the right to intervene militarily in the territory of another state simply because there are individuals there with a passport issued by that state or who are nationals of the state
2662097 attempts to apply such a doctrine have plunged europe into war in the past and we have reason to remember how hitler used this very doctrine little more than half a century ago to undermine and attack substantial parts of central europe

2662116 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2662117 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2662118 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems

2662126 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2662127 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2662128 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2662129 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2662130 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2662132 in many cases we can perform repairs and upgrades while our customers wait for their unit at our service center
2662133 for example ipod battery installations psp screen repairs even macbook lcd screen repairs are all done while the customer waits in these 3 examples we generally can assess and perform the repairs in under 20 minutes and the customer does not have to leave their unit and wait for a technician to call we are bending over backward for our customers and if we can avoid them having to make another trip out to see us well get it done while they are here
2662134 we know that gas prices are high and we receive customers from hundreds of miles away theres no reason for us to not make our walk in traffic a high priority and dazzle them with fast efficient and professional service
2662135 in cases that take longer or need more diagnosis time well receive the customers unit and a technician will call the customer back within 24 hours additionally we have the ability to mail units back to the customers location if they choose

2662138 the court is suggesting that giving a presentation involving security to other security researchers is a violation of federal law this has a tremendous chilling effect on research we intend to fight it with everything weve got
2662139 we disagree with the ruling but we are not going to disobey it
2662140 we wanted to share our academic work with the security community if you want to fix a system you need to know what is wrong with it
2662141 if the discoverer discloses the vulnerability to a broader audience hackers and other malicious users may be able to exploit the vulnerability

2662148 i knew they would come out with a point to prove they hit us hard on day one and kevin played really well in his first test as captain
2662149 from what we have seen so far england look pretty handy but they have always been handy theyre a very good cricket team
2662150 but from a south african point of view we certainly dont want to lose any test matches
2662151 we would be really gutted to lose the last test match here
2662152 as long as we remember the things that have got us to this point we will be fine going forward and we will keep improving
2662153 the guys are going to be fighting to win this one because we still have the opportunity to do so
2662154 we feel we can defend 220 and if we can get that high there will be a lot of pressure on the england top five
2662155 i dont want to make excuses because it was a pretty ordinary performance
2662156 the thing that i kept reminding the guys about and what i have been reminding them in the second innings is we forgot all the things we have been doing well over the past 18 months
2662157 that comes down to relaxing slightly mentally we werent as tight or as decisive in our movements or as patient as weve been
2662158 mentally the guys werent in the same space as they were at the start of the series
2662159 he had a problem when he started but when i came in he was a guy we identified to bat at three for us
2662160 he was the one we went for in that role we needed to run with him and give him an opportunity
2662161 he has blossomed repaid the faith we showed in him and he will be a quality player going forward
2662162 i didnt think it would be that fast in the prelims
2662163 its going to shape up for a pretty good race tomorrow
2662164 i dont want to be the center of attention just yet
2662165 i dont want to be breaking world records on the first night its like were playing a card game right now and those guys are showing their hand im just showing them the back and thats where i want to be
2662166 but im sure tomorrow morning ill be a little on edge
2662167 it makes sense to have greater cooperation but i dont think were ready to have one global super regulator
2662168 i was in the ready room i didnt feel so good i got like these cold chills
2662169 afterwards i looked up and saw president bush giving me the thumbs up and holding up the american flag that was pretty cool
2662170 its probably going to be the most watched game in the history of the world
2662171 its going to send a lot of chills through my body just to be there and be part of it

2662205 today when more children are overweight compared with previous generations it can be harder for parents to objectively identify if their child is overweight
2662206 research shows that most parents of overweight or obese children think that their child is a healthy weight some research showed that only 10 of parents with overweight or obese children described their child as overweight
2662207 preliminary findings of the survey suggest that many people who would be defined clinically as obese find the use of the term obese highly offensive and would stop listening to further advice
2662208 to shrink from using the word obesity is really ducking an issue
2662209 it does not have to be used in a judgmental or insulting way if a child is obese then the parents should know that its obese we must make parents know that the lifestyle of the family needs to be modified

2662240 the bjp is once again playing the communal card at the grave cost of the nations unity and integrity this time the arena of action is the border state of jammu and kashmir where they are playing with fire only with an eye on the vote bank ahead of the assembly elections in that state earlier the bjp and its mentors in the sangh parivar had backed an outfit demanding separate statehood for jammu if kashmir is with us today it is because of the composite culture and geographical diversity it shares with the other two regions jammu and ladakh

2662292 i think they had thought they had taken care of it before but it didnt take
2662293 if youre interested in improving your service you take all the complaints
2662294 normally i dont like to make waves but this sort of thing has been happening far too often lately
2662295 i guess it time to log this as an official complaint so we can begin to track the frequency of any reoccurrences
2662296 it is rare that i ever encountered a situation serious enough to warrant filing an official complaint
2662297 in a quality assurance program that doesnt just mean you rely on complaints
2662298 the patterns of complaints are analyzed to see if they suggest any improvements to policy training equipment staffing etc

2662360 the attacks are occurring in regions of georgia far from the zone of conflict in south ossetia they mark a dangerous escalation in the crisis
2662361 this is about annihilation of a democracy on their borders
2662362 we on our own cannot fight with russia we want immediate cease fire immediate cessation of hostilities separation of russia and georgia and international mediation
2662363 a ceasefire would not be a solution the fighting is still going on the georgian forces are continuing to be on the south ossetian territory
2662364 the actions of the georgian powers in south ossetia are of course a crime first of all against their own people
2662365 the territorial integrity of georgia has suffered a fatal blow
2662366 we have urged an immediate halt to the violence and a stand down by all troops we call for an end to the russian bombings and a return by the parties to the status quo
2662367 our units are well equipped with anti tank rockets and they thwarted a russian tank attack

2662387 legislation would end the rights of employees to secret ballot elections
2662388 legal recognition of a union has traditionally been achieved through secret ballot elections just like how a person votes for a senator or congressman
2662389 the presence of secret ballots cant overcome the corrupt nature of nlrb elections

2662395 but frankly it is the management of the festival were concerned about not the people there
2662396 they are making illogical and penal decisions to snuff out our event to chase our event out of town
2662397 it has always been that way but that is not really a good answer
2662398 it is hard to defend that despite the other event being three to four times larger our event pays three to four times the law enforcement bill
2662399 we had to make a statement that this is a music festival not a drug festival

2662450 at the end of the day im going to focus on my music first

2662452 didnt seem to fit the world that i thought stephenie meyer created
2662453 you see the punch coming that doesnt mean its not gonna hurt when it hits
2662454 theres no way to make everybody happy when i do one thing that a lot of people want theres always the opposite reaction
2662455 but how can you possibly meet up with the expectations that this book had
2662456 it just got so built up there is no book in the world that could stand up to that so i knew it was going to happen but at the same time it hurts
2662457 if they really love the characters then i would hope that this would make sense to them because these are the true characters
2662458 this is the story the way it was always meant to be
2662459 it doesnt always work out that way sometimes you make a decision about what you want and you pay for it and you suffer for it and it doesnt work out those types of stories always leave me horribly depressed im not going to live in a world for a year at a time where thats going to be the ending if people wanted a really depressing tragic ending i gave them a lot of hints that it wasnt going to be that way they really shouldnt have been surprised
2662460 i should have known that people would feel that way
2662461 the name has been real to me for so long now that ive forgotten how unusual it would sound to everyone else
2662462 ive read a lot of books that i didnt like very much and that thought never occurred to me because i had read them i hadnt heard of doing that before thats not fun to hear
2662463 i hope that if they really do enjoy the other books theyll realize that this is kind of where it was supposed to go
2662464 only one of us could make it over the wall
2662465 when you make love to a woman you get revenge for all the things that defeated you in life
2662466 it is categorically untrue that lor al paris altered ms knowles features or skin tone in the campaign
2662467 there is no doubt that anyone seeing that ad will know that it is beyonc
2662468 knowing who im dating and what kind of cereal i eat aint gonna benefit anybody else that kind of thing is not important
2662469 people have different opinions on that type of thing i told you what mine is and i think for each person you do whats right for you for me part of the reason that i have anxiety is the fact that i feel like people are always staring at me so its important for me to make sure that i have my friends and vacation and what i do at home with my family and that type of thing stays private
2662470 said shama 22 a marine corps veteran who served in ramadi iraq and is now an intern at the jerusalem funds palestine center in washington d c hes working toward a degree in international relations with the dream of working in the u s state department office of middle eastern affairs
2662471 when it comes to the quran im sure it says youre not supposed to wage war against others of the same religion
2662472 in ramadi iraq we were fighting al qaeda and al qaeda every day in the news at the time they were blowing up a mosque killing muslims and women and children to me i wasnt fighting against muslims i was fighting against extremists who had taken the religion
2662473 there were times we were going in places where instead of it having to be an ugly situation where marines dont speak arabic telling them to move from room to room instead i could speak to them
2662474 by the end of the day we were sitting there sipping tea with the iraqis in the house everybody is relaxing talking
2662475 i can never complain about being arabic and being in the military
2662476 because of the way my leaders have treated me i have nothing to complain about if anything being arab and being muslim in the military right now benefits a unit so much if anything it helps your career
2662477 justice obviously was a huge record for us we took the ride the lightning and master of puppets concept as far as we could take it
2662478 there was no place else to go with the progressive nutty sideways side of metallica and im so proud of the fact that in some way that album is kind of the epitome of that progressive side of us up through the 80s
2662479 theres a certain kind of specific sound to that record peculiar sound whichever adverb you want to choose thats given it a kind of life of its own and a little bit of a vibe all its own there have been a lot of great musicians we admire whove come up and talked about what a great inspiration that album has been to them and to their sound its obviously awesome to be part of that that album also sent us on this whole other merry way because when we came back from touring on that record in 1989 we were like we have nothing more to offer on this side of metallica and that set us off on some other adventures when i think of the nine records weve put out its impossible for me to think of the music without thinking of the experience and when i think of the experience i have warm and fuzzy feelings but i also have questions obviously justice is well revered especially among a lot of our peers
2662480 that album songwriting wise it was just us really showing off and trying to show what we could do
2662481 weve jammed six riffs into one song lets make it eight lets go crazy with it i listen to some of that stuff and its pretty progressive sonically it has its shortcomings but that is the one where we were able to step forward from
2662482 we mixed that record while we were on the road
2662483 thats not an excuse for the way that it sounds but our ears were beat anywhere i go whenever i ask someone what their favorite record is someones bound to say justice its pretty great that across the line someone can jump into your history and feel comfortable
2662484 id have to go song by song i was just listening to 1997s reload and there are a couple of songs on there that i think are absolutely brilliant but as an album itself and as a time justice just isnt a good memory for me but those songs are good i have to try and erase the memory of that experience somehow and let the songs take me
2662485 its always the next one i think the forthcoming is great but theres always a better something the holy grail of guitar sounds i havent got there yet but i will on the next one ill write the ultimate song on the next one the hunger is always there to do it better
2662486 i dont have an excuse i just need a little help
2662487 due to various reasons it wasnt working out with us and him
2662488 we felt his heart was no longer in it after expressing his want to leave on numerous occasions this year which showed when he played live
2662489 we found pictures that we really loved on the computer and then we put them on the shirts and then we started designing them
2662490 it was all worth it because we got to see the jonas brothers
2662491 it was horrible when we went to the train station there was rats outside the park people were shoving each other there were a lot of fights
2662492 we wanted to get the best seats and we wanted to have fun camping out
2662493 well we go to hear their new songs too which was amazing the jonas brothers are worth camping out for any day
2662494 they really put everything they can into their music and they really love their fans so they deserve it
2662495 theyre great inspirations to kids theyre a very wholesome band and they put everything they can into it
2662496 mereka semua sudah seperti adik adikku jadi mohon jangan salah paham lagipula mereka semua cantik cantik aku tidak sebanding
2662497 tentu saja aku suka perempuan cantik pria mana yang tidak namun bagiku kecantikan yang terpenting adalah dari dalam hatinya
2662498 surprise n a it was bound to happen sooner or later
2662499 yeah i went green and 26s on the hybrid smoke so much green that i cant open up my eyelids

2662501 trouble i dont shy away from it i annihilate suckas in their driveway in church on sunday morning praying bout what happened friday
2662502 basically were naming everything girls like in a song so when you hear it youll understand exactly what im talking about if you dont know what girls like then im going to tell you in this song im going to let you know exactly what they like just give you a couple points its going to help you with the entire rest of your life thats what its going to help you with for sure
2662503 were in the works of doing a whole lot of very creative stuff
2662504 the whole album every song is a movie thats basically how it comes down i dont even have features on the album the first single is not even featuring chris brown and sean garrett its co starring chris brown and sean garrett thats what i have on this album its all stars basically its co starring people because its a movie every song is a movie creatively and conceptually i think people are definitely going to understand that this is something that was very creatively put together it took a minute but every song is very serious
2662505 in 2006 i made a serious error in judgment and conducted myself in a way that was disloyal to my family and to my core beliefs
2662506 i was and am ashamed of my conduct and choices and i had hoped that it would never become public with my family i took responsibility for my actions in 2006 and today i take full responsibility publicly i only know that the apparent father has said publicly that he is the father of the baby i also have not been engaged in any activity of any description that requested agreed to or supported payments of any kind to the woman or to the apparent father of the baby
2662507 pay me 100 and ill tell you how i got rich
2662508 that bloke from oasis said i couldnt play guitar somebody shoulda told him im a f in rock star

2662510 getting the crowd excited for the second sequel to one of the cornerstones of his lauded catalog of classics rumors of the album began this january when but jays reps denied that the song was new
2662511 i walk into the dressing room and kanyes like lets do a record lets do this im like cmon man but you know i couldnt tell him no its his show that was the idea he wanted to perform a new record
2662512 we spoke about doing an album it just was premature
2662513 saya justru setuju ini untuk penegakan kualitas hukum dan efek jera jadi bukan sekadar putusannya yang membuat orang tidak melakukan korupsi

2662517 i kind of put it together myself and i didnt expect it to grow this size but im really excited about it
2662518 outside of the film festivals and societies you dont really see people take the initiative to create their own screenings
2662519 its a lot of work wrangling the films finding people to sell tickets and everything else
2662520 its kind of a social networking site for film enthusiasts and filmmakers to come together
2662521 its kind of a continuation of this event whether or not therell be another event therell be this web site
2662522 we have comedies and dramas and we have a really short animation

2662527 three years ago i was just a guitar tech not even trying to be in a band i was happy surfing and just living now my life is just crazy making records and touring the world and getting to play shows like wacken i truly am grateful for that has befallen on me good and bad
2662528 im in spain right now playing a festival with overkill and cradle of filth and looking forward to killing this crowd tonight
2662529 its been great its a real nice place when were not working ashley and i will go to the gym and he and his girlfriend do all the housework so i dont have to do anything
2662530 ive found it challenging but in a good way ive loved doing different things like crying one day and then shouting the next
2662531 id like to stay in the show for as long as they want to keep me
2662532 but eventually i might want a change im just trying to learn as much as i can and ill see where the future takes me
2662533 a lot of people have been told they will no longer be working on river city and there are fears more will go we are talking about people who have worked long hours for years who are suddenly being sacked without so much as a thankyou its a kick in the teeth no one was prepared for this
2662534 i have been there since the beginning and they basically took me in and said we think you should go get other jobs a lot of the main people on the show have been lost
2662535 neither our wardrobe nor make up departments have been recruited as yet
2662536 when we resume filming there will be a mixture of individuals who have worked on river city before as well as some who havent
2662537 there were plenty of shockwaves when news started to break of the departures some of the cast were shocked to say the least but grew to accept their fate it shows that the new boss wants to take the show forward and isnt afraid of ruffling feathers along the way
2662538 ive had botox because i want to be the best i can be and look the nicest i can theres no right and wrong its a personal choice
2662539 it didnt make me happier though if you link cosmetic surgery into happiness or to be perfect youre never going to be happy its not about being perfect thats where people get it wrong
2662540 i want to go on a personal journey i dont pretend to be a politician or anybody with authority i want to ask questions as a member of the public
2662541 they want to know what is being done or what we can do
2662542 i want to visit charities that deal with these issues and go into gangs with the police to see what they are doing because im sure they are trying their best

2662549 my take is that competitors will die off because there is strong brand loyalty similar to the ebay idea everyone created an auction site while ebay was hot ie true religion premium denim jeans but who was leftover plus trlg is on top of their fashion trends and the margins are so good and the cashflow is so great that we are far far away from this stock being a short candidate short if you want here but it will be painful for awhile

2662552 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2662553 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2662554 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2662555 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2662556 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2662557 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2662558 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2662559 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2662560 i wrote about how we all watch out for each other and how we walk our dogs at night i never thought i would win

2662564 we feel pretty strongly that a lot of the seats are being rented by the democrats and theyll be giving them back
2662565 we have every reason to believe thats going to bode well for us this year
2662566 why arent the ds doing better in florida when theyre picking up seats nationally its reapportionment
2662567 a good candidate who speaks to the needs of the constituents can win
2662568 we have seen democrats in republican performing seats prevail a lot of it depends on the candidate and how hard they are willing to work
2662569 there are a lot of ifs anybody who can divine it is a lot smarter than me
2662570 we feel pretty strongly that a lot of the seats are being rented by the democrats and theyll be giving them back
2662571 we have every reason to believe thats going to bode well for us this year
2662572 why arent the ds doing better in florida when theyre picking up seats nationally its reapportionment
2662573 the true christian is a warrior making his way through the regiments of the invisible enemy to his heavenly homeland

2662575 it is of the new things that men tire of fashions and proposals and improvements and change it is the old things that startle and intoxicate it is the old things that are young
2662576 we all want progress but if youre on the wrong road progress means doing an about turn and walking back to the right road in that case the man who turns back soonest is the most progressive

2662581 so right now its not like we have a route that says that we go to this specific street the first tuesday of every month

2662592 we had already played 64 games and we try to share athletes at rocky mountain so i felt like it was my responsibility to step up and say your season is starting and turn down the regional bid it wasnt easy

2662602 the cases of unrestricted ownership concentration or of scarce content pluralism in the media are endangering cultural diversity and freedom of expression not only within national markets but also at european level we need therefore strong european commitment to overcome those challenges especially in view of the new technologies and services in the media sector

2662604 the media remains a powerful tool which should not be treated solely in economic terms
2662605 the blogosphere has so far been a haven of good intentions and relatively honest dealing however with blogs becoming commonplace less principled people will want to use them
2662606 we do not see bloggers as a threat they are in position however to considerably pollute cyberspace we already have too much spam misinformation and malicious intent in cyberspace
2662607 i think the public is still very trusting towards blogs it is still seen as sincere and it should remain sincere for that we need a quality mark a disclosure of who is really writing and why
2662608 weblogs and user generated content contribute in a lively and fresh way to a colourful and many sided media landscape they should not be restrained
2662609 bloggers cannot automatically be considered a threat but imagine pressure groups professional interests or any other groups using blogs to pass on their message blogs are powerful tools they can represent an advance form of lobbyism which in turn can be seen as a threat
2662610 any blogger representing or expressing more than their personal view should be affected by this report

2662649 it would seem that men and women need a common motivation namely a common adversary to organize and act together in the vacuum such as motivation seemed to have ceased to exist or have yet to be found the need for enemies seems to be a common historical factor bring the divided nation together to face an outside enemy either a real one or else one invented for the purpose democracy will be made to seem responsible for the lagging economy the scarcity and uncertainties the very concept of democracy could then be brought into question and allow for the seizure of power in searching for a new enemy to unite us we came up with the idea that pollution the threat of global warming water shortages famine and the like would fit the bill the real enemy of the elites and their minions then is humanity itself

2662663 the machinery moved no one is working and the parking lots have reopened people are shopping
2662664 it isnt one of those things where you drop a meter in the water and read a needle
2662665 those guys are legends thats huge company but ive missed so many games and ive been trying to find a groove i hadnt even thought about that
2662666 that would be a big lift to get him going he looks good hes had an incredible career with all the milestones hes reached along the way and he still wants a hit every time hes up
2662667 three home runs is never good no matter which way you put it
2662668 the first two were mistakes by me ive got to get the ball down i did not do my job and they did theirs
2662669 at the moment hes going to be out there and battle through it
2662670 you must be connected to the data service to view the windows live mobile terms
2662671 the georgians are euphoric because they have been equipped trained that they have gained military experience in iraq it feeds this revanchist mood how can south ossetia be demilitarized when all of georgia is bristling with weaponry and its only an hours ride by tank from tbilisi to tskhinvali
2662672 i walked up and asked him what he was doing
2662673 he said you and your muscleman dont scare me ill protect myself
2662674 that was what i was trying to do 50 years ago and the attorney general of texas stopped me
2662675 when he broke ground on jamaica beach he was only 30 years old a young man with a vision
2662676 it was something very unique when you look at the desolate barren island land then who could have envisioned all the communities on the west end and where they are at today he might have been a little ahead of his time
2662677 jamaica beach was my favorite project because i was so personally involved in it
2662678 the rich people had a second home but the middle class didnt
2662679 the first thing we had to do is convince people they needed a second home and then we had to convince them that jamaica beach is where they wanted to be
2662680 our brief driving impression revealed well controlled drive motions predictable handling and an excellent powertrain
2662681 this new luxury sedan is so good at emulating its competition that if the badges were removed it could be mistaken for a lexus gs460 im not saying this just because hyundai has taken lexuss generic and inoffensive styling to a new level this car has every 50 000 luxury car meme from a v8 engine that powers the rear wheels to soft leather on the dashboard and door panels to an excellent navigation and multimedia system throw in a pushbutton starter and the package is complete
2662682 i dont need a driveway ornament to impress my neighbors
2662683 i own a lexus and cant find a justification for the cost difference between the ls gs and the genesis that would make me pay more welcome home genesis
2662684 a company that promises you fame and fortune if you shell out big bucks for useless acting lessons and head shots
2662685 you have reached xyz company for dr soandso press one for dr gooberhead press two
2662686 earning money with us is just very easy and simple
2662687 we knew we had to bat well in the second innings and we are even stevens now if we can string another or two partnerships together it could be quite a good test match
2662688 the thing about him is that he scores so quickly weve always rated him highly he had a problem when he started but he was one of the guys we identified to bat three for us we needed to run with him and give him the opportunity hes blossomed and repaid the faith we showed in him
2662689 well have to bowl well tomorrow but theyre still behind with two key men out
2662690 the situation with carlos and everyone else has always been the same and it was the same with hutton last season
2662691 if a club offers you big money for a player there is always pressure on you to give it serious consideration especially after youve been knocked out of europe
2662692 were more susceptible to an offer but so far we havent had one and i hope that continues
2662693 we have no offer for carlos and that is where we stand right now
2662694 conquer self to become stronger each day to advance in virtue
2662695 ive seen companies with nearly everything perfect budget great it good distribution but a terrible working dynamic between the employees though the national media marketing product makes it to store shelves the people working within the company feel miserable unappreciated and unmotivated
2662696 many national media marketing companies go pel mel spending money when there is a good cash flow while there is nothing wrong with wanting to expand it has to be done in accordance with accounting standards and detailed record keeping this is especially true for public companies private national media marketing firms can sometimes let this aspect of the business slide alittle
2662697 in the case of our national media marketing marketing venture we initially started out with a simple website and then slowly grew as sales increased
2662698 then the website expanded into a data warehouse essentially a store of all things related to our marketing campaigns which allowed us to study and refine subsequent efforts
2662699 if you walk up to someone and say ive got a great national media marketing business idea would you contribute 100k theyll probably laugh and consider you a lunatic but if you approach someone and say look i have this great idea and my plan is the following it will reassure an anxious investor that things will move forward with thought and purpose
2662700 i find that attending industry related social functions conferences and even my neighbors cocktail parties help me find new ways of growing my company
2662701 by asking the right people the right questions youll find that you can learn new things and different strategies for your national media marketing firm that you may not have thought of before
2662702 i think the potential for success marketing in most all countries so why not casino games
2662703 i believe that online casinos can thrive in the east if they are marketed correctly that means outstanding customer service a realistic gaming experience and good deposit options

2662708 they say that if a man cant shine his shoes then he cant take care of himself so how can he take care of me
2662709 once upon a time you could go to any bus station or casino any airport barber shop or coffee shop and theyd have shoeshines
2662710 the biggest reason why it is dying out is the shoes people wear now
2662711 you see more sandals tennis shoes shoes that dont require polishing
2662712 nobody has really said that to me but i know that is the reason they figure there are other things they can do
2662713 sometimes a person will come up to me in a bad mood but a shoeshine will put you in a good mood it puts a little shine in your eye
2662714 thats going to be a starbucks and that will be a hotel desk
2662715 they also just put a ben amp jerrys in here so thats more traffic
2662716 i dont know the exact reason but they just stopped coming
2662717 yes a lot of people especially young people wear tennis shoes it used to be on saturdays you would get a haircut and a shoeshine but right now they just dont do it anymore
2662718 it used to be that almost every casino had a stand
2662719 now there are only about four of us who still do this
2662720 i see people walking around who just dont care about their shoes they pay 300 for a pair of shoes and 3 000 for a suit but when they go out they dont shine their shoes now when i grew up if your shoes werent shined you werent clean
2662721 we do have a lot of business travelers and businessmen and business women are more apt to use their services
2662722 ive been doing it off and on since i was 10
2662723 so that is 43 years my father was a preacher and didnt have much money so i went out and got me a box
2662724 in the 60s when i was little my brother and i would make these little skateboards take them down the beale street and shine shoes for 10 or 15 cents
2662725 i dont look at how much money i make because i know that it will be all right
2662726 but i would probably lose some customers or id lose some tips
2662727 we have car shows down in l a but none as big or as nice as this

2662744 ich habe alle spiele der bundesliga seit 1963 die begegnungen der spanischen italienischen und englischen ersten ligen seit 1963 sowie die partien der zweiten bundesliga seit 1974 analysiert insgesamt habe ich die ergebnisse von mehr als 71 000 spielen untersucht
2662745 f r meine diplom arbeit an der technischen universit t dortmund war ich auf der suche nach einem geeigneten thema meine professoren wussten dass ich begeisterter fu ballfan bin und schlugen mir deshalb vor den heimvorteil wissenschaftlich unter die lupe zu nehmen f r mich war es sch n wissenschaft und hobby verbinden zu k nnen
2662746 nat rlich gibt es nach wie vor mannschaften die sehr heimstark sind doch es gibt eben auch sehr viele teams die sehr heimschwach sind wir reden hier von durchschnittswerten
2662747 das kann man so sagen ein grund ist jedoch auch die zunehmende leistungsdichte im profifu ball wenn zwei gleich starke mannschaften gegeneinander spielen ist es praktisch egal wo die partie statt findet
2662748 italien war in den 70er und 80er jahren bekannt f r seinen defensivfu ball vor allem ausw rtsmannschaften haben oftmals auf ein torloses unentschieden hingearbeitet das ist mittlerweile anders aber der italienische fu ball hat sich nur dem niveau der anderen europ ischen ligen angepasst also auch dort gilt der riesen heimvorteil ist ein mythos aber schon seit langem
2662749 seit dieser zeit nimmt die bedeutung des heimvorteils in der tat signifikant ab irgendetwas muss im europ ischen fu ball passiert sein das den heimvorteil negativ oder aus sicht der gastmannschaften positiv beeinflusst hat doch die erkl rung muss ich leider schuldig bleiben ich suche immer noch nach den gr nden und habe mich dar ber schon mit sehr vielen fans ausgetauscht doch die wussten es auch nicht wahrscheinlich war es zufall und den d rfen wir statistiker ja nicht untersch tzen
2662750 ich hoffe nat rlich dass der ein oder andere trainer seine schl sse aus meiner arbeit zieht heimmannschaften rate ich wieder offensiver zu werke zu gehen und weniger auf die abwehrreihe und die taktik zu setzen

2662776 google must make it very easy for people to report privacy invasions
2662777 theres been concern about google capturing images on private roads which they clearly should not be doing and weve seen reports of that happening

2662781 many people who have never been to western sydney have stereotyped views of it as a suburban wasteland or even dangerous like something out of a video game like grand theft auto
2662782 one could imagine some people being quite surprised at how pleasant and well looked after most western sydney streets are
2662783 western sydney is increasingly complex and diverse like other parts of the city

2662802 this decline is not surprising given the state of the economy

2662804 i think the thing here with fuelwatch and obviously with grocerychoice is were about empowering people to make the best possible decisions
2662805 its one thing to wander yourself from supermarket to supermarket checking prices and many people do when theyre doing the weekly shop its another thing to have that information given to you in a convenient format thats what were trying to achieve
2662806 that shows that the community is very interested in the information it can provide
2662807 the liberal party wanders around saying its all a waste of time presumably they would abolish it presumably they believe in less information for consumers
2662808 treasurer wayne swan could learn from the shopsmart website how to provide information that is really relevant to shoppers
2662809 shopsmart also provides consumers a range of money saving and financial planning tips as well as a downloadable unit pricing matrix
2662810 this is really giving motorists the chance to call for a tender for their petrol and really the conservatives in the senate should get out of the way and let motorists have that opportunity
2662811 the liberal party ran around before the election drawing attention to that now they are trying to run around saying that wed said something different
2662812 those politicians themselves are so propagandized that they are incapable of thinking originally
2662813 the case might be made that at least fifty one percent of our national legislators you know the vote percentage needed to direct the political agenda have lost sight of their own thoughts their own moral center and their ability to retain authenticity
2662814 the number one way this culture destroys its members is by preventing men from thinking their own thoughts

2662854 pero esto es imposible a ellos nom s les importa sacar su producci n
2662855 les dejo a mi hija maritza jasm n porque yo s que con ustedes ba a estar mejor porque ustedes s le pueden dar lo que yo no puedo cuidenmela mucho y h ganla muy feliz
2662856 me la mand mala del est mago sin zapatos con una calceta nada m s y con una panzota que la tuve que desparasitar porque hac a de pop pura arena con tierra

2662860 the result is a strong performance in a highly challenging environment it marks the reward for the hard work that has been invested by all of the lufthanseats and all of the groups companies such as swiss it is the result of careful precautions
2662861 the undoubtedly very good first half result should not allow us to lose sight of the major challenges that lie ahead our company has the great opportunity to emerge relatively stronger from the increasingly difficult market and competition situation that we find ourselves in we have laid the foundations and will not jeopardize our future we have shown in the past that we are prepared for these kinds of situations and are capable of reacting to them our financial strength and operating adaptability will grant us the opportunity to remain profitable and strong and to continue to make our company more attractive for our shareholders customers and employees
2662862 i do not believe this will have an impact on the olympic games i do not think it is related to the olympics
2662863 the airline sector is in trouble losses this year could reach us 6 1 billion more than wiping out the us 5 6 billion that airlines made in 2007 falling demand and rising costs are re shaping the industry
2662864 to survive the crisis urgent action is needed airports and air navigation service providers must come to the table with efficiencies that deliver cost savings labour must understand that efficiency is the only path to job security and governments must stop crazy taxation and give airlines the freedom to merge and consolidate where it makes business sense
2662865 the economy is decelerating sharply the correction in the construction sector is still ongoing and the outlook for the near to medium term is rather bleak
2662866 we believe the deterioration of spain is just in the beginning stages
2662867 the bulk of the pain will be suffered in 2009
2662868 the economic situation is worse than we all predicted we thought it would happen slowly but instead it has hit fast
2662869 the almost recession is having an impact i suppose people are going out less than before
2662870 israel needs to be very careful and sensitive these days
2662871 the russians are selling many arms to iran and syria and there is no need to offer them an excuse to sell even more advanced weapons
2662872 the day we will want to prevent a future deal with iran our hands must be clean
2662873 our partnership with brussels airlines is particularly good for the clients of both airline companies as our route networks essentially are complementary as opposed to overlapping airbaltic has an excellent range of products in terms of flights to cis countries baltic countries and regional centres in scandinavia while brussels airlines offers attractive destinations in africa
2662874 the piperjet exhibited excellent control response around all three axes
2662875 the ergonomics and the basic operation of the side stick control were excellent with well balanced and harmonized control inputs required for the air speeds that we tested moreover the expected level of pitch trim change with power applications was minimal and easy to overcome
2662876 shipments in the business jet and turboprop segments continue to rise steadily
2662877 expanding worldwide markets are having a very positive affect on the turbine segments of our industry
2662878 although total shipments in the piston segment are down for the first half of 2008 we believe recent success of the worlds premier general aviation show in oshkosh wisconsin is a good indicator of sustained enthusiasm for the light end of the market
2662879 the experimental aircraft association reported that attendance at last weeks airventure held steady despite uncertainty with fuel prices and strength of the north american economy the energy surrounding the entire spectrum of general aviation remains robust our piston manufacturers continue to generate excitement through new product introductions that incorporate innovative technologies and are paying increased attention to growth opportunities in the international market
2662880 snow trip great i havent seen the snow in yonks ill learn to snowboard ill make a snowman ill throw snowballs down peoples ski jackets and make a quick exit down the slopes
2662881 alright enough of this im scared lets stop this nonsense
2662882 longest a human being has ever flown through the air without any turbines or engines
2662883 most flips and tricks in the air done by accident
2662884 i need to get to a medic or something but i cant walk becuase it hurts way too much
2662885 now tell me if you feel sick at any point of the trip so we can tilt you to the side
2662886 woah ali didnt you brake your back they fixed it pretty quick
2662887 are you alright i heard you got raped by a snow man and couldnt walk because he was so hard on you
2662888 the current noticeable weakening in the yuan has never happened before
2662889 previously when the dollar rebounded the yuan would either move sideways or appreciate more slowly
2662890 we attribute it to the shift in domestic policy the central bank has adjusted its policy for a slower speed in appreciation
2662891 the signal from central banks statement for second quarter monetary policy meeting is quite clear the change in phrasing is obvious
2662892 use various monetary policy tools to create good conditions for stable relatively fast growth
2662893 we do not believe the chinese authorities will defy the law of gravity to engineer a sustained renminbi depreciation despite persistent forex inflow
2662894 but it is likely that the central bank may fine tune its intervention policy to effect a slower appreciation in the short run
2662895 the economy is still in good shape with consumption spending and export growth both much stronger than almost anyone expected a few months ago
2662896 logos smack of seeking approval for what youre wearing and many customers now have enough confidence not to need that branding generally seems to have dropped away over the past couple of seasons
2662897 the shouty branding of recent seasons now looks very out of date
2662898 generally there is a move towards understatement but i think certain consumers want their spending to be more discreet anyway given the state of the economy
2662899 safeguards are now in place that we believe would prevent this from recurring
2662900 there are insufficient safeguards on the agencys use of national security letters and other intrusive surveillance tools there arent enough controls inside the agency and there arent enough checks from outside the agency
2662901 especially dangerous is the fbis power to impose gag orders on those ordered to disclose information these gag orders which are often unnecessary and almost always overbroad invite abuse
2662902 on august 1 1936 hitler opened the olympics in berlin boosting the morale of germans the ioc hoped that letting germany hold the olympics could make germany more democratic and peace loving but the result was the opposite
2662903 during the berlin olympics germany suddenly became peace loving and removed no jews signs hitler tried to make the world believe that germany was the friend of the whole world but history showed that hitler told a big lie
2662904 during the olympics hitler preached peace while building concentration camps after the olympics germany made the decision to kill millions of jews
2662905 we heard a plane go over and then a big explosion
2662906 the attacks are occurring in regions of georgia far from the zone of conflict in south ossetia they mark a dangerous escalation in the crisis
2662907 whatever side is used to bomb civilians and the positions of peacekeepers this side is not safe and they should know this
2662908 all parties to immediately end hostilities and to engage without delay in negotiations to achieve a peaceful settlement
2662909 complete genocide putin also said georgia had effectively lost the right to rule the breakaway province an indication moscow could be preparing to fulfill south ossetians wish to be absorbed into russia
2662910 this word which rhymes with porkers is never ever not in a million years used to describe chopsticks eschewers
2662911 if your os and as are wide open your mouth probably is too
2662912 a wide y or g below the baseline indicates a strong sex drive
2662913 if you have a writing sample with an extreme right slant and heavy pressure to boot run for cover this person can go ballistic
2662914 education is not filling a bucket but lighting a fire
2662915 we need major changes in the first team and everywhere
2662916 we have signed some exciting players and they will offer something different
2662917 alright you pricks were tired of not trading with you we wanna make use of your nation of workers get your fuckin stuff to america pronto
2662918 education is not filling a bucket but lighting a fire
2662919 meaningless blur grain muddy exposures drunken horizons and general sloppiness
2662920 even in the relatively bohemian atmosphere of carmel california in the 1920s and 30s had to photograph many of his models without showing their faces and some 75 years on many communities are less open about such things today than carmel was then
2662921 i am looking at eyes that looked at the emperor
2662922 i hate my life please help me i am going crazy right now
2662923 we got her away from him before it got worse
2662924 shell live with this for the rest of her life but we got her away from him
2662925 the thing i dont want is for this to go to trial and a jury to give him probation
2662926 the settlement gave those children a sense of security that could not be guaranteed if they had to sit across from him in the courtroom and testify before a jury
2662927 it isnt one of those things where you drop a meter in the water and read a needle
2662928 there is no doubt that we should aim to limit changes in the global mean surface temperature to 2c above pre industrial
2662929 but given this is an ambitious target and we dont know in detail how to limit greenhouse gas emissions to realize a 2 degree target we should be prepared to adapt to 4c
2662930 so even if we get the best possible global agreement to reduce greenhouse gasses on any rational basis you should be preparing for a 20 risk so i think bob watson is quite right to put up the figure of 4 degrees
2662931 jeder der mich gew hlt hat oder f r mich wahlkampf betrieben hat steht obama sehr viel n her als mccain
2662932 vergesst nicht f r was wir in meiner kampagne gek mpft haben
2662933 when the facts change i change my mind what do you do sir
2662934 er hat mehr kanten und profil als man sich das vorstellt
2662935 people who put plastic trash in a barrel and burn it are releasing more dioxins than any single industrial complex
2662936 the machinery moved no one is working and the parking lots have reopened people are shopping
2662937 i walked up and asked him what he was doing
2662938 he said you and your muscleman dont scare me ill protect myself
2662939 that was what i was trying to do 50 years ago and the attorney general of texas stopped me
2662940 when he broke ground on jamaica beach he was only 30 years old a young man with a vision
2662941 it was something very unique when you look at the desolate barren island land then who could have envisioned all the communities on the west end and where they are at today he might have been a little ahead of his time
2662942 jamaica beach was my favorite project because i was so personally involved in it
2662943 the rich people had a second home but the middle class didnt
2662944 the first thing we had to do is convince people they needed a second home and then we had to convince them that jamaica beach is where they wanted to be
2662945 i was in the ready room i didnt feel so good i got like these cold chills
2662946 afterwards i looked up and saw president bush giving me the thumbs up and holding up the american flag that was pretty cool
2662947 its probably going to be the most watched game in the history of the world
2662948 its going to send a lot of chills through my body just to be there and be part of it
2662949 ive been running this race since i was 13 years old
2662950 third was my best coming into today and to win it is a dream come true for me
2662951 im really excited to win it was my second time running it competitively
2662952 i wanted to run the first 10km hard i didnt want to leave it until the final 4km because its pretty easy from there
2662953 i started running when i was at school so it would be 50 or 60 years
2662954 ran away from the teachers to wag and hide and ive never stopped
2662955 this year i was just happy to make it over the finish line
2662956 last year i was waiting at the finish with a bandana on my head and no hair
2662957 spice mobile lance le x 1 un mobile faisant office de console de jeux
2662958 im not downplaying this race by any means but i have to put that race behind me
2662959 i have to act like it never happened because i have so many tough races ahead of me
2662960 going into the last 50 and looking to my right and seeing that i was ahead of ryan and laszlo i sort of started smiling
2662961 i looked up and he waved the flag and nodded his head
2662962 that was a pretty cool feeling to have the president say congratulations and have him in the crowd
2662963 we had a deal i told bob that i wanted this to be my last 400 im he said i have to end on a record
2662964 looking and seeing all three of us together pretty much at the 200 i wasnt really comfortable with having that close of a race
2662965 i usually have more of a gap but it made my breaststroke a lot stronger
2662966 i saw lochte was going slower and i tried to do everything to go better than phelps but i dont have enough power for that
2662967 i did everything i could so thats all i can ask for
2662968 that was amazing setting another world record you cant ask for anything else that was a great way to start off the meet for usa
2662969 i sort of turned around and thought i saw 4 31 and i was thinking that hurt a lot for a 4 31
2662970 but when i walked over and saw the 4 29 i thought thats amazing
2662971 it was a tough race but i cant really be mad
2662972 i was only like a half second off my best time so im happy to get my first medal of the olympics
2662973 everyone did a great job and were really happy with silver because i dont think we were even expecting that
2662974 no state man or woman should fear the influence of loving religion
2662975 this trip has reaffirmed my belief that men and women who aspire to speak their conscience and worship their god are no threat to the future of china
2662976 made it clear that trusting their people with greater freedom is necessary for china to reach its full potential
2662977 he has been driven to be outspoken by the appalling prospect of his silence in the wake of worsening chinese repression
2662978 were trying to make it clear that they need to step it up
2662979 hmm that enemy capital ship has a lot of units being deployed from it punch it with the carrier arm

2662995 there could be a signing tomorrow after the leaders have met to thrash out the remaining issues
2662996 they want an agreement for a process leading to the adoption of a new constitution one that was agreed to by the parties during last years negotiations but were saying this should be an issue for a national referendum
2662997 hmm that enemy capital ship has a lot of units being deployed from it punch it with the carrier arm

2663007 hes cool though ive played against him so many times he owes me some money though because i get all those personal fouls against him every year so i might take his shoes or something and maybe hell give me a ransom
2663008 in addition to the spy drones israel has also been supplying georgia with infantry weapons and electronics for artillery systems and has helped upgrade soviet designed su 25 ground attack jets assembled in georgia according to koba liklikadze an independent military expert based in tbilisi former israeli generals also serve as advisers to the georgian military

2663025 the salary increments will be extended to items with monetary value on the total package concept applied by telkom such as medical aid
2663026 cwu and sa communications union sacu signed the agreement with a clear caution to the employer that the salary increments inclusive 11 5 is still below the current inflation 11 6 rate
2663027 if mbeki has a clear conscience about the deal as he insists he does then he will appoint an independent judicial inquiry into the persistent allegations
2663028 this is not just a willful demand from the media a judiciary inquiry has been demanded by local political parties religious leaders and anti corruption activists
2663029 we have been warned by minister in the presidency essop pahad that the president is taking legal action about the sunday report we are eagerly waiting
2663030 it has been established that instead of helping to boost south africas economy and create thousands of jobs ferrostaals offsets have left a trail of broken promises court battles and dashed expectations
2663031 the report which purports to be a result of six months investigation is but a hotchpotch recycling of allegations that have from time to time been peddled against the governments strategic defence procurement package
2663032 the sunday times or anyone who has evidence that the president or anyone else received bribe s in the procurement process should as we have emphasised before approach the law enforcement agencies

2663050 ive been thoughtful and brought a lot to the table
2663051 the net result is we saved enough money to give seniors making 24 000 or less not including social security an additional 15 000 homestead exemption
2663052 i gave everybody who worked for me the opportunity to have health insurance

2663059 you pay good money for water and then you cant even drink it
2663060 im sure that before we ever started testing for trihalomethanes they were even higher
2663061 it took long we cant argue with that we took some missteps at points in the process
2663062 we were confused as to what we needed to do
2663063 mr forman doesnt speak to the press about business or political activities at all
2663064 its horrible it smells like a swimming pool sometimes sometimes it smells like a cesspool theres debris in it
2663065 ferncrest in my opinion should be fined and their operation canceled turned over to the city or placed up for bids
2663066 we dont know how long you have to drink it
2663067 we thought that the water plant would be phased out
2663068 those guys are legends thats huge company but ive missed so many games and ive been trying to find a groove i hadnt even thought about that

2663199 at the moment i am not close to concluding any transfer deal because i am too busy here
2663200 maybe next week something can happen but for now we have to focus on the champions league and forget about transfers because it is a big target for us
2663201 today we were very young but in the end we learned what it is like to defend something we are not used to and it was a good lesson for us overall i am pleased because we lacked a bit of experience but we got a positive result with 1 1 even if overall sevilla had many more chances
2663202 fabianski played very well he was spot on with his decision making and technically what he does was impressive tonight we have two great goalkeepers so that is what i thought at the start
2663203 he is an exciting player i feel he is still not there physically but overall he has all the skill and technical qualities to be an arsenal player
2663204 i am confident and have belief the team will be focused and treat twente with respect we have learned through our experience and i am confident we can qualify you always expect good opposition in holland but i believe we are good enough to get through
2663205 theres a lot of spots where i thought i could have changed and it probably would have made me in the race more with michael
2663206 i feel like my backstroke i kind of went too hard and i paid for it at the end ive got to go back and look at video and correct it for the future
2663207 im glad that my first race is out of the way
2663208 i wanted to do better but i cant really complain about it i got third at the olympics so im just going to get focused for the rest of my races
2663209 you cant have good races all the time i guess hopefully i got that race out of the way
2663210 you just have to go faster in the morning than you do at night
2663211 he competed the whole way and he did really well
2663212 he had a great race all the way and im really proud of him i wasnt really surprised because i know what he is capable of doing and ive trained with him so it wasnt all that much of a shock to me he did really good my hat is off to him
2663213 i saw early on that he was playing way back on my first serve
2663214 im going to have to pressure him in the corners
2663215 he looks like hes 25 hes got a huge game
2663216 this was a nice week to build on it definitely turns the summer around
2663217 if it werent tisha bav id say its nice to see you
2663218 at the moment he is with us and we have had no formal offer from anybody
2663219 sie warten alle auf den tagesanbruch um aktiv zu werden
2663220 its hard to tell parents how to interact with their children based on one study but what we see here is that parents who have a propensity for being verbally aggressive have a tendency to try to direct and control their children during a play period
2663221 as a result these children were less cooperative and not only are parents setting up situations that are challenging for them to handle but they also are subtly undermining their childs self esteem
2663222 of course all parents direct their children and people in general are always directing others to close a door or hand them something
2663223 its something we do all the time but there is a qualitative difference in the kinds of directing going on by these verbally aggressive mothers by looking at how and when directives occurred not just how often we found that moms who scored highest on verbal aggression used directives to control the child and ultimately the way the game or activity was played the aggressive action is not overt as in a parent hitting or yelling but these small negative maneuvers can say so much to a child
2663224 we all say things to our children that we regret saying but saying a lot of things that attack a childs self confidence is not healthy
2663225 these parents were in an unstructured low stress environment and if we saw this behavior in such a brief setting how could such negative interactions even so subtle affect a child over the long term for example if the parents always have to control what activity they and their children are going to play as well as for how long and how they are going to play it you wonder if this communicates to the child that what they want to do doesnt matter
2663226 group in this context can mean students of different universities people of different nationalities members of different sports teams etc
2663227 the emotion of embarrassment is only felt in the presence of and because of an audience even if that audience is imagined however the nature of the audience has been only scarcely investigated so far
2663228 we will investigate if the opposite process might be true when the embarrassed person is not a member of the group particularly if they have a high status in this case people might actually show joy at anothers misfortune schadenfreude rather than empathy
2663229 group memberships for instance nationality are crucial in social interaction this project moves the literature forward by examining the effects of group belongingness and audience on embarrassment
2663230 in the realm of intergroup relations it is arguable that fear of embarrassment may be particularly important in leading people to avoid contact and hence intimacy with those from different groups and cultures the practical importance of embarrassment is evident when its presence or absence has important implications on intercultural contact and friendships and could determine peoples behaviour in emergencies and health related domains
2663231 this study demonstrates how remedial instruction can use the plasticity of the human brain to gain an educational improvement
2663232 focused instruction can help underperforming brain areas to increase their proficiency
2663233 any kind of education is a matter of training the brain when poor readers are learning to read a particular brain area is not performing as well as it might and remedial instruction helps to shape that area up
2663234 this finding shows that poor readers can be helped to develop buff brains a similar approach should apply to other skills
2663235 we are at the beginning of a new era of neuro education
2663236 het is duidelijk dat het conflict zich op heden uitbreidt naar andere gebieden van georgi meer bepaald abchazi
2663237 wij komen tot het besluit dat het erg moeilijk is zoniet onmogelijk om een punt van overeenkomst te vinden voor een verklaring
2663238 een verbintenis tekenen om niet naar het geweld te grijpen en zich uit zuid osseti terug te trekken

2663240 while mail art etc are sent out actively to their respective recipients with rss art the recipient has to get active and subscribe to the feed or visit the website we feel this to be a very viable art form for our times in which people suffer from information overload and are getting bombarded with unsolicited emails left and right
2663241 a person working in the bank reported it we have several teams looking for her we have to be certain
2663242 when teachers vote for something and its best for kids that should end it
2663243 what else is there to talk about it i can see this program turning around lives and theyre not going to get that if microsociety is watered down
2663244 we have a great team of teachers and we still have a town with a market place concept and a token economy
2663245 within our town theyll have their own rules and deal with a court system
2663246 we have 31 business ventures facilitated by staff members a beauty shop snack bar gym tv station the kids just will get it two days a week instead of five
2663247 we are only taking actions against the breakaway milf group that defied the orders of the ceasefire panels
2663248 we dont know what will happen next but this will certainly have an adverse impact on peace talks
2663249 i hope those remaining five will also be released as they had not done anything to harm the peace
2663250 they did it in memory of those who were killed in 1988 and i hope the authorities who have declared plans to establish democracy in the country will treat those youths leniently and release them quickly
2663251 hamas has agreed to close the file of political detentions and fatah showed its readiness too but there were no measures of datesset for doing so
2663252 theyll remain deadlocked and each side will use it to become more deeply entrenched in their positions
2663253 what is being proposed is not compatible in scope and scale we think we could have something smaller other neighborhood centers do not have stores of that size
2663254 my goal always has been and will continue to be to represent and advocate for all kansans
2663255 a major concern of my campaign was the excessive influence of out of state money it was never my intention to upset or offend anyone
2663256 she finney never just came right out and said it
2663257 you just dont expect it to come from inside the party
2663258 i regret that a right wing blogger used my campaign as a vehicle to attack the civil rights of the gay and lesbian community
2663259 what is out of bounds is using sexual orientation to divide people
2663260 its ugly and divisive and its something democrats dont do in history
2663261 the rumors and charges that the finney campaign was using sexual orientation as a wedge issue are untrue
2663262 used divisive tactics and out of state money to influence a kansas election
2663263 when they failed instead of taking responsibility for their incompetence they targeted gail and the sedgwick county democratic party as a scapegoat
2663264 i publicly release every project that receives these investments and i am confident all can withstand the flashlight of public scrutiny
2663265 in addition i voted for the ethics reform bill signed into law last year that increased the transparency of the earmark process
2663266 the incumbent senators mentality of vote for my pet projects and ill vote for your pet projects had gone on for too long
2663267 i am confident that kansas will get its fair share of funding if the process is merit based
2663268 in light of the high extent of commercial and economic relations between the eu and iran if the europeans impose sanctions they will definitely be hurt
2663269 we have said we will continue looking to see how best to apply pressure to the iranian regime and we will continue to do that
2663270 current developments as well as relations between irans atomic energy organisation and the iaea were discussed in a positive atmosphere
2663271 were facing an economic blockade and this has forced us to take this natural route and march to muzaffarabad
2663272 our produce mainly apples is rotting at least 1 500 truckloads of fresh fruit are waiting to be transported to markets outside kashmir
2663273 i want america to know that im like totally ready to lead
2663274 it would be pink on the outside pink carpets pink furniture pink jammies the men on her staff would be cool with be shirtless chippendale types with names like leon
2663275 instead of a bowling alley in the basement of the white house paris would have a pilates studio and oh yeah shed have foam parties in the oval office for the white house staff and old girlfriends from boarding school
2663276 she would answer all questions while walking and posing for a wall of photographers and theyd be yelling out paris look here
2663277 the first half of every conference would be about what shes wearing paris would realize that as president she would have to tone it down a little shed lean toward prada
2663278 what would happen is rihanna would step off the plane in fishnet stockings music would blare and whole countries would melt at the sight of her
2663279 it would be like bush at the crawford ranch she would be in l a more than she would in washington d c
2663280 people have come to the conclusion that the closer he is to wanting to obtain power the more difficult others will make it for him to achieve that
2663281 a lot of people are very tired after living through the first sodomy trial which had a chilling effect on the country even until today people thought it was blatant political manoeuvering
2663282 the new sodomy charges against anwar ibrahim are all a political game because he is now a real threat to the prime minister
2663283 anwar was cleared of all the sodomy charges before so what are they trying to prove now we have all grown up in the last 10 years and people are not so stupid to just accept all these things blindly
2663284 it looks like the government is out to fix him again everyone knows that the charge against him is nothing but a lie
2663285 the only thing we can do now is to vote for anwar and make sure he gets to parliament and eventually form the government only then can we right all that is wrong in this country
2663286 basically hes fine hes just staying in hospital for further observation
2663287 i would like to inform you that the total expenses registered since 14 october 1997 amounts to 23 million french francs and this is uniquely for the groups we support these are liberation army of rwanda alir 2 300 men ex far 1 565 men and lastly interahamwe 1 250 men
2663288 witnesses some only 12 at the time testified to being raped by french troops from operation turquoise in the refugee camp set up for tutsi survivors at cyangugu belgian and german witnesses spoke of the training given to the interahamwe and the financing of the interim government by paris
2663289 so accusing france today of its complicity in those horrible events would logically lead to accusations or self accusations against every other government even though frances role was more direct than the purely passive one of other countries
2663290 i personally believe that u s americans are unable to locate the us on a map because uh some people out there in our nation dont have maps
2663291 attacks by seperatists claimed the lives of at least ten georgian soldiers
2663292 despite our call for peace and a unilateral ceasefire separatists continued the shelling of georgian villages
2663293 such a turbulent history would seem to leave little room for the sedate solar system and our simulations show exactly that
2663294 conditions must be just right for the solar system to emerge
2663295 we now better understand the process of planet formation and can explain the properties of the strange exoplanets weve observed
2663296 we also know that the solar system is special and understand at some level what makes it special
2663297 movement of cargo at most out ports is done manually and would require the assistance of conveyor belts to make work easier
2663298 as a partner of papua new guinea japan has been contributing to its development through various kinds of assistance in response to the requests from its people and the government
2663299 papua new guinea is the biggest recipient among the south pacific island countries
2663300 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2663301 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2663302 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2663303 our government business and aviation clients will breathe a little easier today
2663304 motorists and domestic users the backbone of our business will also receive a welcome respite from the price hikes of recent months for people trying to balance the family budget its like a breath of fresh air
2663305 finally a touch of sanity has returned to the international market place
2663306 none of these factors are internal to the png economy they are all external
2663307 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2663308 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2663309 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2663310 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2663311 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

2663318 the one constant in republican victories in fall elections has been large margins in springfield and those surrounding counties
2663319 if you dont campaign hard in a region of the state that is growing that represents a lot of votes
2663320 a good performing republican will get 65 percent of the vote in greene and surrounding counties
2663321 this race will be fought and won in the margins
2663322 if youre a democrat and cant get north of 40 percent in greene county youre in trouble
2663323 a lot of things hes said have really turned off and angered a lot of people including greene county democrats
2663324 the threat of obama is enough to get the hard core conservatives out
2663325 cheated on more times than a blind woman playing scrabble with gypsies
2663326 senator lieberman supports both democrats and republicans and he gave to the committee as a senior member of the caucus
2663327 employees here dont know where hell get the ethanol there are only gas pumps here
2663328 i enjoy our conversations our relationship is constructive and its important and also very candid
2663329 i had a very uplifting experience going to a church
2663330 it just goes to show that god is universal god is love and no state man or woman should fear the influence of loving religion
2663331 this is a true testament to the importance you place on relations with china
2663332 hey im changing so i can get votes in texas or arizona
2663333 he was absolutely marvellous so prepared so professional so enthusiastic
2663334 i didnt know jean lemire but the fact that it was a canadian piece swung me over to it
2663335 i looked at it and i really loved their work
2663336 they went through trauma and personal anguish and terrible terrible disappointment with what is happening with the world
2663337 oh i hope they get a devastating understanding of what terrible things that we are doing
2663338 just look at the wretched broadcasting in the united states during this presidential campaign its disgusting look what theyre feeding people
2663339 if barack obama is elected president then al gore will be the energy czar in the united states and that i do believe would have a very positive effect
2663340 the cake went all over me that was the end of my suit
2663341 i always wondered whether sometime a political protester would hit me with a pie in the face i never thought a friendly birthday cake would attack me from the rear
2663342 id like to hear the governor and legislative leaders tell the voters where the shortfall is coming from and unless i hear that im not sure we ought to take a gamble
2663343 education funding is very important part of our economy has to be based on attracting and keeping good paying jobs and we cant do that without a well educated work force
2663344 our dependence on foreign oil means that we are buying from our enemies
2663345 how bout some friends and a few a holes that better
2663346 the american people know something is wrong as far as energy is concerned
2663347 i hope he grabs that part of middle america that we failed to reach
2663348 i want him to make more money in wind than he did in oil
2663349 it was my first experience in the takeover field expansion by acquisition
2663350 people had splashed water all over the counters thrown paper towels on the floor and boone pickens couldnt stand to see his investment in disarray so without a word he started picking up the paper towels and wiping down the counters himself
2663351 i think the rest of us were so embarrassed we started to clean up quietly around him
2663352 want to continue flying in your private jet and air conditioning your 16 000 square foot mansion and not worry about hurting the environment then send us your money and well offset the damage youre doing by planting trees
2663353 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
2663354 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view
2663355 we are pleased to note ofcom has vindicated the ipccs claim against channel 4 in spirit and in substance
2663356 it is entirely appropriate people should bear a cost if only of unpopularity and criticism for speaking freely however the cost should be reasonable and not disproportionate there should not be in the words of a famous supreme court decision a chilling effect on free speech
2663357 an anonymous secondhand quotation from sen barack obama at a closed house democratic caucus meeting on july 29 caused an uproar among partisans it is an excellent example of how the pernicious use of unnamed sources so pervasive in washington can backfire on journalists and sources
2663358 this is the moment that the world is waiting for i have become a symbol of the possibility of america returning to our best traditions
2663359 in response to what one of the house members prefaced the question by
2663360 said i wish i could take credit for that but i cant because its not about me its about america its about the people of germany and the people of europe looking for a new hope new relationships as we go forward in the world so he expressly said that its not about me
2663361 lots of people are reading the quote about obama being a symbol and getting it wrong his entire point of that riff was that the campaign is not about him
2663362 the post left out the important first half of the sentence which was something along the lines of it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all
2663363 it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all its about america i have just become a symbol
2663364 anonymous quotes should be used sparingly this one wasnt worth it if you werent there be careful about judging the context
2663365 i have become the symbol of america returning to our best traditions
2663366 it scared me to see how the mainstream media were propping up george bush while faithfully reporting every stupid lie that the bush campaign made up about al gore
2663367 ill use every talent i possess and all my energy to try to bring back tolerance decency and generosity to the country i love
2663368 i called my partners and said i think i just met a future president of the united states
2663369 i went from being a senator a young senator to being considered for vice president running for president being a vice presidential candidate and becoming a national public figure
2663370 all of which fed a self focus an egotism a narcissism that leads you to believe that you can do whatever you want youre invincible and there will be no consequences
2663371 he could have been a force in american politics for a very long time
2663372 the fact that he had not spent his life in politics was his greatest asset people at the time were saying he didnt have enough experience and hadnt been tested actually hed been tested in ways other people had not
2663373 if youre an incumbent one of your nightmares is a fresh face coming out of the woodwork with the resources to be competitive
2663374 has shown a remarkable disrespect for his office for the moral dimensions of leadership for his friends for his wife for his precious daughter
2663375 i suspect the first thing he thought about is im going to protect myself politically he was worried about his family finding out he was worried about the rest of the staff finding out he was worried about the press finding out
2663376 consistent moderation placed edwards among the center right of senate democrats
2663377 he climbed onto the slab at the funeral home laid there and hugged his body and promised that hed do all he could to make life better for people to live up to wades ideals of service
2663378 as he told me later edwards had recounted the exact story to him almost in the exact same words a year or two before and with the same preface that hed never shared the memory with anyone else
2663379 he wanted to be vice president and said what he had to
2663380 the thing that would surprise me is if he doesnt continue to serve in some way hes been underestimated many times
2663381 im not sure i had a political career for the future anyway
2663382 im not sure that politics was what i wanted to spend my life doing
2663383 i dont know whats possible and whats gone i dont think anythings ended i see no end my lord and my wife have forgiven me so im going to move on
2663384 if a person is too safe and conservative hes not likely to come up with great ideas
2663385 pick your failure apart as if you were a commentator at a golf tournament
2663386 being fired teaches you that your workplace doesnt define you as much as you thought it did
2663387 dont be too blas too self blaming or too defensive
2663388 my expectations about my previous job were off and i also lacked some of the resources i needed
2663389 we tend to overreact to failures and ignore the successful aspects of these experiences
2663390 everybody says they want to support it but its been a tough sell
2663391 a number of utilities have reported that only 20 percent to 30 percent of their customers are aware that a green power option is offered
2663392 thats confusing they think its the wind why isnt it free
2663393 what we see in georgia is whats the minimum that we can do well take your money and well green wash and do a lot of propaganda about the program
2663394 10 years behind the curve southern co is looking at offshore wind but theyre not really advancing the ball on renewable energy in a credible or serious way
2663395 as much as 1 billion on renewable generation over the next 10 years
2663396 if they had something in place where they were doing wind turbines on the coast or solar modules or solar plants or something like that i would be more inclined to pay more for that
2663397 but its just really hard for me to justify paying more for landfill methane gas
2663398 we have regular exchanges with malaysian diplomats in washington on a number of subjects including with the malaysian charge daffaires yesterday
2663399 anwar ibrahims case was one of the topics of conversation
2663400 we take note of the many serious questions raised within malaysia including by the malaysian bar council concerning this case
2663401 for the second time gore is goring us repeating the 1998 goring
2663402 we hope he will stop goring as it is about time he re examines the goring process within himself and his country
2663403 there is no way other countries should look down on us in the administration of our own laws our criminal procedure code and the penal code emanate from the common law
2663404 therefore there is no reason whatsoever for any other power in the world to criticise us in administering justice and the rule of law
2663405 the larger theme is how environmentalism seems to harm the poorest people in the poorest places on the planet
2663406 its looking at how the hysteria around global warming will affect people on low or fixed incomes it asks is there a disease and is the cure worse than the disease the science isnt settled global warming was invented five or 10 years ago
2663407 the film al gore and hollywood dont want you to see
2663408 i dont think it would be a bad thing for this earth to warm up
2663409 greenpeaces claims are based on science and the science is very clear the latest report from the uns leading scientists says that climate change is happening human activity is causing it and its a huge threat to our species
2663410 but we can prevent the worst if we act immediately to slash emissions and kickstart an energy revolution with a massive expansion of renewables and improvements in energy efficiency
2663411 despise ryanair because it used to be that we with our own sort whereas i see ryanair as making ireland wealthy they see it as a negative for ireland
2663412 obama telling us not to drive suvs and al gore saying that you cant use air conditioning
2663413 it predates me being involved in politics or him being involved in politics im older than him so i serve an older brother role i hope he feels ive been there for him and hes certainly been a very loyal and terrifically helpful colleague
2663414 one of the roles ive always wound up playing is being a translator telling people yes he has a different approach hes serious about change this is what it means and my relationship with him gives credibility to that
2663415 my dad is one of the people who taught me how to laugh
2663416 the group had sort of a smothers brothers like routine they would sing songs and they would tell topical stories talk about current events tell a few jokes sing songs and you know thats my dads personality
2663417 i ended up delivering packages to these glittering buildings in downtown chicago and when youre a kid growing up in chicago these are the most important buildings in your life
2663418 in a permanent state of zen very even handed very mild mannered
2663419 i am now here spreading the word about the climate project and what we can do in india and elsewhere to help
2663420 we are expected to give 10 inconvenient truth presentations within a year
2663421 the reason why the global warming message is a success is that ordinary people are involved in it who are spreading the word
2663422 but i dont really have a good argument that the government should be the one to prevent abortion because of my religious beliefs
2663423 yes the other issues do matter but as a christian my belief system supports the idea that human life is sacred it doesnt matter if that human life is accidental or the result of rape as tragic as those situations are human life is sacred
2663424 for many democratic activists and operatives the phrase white christian still conjures up images of finger wagging priests and scopes era fundamentalists
2663425 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
2663426 the un secretary general has not uttered a word meaning that he respects our laws and justice system why should a lesser mortal from the us say that malaysia is not up to their standards
2663427 why should gore and the us president give their evaluation of a country does he not know the meaning of the udhr universal declaration of human rights and the un charter respect for the internal affairs of a country
2663428 but if they have any substantive legal problem that they would like to highlight internationally they are welcome to discuss it with us but in a manner that is judicious careful and respectful
2663429 both obama and mccain need to make their running mate choices very carefully because after all the influence that cheney and gore developed people are going to analyze their choices very carefully
2663430 we will never go back to the days when the vice presidency held little influence the national government is involved in too many things for a president not to have a strong partner standing at his side
2663431 even selecting himself as the running mate something that has never been done in history
2663432 theres something healthy in the vice presidency becoming a separate entity
2663433 in the next month one man either the democratic presidential nominee or the republican presidential nominee will choose the next vice president of the united states
2663434 their choice will be ratified by their party conventions and we the people will accept it but the idea that one person will select somebody who has a one in three chance of becoming president of the united states is to my mind very problematic
2663435 presidential candidates usually get vetted for a couple of years but the vice president just gets picked by one guy
2663436 its kind of weird process if you stop and think about it
2663437 it ought to be a more competitive process at the early stages
2663438 maybe people should run for vice president i dont know but we should be talking about it because the process now is fundamentally unhealthy it is not democratic for one man or woman to be able to pick the next president of the united states
2663439 our penal code and criminal procedure code originate from the common law
2663440 therefore there is no reason whatsoever for any power on earth to criticise another countrys internal administration of justice
2663441 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
2663442 weve had enough of this criticism but if they have a substantive legal problem that they would like to highlight internationally they are welcome to discuss with us but in a manner that is judicious careful and respectful
2663443 we have been summoning people too often lately i think for now we just let this go
2663444 as the minister of foreign affairs i would like to send this message loud and clear stop meddling in our internal affairs
2663445 we can say the same thing about guantanamo we can say about the malaysians being detained there but we did not do that as we have respect for the systems of the world
2663446 what more with the creation of the asean charter we want to ensure a much brighter future for asean whether in the political economic security or socio cultural sphere
2663447 the only issue that hit home is the war because of him
2663448 real results by the end of my first term in office
2663449 take nothing less than a complete transformation of our economy
2663450 leverage billions more in private capital to build a new energy economy
2663451 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
2663452 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
2663453 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
2663454 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
2663455 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
2663456 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
2663457 john and i will tell you there were interesting races four years ago and eight years ago but in many ways this is one of the most interesting races in all of american history we have a chance to lift our country to a new way of thinking this can be a transformative election but make no mistake its close closer than it should be
2663458 mccain has promised and reaffirmed his commitment to continue the same policies weve had these past eight years for another four
2663459 we cannot do that barack obama has lifted our spirits and led us to believe yes we can solve the global climate crisis address the other issues we have to take on and has said we can come together and create a new century with bright hope
2663460 you want some advice make iraq the 51st state and lets get the hell out of there
2663461 these are not normal times the relationship between the planet and ourselves has been irrevocably and dramatically altered were a bull in a china shop today as the sun sets we will have put another 70 million tons of global warming pollution into the atmosphere
2663462 just so you all know we did set a record
2663463 ive been involved in fundraising a long time and to have two incredible men who were nominees and both should have been president and also the fact i got a nobel prize winner and an academy award winner this is too much even for me
2663464 he promised america it would be a campaign of respect of ideas not insults and the american people wanted a better campaign and he gives you paris hilton and britney spears
2663465 if he cant keep his word about the campaign and he cant keep his word about the issues that are really important to the american people and he makes the wrong judgments about how to protect america then his candidacy is in fact dangerous in terms of americas security and you cant trust it and you cant trust him thats what this is about
2663466 the most insignificant office that ever the invention of man contrived or his imagination conceived
2663467 the technology has changed and the political and environmental landscape has changed if youre concerned about climate change wheres the power coming from thats why youre not hearing the same opposition you heard 20 years ago
2663468 we have to free ourselves from the domination of the big oil companies that have the ability to manipulate the price
2663469 the need for math and science education and higher level thinking skills
2663470 the capital costs of wind and solar are terrifying to contemplate
2663471 we are extremely pleased to complete the filing of these delayed annual and quarterly reports with the sec today
2663472 i appreciate the dedication and diligence of our team in accomplishing this critical goal we will now be able to fully focus on the key operational initiatives required to improve our business performance and maximize the long term potential of the company
2663473 which many historians believe would have collapsed of its own weight no matter who was commander in chief
2663474 democrats this week chose the prayer of alternative energy over proven prosperity theyve handed prosperity in the here and now to the republicans run with it
2663475 this is the willie horton of 2008 the issue that we have to take back and own or lose
2663476 remember the cheapest form of energy is the energy we dont need to buy in the first place and yet even while americans are worried about making their dollar stretch as far as it can the tremendous power of energy efficiency is being dismissed leadership is the missing ingredient strong forward thinking leaders would 1 show americans that efficiency isnt about sacrifice its about ingenuity high tech solutions and saving money 2 enact policies that give car makers tire manufacturers and motor oil companies incentives to make more efficient products
2663477 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
2663478 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
2663479 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
2663480 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
2663481 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
2663482 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
2663483 surrender of personal excellence and community value in the mere accumulation of material things it measures neither our wit nor our wisdom and can tell us everything about america except why were proud to be americans
2663484 and yet few politicians have seemed inclined to address solutions particularly if those solutions involve a modest individual sacrifice
2663485 since taking steps to make his home more environmentally friendly last june gore devours an average of 17 768 kwh per month 1 638 kwh more energy per month than the year before the renovations by comparison the average american household consumes 11 040 kwh in an entire year according to the energy information administration the cost of gores electric bills over the past year topped 16 533
2663486 despite all the talk about sexism in the presidential campaign the majority of women voters laid the blame for hillarys loss squarely on her and her strategists shoulders they largely reject gender as a cause of her demise
2663487 we get blamed by people for being neanderthals but just because something is new doesnt mean its a good idea to include it in the debates
2663488 this has been something weve explored in the past and for a variety of reasons logistical and scale it couldnt come together
2663489 we offered our functionality with the notion that we knew the goal of these debates is all about information and education
2663490 its a way for americans to educate themselves in a different manner and ideally make a more informed choice when choosing their leader
2663491 i think it will change the process for elections to come
2663492 at the same time were seeing our national security experts saying were highly vulnerable with 70 percent of our oil coming from foreign countries the largest reserves being in the most unstable region of the world the persian gulf
2663493 we are being told by scientists around the world particularly the international group that is charged with studying this and reporting to world leaders that we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
2663494 sitting next to someone on a senate committee has sparked more than a few deep friendships
2663495 obviously my name was linked to it but other than that theres nothing that can be said
2663496 he was a governor who tried to not ruffle feathers
2663497 as a debater i felt like i was in the twilight zone show you want to reach over and slit the arm to see if theres flesh and blood or just wires
2663498 one of my big accomplishments was at one point in the debate he started to sweat
2663499 is it boring to win five times as a democrat in a state thats overwhelmingly republican
2663500 obviously the people of indiana think theres something exciting about him
2663501 when he wasnt writing dirty jokes and yelling at people on the radio he found time to avoid paying his taxes in 18 different states
2663502 im not proud of every joke ive ever told but i know theres a difference between what you say as a comedian and what you do as a u s senator
2663503 the two candidates are polar opposites on many major issues notably the wars in iraq and afghanistan and drilling in the arctic national wildlife refuge coleman has been with bush on both and franken is energetically against both
2663504 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
2663505 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
2663506 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
2663507 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous
2663508 clearly we shouldnt relax our guard just because we are automating the elections
2663509 this is the electronic equivalent of ballot boxes stuffed with ballots even before the voting has started
2663510 even though 27 votes each were recorded for their running mates
2663511 whether it paid bribes to win a venezuela election contract in 2004
2663512 the current way computers are used to record count and tabulate votes threatens the basic democratic principles of voting in secret and counting in public in dre you are already counting in secret
2663513 more than a technological problem election fraud is really a social problem and therefore calls for social solutions supported by technological means the only effective social solution to fraud is elections is eternal vigilance and punishment for the cheats
2663514 the lives of people especially the youth who will sign up on the red list will definitely be in the red meaning stepping into the danger zone
2663515 after others learn about this new group kaya natin we can hardworking and ethical local government officials will come out hopefully
2663516 i think people across the country look at a debate such as this and they scratch their heads
2663517 how can people seriously think they are going to have a positive impact on energy prices in the medium term or the long term if they are not really doing anything about either supply or demand
2663518 it is our job to clarify any confusion and misunderstanding
2663519 whatever decisions orders and policies handed down by the courts and the legal department we have to abide by them they should understand the countrys legal system
2663520 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
2663521 axelrods not the type to drop a refrigerator on a guys head hell take the refrigerator apart drop one piece at a time and save the biggest piece for last
2663522 weve been through two very tough elections at the national level and its very easy to lose confidence
2663523 after one president in the pocket of big oil we cant afford another
2663524 this is a classic washington story anonymous quotes from armchair quarterbacks with no sense of our strategy data or plan
2663525 the entire thing depends on gas availability and price if it is available to fertiliser manufacturers at 5 per mmbtu urea production will go up
2663526 a politician with a troublesome reputation for trying to have it both ways
2663527 mr gore has a bit of a reputation for flip flopping and corner cutting
2663528 at least you know what i believe and where i stand
2663529 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
2663530 i didnt read all the specifics of his plan i agree with his goal i may disagree on all the ways of getting there but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue
2663531 i am in no way trying to get in a fight with gore because we share the same goal
2663532 their tax plan operates under the old theory that the best way to feed the birds is to give more oats to the horse
2663533 i did something thats not normal for politicians but its normal for people
2663534 as we come closer to the peoples vote they get closer to corporate power
2663535 things are getting so bad for libertarians and liberals theres starting to be a convergence of interests
2663536 you cant focus on voters rights and ignore candidate rights
2663537 for all practical purpose we are no much better than the chinese political model expect that in china there is no gridlock and things are getting done
2663538 i am really beholdin to corporate interests they give me a great paycheck and have provided me with the highest standard of living in history comment by lackeynlovenit august 6 2008 at 5 05 pm
2663539 i cant understand why there arent rings of young people blocking bulldozers and preventing them from constructing coal fired power plants
2663540 the gap between the carbon price and the cost of ccs
2663541 i hope that the strengthening of carbon markets will bring forward a sufficiently good price for carbon that it will provide some of the financial incentive for ccs will it be enough i do not know
2663542 as a fig leaf to give unabated coal fired power stations an appearance of environmental acceptability
2663543 has no right to withhold approval for a conventional plant
2663544 thanks i wont include hope to get the set of draft conditions out today or tomorrow
2663545 do you think running a campaign ad in which you feature britney spears and paris hilton with barack obama is respectful
2663546 its a bit of humor its a way to draw people into the ad
2663547 were not deciding whos our favorite celebrity who we are fans of
2663548 the only strategy theyve got in this election is to try to scare you about me
2663549 well you know hes got a funny name and he doesnt look like all the presidents on the dollar bills and the five dollar bills
2663550 what obama was saying is theyre trying to scare you
2663551 theyre trying to scare the american people and believe me im an expert on how they do that
2663552 to insinuate that his celebrity is somehow all he has
2663553 theyre trying to say to america somehow hes not like you
2663554 the mccain campaign is to use barack obamas words raising the question is he a risky guy but it has nothing to do with his name or his skin color it has to do with his lack of experience and bad judgment his unreadiness to be president
2663555 in 2000 al gore gave me the extraordinary honor of being the first jewish american to run for national office and al gore said he had confidence in the american people that they would judge me based on my record not on my religion
2663556 and i urge barack obama to have the same faith in the american people that they will judge him on his record or lack of record certainly not on his name or his race
2663557 break americas gridlock by honoring a bipartisan effort if that is the only way to move us towards alternative and renewable fuels
2663558 when john mccain brings american troops home from iraq theyre staying home
2663559 i think liebermans going to want to be part of the stronger democratic majority
2663560 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
2663561 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
2663562 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
2663563 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
2663564 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
2663565 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
2663566 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
2663567 only if you think that not doing so almost immediately would result in an uninhabitable planet
2663568 about 28 million aids cases could be prevented by 2010 the cost would be 27 billion with monetized socioeconomic benefits almost 40 times as high
2663569 when theres so much in dispute you cant validly make strong conclusions
2663570 by raze you know zeebc i sense a certain progress on ambroses part
2663571 inside the caucus according to a witness obama told the house members this is the moment
2663572 in response to what one of the house members prefaced the question by
2663573 said i wish i could take credit for that but i cant because its not about me its about america its about the people of germany and the people of europe looking for a new hope new relationships as we go forward in the world so he expressly said that its not about me
2663574 lots of people are reading the quote about obama being a symbol and getting it wrong his entire point of that riff was that the campaign is not about him
2663575 the post left out the important first half of the sentence which was something along the lines of it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all
2663576 ordered up a teleconference with the current presidents treasury secretary granted an audience to the pakistani prime minister then he went up to capitol hill to be adored by house democrats in a presidential style pep rally
2663577 along the way he traveled in a bubble more insulating than the actual presidents traffic was shut down for him as he zoomed about town in a long presidential style motorcade while the public and most of the press were kept in the dark about his activities
2663578 capitol police cleared the halls just as they do for the actual president the secret service hustled him in through a side door just as they do for the actual president
2663579 house democrats had called the session to allow the left wing to vent its collective spleen
2663580 in the capitol basement yesterday long suffering house democrats took a trip to the land of make believe
2663581 they pretended a small conference room was the judiciary committee hearing room draping white linens over folding tables to make them look like witness tables and bringing in cardboard name tags and extra flags to make the whole thing look official
2663582 banged a large wooden gavel and got the other lawmakers to call him mr
2663583 i looked around the country for other sites like that i found a little place in upstate new york called love canal had the first hearing on that issue and toone tennessee that was the one that you didnt hear of but that was the one that started it all
2663584 we passed a major national law to clean up hazardous dump sites and we had new efforts to stop the practices that ended up poisoning water around the country weve still got work to do but we made a huge difference and it all happened because one high school student got involved
2663585 that was the one that you didnt hear of but that was the one that started it all
2663586 gore boasted about his efforts in congress 20 years ago to publicize the dangers of toxic waste
2663587 gore said his efforts made a lasting impact i was the one that started it all he said
2663588 al gore is simply unbelievable in the most literal sense of that term
2663589 its a pattern of phoniness and it would be funny if it werent also a little scary
2663590 heres the guy who said he was the character ryan oneal was based on in love story it seems to me hes now the guy who created the love canal case i mean isnt this getting ridiculous isnt it getting to be delusionary
2663591 add love canal to the list of verbal missteps by vice president gore
2663592 the man who mistakenly claimed to have inspired the movie love story and to have invented the internet says he didnt quite mean to say he discovered a toxic waste site
2663593 it reminds me of snoopy thinking hes the red baron
2663594 i mean how did he get this idea now youve seen al gore in action i know you didnt know that he was the prototype for ryan oneals character in love story or that he invented the internet he now is the guy who discovered love canal
2663595 what is it the zelig guy who keeps saying i was the main character in love story i invented the internet i invented love canal
2663596 again hes been caught red handed and again he has been left sputtering and apologizing this time he falsely took credit for breaking the love canal story yep another al gore bold faced lie
2663597 says he was the model for love story created the internet and this time he sort of discovered love canal
2663598 never mind that he didnt invent the internet serve as the model for love story or blow the whistle on love canal all of this would be funny if it werent so disturbing
2663599 the real question is how to react to mr gores increasingly bizarre utterings
2663600 websters new world dictionary defines delusional thusly the apparent perception in a nervous or mental disorder of some thing external that is actually not present a belief in something that is contrary to fact or reality resulting from deception misconception or a mental disorder
2663601 the part that bugs me is the way they nit pick
2663602 in fact gore said that was the one that started it all referring to the congressional hearings on the subject that he called
2663603 they fixed how they misquoted him but they didnt tell the whole story
2663604 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
2663605 the consequences of climate change are very real and very negative but cheney is not convinced of that he believes not quite as much as senator james inhofe that this is a hoax but that the earth has been changing since it was formed and to say that climate change is caused by humans is incorrect
2663606 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
2663607 from their own website yes the owl is scamming you but yes you lefty libs are so desperate to believe in ghosts and goblins that you will look the other way when the obvious smacks you upside the head
2663608 deliver superior investment performance by taking a long term investment view and integrating sustainability research within a rigorous fundamental equity analysis framework
2663609 a significant shift in where the u s gets its power in 2005 coal supplied slightly more than half the nations 3 7 billion kilowatt hours of electricity nuclear power accounted for 21 percent natural gas 15 percent and renewable sources including wind and solar about 8 6 percent
2663610 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
2663611 channel 4 will not be in a hurry to commission him poor old durkin again
2663612 it is entirely appropriate that people should bear a cost if only of unpopularity and criticism for speaking freely however the cost should be reasonable and not disproportionate there should not be in the words of a famous supreme court decision a chilling effect on free speech
2663613 i am really honored by the suggestion that some have made that i consider taking a position of some kind in the next administration
2663614 i want to convey my respect for the idea even as i explain to you why i dont think thats the best idea
2663615 to focus on and try and enlarge the political space in which we address this climate crisis
2663616 to bring about a sea change in public opinion across party lines
2663617 remember america i gave you the internet and i can take it away
2663618 i found it interesting that over the weekend i heard a sound bite on the news from al gore where he was also using the figure of the equivalent of a dollar a gallon
2663619 we are honored to welcome u s vice president gore one of the worlds most respected leaders to west coast green
2663620 addressing both the challenges and significant opportunities that humanity is facing requires significant innovation in technology business and building and we are extremely excited to hear mr gores timely exploration of the intersection of these industries
2663621 by facing and removing the danger of the climate crisis we have the opportunity to gain the moral authority and vision to vastly increase our own capacity to solve other crises that have been too long ignored we must ensure that entrepreneurs and inventors everywhere on the globe have the chance to change the world
2663622 specially if your partner raises the bedsheets at the wrong time in the middle of the night
2663623 specially if your partner raises the bedsheets at the wrong time in the middle of the night
2663624 i have never seen an opportunity for the country like the one thats emerging now
2663625 at the least the have a lot of hatred of anybody who is enjoying life
2663626 anyone who drives an electric car falls in love with an electric car
2663627 we could further increase the value and efficiency of a unified national grid by helping our struggling auto giants switch to the manufacture of plug in electric cars an electric vehicle fleet would sharply reduce the cost of driving a car reduce pollution and increase the flexibility of our electricity grid
2663628 hi mom this is john doe your son you believe me dont you
2663629 oil generates only 3 percent of our electricity therefore a 100 percent renewable electricity system does little to reduce our oil dependency
2663630 we can not drill our way out of this crisis regarding oil
2663631 americans hate being dependent for our mobility and therefore for our livelihoods on countries often hostile to our way of life
2663632 dire national security problems inherent in our dependence on imported oil
2663633 this is the reason enron and others were able to manipulate the system in deregulated california 10 years ago a manipulation that led to the near bankruptcy of the state and continues to burden the state budget
2663634 dire national security problems inherent in our dependence on imported oil
2663635 this is the reason enron and others were able to manipulate the system in deregulated california 10 years ago a manipulation that led to the near bankruptcy of the state and continues to burden the state budget

2663643 moving people mindlessly across the stage in provincial parades of gobsmacking mediocrity
2663644 the problem is director drought ask any of the good actors or designers in the country
2663645 most directors have no idea about space no idea about the actors body no idea of rhythm no idea of the contrapuntal movement of body sound light and image and no idea about why the f k they want people to buy a ticket and sit through an evening of their work
2663646 they think them too clever by half too smart for their own good its ultimately about the aussie fear of appearing stupid i dont get it so therefore i dont like it whereas i dont want to get it i want to get in it and seek to understand it
2663647 you just dont see contradiction on the stages its as if we have a pathological fear of complexity
2663648 its just not possible to have a willing excited dialogue between the stage and the audience everything is so passive
2663649 we have so few cultural traditions here though and almost no context for what we do and it is really deathly if the audience members are not excited participants in the dialogue between the stage and that space where the audience is
2663650 the problem is director drought ask any of the good actors or designers in the country
2663651 most directors have no idea about space no idea about the actors body no idea of rhythm no idea of the contrapuntal movement of body sound light and image and no idea about why the f k they want people to buy a ticket and sit through an evening of their work

2663682 herr krzyzewski welche rolle spielt der kampf der systeme bei diesen olympischen spielen
2663683 das m sst ihr entscheiden ich interessiere mich nur daf r wie wir gegen yao ming verteidigen
2663684 es wird wahrscheinlich das spiel mit der h chsten fernsehzuschauerzahl der sportgeschichte sein
2663685 wir haben bei olympia eine sehr ernstzunehmende herausforderung die h rteste seit der aufl sung der sowjetunion

2663687 im going to have a double shot of espresso tomorrow morning and ill be ok
2663688 i said the president is watching its time to step up
2663689 i saw the chinese guy next to me and i just buried my head
2663690 i was hoping for gold everyone in that race was i gave it everything i had
2663691 that was a strange one id asked the referee if i could remove a plastic bag from the field he allowed me to do so and then when i came back and put the ball on the spot he decided to give me a yellow card i dont know as i said a strange one im really disappointed because i really wanted to play against china on sunday
2663692 all teams are difficult we know that i think we have a very interesting group we have to work hard really hard to achieve the final round all the players know that now after all the experience of the past two years
2663693 stupid italian guy who made a dive and should win an oscar award for it
2663694 i was proud of all my players tonight and getting a point keeps us right in the competition they all worked unbelievably hard in very trying conditions sometimes we did turn possession over too quickly but that might have been down to the occasion physically they did everything they could possible do
2663695 we have to work very hard as a team because were playing against top quality people have to realise that these are the 16 best teams in the world weve made a massive achievement by qualifying but now were playing against players from the top leagues around europe eight out of my eleven were from the a league which is great credit to the competition
2663696 four games and no goals against but today it was not what we deserved i think everybody understands that i am very happy with the three points but we started quite nervous i am happy with the three points but not the performance
2663697 i speak about organisational mistakes we have to work on that i think mark thats why hes the goalkeeper i said thanks to him and he said yeah but thats my job hes a good professional but he did a great job he was always there great performance from mark again
2663698 it wasnt pretty you can plan a lot of things and that but we grinded it out it shows the determination of the young squad weve got here it was the first time weve played together so again it obviously showed but when you dont go well you stick to your plan pick up your man and work hard

2663702 he did this speech and 100 000 people showed up there were so many germans shouting and screaming that france surrendered just in case
2663703 they really love barack obama in germany hes like a rock star over there impressive until you realize that david hasselhoff is also like a rock star over there
2663704 of course obamas supporters got him his usual birthday gifts of gold frankincense and myrrh
2663705 obamas people are trying to portray mccain as cranky and mccain is trying to portray obama as arrogant you see
2663706 see barack obama on the news hes becoming a workout fanatic hes at the gym like twice a day sometimes three times a day at the gym yeah according to his staff well he has to stay in shape to do those flip flops

2663731 there was a crowded bar of people waiting for a table
2663732 a refreshing cocktail of aquavit with muddled cilantro cucumber and a traditional lebanese fragrant syrup with a float of moscato dasti

2663744 she just got mad and said fine whatever umm of course it is but it is better than cutting
2663745 well we have a good team but we will have to be at our best to beat xyz
2663746 of the iraq afghanistan veterans who sought care from va about 38 percent have received at least a preliminary diagnosis of a mental health condition and 18 percent have received a preliminary diagnosis for ptsd post traumatic stress disorder making it the most common but by no means the only mental health condition related to the stress of deployment
2663747 too expensive and the va doesnt like to use it if they can use something else
2663748 theyd rather have me on opiates which are highly addictive and do much more damage to the body
2663749 stephen benjamin is the subject of our film but the problem is a huge disgrace
2663750 in arabic as in hebrew people dont include most vowels when writing
2663751 to the western media its a virtual war going on in iraq were far removed in the comfort zone
2663752 were allowed to disengage from the consequences of war we dont see mutilated bodies we dont see the toll on human beings
2663753 it was much different on opening night which was a very playful atmosphere i wanted to draw people in by doing something playful but then when all the people left the shooting continued
2663754 there was so much fear you couldnt even talk to your brother or sister the saying was that the walls had ears
2663755 you could make a simple joke and end up disappeared and tortured there were a lot of people fighting the regime but it was so brutal it didnt make any difference a whole village could be disappeared
2663756 we realized we werent going to leave any time soon
2663757 we were given tents to live in and the desert has no mercy when storms come
2663758 gordon brown understands that failure in iraq would be a disaster for the security of our countries
2663759 when we first got there the example was already set
2663760 those boys who died are not my relatives and until it happens to my relative things are going fine
2663761 hollywood executives were the last people who were going to get in the middle of that thing i mean studio executives are not known for their social courage
2663762 between 2000 and 2006 the combined real annual earnings of 93 million american workers rose by 15
2663763 less than half of the combined bonuses awarded by the five wall street firms for just one year
2663764 so this was a very difficult decision for me to come to i dont take this decision lightly
2663765 im expressing a right of people in the military to contact their elected representatives and i have done nothing illegal or disrespectful
2663766 we are in possession of what i think to be compelling evidence that saddam hussein has and has had for a number of years a developing capacity for the production and storage of weapons of mass destruction
2663767 we have known for many years that saddam hussein is seeking and developing weapons of mass destruction
2663768 as a member of the house intelligence committee i am keenly aware that the proliferation of chemical and biological weapons is an issue of grave importance to all nations saddam hussein has been engaged in the development of weapons of mass destruction technology which is a threat to countries in the region and he has made a mockery of the weapons inspection process
2663769 iraq does pose a serious threat to the stability of the persian gulf and we should organize an international coalition to eliminate his access to weapons of mass destruction iraqs search for weapons of mass destruction has proven impossible to completely deter and we should assume that it will continue for as long as saddam is in power
2663770 in the four years since the inspectors left intelligence reports show that saddam hussein has worked to rebuild his chemical and biological weapons stock his missile delivery capability and his nuclear program he has also given aid comfort and sanctuary to terrorists including al qaeda members it is clear however that if left unchecked saddam hussein will continue to increase his capacity to wage biological and chemical warfare and will keep trying to develop nuclear weapons
2663771 iraq is a long way from here but what happens there matters a great deal here for the risks that the leaders of a rogue state will use nuclear chemical or biological weapons against us or our allies is the greatest security threat we face
2663772 hussein has chosen to spend his money on building weapons of mass destruction and palaces for his cronies
2663773 he will use those weapons of mass destruction again as he has ten times since 1983
2663774 the community of nations may see more and more of the very kind of threat iraq poses now a rogue state with weapons of mass destruction ready to use them or provide them to terrorists if we fail to respond today saddam and all those who would follow in his footsteps will be emboldened tomorrow
2663775 nearly 1 000 us soldiers sailors marines and airmen including dozens of officers most of whom are on active duty
2663776 it is the duty of the patriot to protect his country from its government
2663777 military men are just dumb stupid animals to be used as pawns in foreign policy
2663778 lets look at it simply the most important difference between north korea and iraq is that economically we just had no choice in invading and conquering iraq the country swims on a sea of oil
2663779 war is a racket it always has been a racket is best described i believe as something that is not what it seems to the majority of the people only a small inside group knows what it is about it is conducted for the benefit of the few at the expense of the very many out of war a few people make huge fortunes
2663780 if youre looking for people to blame for the endless evil shit that happens in iraq in this dishonorable imperial war blame the politicians that put the troops downrange in an impossible situation everything flows from the act of invasion and conquest ordered up by the greedy imperial liars and traitors in washington dc they are the enemy
2663781 the lifers hold on to the lies of the system because the truth would destroy the core of their beliefs the fact that the stars and bars is only an illusion for the real power behind the throne could ruin their psyche and crash their egos they will never let go of their pride and use it as an excuse to cover their fear a war backed by our nations cowards what else would a preemptive strike be good for americans get so afraid they will kill in cold blood and thump their chests to claim it for a good cause i serve in shame
2663782 our leaders goals are not to the benefit of the majority who work themselves into poverty only to provide tax money that pays for their own shackles we deplete the strength and welfare of our own countrymen fighting as mercenaries for the elite rich who gain off exploiting government contracts and manipulating the oil market
2663783 this war is about money most people believe that dollars are being handed over to iraq to rebuild their country on the backs of the american taxpayers and under the protection of us troops however the money never sees iraq it leaves your wallet and goes through the system in dc and ends up in a corporation with the sizeable government contract sure the product is a new road a school house or ak 47s for the iraqi national guard but the money is only making a rich man richer
2663784 come weve got another one this one is a bit more interesting than the others
2663785 ok but we have to be quick my head is hurting
2663786 what have we here dinner youll do well once youre nice and roasted
2663787 id suggest you stop that or ill make you stop and im afraid you wont like it
2663788 is this what you want do you like hurting innocents have some of your own fire i hope you burn in hell for eternity
2663789 then of course ill be nice and buy them a drink usually people who constantly talk about themselves and their earth shaking problems have humongous egos ill be nice and pacify them a little then its goodbye for good
2663790 oh yeah then how come youre so nervous around me always trying to make jokes forcing them out
2663791 i know i am you dont have to tell me that
2663792 thank you i cant believe we waited 3 years for this
2663793 when i left parliament john key said to me look if we win the election in 2008 lets talk about some of the things you might be able to do to help the country and thats as far as its gone
2663794 theres no suggestion of particular jobs of particular posts at all
2663795 he alluded to all sorts of things in general terms he alluded to offshore posts to onshore posts soe state owned enterprise boards all sorts of things i might be able to help with but there was nothing specific offered at all
2663796 taking a goal off china would have been difficult today
2663797 for us we want to play with other team and gain experience
2663798 as a team there is nothing more important to us than supporting mrs bachman in her struggle and supporting hugh and elisabeth in their grief
2663799 we are absolutely devastated by what has occurred for their loss and for everything they are going through we have been in touch with hugh throughout this tragedy and we are extremely proud of the strength he and elisabeth are displaying
2663800 they know we are here for them in every way possible we are binding together as a team to lift the bachman and mccutcheon families we are a family and we will get through this together as a family
2663801 the boys have done a good job in dealing with it its on the forefront of their minds but they are ready to play
2663802 hugh is attending to wizz elisabeth and mrs bachman right now he does not know when or if he will be able to return to the team the team has rallied behind him to support whatever decision he decides to make
2663803 those who do not learn from history are doomed to repeat it
2663804 under a state of total military aggression by the russian navy air force large scale ground operations
2663805 we saw the impact of the air strikes buildings on fire we could hear the russian jets above us
2663806 in one air strike the pilot missed the intended military base instead hitting two apartment blocks
2663807 when we arrived flames were pouring out of the buildings and people were still trapped inside
2663808 a woman begged the firemen and soldiers to help find her family she said shed gone into the burning apartment block but had not been able to find them
2663809 we saw injured civilians being pulled from the buildings we saw at least one man pulled out dead
2663810 the attacks are occurring in regions of georgia far from the zone of conflict in south ossetia they mark a dangerous escalation in the crisis
2663811 ossettia is georgias territory it has been undermined by terrorists funded by moscow
2663812 this is because russia wants to punish georgia for its democratic stance and its western ties at the moment there are between several hundred and two thousand people dead this conflict is not ethnic its not religious its about russia wanting georgia to be subordinate to them
2663813 it is vital for leaders on both sides to call for fighting to cease and for peace talks to start as soon as possible
2663814 whatever part of georgia is used for this aggression is not safe

2663837 that the respondents directors or any representative or employees of the respondent be and are hereby interdicted from going anywhere near 500 metres of the applicants business from the date of this order until the expiry of the lease agreement
2663838 what do you want to write this time the damage has been done and you misled my clients into believing that the place has been closed when we are operational
2663839 i dont care what you are going to write this time but if you continue writing such kind of stories you will know me better because i am not an ordinary person like you
2663840 if you didnt know me well i will deal with you accordingly because hamundizive kuti ndini ani uyezve kuti ndinoita nezveyi
2663841 there is nothing to talk about here because you have printed the story and sold your paper do you know how much revenue i lost today
2663842 if katanha takes me to court as he is saying i will go without a lawyer because i have my papers with me here
2663843 in fact i had wanted to sublet the place to katanha but he never returned the copies of the contract its now more than five months while katanha is still holding onto the papers
2663844 as a result of his delay i have changed my mind and i am now looking for serious people to rent this place
2663845 its very appropriate that it an inconvenient truth got an oscar from the land of make believe
2663846 hea got a lot more movie offers coming in that hes weighing
2663847 fedor was randys last great challenge and with the prospect of that fight being gone he feels that hes accomplished all he can in mixed martial arts
2663848 hes looking to spend more quality time with his wife now
2663849 i appreciate this opportunity the sport of mma and the ufc has given me
2663850 however im tired of swimming upstream at this stage with the management of the ufc it only makes sense at this point in my career to fight fedor emelianenko and since hes now signed with another organization i feel like its time to resign and focus on my other endeavours
2663851 i talked to randy several weeks ago and he said that if he couldnt fight fedor then he has nothing left to prove in the sport of mixed martial arts
2663852 i think its a great move for randys acting career to retire from fighting while he is on top
2663853 as we all know randy retired before the landscape in mma changes every day
2663854 so when he is ready to come out of retirement again he is still under contract with me and im ready to promote him
2663855 you dont see many guys that are able to compete at 44 years old let alone at the level hes competing at hes a freak of nature not only is he an incredible athlete and an incredible fighter hes an incredible human being
2663856 the first guy was 300 pounds the second was about 290 i remember being about ready to piss my pants walking into that cage
2663857 i wasnt sure if i wanted to climb the fence and run or stand in there and fight
2663858 with the defiance of the milf 105th base command to pull put from illegally occupied areas in north cotabato the group has degenerated into a plain bandit group and considered as lost command
2663859 the ceasefire agreement cannot be binding on any group outside the milf organization especially when such group is committing unlawful acts
2663860 all peaceful avenues have been exhausted to resolve the conflict since the 24 hour deadline last friday has expired and we are now compelled to resort to the application of proportionate and justifiable force so that peace and order may be restored in north cotabato
2663861 n o creio que os atentados afetem o caminhar das olimp adas e n o penso estarem relacionados com ela
2663862 the world which has got rid of the cold war cannot regain balance moreover the slant towards the use of violent methods in a number of areas is increasing and we are well aware of that
2663863 a brain dead person should not be able to form new memories he shouldnt have any consciousness at all really so how can anything but a metaphysical explanation cover ndes
2663864 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
2663865 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
2663866 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
2663867 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
2663868 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
2663869 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
2663870 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
2663871 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
2663872 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
2663873 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
2663874 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
2663875 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
2663876 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
2663877 our country and the entire international community cannot stand by as a terror supporting state fulfills its grandest ambitions we will not allow iran to have nuclear weapons
2663878 you do a great job maintaining that blog it has become essential daily viewing for myself and lots of other people i know your efforts are greatly appreciated
2663879 congrats on the site its become an addiction especially now that i am on tour
2663880 isnt matrixsynth better than a big cuppa cocoa amp a christmas cookie on a cold cold southern california morning
2663881 i think that the matrixsynth blog is great and keeps people well in touch with everything synth i visit everyday to see whats going on
2663882 the team was very pumped and ready to play but it was with mixed emotions
2663883 the team installed after the first goal then we clearly dominated overall we would have preferred a more skilled game but argentina has preferred to keep the tempo
2663884 they were tough the heat was 35 degrees and there was high humidity
2663885 we should have determined the final result much earlier but our arrival was not great
2663886 the goal was big for us it is always frustrating when your pressure on the ball and it does not go in the net
2663887 welcome to another edition of family feud we surveyed our audience of internet marketers and asked for their top gripe about their discipline what do you think is number one on the list
2663888 internet marketing is held to different standards of measurement than other media
2663889 survey says ding ding ding internet marketing is held to different standards of measurement than other media a whopping 80 gave that answer
2663890 my cmo wants to know the click rate and conversion rate for every banner ad and every site each month and expects my team to improve upon it month after month theyll spend ten times as much on print media without knowing the response rate but i cant spend a dollar without eight metrics in place
2663891 and well show you the roi of every penny spent
2663892 n o existe raz o para acreditar que o ataque tinha norte americanos por alvo
2663893 vamos apertar a seguran a em locais tur sticos para termos certeza de que nenhuma arma possa ser levada a essas reas
2663894 pequim uma cidade segura mas infelizmente n o somos imunes a ataques violentos
2663895 com ele morto n o h como descobrir o motivo do ataque
2663896 parece ter sido um ato isolado sem nenhuma conex o com a olimp ada
2663897 n o temos raz o para acreditar que o agressor visava cidad os norte americanos como v timas
2663898 n o gostei do tempo s valeu mesmo pela classifica o
2663899 nadei bem acertei os fundamentos mas cansei no final espero melhorar na final
2663900 quero ser a primeira nadadora brasileira a conseguir esse feito se n o for aqui vai ser nos pr ximos jogos ol mpicos
2663901 then i started getting these kinds of chills on my body right then and there i knew i was starting to get more and more excited
2663902 i think i am as prepared as i can be at this moment and thats the best time to be in this position
2663903 abrilhante o sonho com paix o construa a lenda ol mpica
2663904 receba os jogos ol mpicos com muito prazer e construa uma sociedade harmoniosa
2663905 hice una ltima vuelta muy floja es una l stima despu s de haber hecho tres vueltas excelentes en las que acert 73 de 75 platillos
2663906 just rough it for the next two years then we will send another 1
2663907 just rough it for a while that doesnt mean fuck everything it means kepp developing new ideas that are more efficiant instead of quickly mass produce something shitty
2663908 i am a tither and always have been however my motive changed
2663909 this is not a cure all but it is good to see something coming out of the white house
2663910 it is good for markets both domestically and internationally to see that the white house is facing the problem head on and at least starting to do something about it
2663911 bernanke basically said that if problems in the financial market are hurting the economy then the fed will have to respond
2663912 all the conditions are in place for the fed to begin cutting interest rates
2663913 its not the governments job to bail out speculators or those who made the decision to buy a home they knew they could never afford
2663914 yet there are many american homeowners who could get through this difficult time with a little flexibility from their lenders or a little help from their government
2663915 this means that many families who are struggling now will be able to refinance their loans meet their monthly payments and keep their homes
2663916 these are welcome steps but the presidents proposal does not go far enough
2663917 i have called for a plan that will help far more struggling borrowers avoid foreclosure
2663918 for too long this president has sat on his hands as families were losing their homes
2663919 the president has gotten out of his ideological straitjacket and seen that in times of crisis one of the jobs of government is to help
2663920 i look forward to signing a bill as quickly as possible
2663921 some can afford it but its the many who couldnt that i feel sorry for
2663922 it was a once in a lifetime opportunity were working people
2663923 we just have to figure out what were going to do now
2663924 had no other recourse unless we meet with the nearby towns of gulf stream and ocean ridge no one will find out what ultimately can be built there were heartbroken
2663925 i love the beach the boating the fishing so ill just enjoy the parade and keep going
2663926 i have grandchildren going to college and i like to travel i was willing to take the money
2663927 being out at sea 24 7 would grow old after a while
2663928 one beautiful sunset after another now i can stay here and ride around in my little golf cart
2663929 moving with kids is always a little challenging especially if they are resistant to the move itself
2663930 children feel like their losing everything they once loved they may try to hold onto their things a little tighter
2663931 ad oggi abbiamo sollecitato ed ottenuto spiegano i radicali la disponibilit di provincia e comune a ricevere il rappresentante tibetano alle 11 in provincia ci sar un incontro col presidente del consiglio fabbro e alle 16 in comune sar il sindaco romoli a fare gli onori di casa
2663932 it is one of the most powerful ways to put the
2663933 the ownership of money and property comes as a result of doing things in a certain way those who do things in this certain way whether on purpose or accidentally get rich those who do not do things in this certain way no matter how hard they work or how able they are remain poor it is a natural law that like causes always produce like effects therefore any man or woman who learns to do things in this certain way will infallibly get rich
2663934 i can honestly say that since that first night when a tattered printed manuscript found its way to me thanks to one of my daughters my life has never been the same once you read it for yourself you will understand why
2663935 i cant express enough how excited i am to have started off with the time i posted in that event
2663936 i have to put that race behind me and act like it never happened
2663937 i think im as prepared as i can be at this moment
2663938 any time you think you are close to reaching him he jumps to another level
2663939 any time you get an opportunity to have a walkoff game winning hit those are some of the most exciting moments in your career stuff that you dont forget
2663940 im sure most every player remembers every single one of their walkoff hits it was special obviously being here and playing them
2663941 were not a power hitting club and weve got to execute
2663942 weve got to do little things but still you need the hits to win ballgames thats the brand of ball weve got to play
2663943 its a bit of a roller coaster of emotions for me just thinking about sitting behind the eight ball there and then just to see our guys battle out there off broxton its just huge
2663944 if you expect to do something special and play in october you just move on
2663945 to divide a geographic area into voting districts so as to give unfair advantage to one party in elections
2663946 i heard someone say oh my god look at those
2663947 i look up and im like what the hell is that they looked kind of like dragonflies or little helicopters but i mean those are not insects
2663948 you cant make a conventional robot of metal and ball bearings and just shrink the design down
2663949 you might recall that gandalf the friendly wizard in the recent classic lord of the rings used a moth to call in air support
2663950 this science fiction vision is within the realm of reality
2663951 it showed that we can manufacture the articulated high speed structures that you need to re create the complex wing motions that insects produce
2663952 you can get more energy out of a drop of gasoline than out of a battery the size of a drop of gasoline
2663953 they can get eaten by a bird they can get caught in a spider web
2663954 a jet black dragonfly hovering about 10 feet off the ground precisely in the middle of 7th avenue watching us
2663955 it would be a significant violation of peoples civil rights
2663956 they kept us in a truck for several hours then took us out of the truck outside the town and beat us then they drove away leaving us in a field
2663957 it was a blatant action of intimidation they get paranoid
2663958 come on you have just got time for another game
2663959 i walked up and asked him what he was doing
2663960 he said you and your muscleman dont scare me ill protect myself
2663961 that was what i was trying to do 50 years ago and the attorney general of texas stopped me
2663962 when he broke ground on jamaica beach he was only 30 years old a young man with a vision
2663963 it was something very unique when you look at the desolate barren island land then who could have envisioned all the communities on the west end and where they are at today he might have been a little ahead of his time
2663964 jamaica beach was my favorite project because i was so personally involved in it
2663965 the rich people had a second home but the middle class didnt
2663966 the first thing we had to do is convince people they needed a second home and then we had to convince them that jamaica beach is where they wanted to be
2663967 it isnt one of those things where you drop a meter in the water and read a needle
2663968 my concern was that it is not welcomed by all communities
2663969 its a picture of a dog grow up and get the fuck over yourself
2663970 the machinery moved no one is working and the parking lots have reopened people are shopping
2663971 in christianity the literalists are the fringe elements but in islam total devotion to the text is the mainstream
2663972 well they didnt ask me this question so it isnt totally accurate
2663973 it proves that an authority in the church someone who spent their life telling children that god exists doesnt really believe it
2663974 quit your job for the good of the children or you can get your brains beat in
2663975 all 1800flowers com associates are instructed that any misuse of company systems or equipment for personal purposes is potential grounds for dismissal
2663976 it looks like it was designed so it must have been
2663977 and the eye is an organ which can be produced like this just like all organs in every organism
2663978 with the exception of the cross burning episode i believe john freshwater is teaching the values of the parents
2663979 how would you feel if nice folks starting ranting against
2663980 and no im not joking you know im right thats why you didnt answer if we used to be monkies we should be able to talk monkey
2663981 if evolution was true they would be able to fly by now or talk or grow fur or invent things
2663982 the devil tricked you into believing you are from mud to take you away from god
2663983 if you just stop thinking the bible makes sense and you dont have to worry about anything if you just stop trying to find things out and accept gods word jesus will forgive you
2663984 how could a monkey become a person over billions of years when they dont live that long
2663985 i dont know any science or anything and even i know evolution isnt real
2663986 i will pray to god asking him to make you think like me
2663987 if you just stop thinking the bible makes sense and you dont have to worry about anything
2663988 three how could a monkey become a person over billions of years when they dont live that long
2663989 if there is any science that makes it look like evolution is real then it has to be either a hoax by evilutionists or put there by god to find out who believes in him
2663990 i will pray to god asking him to make you think like me
2663991 i saw on your blog that you like to talk about the religion of evolution and trick people by using big words and pretending that science actually proves evolution
2663992 i dont know any science or anything and even i know evolution isnt real
2663993 for one it isnt in the bible the bible said god made everything in 6 days not millions of years
2663994 second when we go to the zoo we cant talk to monkies if we used to be monkies why cant we talk to them
2663995 three how could a monkey become a person over billions of years when they dont live that long
2663996 and why are there still monkies if they turned into people
2663997 five even darwin said he was wrong on his death bed he converted to christianity and said evolution was a hoax
2663998 how i wish i had not expressed my theory of evolution as i have done
2663999 would like to speak to them of christ jesus and his salvation being in a state where he was eagerly savoring the heavenly anticipation of bliss
2664000 lady hopes account of my fathers views on religion is quite untrue i have publicly accused her of falsehood but have not seen any reply
2664001 i was present at his deathbed lady hope was not present during his last illness or any illness i believe he never even saw her but in any case she had no influence over him in any department of thought or belief he never recanted any of his scientific views either then or earlier we think the story of his conversion was fabricated in the u s a the whole story has no foundation whatever
2664002 if there is any science that makes it look like evolution is real then it has to be either a hoax by evilutionists or put there by god to find out who believes in him
2664003 i hope that after reading my questions you will see that evolution cant be true and people dont come from monkies
2664004 i will pray to god asking him to make you think like me
2664005 second when we go to the zoo we cant talk to monkies if we used to be monkies why cant we talk to them
2664006 are they muslims cutting open their childrens heads because of religion yes
2664007 i was saying why have you chosen an ethnic group to compare them not another religious group
2664008 what are you trying to say maybe islam is stupid but jews arent
2664009 youre assuming that nobel prize acquisition in the 20th century can be equated to scientific achievement by a group of people over more than ten centuries of existence
2664010 these are not a proper comparison either you compare arabs to jews or followers of islam to followers of judaism to get a proper comparison
2664011 oh right ok then if you are going to do a comparison you do have to base it on religion
2664012 maybe you should look into the groups of people with the most prejudice i am sure atheists would be up there
2664013 maybe you should look into the groups of people with the most prejudice i am sure atheists would be up there
2664014 ill be honest with you i dont fully understand how one would rather believe that there isnt god than believe there is one
2664015 if you dont believe in god what is stopping you from killing someone
2664016 dont use racist words when youre talking to me please the sun does orbit the earth and if you have any proof to the contrary any documentable video evidence i would gladly look at it i dont want any sci fi 3d presentations though
2664017 if i can go to palestine and sacrifice myself i would do it why not sacrificing myself for palestine is a noble cause it is the straight way to pleasing my god and i would do it if i had the opportunity
2664018 people who put plastic trash in a barrel and burn it are releasing more dioxins than any single industrial complex
2664019 i hate my life please help me i am going crazy right now
2664020 we got her away from him before it got worse
2664021 shell live with this for the rest of her life but we got her away from him
2664022 the thing i dont want is for this to go to trial and a jury to give him probation
2664023 the settlement gave those children a sense of security that could not be guaranteed if they had to sit across from him in the courtroom and testify before a jury
2664024 si je pouvais revenir avec une m daille je serais extr mement contente

2664034 come down joe theres nothing sinister about yasirs construction company
2664035 can a moslem book a one way ticket these days without someone having to call their supervisor
2664036 yasir i had a brainstorm we can use the laundry room to wash and clean the dead bodies
2664037 why dont we just log on to the moonsighting com and let the starvation begin
2664038 why dont we do what christians do pick a month and stick to it i mean whats wrong with december shoreter days for fasting and way way better shopping
2664039 my point is this wine gums rye bread liquor ish western trap is trying to seduce moslems to drink alcohol
2664040 his sermon is going to drive me to drink alcohol
2664041 desperate housewives why desperate when they are just doing their womenly duties
2664042 i found your profile and liked what i read to say the least i am interested i was wondering if you would be interested in chatting with me sometime i am a 33 year old drama free divorced guy i have been in the swinging lifestyle a number of years
2664043 what could we say that just might make your head turn our way
2664044 i think you are absolutely beautiful do you happen to be irish and indian
2664045 id like to chat with you sometime if your interested im a nice guy just would like to have a friends w benefits type of thing not looking for anything serious im a professional work in the electronics field not just any wacko off the street lol
2664046 what going on tired of the same old stuff so how is your summer going
2664047 hey there im shawn im from south boston va im active army stationed at ft bragg nc i saw your profile and you seem like someone i can have a lot of fun getting to know and then who knows think you up for it
2664048 the girl from dead like me is here holy shit
2664049 hi um i was just in the trek casino with my sister and her friend and i lost her and she wont pick up her phone and i dont know what room she is staying in but i need to find her what can i do
2664050 im sorry i dont have any muths on file do you know her friends name
2664051 marty something i dont know the last name what do i do im worried about her
2664052 dont worry mam she probably just cant hear her cell phone ringing youll find her
2664053 the titans tale was needed so you could fully grasp the sway you hold in the universe souls dear maelduin essences are the key to it all human souls are revered in all the realms they are forever undying in the realms of the dead only to find their way back sometimes they find their way back to another sentient life sometimes they find their way back to the ethereal either way they always exist and always will the only other souls that can do that are the four eternal essences
2664054 you didnt get it maelduin it has always been you what you look like physically is just an image to those that can see you the real you your physical form is of no importance you are love the true essence of goodness and hope in the world yours is a life of valor of courage in the face of evil this is how it has always been and will continue to be
2664055 then why am i so devoted to my brother if he is hate shouldnt i want to stay away from him
2664056 i would say that you should but it would not be the truth
2664057 tag and nacht could well have been blessed with the essences of love and hate had two others been called into existence after they were born since there were no beings called to hold order and chaos they were not able to possess the essences instead the crystals were to be guarded by their first born child starz
2664058 born of the purest love and the most consuming lust starz was easily the most beautiful being in existence
2664059 the next children to be born of tag and nacht were of course myself and my sister lillith ill bet you can guess which essences we were supposed to possess
2664060 there was a prophecy stating that an ancient would bring out the essences through starz again propheteus omitted some vital information he never spoke of which ancient the prophecy spoke of many believed it was supposed to be each as the former bearer of love his kindness and compassion seemed a perfect match for starz having defeated the evil titans the ancients were sure that a spirit of love should be the one to father starzs children
2664061 i mean if we are the possessors of these essences we were born well before starz werent we
2664062 you still needed to be born into bodies lord valor
2664063 in part at the very least you have her eyes what you have more in common is a doting younger sibling wraith was easily starzs favorite they even share a mental link much like you and patrick but as far as physical appearance goes you do share many characteristics with your mother better her than your father
2664064 the beholder believed he was destined to bear children with starz
2664065 when wraith freed starz from the mask the essences were born into the world
2664066 once the world had advanced enough to allow the essences to be born to the world wraith consulted with styx about your physical appearance
2664067 the first to be born to the world were order and chaos you know them as vincent and valencia vincent has taken on the moniker of lord aggression and it is a fitting name though he can appear to be quite diplomatic even patient there are limits to his benevolence when the time comes that he feels the need to set things in order by violence there is little that can stand in his way your sister has no pseudonym as she has not been out discovering the world like vincent has she had remained within the borders of egypt for eons until called upon by vincent and cherub to assist them with a most upsetting task
2664068 unfortunately the world did not evolve as fast as wed hoped and the two of you spent much longer in the ethereal than expected releasing you from the bonds of the ethereal became more of a necessity than a choice being so different from the other souls being held in the ethereal love and hate were drawn only to each other this made your bond to one another stronger than ever before
2664069 but it is not the good in you nor the speck of evil that remains in your heart that makes you so very different from previous vessels
2664070 yet your aura has an essential component that ours lack you have your humanity that is what makes you immortal if and when the eternal essences pass on from you to another your immortality will remain your human self will prevail for eternity your human soul living on forever
2664071 only souls of silver defy time and death it is why any physical death you endure is only temporary that is unless your heart is removed as you well know
2664072 and has been well guarded for the duration you are able to leave haven any time after your body has healed i apologize for not telling you sooner but we did have a lot to discuss and it wouldve been a shame had you decided to leave before we were done
2664073 when you wake up the splendor of haven will be behind you i cannot guarantee that you will wake up in your body as styx may interrupt your passage but you will live again soon and you will awaken to a new life with new purpose
2664074 i know you must hunt down the vile titan pak and capture him do not let your brothers heart be your only goal it is vital that pak not be allowed passage back to haedes capture him and prove your valor
2664075 ive already been to haven i dont think i need any more judgments do you
2664076 im not going to judge you silly boy i just wanted to meet you
2664077 i most certainly can youll just know im lying thats never stopped me before
2664078 so why am i here i already know what you told to patrick is there something you missed last time
2664079 just anxious to get back christi lona said ive been dead for centuries
2664080 a bit i guess im not used to the way time works around here
2664081 it takes some getting used to for most people personally i dont have a problem with it
2664082 she told me you were fond of me and my siblings
2664083 she may have i mean she mentioned that you well
2664084 no maelduin did you think i was or did you believe i was
2664085 i thought you were mad i didnt believe you would hurt me though
2664086 simple i know i shouldnt go after pak i know bringing patrick back to life will probably be a problem that is unless he can still be saved from damnation as i believe he can
2664087 what do you believe will be behind these doors right now
2664088 but what if those doors told you where youll end up later after youve walked the planet as a deity for a while would you still know
2664089 patrick knew only he decided to go back to you and not open a door
2664090 so what do you believe is behind the doors for you young lord valor is it haven
2664091 anything else or anyone else remember patricks fate is tied to yours haven for you means haedes for him
2664092 but i believe and if im wrong so be it but if im right and he can be with me and haven still wont accept us together then i guess we become your problem
2664093 well done and i look forward to the latter so do you want to open the door
2664094 yes it may take 20 minutes to get to your car but have you seen how long the lines are at the disney counter service restaurants during the lunchtime and suppertime hours
2664095 if we leave disney we dont have to stand in line at a counter hunt around for a free table that turns out to be sticky or get stuck with a table in the strong sunshine after a day or two of disney a change of scenery and different food is just what i need
2664096 shifting the attention from her outer self to her inner self
2664097 seldom will we experience a finer day in early august
2664098 it is ridiculously nice out for a d c august
2664099 we should have paid more attention when we started to have suspicion that something just wasnt right
2664100 what happens if some it comes into our real life
2664101 it is better to trust in the lord than to put confidence in man
2664102 if any man teach otherwise and consent not to wholesome words even the words of our lord jesus christ and to the doctrine which is according to godliness he is proud
2664103 for the new evangelization to be effective it is essential to have a deep understanding of the culture of our time in which the social communications media are most influential knowledge and use of the media is indispensable

2664109 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware

2664113 memberikan pesan yang kuat mengenai pertimbangan moral ioc bahwa kasus ini telah membawa citra buruk bagi olimpiade
2664114 ada banyak peristiwa yang terjadi dalam kasus ini semuanya berujung pada apa yang disebut ioc sebagai cerita skandal
2664115 taking in my opponents performances is a little like watching a big summer blockbuster and an hour in realizing that all the best scenes were in the trailer you saw last fall
2664116 you make me forget all about iraq something laura cant do

2664120 when i feel poverty i will think of wealth to come
2664121 when i feel incompetent i will think of past success
2664122 the path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the inequities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men blessed is he who in the name of charity and good will shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness for he is truly his brothers keeper and the finder of lost children and i will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who attempt to poison and destroy my brothers and you will know my name is the lord when i lay my vengeance upon you
2664123 never take your own revenge beloved but leave room for the wrath of god for it is written
2664124 this is definitely the best built the most intimate the seats come a lot lower and its great to play in
2664125 the commentator is the same as the one in the tournament in austria in klagenfurt
2664126 i n an efficient market at any point in time the actual price of a security will be a good estimate of its intrinsic value
2664127 stop crying youre making me so worried whats wrong with father
2664128 lists of thousands of books that have been neglected overlooked forgotten or stranded by changing tides in critical or popular taste
2664129 lethal weapon is going green both mel and danny will take back roles and script is fabulous
2664130 the research on the use of such technology shows that when it is well designed it can actually be better than teaching even by the best teachers
2664131 robots cant teach the only effective teaching is by breathing living teachers who can look a pupil in the eye and respond to them
2664132 use phonic knowledge to write simple words and make phonetically plausible attempts at more complex words
2664133 of course children might take to it but that does not necessarily mean its good for them three year olds should not be doing phonics they should do whats normal in nurseries singing rhyming and playing
2664134 stealing from the rich is a moral duty not a crime
2664135 yes we have freedom and democracy but you have to live under tyrannical governments
2664136 say to them we believe what you believe your god and our god is one
2664137 tournament style vote off day 6 nfl qbs up now a smith vs b cryole pick the winner
2664138 there are enough untied loose ends in the hoax storyline to leave open the possibility that the hoax is itself a hoax meaning the story has now entered a confusing phase where one must carefully sift the professed deceptions from the real deceptions and hard facts from intentional distortions
2664139 the moviemakers never come out and say on their website or blog that they actually made the monster they only imply it perhaps they are having a bit of fun there is no proof that darren and rachel goldberg are related only a statement on darren goldbergs blog which could be a joke
2664140 i do find it a little strange that someone who as far as we know isnt apart of any scientific group would even think of moving a carcass

2664143 los corredores pasamos buena parte de nuestro tiempo libre intentando ser tambi n los mejores en nuestros v deo juegos favoritos
2664144 a veces nuestras dedos se cansan m s de lo que se cansan nuestras piernas en las carreras reales
2664145 tienes que atraer a los espectadores j venes si quieres seguir haciendo dinero con los juegos ol mpicos y para ello hay que incluir deportes no tradicionales
2664146 i like alcohol better because pot makes me feel really kind of stupid i like to be in control of my thoughts vodka sharpens my skills i have a drink and i can take a test
2664147 we are seeing a lot of europeans the dollar is weak the euro is strong this is a beautiful area to bike
2664148 no state has the right to intervene militarily in the territory of another state simply because there are individuals there with a passport issued by that state or who are nationals of the state
2664149 attempts to apply such a doctrine have plunged europe into war in the past and we have reason to remember how hitler used this very doctrine little more than half a century ago to undermine and attack substantial parts of central europe
2664150 shankar are you still in office i am just driving down just outside your office i wanted to drop in if you dont mind

2664157 i believe in both god and telepathy i wanted to come to you with all these i was too pleased to know that god came to know of my problems and sent you here
2664158 i came here just to discuss this and i am surprised you have this already on the table

2664160 the balance 204 sq ft could be for common areas like corridors
2664161 but the corridor here for the entire floor is only 200 sq ft and there are four more flats in the same floor to share
2664162 then you should have talked to them properly before agreeing to pay
2664163 i did but the builder was so sure of our purchase
2664164 he told me your wife has liked the plan and approved the design let us build it that way we are close to all amenities and places of worship if for some reason you do not like it you can consult your wife and sell it off if you want we will buy it back
2664165 both of you together tell me what i can do for you
2664166 it is not for any orders we just wanted to consult you on civil engineering
2664167 i have put it into grinder for the masala dosa batter long back
2664168 now tell me the area of this flat which i am buying
2664169 forget about that add it from the design and tell me
2664170 now what is your problem let me know in short
2664171 that 760 sq ft is you added up is called plinth area if you had asked the price in plinth area he would have told a much higher price usually we engineers calculate the constructed area of the whole of the building and distribute it floor wise further distribute it flat wise since you are part owner of the building you have to pay accordingly
2664172 whether it is correct or not you have paid and thats it you will get a flat which is to the liking of your wife and you are fortunate i spent almost the price of another flat to make my flat to the liking of my wife
2664173 my doubt is that this matter will come up again if we want to sell the flat
2664174 not at all you are going to sell the flat with this same design and this same document people only check whether their wives liked the flat nobody will check the measurements like you did even if they check they will keep quiet once their wife says she has liked it worse come worst may be they will bargain for the price
2664175 you decide its your property and bargaining for the price is part and parcel of any deal
2664176 i will not leave it here i will go to the builder again
2664177 i want to buy a flat in the same building
2664178 your wife has explained your deal in such a nice manner that my wife wants a flat there at any cost
2664179 i will advise you to negotiate in terms of plinth area at least you will save a lot of time headache and future arguments at home
2664180 do not tell me stories come down with the family
2664181 today garbage is more important for me than you i will try to get back as soon as possible
2664182 please no cricket i hate cricket i hate our cricketers they do not win do not allow others to play
2664183 for three reasons i have no time its quite expensive and i do not enjoy them
2664184 i can understand the first two but dont tell me you can not enjoy tell me you want to see only english movies i can understand all those indians abroad want to show that they are modern
2664185 look at me look at yourself your dress it is not us who want to be like westerners you guys in india want to be so
2664186 tell me what i told is true isnt it that is the truth and sach hamesha kadvaa lagtha hai haina
2664187 given a chance i would rather watch an english movie
2664188 there is quality they use the best of the technology equipments and locations the best of the actors will be hired you feel that its happening right in front of your eyes what is there in hindi cinema same old stories hero and heroine singing in park in beach in goa in srinagar trouble in getting married fights and then finally happy ending mostly all copied from hollywood
2664189 uncle i do not know which time you are referring to probably you are assuming that the things are same as you saw two decades back when you left india you have not seen the recent movies things have changed long back do you know these days the movies made in hindi are copied by others celebrated hollywood actors are longing to act in hindi movies do you know hollywood directors are begging our hindi actors like amitabh aishvarya and shilpa shetty to act in their movies
2664190 hollywood people want to get into bollywood because they want to capture huge indian market they want to use a few indians so that our film crazy people flock to the theatres
2664191 exactly they want our people to see english movies they want hindi movie industry to suffer but we indians should not allow that to happen
2664192 i agree on that point but hindi film industry has to improve further if it wants to take on hollywood
2664193 uncle i would like to show you how things have improved tell my mom that you want to take me for the movie chak de india in the afternoon she will say no first but you insist i hope she will agree and we can have a nice time
2664194 do not concentrate on it change the focus keep a book in toilet and start reading you will find it easier that way
2664195 i am calling from xyz bank can i have five minutes of your time sir
2664196 but sir i think i have answer for some of such problems give me two minutes
2664197 i am sorry i am expecting an important call call me later on in the evening
2664198 sorry i did not call you earlier are you ready we will be there to pick you up in two minutes wait near the main gate of your building
2664199 sir i did not know otherwise even i would have dressed like this
2664200 its ok my dress suits the person we are meeting when i introduce a well dressed person like you as my assistant it shows my status
2664201 so you are here to consult me on your promotion
2664202 and you want to know whether it is safe to accept the new position
2664203 so far i was in charge of our operations within the country
2664204 but you have to take some precautions before accepting the position ensure you assume the charge on a clean slate all the misdeeds of the previous director should be cleared up even remote chances of failure are written off straightaway otherwise next year it will be counted as your non performance and your failure
2664205 but swami that way my whole company portfolio could be wiped off the company is already into trouble because of sub prime losses
2664206 see to it that you put one of your trusted men here and make sure that your performance here is not unduly checked and reported this will help you in the future
2664207 he was a management consultant earlier but the returns in this profession lured him here
2664208 even before we met swami i had you in my mind as my replacement now that swami guided me on this i will recommend your name
2664209 he told to put somebody here who is my man who else can protect my interests here more than you
2664210 but we will also request to write off all those losses as swami told this is a chance to clear all those
2664211 no no that will spoil my reputation my hr files let it be there write them off slowly in the next few years
2664212 but that will spoil my hr files and will ruin my promotion chances
2664213 you dont understand now i am in a position just to recommend you dont forget i would be moving to a position where i would be approving your promotion
2664214 good evening sir i am calling from xyz bank you had told me to call in the evening
2664215 yes i remember you i am free now tell me
2664216 sir i would like to suggest an investment option which would secure the interests of your entire family i told your wife about this and she showed great interest in it she has told me that you will be at home by 8pm i want to come and meet you both would 8 30pm be fine
2664217 well if my wife has shown interest and invited you you can come by all means
2664218 she has convinced my wife as well that is great
2664219 today is a great day and i will invest in your scheme
2664220 i still have no money but i think we can withdraw the deposit we made with the lady who had come with a red color low cut blouse
2664221 thats still not one year and there is heavy deduction on premature withdrawal before one year
2664222 how about that deposit which we put with that lady with jeans and sleeveless t shirt
2664223 that is the only deposit we have which yields above 8 return when calculated over a period of five years
2664224 come on we will take it out and give this lady or that deposit held by the bank of that girl who always wears dangerously low jeans
2664225 leave your telephone number with me we have to cancel some other investment and then only we can invest in your plan i will give you a call when we are ready
2664226 thank you madam i will keep calling you to remind you for this sir
2664227 the entire home including my table looks surprisingly clean who did the great job
2664228 mama brought a new broom and we all tried it out in turns it was great fun
2664229 they want us to join them for dinner this week end
2664230 i told her to ask her husband to call and find out your convenience
2664231 that was also nice but that was adai aviyal with north indian flavor
2664232 tell her that i am free to come and willing to come provided she makes adai aviyal dish
2664233 no way i am going to tell her that i have put a word to you and you told me that you have a meeting let her husband call you and when he calls you tell him that you are busy in the first instance i know he would insist you to some how make it then slowly agree to make some adjustments to be there by say 8 30 pm
2664234 ok ok but are you very sure that he will call me
2664235 i am sure they will not leave you they want your guidance
2664236 suma has been asked by a magazine to write some article so she wants your guidance
2664237 i do not know i will enquire and tell you yes your apprehension is right i will tell her that it is not worth wasting time discussing and modifying the article if it is some small time magazine
2664238 no problem we will go there discuss the article finalize have food and come back
2664239 oh you mean documents let me find out for you sir are they important documents
2664240 they are important for me but not very sure how important for the receiver
2664241 no problem sir we will insure i will get back to you sir
2664242 the souvenir is likely to get to the hands of thousands that is why she is so nervous
2664243 you should help me out in this test of time sir
2664244 ok what you have thought on which subject you will write
2664245 that is a problem sir the president secretary treasurer committee members all have decided to write on some subject matter or the other and they have exhausted all
2664246 nothing like that you could still get one subject and you can write an interesting article on that in such a way the readers will enjoy
2664247 i know sir that is why we called you for guidance
2664248 may be fashion career divorce single mother extra marital lesbian gay
2664249 the matter is going all around the place we will eat and continue discussion after that
2664250 suma the article will be your article you have to think write and finalize i will only see the final draft and suggest improvements
2664251 no sir thats too far you will give me the idea i will think over it and write it you will correct it afterwards then i will translate it to tamil
2664252 one should write on some thing which one knows very well
2664253 husband and wife pulling each others leg is not a bad idea at all it can make a good subject with a lot of potential
2664254 to me that looks to be the easiest one if my husband can do it every now and then i am sure you could do it as well if required i can assist you in this
2664255 she did not give i planned it nicely and took it from her
2664256 she tried to write that article but could not get it right i offered her any article of her choice from that cupboard of yours in exchange for this recipe
2664257 you do not know her we were great friends in college then she took up fashion designing she is a professional fashion designer now she was stitching all my clothes before my marriage
2664258 she is your friend and also your tailor ok what does she want now
2664259 she is one of the top dress designers of chennai do you know that jayalalithaa and khushboo are her customers
2664260 what jayalalitha i have never seen her in any dress other than a 15 metre sari moreover she is up with that bullet proof jacket i have not seen the color of her blouse as well
2664261 ok ok i accept she is a big dress designer and she called you now tell me what she said
2664262 she is having a fashion show here in dubai and she has invited me to be present at this special occasion
2664263 of course she will send complimentary passes definitely two if you want more for your friends tell me sufficiently early so that i can try
2664264 no no two is enough may be one also is enough i can drop you there and go to the dentist yesterday also that tooth ache recurred
2664265 no way i have told her that we will be with her till the show is over she should not feel that we did not support her in a place like
2664266 come on darling she has a show organized here she must be know someone to do that
2664267 no way she is not of that sort i have told her we will be there and thats it
2664268 no way what do you think the show is already sold out if they want to buy tickets i can go out of the way and help them
2664269 send the children to school i need to go to the beautician
2664270 may be i will be late to pick you up you better come by school bus
2664271 dont worry mama has told us to come by bus and get down at rahuls place
2664272 the fashion show preparations are too hectic i heard three bollywood actresses are participating
2664273 come on dont act too ignorant that designer lady took your wifes name and thanked her at the press conference
2664274 may be i was not aware they were best friends in college
2664275 but these were stitched ten years ago or more naturally wont fit now why you want those old ones
2664276 she may feel bad if i do not wear a dress designed by her thats why i am altering this to make it a little loose here
2664277 its already 5 30pm and you want to be there by 6pm
2664278 change your dress i will be there in a minute
2664279 bring it here i will open it and increase the waist
2664280 iron this area and get ready i will be ready in flat sixty seconds
2664281 there is no further room try a big breath out and pull your stomach in
2664282 you dont understand everybody looks fashionable there only you there will be dressed like a joker
2664283 if somebody asks you questions like what does fashion mean to you do not give some dumb answers in front of the camera remember three is idea imagination and individuality
2664284 do not stare at the girls throughout from one end to the other end of the ramp just look at them once and thats it
2664285 i cant even get up it is torn all the way along the old stitch
2664286 slowly nobody should come to know take it off casually hand it over to me majestically i will wear it slowly so that nobody gets any hint
2664287 it was nice but paying that money i was expecting to see a wardrobe malfunction
2664288 in fact there was one but the lady was quick to cover it up so it went unnoticed
2664289 darling i have a surprise for you a life time opportunity
2664290 dhs 1000 tickets we will be sitting on the vip lounge its an international match
2664291 sports channel is covering it live we could be seen on tv in 170 odd countries all over the world
2664292 ok if you are not interested i will call shashidhar my goan friend i do not want this dhs 1000 ticket to go waste
2664293 ok so you are not coming then came a slow voice
2664294 anything should be fine dress up fast we need to be there by 7 pm it is already 4 pm
2664295 may be they will flash the camera once in a while on the public anything will do dress up neatly and we should start in half an hours time consider the traffic
2664296 you are always like this never give me chance to dress up or make up and look good
2664297 jyoti says saree wont look nice it does not look international how about trousers and t shirt
2664298 the match is for one and half hours by the time you consult all your friends and get ready it will get over
2664299 sheela was telling that if it was from a distance the flower design on my t shirt might not be seen on tv
2664300 we are physically going there to see the match live why you want to see the recording again
2664301 use your brains i want to see how we looked there in vip lounge
2664302 medha was telling me they would focus the tv camera on the spectators soon after the goal is scored
2664303 dont worry maam he is acting as if he is in pain just to get a penalty shootout
2664304 that was a mistake he should be given at least a yellow card
2664305 two yellows mean one red and red means no further part in the game
2664306 now go and tell him that we are here he will show us more on tv
2664307 he is the coach if these boys do not win his job is at stake he will be kicked around after the match that is why he is trying his best
2664308 may be since both fell on the ground punishment is waived
2664309 mr tanti knew the window was open so he charged like crazy
2664310 the product issues notwithstanding we dont expect any major impact upon our sales
2664311 the ground here in indias fertile breadbasket is beginning to look like swiss cheese
2664312 the concept of quality used to be that if it works somehow its okay but it doesnt need to work all the time
2664313 corruption is the grease that makes the wheels of indian business turn
2664314 perhaps only a third of indian manufacturing deserves these plaudits
2664315 going into the ready room i started getting these kind of chills up and down my body
2664316 i wasnt comfortable after the first 200 with everybody so close together
2664317 thats not usually how it is it made my breaststroke a lot stronger
2664318 hoffen wir da die vernunft der wille zum frieden und zum verhandeln ber die waffen siegt
2664319 there was a definite influence on the girls to feel emotional and tired and this may be taken as a disadvantage for them to compete at this hour
2664320 it was a difficult competition maybe the judging was a bit severe its the first rotation so maybe they want to judge everything a bit harsher
2664321 im tense about it because ill be lying awake worrying about it all night ill be very tired by the morning
2664322 it is a very bad decision for athletes as we seldom had any intense training in the mornings before
2664323 there was a definite influence on the girls to feel emotional and tired and this may be taken as a disadvantage to them to compete at this hour
2664324 taking a goal off china would have been difficult today
2664325 for us we want to play with other team and gain experience
2664326 dieu est universel dieu est amour et aucun etat aucun homme ou aucune femme ne devrait avoir peur de lamour de la religion
2664327 si jai pris du ventre cest uniquement parce quil marrive de boire une bi re
2664328 kan s lja ett bilvrak till n stan vem som helst
2664329 what you would have been doing if you had not taken up acting
2664330 i would have been selling milk in roadside booth in allahabad
2664331 would you like to see me act in a drama again
2664332 why not both of us acted in school we acted in college as well you were my permanent villain then of course you concentrated on studies but i still tried acting even in mumbai where i went after finishing the college i was trying my luck my brother was searching for a job for me and i was trying to impress the gate keeper at rk studios to let me in
2664333 i know i know and then your brother packed you off to dubai
2664334 but the artist in me has still not died i got an opportunity and i am on stage again
2664335 even i do such acting at home occasionally the hall is your stage and your wife is your audience
2664336 its not a joke i am serious there is a group in industrial area iii they are staging a comedy and they have offered me a small role
2664337 there is a start for everything i followed it up with my contact talked to them and got this opportunities come to doorstep only for the lucky ones you and i will have to go everywhere searching for that
2664338 tell me whether you are free in the afternoon we will go there today is the final rehearsal drama is next friday
2664339 ok ok i will check with my wife for any commitments and give you a call soon
2664340 i am going to explore a chance to act in dramas
2664341 you have a good physique but that is not all you need to express yourself all these years i have not seen you express emotions you could neither shout at the watchman when the car tyre was stolen nor you could shout at your son when he got grade c in all his papers
2664342 i did not because i knew there is no use
2664343 you could not cry in front of the landlord when he increased rent
2664344 you think he would have reduced if i had cried in front of him
2664345 forget all these you have not come out with a few catchy dialogues expressing your love to me
2664346 that is no problem in drama there would be ready made dialogues one needs to only deliver them i have done so during college days
2664347 i have not seen you act at all even in real life give me one instance where you actually acted
2664348 you have seen me as a happy contented man all the way havent you part of it was acting
2664349 ok ok i am all the more interested to see you act its better than sitting all through out in front of the computer and typing wish you all the best
2664350 do you remember any dialogue in any old drama you acted may be they will ask you to act and show your skill
2664351 do not worry i will tell some cinema dialogues like are o samba kitne aadmi the
2664352 that is too common and where is the chance to prove you there whatever you say will be well below amjad khan
2664353 relax this is not an interview to prepare and deliver i will just tell them that i had acted during college days
2664354 by the size of the beard i thought he is the director
2664355 he too is a good actor and wants to join us in our plays
2664356 we appreciate your interest but you are late we have already allocated all important roles with all difficulty we could accommodate sridhar with a small role
2664357 see this drama of ours we want to be number one in this region we need more actors for our future plays be in touch we need actors like you
2664358 a small role told the director because i was the last to join
2664359 without knowing when your role comes up how long we will wait ask the director to finish your scene so that we can go home
2664360 be patient honor the basics we need to wait till our role comes up remember this is the final rehearsal
2664361 there is nothing wrong in asking the director what is your role and the scene number in which you get to go to the stage
2664362 what happened any problem did he get angry with you or you are angry
2664363 nothing of that sort the director told i need not wait for rehearsal he is sure of my capacity to act and it is a small role he has asked me to come on the day of drama
2664364 where is your dialogue you need to know them by heart
2664365 yes i told this to the director but he said it is only one line dialogue and two scene appearances he will explain it on the day of the drama he asked me to come at 4 30 on the day of drama when the director told he has full confidence in me not to worry i could not ask any more questions
2664366 what ever it is let us take this as an introduction this will help us to know the people
2664367 i am already here the show is at 6 pm you bring my wife and kids along with your family do not buy tickets my wife has tickets for both of you each of us had to sell five tickets minimum
2664368 its that of a postman i am upset i would have avoided this if the director had told this to me in advance but now i am doing this for the sake of commitment
2664369 a true actor should not turn away from doing any role
2664370 if you do not give my commission i will tell your father that five hundred rupees pension is coming regularly and your son is grabbing it
2664371 he was dancing all the way for this role i can not believe this
2664372 i am coming back with you let him enjoy their company till the end and come back at his convenience
2664373 we need to go that director he has called me to come today
2664374 i am not interested to act anymore with him he was not fair with you
2664375 even i am not interested to act with him anymore
2664376 you are not interested to act then why you are going there
2664377 adorning that postman role i had given five hundred dirham of my money to him five dirham he returned on the stage itself as my commission he is yet to return the balance 495 he is avoiding me since then he has promised me to repay that today i understand he owes a lot of money to other actors too if he is not giving it today i do not know what i will do to him i want you to be by my side as my bodyguard
2664378 look i met a gentleman he wants the school to be named after his father just because he is willing to bear the cost of one class room
2664379 when you come next time sir you see a lot of improvement here we are committed to make things happen here and you can take my word
2664380 three directors and the manager are involved the police are investigating we need to go to police station
2664381 i had just deposited rs 50 000 and that was the only transaction i did
2664382 all the directors are telling the same sir that is why it has gone for criminal case the manager and three directors are in judicial custody two more directors are absconding and the president has taken anticipatory bail one director has agreed to pay the loan standing in his name and you are the last one
2664383 but i did not take loans i was in dubai how i can take the loan from dubai
2664384 i know that you managed it in such a way i have the arrest warrant the court will decide the truth it is the registrar who has filed the case go to him agree for the installments and file a copy of the agreement here or else go to the court and get an anticipatory bail the choice is yours i am coming to your home with hand cuffs in two days
2664385 no other way out sir go to the registrars office and agree on installments if the case is decided in your favor you will get your money back
2664386 see all the four in the jail are just like you the president who as people say who did this has anticipatory bail the other director whose case is also similar to you has agreed to installments now you decide
2664387 need not be exact tell me a round figure it is alright
2664388 if there is a 34 reduction what could our savings be in a year
2664389 assume it to be 35 million how much it will improve our bottom line in terms of percentage
2664390 ravi what could be our improvement in bottom line if there is a 35 million to 40million reduction in expenses
2664391 our total expenses last year were 100 8 million sir 35 or 40 million reduction how possible sir
2664392 it will work wonders profits will jump from the current 12 percent to say 17 to 19 percent sir
2664393 i have a paper cutting from yesterdays news paper about a company in the
2664394 pat came the comment from sales manager smart he is how many times i had thought i should also be quick and produce dialogues like this and be considered as man with positive thinking
2664395 each one of you have to be true to your conscious and look into your respective departments and come out with suggestions as to where we can also cut expenses
2664396 but is there any clue where that company reduced expenses
2664397 the major areas are employee reduction reduced perks for staff and identification of unproductive expenses
2664398 everything else can wait i have something important to do
2664399 is the main reason please try to convince the management
2664400 better sir if you could convince management that we are only six in the dept and it is easier if they concentrate on departments with more than 10 people
2664401 may be the us company in fact had excess staff
2664402 try to retain the other staff sir otherwise it will be difficult
2664403 further reduction is only possible if they re organize the work so that part of our work will go to accounts dept and also some to administration dept
2664404 34 reduction is impossible in our dept unless they think of sending you off sir
2664405 dont worry they will not it is very difficult to measure efficiency you see
2664406 there should be at least 10 savings so that we can do something re do your homework and let me know i will do my own calculations as well
2664407 remove your attender instead of sitting in your cabin you can move the files here and there this way you will know which paper is on which table
2664408 moreover remember the doctor told you to reduce this will help you in weight reduction as well
2664409 what do you have my friends come on let me know
2664410 as per our assessment no further cut is possible sir but we are ready for any decisions you take sir
2664411 worst case i may sacrifice my attender sir but that wont give us any significant benefit it is up to you sir

2664418 does not know that we should put as big an amount as possible in the final invoice
2664419 no problem sir it goes i know that but this is easy
2664420 ok where are the invoices i asked looking at the accountant
2664421 some are given in duplicate to the customers some are probably with the delivery boys and some may be here
2664422 but how can you keep track of the payments received if you do not have the copies filed properly i raised my voice and questioned the accountant
2664423 dont look into all these give me a balance sheet and the bank manager has agreed to arrange for the facility they will come for discussion and that day we will show them the contracts we have signed and submit them the balance sheet thats it
2664424 but balance sheet on what basis and on which papers
2664425 not on the usual white paper get some executive bond dont worry i will pay for it

2664432 i am strong financially or weak the manager told he would decide on the balance sheet are you making it strong or weak
2664433 the manager was telling me i should be financially strong why the hell i need bank finance if i am financially strong i am in fact weak i need bank finance but the manager says if my balance sheet is weak he cant help it
2664434 see like this strong tea make a strong balance sheet the bank manager should like it
2664435 but i do not know why they want to finance me if i am already strong
2664436 now do not sit here smile all along i am depending on you i need the bank to finance me at any cost
2664437 ramphal do not worry i will get you bank finance now let me go
2664438 i am not sure but just trying to help him
2664439 i had borrowed the copy of balance sheet of excellent interiors i kept it somewhere here they had succeeded in getting bank facilities of usd 500 000 you could have copied the design with double measurements and usd 1 million would have been easy
2664440 it was a good twelve pages with a lot of figures
2664441 and sadiq he is the owner excellent interiors told me that the bank gave facilities just like this
2664442 forget it i am seasoned enough to manage without that do you have confidence in me

2664448 i have changed the company name year and doubled the figures everywhere they predominantly use cardboard plastic sheets screws and nails sir but we use plywood laminating sheets and gum i could not find where and how to make this change sir
2664449 i am sure you will be able to find and change it too sir i was shocked when you told me that the screw is to be screwed in not to be hammered in as a nail you were here for only half an hour and you understood things pretty well
2664450 when our fully developed educated beyond the high school level adults on cnn make such
2664451 we cannot let the chinese seize the olympic flame a symbol of piece without denouncing the dramatic situation of human rights in the country

2664456 the readings that we were looking at indicated that we have no cause for concern at this stage
2664457 it feels like youre at 3 000 metres because of the air you cannot breathe the air is thick and there is smog right now im just knackered
2664458 we seem to be stuck in a weather pattern that is bringing us high humidity and higher than normal temperatures but despite all this the air quality continues to remain in the satisfactory range that does not pose any threat to the athletes

2664465 the biggest challenge facing the cemeteries is the shift in the death care industry toward cremation
2664466 we dont check the material distributed by people we bring in for training
2664467 its a blatant lie that this was sponsored or endorsed by us the material was not discussed at all it was just in a packet that was handed out
2664468 were training them mostly on how we take care of a victim of a crime

2664470 our jewellery range consists of a select range of pearl earrings and bracelets i love the fact that pearls are such a precious gem and eastern cultures believe that pearls symbolise purity and innocence they are not a flashy jewel but one which is synonymous with style and grace and again they are something which can be purchased for christmas birthday or any other special occasion
2664471 and i never tire of seeking out great gifts for children alimrose designs offer a lovely range of soft classic dolls for little girls and our books are always a popular choice for gifts regardless of the age
2664472 people like the convenience of internet shopping as it makes a wide range of products more accessible particularly to people in remote areas we find a large percentage of our shopping base are from travellers in america or in the united kingdom who are looking to send a gift to their family back in australia
2664473 any time you get an opportunity to have a walkoff game winning hit those are some of the most exciting moments in your career stuff that you dont forget
2664474 im sure most every player remembers every single one of their walkoff hits it was special obviously being here and playing them
2664475 were not a power hitting club and weve got to execute
2664476 weve got to do little things but still you need the hits to win ballgames thats the brand of ball weve got to play
2664477 its a bit of a roller coaster of emotions for me just thinking about sitting behind the eight ball there and then just to see our guys battle out there off broxton its just huge
2664478 if you expect to do something special and play in october you just move on
2664479 science gives us the ages of rocks while religion gives us the rock of ages

2664482 to say that he slept with her but he wasnt in love with her thats not very chivalrous
2664483 i dont feel my questions have been answered with regard to edwards
2664484 when i met her she was bubbly and fresh and honest she was afraid of nothing
2664485 she was doing a lot of drugs at the time but so was i and everyone else
2664486 ive been in harness racing for 15 to 20 years but i got out of it for a while

2664488 i quit school when i was 14 and took a job caring for a 2 year old colt at the meadows
2664489 by the three quarter pole i felt pretty safe i didnt think they were making up any ground on me
2664490 theres a little something inside me that says either one could work
2664491 its really interesting when you look at the history of the u s open and you look at the history of the pga championship because it seems like the more difficult it is the better the more the americans show up
2664492 at the same time i think that when youve got a bunch of guys coming in playing well you want to give them a chance to play golf
2664493 not really playing golf as much as kind of just hanging in there
2664494 tell her to take all the sharp objects away from woody and let him know hes got three tournaments to go
2664495 this isnt ryder cup selection week we have three weeks to go i want a guy who is confident and if the guys confidence is shattered when he left here well join the club
2664496 the course is just really really hard its difficult to know what the strategy is i dont think its unfair but id agree there are some unfair situations you can get in for sure
2664497 i think playing the underdog role is not going to be an act
2664498 im not looking to motivate or inspirate those guys are already inspired

2664521 i feel like my backstroke i kind of went too hard and i paid for it at the end ive got to go back and look at video and correct it for the future
2664522 im glad that my first race is out of the way
2664523 i wanted to do better but i cant really complain about it i got third at the olympics so im just going to get focused for the rest of my races

2664541 the settlement gave those children a sense of security that could not be guaranteed if they had to sit across from him in the courtroom and testify before a jury

2664557 i walked up and asked him what he was doing
2664558 he said you and your muscleman dont scare me ill protect myself
2664559 that was what i was trying to do 50 years ago and the attorney general of texas stopped me
2664560 when he broke ground on jamaica beach he was only 30 years old a young man with a vision
2664561 it was something very unique when you look at the desolate barren island land then who could have envisioned all the communities on the west end and where they are at today he might have been a little ahead of his time
2664562 jamaica beach was my favorite project because i was so personally involved in it
2664563 the rich people had a second home but the middle class didnt
2664564 the first thing we had to do is convince people they needed a second home and then we had to convince them that jamaica beach is where they wanted to be
2664565 we had to decide what percentage of the mortgages would go bad and to which the holder would need to go through the exercise of making a claim on the underlying real estate then we had to decide what value was left in the real estate that covered it

2664583 i was depressed for a long time after the accident so it was incredible how it changed my life just being active again
2664584 i know that people just love to come to our meetings on thursday nights
2664585 its their night they love the workout and some of them come to the dinner afterward they love it because for many of them its their social event for the whole week
2664586 right after she won the essay contest she called me
2664587 the second i heard her voice i knew she had won
2664588 we knew we would have to bat well in the second innings
2664589 i think its even stevens now theres still a lot of hard work to do
2664590 the guys will be fighting to win because i still think we have the opportunity to win this test

2664633 anytime you can get to them early thats how you beat those guys
2664634 hes a guy who goes out there every day gives you 100 percent every day and is one of the leaders of this team emotionally and on the field
2664635 these last two games were probably my top two of the year so far
2664636 im tense about it because ill be lying awake worrying about it all night ill be very tired by the morning
2664637 it is a very bad decision for athletes as we seldom had any intense training in the mornings before
2664638 there was a definite influence on the girls to feel emotional and tired and this may be taken as a disadvantage to them to compete at this hour
2664639 there was a definite influence on the girls to feel emotional and tired and this may be taken as a disadvantage for them to compete at this hour
2664640 it was a difficult competition maybe the judging was a bit severe its the first rotation so maybe they want to judge everything a bit harsher
2664641 in last years performance we scored 11 goals in the first game and then we had no goals against
2664642 it was historical and unique and definitely its something that will be very difficult to repeat
2664643 nadine is one of the most important players in our team
2664644 she had proved herself last year she knows how to control the ball and she knows how to work in the box she is self motivated and she knows how to encourage the other players
2664645 actually i dont care if i allow goals or not
2664646 the most important thing is that my team wins my goal is to win the title not just to not allow goals i will be just as satisfied if they score four times but we win 5 4
2664647 it will keep us going in the tournament and give us a chance to win the gold medal
2664648 we are looking forward to beating teams that are in our division
2664649 the marlins are playing great with the team they have to be in a position that they are they play hard they come back they dont quit
2664650 any time you get young players they bring enthusiasm energy a kind of wide eyed look like christmas
2664651 its good that hes off to a good start had some success
2664652 thats a situation where your development people know better because theyve had the guy all year
2664653 we are always good in the medley because we make a hard training and a lot of training
2664654 we always always swim the four different strokes i dont why but we are a medley nation we try everything
2664655 i saw lochte was going slower and i tried to do everything to go better than phelps but i dont have too much power for that
2664656 anytime you think you get close to michael phelps he jumps to another level
2664657 im not so happy because if i beat phelps that would make me happiest
2664658 but if phelps is not going into the water ill try to catch his time
2664659 the 400 im field is getting stronger and stronger right now right now you need a 4 11 to qualify in the past only two or three guys could swim 4 10 i dont think it will be just lochte and i in the future
2664660 it looks a little different textured not really sure if that will scar or not
2664661 its called running as hard as you can and throwing yourself to the ground
2664662 theres nothing i can do anyway so ill just have to suck it up
2664663 it kind of defines what you want in an olympic trials

2664879 exorcism in islam consists of readings of the holy koran and invocations accompanied by holy water water over which the holy koran has been read
2664880 the exorcist voices his readings while the patient in front of him remains unrestrained the patient is a completely normal person except he has been exposed to aspects of possession which can often manifest physically or psychically
2664881 he can live normally go to work and study but occasionally he falls into a kind of hysteria where paranormal phenomena manifest including speaking in a voice other than his episodes of contractions and seizures demonstrations of abnormal strength telekinetic effects on near and distant objects
2664882 having recognized these signs which reveal a case of possession the person or his family introduces the patient to an exorcist who can attempt to help the patient
2664883 there are the other signs in the patient that the exorcist recognizes as those of possible possession migraines insomnia depression dreams of wolves dogs blood massacre or falling endlessly into a vacuum physical reports of awakening the night with visions feelings of a presence in the room or the bed skin lesions failure in work studies or marriage etc
2664884 these people can suffer from harassment by these djinns islamic demons who attack them with a specific goal and for a specific cause

2664893 saya sangat paham dan bersimpati terhadap perasaan mereka yang gagal melewati ujian nasional tapi di sisi lain ujian nasional itu sendiri bukan hanya ujian atas kecerdasan otak mereka tetapi sekaligus ujian untuk kecerdasan emosional mereka
2664894 thats when genius struck for klein a mother of three who lives in california she was tired of digging around for old check stubs and stray gum wrappers every time she wanted to give another mother her phone number suddenly she knew what she needed she needed business cards klein who designed her own cards and now sells them online isnt the only mom to have this revelation business cards for moms also called mommy cards and mommy calling cards
2664895 michalk says it was such a great idea she copied it and since then at least two of her friends have borrowed the idea and started handing out cards of their own
2664896 i wanted them to look like a moms she says
2664897 im ready to fight everybody everybody who deserves a shot
2664898 i didnt want to get into a brawl with him hes very very tough
2664899 cut a small slice off and soak it in water for a few hours
2664900 even better soak it in some liquid from a drinking coconut
2664901 check out majuro and some of the outer islands but ill be back
2664902 hanging out with a bunch of local kids kainoa murphy carla bigler and kaili kramer and snorkeling at eneko island one of the atolls small northern islands it was definitely the best snorkeling ive ever done
2664903 but you have to press on and by about three days out ill be back into the rhythm
2664904 i have to navigate around islands and then deal with torres strait which is pretty much the deadliest strait in the world plus therell be oil rigs and lots of shipping
2664905 i also have the phone numbers of people who gave me some equipment such as my raymarine chart plotter
2664906 but im hoping to make it to darwin in one leg
2664907 i really need to keep moving to get across the indian ocean in time
2664908 i was empty at the end just in terms of fuel i just havent had seven hour rides
2664909 the guy that i raced today wasnt the guy who won the tours so i dont put myself in that category
2664910 but it was great of him to come out and do this race and to race with all the people hes a class act out there it was fun we didnt talk a whole lot because it seemed like it was pretty much business
2664911 at the end i realized i was thoroughly cooked but i said i am having a good time
2664912 thats why i wanted to come out here i didnt expect to beat this guy so i just wanted have something out there to shoot for train for stay in shape for and it was a blast it really was
2664913 i wont come back unless im in shape and i feel like im in decent shape you cant show up to this race if youre not in shape so it just depends on how i train id love to be back
2664914 i dont know what happened its got to be flattened by now it was squishing all over
2664915 that was a product of lance and i being together
2664916 it was lances idea i would have never considered that
2664917 the culture in utah is very family oriented and its a family oriented play i think theres a lot of synergy between that and the mormon culture
2664918 its about whats human in us as opposed to any other identifying label
2664919 the story of fiddler resonates with a lot of people you dont have to be jewish to understand it
2664920 in directing a play one of the most important things is to figure out what the basis of the story is and for me the story is about a family
2664921 you could take that story and set it in 100 different cultures and it would still resonate
2664922 while there are a lot of divisions there are also a lot of commonalities
2664923 utah itself was largely founded because there was a people who were driven from their homes because of their religious beliefs
2664924 its such a great message about the traditions and the breaking of them
2664925 its definitely intimidating but being there is a good way for us to see other talented dancers and be inspired by other talented people
2664926 i had all these horrible feelings about playing and not being able to interface properly with my instrument
2664927 but by working with sandpaper files and his good knowledge lee can put the necessary curve on the mouthpiece to make it respond just right it seems so arcane but it is so necessary to making clarinetists happy
2664928 he has a beautiful sound and wonderful lyricism a clarinet player who is world class in every way
2664929 i know my response is kind of roundabout but this is where my thinking has been
2664930 most people think poster and its so much more than that its not really that at all
2664931 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2664932 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2664933 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2664934 all our lifetime we aspire to get the ultimate self fulfillment but if we get there the sense of life is gone the way itself is the aim life is like the probe for a theatre play that never happens
2664935 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2664936 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2664937 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2664938 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2664939 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2664964 they have to concentrate on competition but its very tough
2664965 we know it is the olympic games and all of us sportsmen want everything to be normal
2664966 here in a sporting context and theyve confirmed their participation very much in the light of respect friendship athlete to athlete we have no reason to have any concerns on that
2664967 when the war is in your country at such a time it is very difficult for them for all of us
2664968 we are trying to say hey lets have a truce for at least the olympic games so we bring some peace to the world even for two weeks the timing couldnt be worse war is not great at any time but to have it on the first day of the olympic competition was pretty bad timing
2664969 i see all the nations get together i am very upset about it i wish everybody would be at peace especially during the olympics
2664970 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue

2665001 it demonstrates at the very least that you cannot count on a military jury to throw the book at people
2665002 it doesnt demonstrate the wisdom of the process and it doesnt illustrate the fairness of the process
2665003 they understand chain of command and the relative roles of people and this guy was a nobody
2665004 it is really a question of how a military panel would view a four star generals driver he was a driver this is a decision consistent with their military training and understanding
2665005 we had a court we had a jury it was a military jury they heard the evidence they gave him five months
2665006 that ought to be his sentence either we believe in american justice or we dont

2665023 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
2665024 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
2665025 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
2665026 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
2665027 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
2665028 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
2665029 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
2665030 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
2665031 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
2665032 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
2665033 i get it already your crazy hair and genre definitive wardrobe show me how much cooler you are than me without you having to say a word now go pick your bastard up from school
2665034 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
2665035 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
2665036 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
2665037 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
2665038 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
2665039 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
2665040 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
2665041 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
2665042 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
2665043 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
2665044 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
2665045 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
2665046 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
2665047 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
2665048 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
2665049 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
2665050 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
2665051 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
2665052 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
2665053 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
2665054 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
2665055 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
2665056 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
2665057 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
2665058 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
2665059 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
2665060 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
2665061 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
2665062 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
2665063 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
2665064 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
2665065 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
2665066 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
2665067 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
2665068 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
2665069 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
2665070 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
2665071 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
2665072 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
2665073 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
2665074 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
2665075 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
2665076 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
2665077 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
2665078 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
2665079 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
2665080 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
2665081 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
2665082 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis

2665086 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
2665087 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
2665088 trucks have continued to wreck havoc and resulted in the deaths of many people the commissioner held this meeting with an intention to make delhis roads safer
2665089 most of the accidents take place in the night we have noticed that in most of the accidents involving trucks the drivers were found drunk
2665090 now our peacekeepers are waging a fierce battle with regular forces from the georgian army in the southern region of tskhinvali the provincial capital

2665104 but then i ran a couple of weeks ago so i was happy with the way it turned out
2665105 and i wanted to win to show the people of chambersburg that i was representing my country and turn around america
2665106 at that time we had a 10k pepsi challenge at wilson when tom died we changed it to a 5 mile run in his memory and brought it in to the marine corps since tom was a stanch marine there is a committee that runs it although john ausherman does most of the work it is funded by the entry fees sponsors and individuals who contribute with out all of this support we could never offer all that we do
2665107 people used to think i looked like the guy on the planters peanut can

2665168 and second are those price increases meeting the statutory requirement of severe harm to the economy and our conclusion is no
2665169 instead the misguided corn ethanol mandate is forcing farmers to plow up marginal land and wildlife habitat while increasing global warming and dumping toxic fertilizers and pesticides into our precious water sources
2665170 i am disappointed that the epa missed this opportunity to provide relief for american consumers who are dealing with skyrocketing food prices due to the unintended consequences of the continued escalation of the ethanol mandate

2665186 what weve found with miscanthus is that the amount of biomass generated each year would allow us to produce about 2 1 2 times the amount of ethanol we can produce per acre of corn
2665187 one of the criticisms of using any biomass as a biofuel source is it has been claimed that plants are not very efficient about 0 1 percent efficiency of conversion of sunlight into biomass
2665188 what we show here is on average miscanthus is in fact about 1 percent efficient so about 1 percent of sunlight ends up as biomass
2665189 dal punto di vista giuridico non solo del tutto fondato e legittimo ma anche necessario
2665190 le azioni georgiane in ossezia del sud sono un crimine ha affermato e innanzitutto un crimine contro il proprio popolo
2665191 malgrado le azioni criminali delle attuali autorit georgiane la russia ha sempre considerato con grande rispetto il popolo georgiano lha sempre visto come un popolo fratello e sar cos sono sicuro anche in futuro
2665192 ci sono ragioni politiche da secoli la russia una forza stabilizzatrice nellarea promotrice di sviluppo e progresso vi assicuro che sar cos anche in futuro
2665193 quello che sta avvenendo in quella regione e un genocidio
2665194 e al 100 unaggressione brutale e non provocata da parte delle forze russe
2665195 attualmente i civili le donne e i bambini sono in pericolo
2665196 la citt di tskhinvali non esiste pi i militari georgiani lhanno rasa al suolo
2665197 nessuno pu dire quanti altri morti si trovino sotto le macerie
2665198 due o tre ore fa ha riferito al telefono il portavoce del team georgiano a notte fonda a pechino erano passate le due la delegazione era pronta a lasciare i giochi tutti gli atleti erano determinati a rientrare a casa se ci fosse stato meglio per il paese
2665199 erano pronti ha aggiunto il portavoce a prendere questa difficile decisione per rinunciare al sogno di una vita a ci per cui hanno lottato tanto e far ritorno alle proprie case e alle proprie famiglie
2665200 ma ha aggiunto tchanisavili il presidente della georgia mikhail saakashvili ha inviato un messaggio per gli atleti in cui ha detto la situazione veramente difficile nel nostro paese ma per il bene degli atleti del paese dei georgiani e del futuro dello sport nel nostro paese meglio restare ai giochi e continuare a combattere per conquistare il maggior numero di medaglie possibili
2665201 abbiamo subito bombardamenti in diverse citt gori kareli poti senaki kutaisi bolnisi e marneuli i nostri spazi aerei sono stati ripetutamente violati dagli aerei militari della federazione russa e ora in atto unaggressione con un intervento militare a tutti gli effetti chiediamo alla comunit internazionale di intervenire per fare chiarezza e per chiedere spiegazioni alla russia per una intrusione nel territorio di uno stato sovrano inaccettabile e intollerabile nel 21esimo secolo
2665202 il messaggio di fratellanza lanciato ieri durante la cerimonia inaugurale dei giochi prenda la strada del caucaso e riporti la pace nella regione
2665203 what the president would like to do is to have validation for his failed policy
2665204 controlling weight with negative calorie foods is easy only once you get the hang of it
2665205 the first pick have to be a healthier lifestyle but medicine usage can be justified because fleshiness is a serious medical condition
2665206 the intent is not just to accomplish weight loss but to cut down wellness hazard factors all three drugs can have got good personal effects on those
2665207 selling anti obesity drugs over the counter will perpetuate the myth that fleshiness can be fixed simply by popping a pill and could further sabotage the attempts to advance healthy living which is the lone long term flight from obesity
2665208 globally fleshiness is spiralling out of control and will only be reined in by public wellness political campaigns that somehow carry people to eat less and exercising more
2665209 going into the ready room i started getting these kind of chills up and down my body

2665218 even though it was thrown on him he knows what to do
2665219 i pictured this exact moment but never from the viewpoint of being in the stands
2665220 sometimes you think things are going to be easy from the get go and theyre not
2665221 should i post that can i say that is this too far
2665222 i dont think i anticipated the emotion i would feel up there
2665223 to me its like a shark attack what are the chances its so random
2665224 im such an anxious player i go in there and go hard and i get myself in trouble

2665236 chinas first blogger it was just like a fairy story
2665237 the dichotomy between what olympics visitors will see and what residents experience
2665238 may be most visible in the stadiums once the games begin
2665239 political change however gradual and inconsistent has made china a significantly more open place for average people than it was a generation ago
2665240 the similarities between these two coming out parties are eye popping dissidents jailed social undesirables mainly poor migrant workers kicked out of town three rings of police checkpoints surrounding the city old buildings bulldozed security so overwhelming as to squeeze all the fun out of the party
2665241 today even the farmers in remote areas have satellite tvs
2665242 so whenever they see an election such as the one held in pakistan recently they may wonder why even though we have approximately the same economic conditions they can elect their top leaders and we cant even vote for the leader of a small county i think a consciousness of political rights has increased more than anything
2665243 we need perspective on this i was there during the cultural revolution and i watched people being carted away in the streets to be shot in the back of the neck about 3 million people died ive been back often since and each time there is a sort of incremental freedom though sometimes it moves backward
2665244 one of the reasons we were there was because tibetans could not be there in our place they were refused visas and would have faced harsher treatment
2665245 we have come here today to be a voice to those who are in prison because of their religious beliefs
2665246 with the media coverage around the world we are convinced the government will sit up and take heed certainly it was worth it the job is not done
2665247 your decision on these issues will determine the success the olympic games and the image the world will have of china in the future
2665248 for the sake of the overall situation to avoid bungling the games
2665249 weve raised concerns to the chinese in the past about human rights in general and about the falun gong in particular ill continue to do so
2665250 we speak out for a free press freedom of assembly and labour rights not to antagonise chinas leaders but because trusting its people with greater freedom is the only way for china to develop its full potential
2665251 we press for openness and justice not to impose our beliefs but to allow the chinese people to express theirs

2665256 wir gratulieren der omv dass sie sp t aber doch zur einsicht gekommen ist dass wir mit unserer einsch tzung der wettbewerbsproblematik von beginn an recht hatten die frage der verantwortung f r die ungl cklichen vorgangsweisen und den f r beide unternehmen verursachten schaden ist nicht unsere sache die kritik an der europ ischen kommission teilen wir nicht denn die wettbewerbsbeh rde hat absolut korrekte und professionelle arbeit geleistet
2665257 es hat sich nun eindeutig erwiesen dass wir mit unserer verteidigung richtig lagen und die interessen unserer aktion re gesch tzt haben die zahlreichen unberechtigten und exzessiven attacken seitens der omv und unseren erfolg im bernahmekampf haken wir ab
2665258 wir sind zuversichtlich dass es betreffend die 20 prozent der omv an mol zu einer f r beide seiten befriedigenden l sung kommen kann
2665259 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
2665260 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
2665261 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
2665262 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
2665263 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
2665264 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
2665265 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
2665266 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
2665267 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
2665268 i am honoured to be in association with disney not only through the extension of our original deal but also in breaking ground by creating a new superhero
2665269 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
2665270 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
2665271 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
2665272 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
2665273 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
2665274 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
2665275 they were so excited theyre rvers so they can go anywhere on the road find a computer go into the phoenix public library catalogue download a book and play it while they drive down the highway
2665276 we also know we are touching only a small percentage of each librarys patrons
2665277 its a like this nice secret that we of course dont want to be kept secret
2665278 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
2665279 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
2665280 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
2665281 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
2665282 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
2665283 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
2665284 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
2665285 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
2665286 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
2665287 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
2665288 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
2665289 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
2665290 who are open to doing something on the production side
2665291 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
2665292 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
2665293 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
2665294 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
2665295 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
2665296 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
2665297 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
2665298 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
2665299 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
2665300 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
2665301 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
2665302 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
2665303 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
2665304 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
2665305 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
2665306 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
2665307 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
2665308 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
2665309 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
2665310 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
2665311 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
2665312 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
2665313 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
2665314 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
2665315 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
2665316 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
2665317 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
2665318 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
2665319 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
2665320 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
2665321 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
2665322 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
2665323 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
2665324 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
2665325 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
2665326 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
2665327 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
2665328 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
2665329 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
2665330 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
2665331 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
2665332 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
2665333 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
2665334 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
2665335 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields

2665337 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
2665338 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
2665339 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
2665340 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
2665341 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
2665342 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
2665343 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
2665344 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
2665345 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
2665346 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
2665347 panasonics toughbook cf 29 comes closer to an indestructible notebook than anything weve seen
2665348 i know i have to cheer me up as i know i must set a model for my teammates after me i am happy i managed it well
2665349 its a great pity that he failed we had hoped she could bring home a gold medal on uneven bars
2665350 she failed in a movement which is not so difficult and that makes her failure even more regretful
2665351 i had been worried about our beam performance as its our first apparatus and also one easy to make mistakes but they did an excellent job
2665352 im satisfied and the team did not make big mistakes they did not fall during their routines its not their best they can do better and i hope they do their best in the final
2665353 we only had one fall on the beam from andreea acatrinei we have to accept it theres no solution i thought that would happen to her since shes a younger one on the team
2665354 there could be a signing tomorrow after the leaders have met to thrash out the remaining issues
2665355 they want an agreement for a process leading to the adoption of a new constitution one that was agreed to by the parties during last years negotiations but were saying this should be an issue for a national referendum
2665356 this has been a longstanding dispute there have been tensions between georgia and russia simmering for some time were obviously very concerned our starting point is that we respect georgias territorial sovereignty over south ossetia
2665357 we call on all the parties to immediately engage in a ceasefire and we urge all parties to commence the dialogue
2665358 with nuclear proliferation posing a greater threat along with weapons of mass destruction our unilateral policy of no first use necessitates that india possesses a credible and survivable nuclear deterrent including submarine launched
2665359 though it is an operational submarine akula will be basically used for training naval operators before they get to operate our indigenous nuclear powered submarine
2665360 leaders at the district level have been asked to provide dates suitable to them so that yadav can hold interactive sessions with local workers during the tour
2665361 we are expanding in a big way we are coming up with many projects in different cities for which land has already been acquired with an investment of about rs 3 000 crore
2665362 we will invest about rs 6 000 crore over the next four years on construction
2665363 jewel of india is an offering that will transform the retail segment of the country
2665364 with third generation guidelines in place in the telecom sector the business metrics of telecom players in india is all set to undergo a change
2665365 it would also act as a revenue generating tool for operators besides there would be increased services of internet on mobile phones
2665366 our main focus will be on brand communication and brand experience we will be investing around rs 360 crore in this
2665367 the priority will be on premium products for providing stylish designs and smart technologies to consumers
2665368 in the case of invisibility cloaks or shields the material would need to curve light waves completely around the object like a river flowing around a rock
2665369 market will be looking at us market and crude prices for its next direction there are no trigger in the domestic market as everything has been discounted
2665370 going forward commodity prices shall be correcting and thus inflation in most of the economies specially in emerging countries should start topping out slow down in commodities may also move funds to equities
2665371 the market is likely to go up this week and may witness a rally in the beginning as the market has already discounted all negative cues
2665372 work to isolate bjp which spearheads the communal forces and also oppose the congress which has been instrumental in forging a strategic alliance with the us and following neo liberal policies
2665373 see what will be the relation of the upa partners to the congress
2665374 assess the situation in other states and work out our tactics accordingly
2665375 we have to strongly attack the government for its failure to tackle price rise and inflation we must show how their policies contributed to price rise agrarian crisis and unemployment
2665376 how they are targeting minorities in states like gujarat rajasthan madhya pradesh orissa karnataka where they are in power
2665377 this medal is good for georgia especially during times like this
2665378 i am very nervous today its very difficult for my people
2665379 its very difficult for us as georgians because of everything thats going on at home
2665380 of course we went in the race as world record holders but we knew that especially america and australia would be fast and strong
2665381 so we just went in to explode in the water and see what results we get
2665382 it was great were really happy with our performance we came up with an australian record
2665383 third is nothing to be sneezed at im proud to be part of this team and get on the podium again

2665388 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection
2665389 we had one that we used in a sting for school zones
2665390 hopefully well have the new one by the time school starts again
2665391 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
2665392 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
2665393 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
2665394 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
2665395 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
2665396 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
2665397 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
2665398 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
2665399 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
2665400 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
2665401 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
2665402 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
2665403 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
2665404 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
2665405 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
2665406 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
2665407 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
2665408 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
2665409 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
2665410 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
2665411 no matter how hard they try they cant stop us now
2665412 it isnt one of those things where you drop a meter in the water and read a needle
2665413 no matter how hard they try they cant stop us now
2665414 i hate my life please help me i am going crazy right now
2665415 we got her away from him before it got worse
2665416 shell live with this for the rest of her life but we got her away from him
2665417 the thing i dont want is for this to go to trial and a jury to give him probation
2665418 the settlement gave those children a sense of security that could not be guaranteed if they had to sit across from him in the courtroom and testify before a jury

2665422 i walked up and asked him what he was doing
2665423 he said you and your muscleman dont scare me ill protect myself
2665424 that was what i was trying to do 50 years ago and the attorney general of texas stopped me
2665425 when he broke ground on jamaica beach he was only 30 years old a young man with a vision
2665426 it was something very unique when you look at the desolate barren island land then who could have envisioned all the communities on the west end and where they are at today he might have been a little ahead of his time
2665427 jamaica beach was my favorite project because i was so personally involved in it
2665428 the rich people had a second home but the middle class didnt
2665429 the first thing we had to do is convince people they needed a second home and then we had to convince them that jamaica beach is where they wanted to be

2665440 the goal of all this central planning and spying is not to celebrate the glories of communism regardless of what chinas governing party calls itself it is to create the ultimate consumer cocoon for visa cards adidas sneakers china mobile cell phones mcdonalds happy meals tsingtao beer and ups delivery to name just a few of the official olympic sponsors but the hottest new market of all is the surveillance itself unlike the police states of eastern europe and the soviet union china has built a police state 2 0 an entirely for profit affair that is the latest frontier for the global disaster capitalism complex
2665441 most of my friends are here and im having a great time today
2665442 you dont hear a lot of gospel music these days
2665443 we need good role models for our children i think to stay positive
2665444 we try to build an ongoing relationship with the residents and show them we are not just here to do one thing and then leave
2665445 i get the sense sometimes talking to these residents that they feel like outsiders in greenwich
2665446 science isnt just a topic you study in the classroom
2665447 its also a life skill when you recycle or talk about global warming or pick up a newspaper and read about the environment
2665448 ill definitely be talking to plenty of teachers and getting a sense of where we stand as a district
2665449 we dont want to be teaching in fourth grade something that theyre going to test in third grade
2665450 is to just make sure students have a lifelong love of exploring science we have to make sure our program is formulated with that in mind

2665454 were taking nothing for granted but i think the lines have been drawn pretty clearly between my message of economic renewal and ms whitnums negativity and im pretty confident that the voters of the district will choose the more positive forward looking candidate
2665455 himes puts the interest of a constituent group and his own campaign purse before the interests of the american people

2665457 himes would rather provide zero enforcement and make everyone a citizen
2665458 how does that solve the growing burdens on our region himes is too weak to take the hard stands
2665459 i think what ive been talking about is far more relevant to voters in the district than ms whitnums anti immigrant and anti israel positions

2665464 for the lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the archangel and with the trump of god and the dead in christ shall rise first then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the lord wherefore comfort one another with these words
2665465 for the lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the archangel and with the trump of god and the dead in christ shall rise first then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the lord wherefore comfort one another with these words
2665466 behold i shew you a mystery we shall not all sleep but we shall all be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye at the last trump for the trumpet shall sound and the dead shall be raised incorruptible and we shall be changed for this corruptible must put on incorruption and this mortal must put on immortality so when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption and this mortal shall have put on immortality then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written death is swallowed up in victory
2665467 we will immediately leave this earth no matter what we are doing we will suddenly be taken out of the world
2665468 the rapture of the church will be an event of such startling proportions that the entire world will be conscious of our leaving some have suggested that there will be airplane bus and train wrecks throughout the world when christian operators are suddenly taken out of the world who can imagine the chaos on the freeways when automobile drivers are snatched out of their cars
2665469 is that while the former are worried that the world could come to an end soon the christians are literally excited over the prospect the reason for the optimism of the bible believing christians is that in their view while the world is teetering on the brink of the great tribulation a cosmic disaster foretold in the bible the believers in christ will be spared
2665470 it would be difficult not to be troubled if scripture did not clearly show that inevitable martyrdom in the great tribulation would not be the next expectation for believers in this age true christians today need not fear the catastrophic days about to overcome the world instead they have the imminent hope of christs return and their being joined to the lord to enjoy his presence forever
2665471 with optimism with anticipation with excitement we should be living like persons who dont expect to be around much longer
2665472 the lord himself will descend from heaven with a commanding call with an archangels voice and with gods trumpet and those who are dead in union with christ will rise first afterward we the living who are surviving will together with them be caught away in clouds to meet the lord in the air and thus we shall always be with the lord
2665473 he proceeded to bend the heavens down and to descend and thick gloom was beneath his feet
2665474 look jehovah is going forth from his place and he will certainly come down and tread upon earths high places
2665475 those who are dead in union with christ will rise first
2665476 be caught away in clouds resurrected as invisible spirit sons of god to meet the invisible lord in the air

2665535 here here like were stuck here because we were exposed to a goauld doohickie or out here as in exploring the universe boldly going seeking out new life and new civilisations and introducing them to the american way of life
2665536 thats one of the things that bothers me i mean weve fucked up so many cultures at home planted starbucks and mcdonalds around the globe conquered nations and sold them coke oh yes let me be the one to bring the ruin of a thousand cultures
2665537 unless of course youre asking why youre here in which case id have to tell you to ask your parents

2665539 this place my research who really cares nobody can ever read about what ive found and the pentagon certainly dont care im a waste of time and money as far as most people are concerned
2665540 no youre not your work is important the rosetta stone was found on a military expedition after all
2665541 you found the cartouche on abydos we wouldnt have the sgc if it wasnt for you more people know about the rosetta stone than the battle of the nile you might not feel appreciated now but your work will be remembered more than mine it is important daniel in the grand scheme of things

2665543 its not that theres nothing id rather be doing dont you see nothing
2665544 i dont care nobody else does so why should i

2665547 i thought i was right but i was wrong i wanted to prove my theories i wanted my life back all i brought was death share is dead because of me

2665549 i put it in danger me my pride my hubris i was so desperate to prove myself right i ripped the lid right off pandoras box without even thinking i brought all this death upon our heads everything thats happened anything that happens its all my fault
2665550 so what good are my books now ive destroyed the world
2665551 bit melodramatic dont you think daniel they might have got the gate open without you you dont know without you id have set that bomb and all of abydos would be toast anyhow this isnt all your fault theres no fault here you kept us me honest reminded me that theres more to this than risk assessment dont sell yourself short daniel we need you i need you

2665556 sam turned the light all the way down i volunteered to come and make sure you were all coping
2665557 is fine shes packed and ready to go back with loren
2665558 how long has he been like this sluggish moody distracted
2665559 i thought we were supposed to be getting back to normal
2665560 well daniel was exposed longer and his brain chemistry has been slightly altered by excessive sarcophagus use not to mention ribbon devices if i could get an mri
2665561 daniels taking longer to get over the effects of the light than planned bearing in mind that he had a longer exposure and that he took longer to succumb than sg 5 its not that surprising daniel has been exposed to more goauld technology and survived than anyone else it might have affected him differently
2665562 in a week or so yes he will be it just takes some people longer
2665563 without you everything falls apart without you its not as much fun to pick up the pieces take me with you
2665564 no i think you need to stay here and i need to stay here with you
2665565 that isnt going to happen you just need a few more days to adjust

2665585 theres that but is it what im meant to be doing the people i love they keep ending up as collateral damage it makes me think ive made a mistake and theyve paid the price
2665586 the world would be in ashes if it wasnt for you daniel yes you lost share and sarah but youve saved so many more
2665587 nothing the goauld have done to you and yours is right but if you want to start playing its a wonderful life then at least look at the big picture you helped save the world a lot
2665588 stop it daniel whats done is done we all have to live with regrets mistakes and plain awful stuff we never want to remember but always do
2665589 you proved your theory and maybe theres been some heavy consequences but theres been some good stuff too
2665590 i know its not much but it means something to me hey

2665602 we can rebuild what we had we can make it better faster stronger
2665603 its still got a pulse daniel dont give up on it yet
2665604 i went looking for you that night on abydos but you were too busy shagging share i didnt even think you knew what to do with a girl
2665605 daniel come and say hello to the nice people they think ive murdered you and stashed your body somewhere
2665606 were fine daniels busy translating every single one of those columns itll be in his report oneill out
2665607 i saw two shooting stars last night i wished on them but they were only satellites its wrong to wish on space hardware i wish i wish i wish youd care
2665608 im busy and ive got all these columns to do
2665609 enough time for a break come on i want to show you something
2665610 stars lots of em all new shining just for you
2665611 i used to look up at the night sky and try and find the star that was shining down on you i bought a telescope so i could see the same stars that you saw at night
2665612 i didnt think you needed to know i missed you you got under my skin like sand you still are
2665613 are you going to sleep inquired jack his thumb softly stroking the line from daniels ear to collarbone he wasnt annoyed just surprised daniel had been wound so tightly not more than 20 minutes ago
2665614 orpheus see with his lyre if you can have orion i can have orpheus
2665615 orpheus and eurydice were young lovers one day eurydice was bitten by a snake and she died orpheus was completely broken up over it so he played his lyre for the gods begging them to bring his eurydice back at last they agreed and orpheus was allowed to fetch her back from the underworld there was one condition however he wasnt allowed to look back so he took her hand and led eurydice out of the underworld at the very last moment he looked back and she was gone all he was holding was air
2665616 oh orpheus was torn to pieces by the bacchii wild women who worshipped bacchus his head survived though and continued to sing songs of lament
2665617 i bet he did dont you know any cheerful stories
2665618 the old myths werent worried about middle class sensibilities and pg ratings it was a cruel world and their stories reflect that even grimms fairytales are well grim
2665619 the important thing isnt that they died its that they loved thats what youre supposed to remember orpheus sorrow was so deep that he made the gods pity him just for a second
2665620 well they were gods they live for that sort of thing
2665621 wish i knew what you were looking for might have known what you would find wish i knew what you were looking for might have known what you would find under the milky way tonight
2665622 kiss me again and again for your love is sweeter than wine
2665623 youre in great shape jack you use it you dont lose it and we use it a lot a hell of a lot
2665624 god no never i love sex with you i need sex with you i need it to feel alive to feel something when im inside you its and when youre inside me when i can feel you all of you hot and alive and when you come inside me
2665625 i dont suppose i need to ask you if youve had sex offworld
2665626 dont be such a baby colonel its not like this anything new
2665627 i like it better when daniel does it he has a lighter touch
2665628 what shes got her finger up my ass its not like i can lie or anything
2665629 uh really you dont have to check oh jeez down boy
2665630 so are you going to tell me how daniel got those cuts on his wrists
2665631 that fucking place it got to him again thats all
2665632 just leave it for now give him time to get over whatever that place did to him
2665633 doc wants to keep you in overnight just in case you know because of last time better safe than sorry
2665634 not long i just wanted to see you before i went off
2665635 youve been like two peas in a pod this last month and youve been coming down from the effect of that planet from what jack tells me its brought a lot of things to the surface do you want to talk about these things
2665636 he doesnt need that it was just a bad dream no biggie he has them all the time
2665637 you know the sort of shit daniels been through and they knew what they were buying into when they hired him
2665638 just dont pump him full of drugs he doesnt need that not on top of everything else he can get through this i can get him through this i have before
2665639 he needs out of here let me take him back to my place where i can keep an eye on him a good feed a good sleep hell be as right as rain i promise id never do anything that might hurt him
2665640 you wanna tell me what that bad dream was about
2665641 good ive got stuff to do then well leave early and go back to my place youre staying with me for the rest of the week okay
2665642 i lied i was sleeping in my office i just wanted to be close by in case
2665643 daniel this isnt your fault this thing is fucking with your brain sg 5 died and you didnt youve got nothing to be ashamed of youre stronger than this thing its just got a grip on you because you were exposed longer than any of us
2665644 youll be okay its just going to be rough weather for a bit longer im here for you ill get you through this i promise
2665645 so do you think you can get back to sleep or do you want fraiser to give you something
2665646 are you alright stupid question no youre not back we go
2665647 no jack please just get me coffee and doughnuts and ill be fine
2665648 daniel you cant keep cycling like that its not good for you
2665649 yes tell me jack how wrong my addiction to coffee is
2665650 im just worried about you this thing is taking a real long while to get out of your system
2665651 well it killed me if you remember it just gave you a bit of a headache
2665652 well take it easy and dont start on anything big i want to get out of here early tonight i mean it daniel i dont want to come back and find you in the middle of something or face down on the floor
2665653 yes as a matter of fact ive got month old milk in the fridge to be dealt with for starters
2665654 look i dont care what doc fraiser says daniel is fine a little ragged but no worse than carter on certain days
2665655 if you say so jack hes on your team your responsibility
2665656 he is that sir look hes better off left alone with his books than with mackenzie any day of the week you know this sir daniels a good kid he wont let you me us down
2665657 i have okay while youre in such a generous mood could you throw the guy a bone
2665658 daniel hasnt published in years he hasnt actually said anything but it bothers him hed like the chance to try and restore his name in the archaeological community give him something to fall back on you know ive gotten medals carter got a promotion but daniels gotten sweet fa and hes given a lot to the sgc he knows he cant publish what he knows but if you could get the security guys to vet just a couple of papers just on some of the stuff hes had to work on without mentioning the goauld or the ancients or anything else classified
2665659 if it can be done ill think about it i wont promise anything it entirely depends on what dr jackson writes about and how much hed be allowed to publish jack if his work is rejected by the security folks it may do more harm than good
2665660 yes it is he has no respect among his peers outside the sgc even within the sgc we recruit outsiders and they have no idea of the work daniels done they only know him as a joke so they treat him like one its not fair on daniel and the mans got his pride as we both well know that whole business in chicago only kicked it home further with the loss of share he feels like hes wasting his life this bastard light thing just brought all this shit to the surface
2665661 no sir but its part of it daniel needs to restore his name without our name we are nothing i read that in something of daniels once
2665662 ill look into it colonel thats all i can say
2665663 its alright jack i know we owe dr jackson a great deal are you sure hes all right
2665664 his academic reputation thats all thats been bothering dr jackson
2665665 well that and losing share then sarah amongst other things
2665666 oh sorry im fine i was just thinking some guys came by and took a stack of my old reports away you wouldnt know anything about that would you
2665667 just how much coffee did you have today anyway because weve talked about this
2665668 if youre having real problems you know ill have to speak to dr fraiser
2665669 some notes on the frum community from a local wolf
2665670 theres a blaze of light in every word it doesnt matter which you heard the holy or the broken hallelujah
2665671 musings on the jumbled interplay between emotions ideas and beliefs
2665672 this website presents a collection of articles which aim to defend genuine science from numerous attempts by the new crop of creationists to replace it with theistic pseudo science under various disguises and names
2665673 talk origins is a usenet newsgroup devoted to the discussion and debate of biological and physical origins
2665674 de has been operating since 1998 as a public organization whose main goal is the study of classical jewish culture and the dissemination of its scientific humanistic interpretation
2665675 he just has a knack for coming through when you need him and hes a big time run producer
2665676 whats happened is just what i was afraid of you have to ease them through this year yet because it takes time to get over all that shoulder stuff thats not an easy way to have to operate but thats what were doing
2665677 obviously were both not in major league baseball for different reasons
2665678 thats probably why the moment is not being celebrated in baseball not only because of the steroids people are talking about but because neither of us is playing in major league baseball youd have to go find barry where he is and youd have to go to a minor league city to find me to talk about it
2665679 weve got some guys who can drive the ball these things run in streaks sometimes im hoping well start driving the ball not just home runs but squaring up on balls and driving the gaps we did have quite a skid there
2665680 bat no 1 and he will play somewhere every day
2665681 we got him he got us 10 times we were lucky enough to get him out of there and score some runs late
2665682 you just cant pick and choose when youre going to put your effort out there
2665683 when it comes down to individual effort it takes absolutely zero talent zero zero talent to try hard or play hard every day im ok with physical mistakes we talked about the mental mistakes i want them to cut down and we have cut down on them a lot im accepting of all that the part im not accepting of is the part you can control which is your effort
2665684 i didnt run it out but its over done with you move on learned a lesson
2665685 we were right there things didnt pan out i heard on the radio after the haren signing that people didnt think i wanted to be a diamondback im not a greedy one im not the one that pulled it off the table we just couldnt see eye to eye on a couple of things i love arizona this is my first choice
2665686 i have never made but one prayer to god a very short one o lord make my enemies ridiculous and god granted it
2665687 we have these huge stories going on like the one youre reporting in georgia
2665688 there is a growing need for senior health services in the south bay
2665689 he just went to school went to work and stayed in the house
2665690 thats when it happened he got shot in the back
2665691 if it wasnt for my husband and kids id be falling apart
2665692 who knows if it will ever be this low again
2665693 but this is not just about money its the countrys reputation for quality lack of corruption and huge range of choice that attracts students
2665694 the number is 4 000 the number of accredited colleges and universities in the u s about a third of the higher education capacity in the whole world
2665695 our students did a research project last spring about students experiences acquiring visas and entering the country and there was no shortage of unpleasant experiences shared
2665696 from applying for visas and dealing with uncooperative officials to dealing with officials at port of entry many feel like they are being treated as criminals they dont understand why they are receiving so much attention as potential criminals or terrorists when they are trying to come and contribute to society
2665697 students report high levels of satisfaction they report that its a welcoming environment
2665698 many universities are trying to do more to globalize their campuses and provide students with a global education because this helps prepare students for the world out there that is increasingly small

2665717 how many tracks on this album do i truly adore
2665718 but if our gospel be hid it is hid to them that are lost in whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not lest the light of the glorious gospel of christ who is the image of god should shine unto them
2665719 that maxim there are no atheists in foxholes its not an argument against atheism its an argument against foxholes
2665720 all of the traditional theological answers to this are mere wordplay
2665721 and my explanation is just as good and simpler because it doesnt have an extra entity god in it
2665722 if the bible say had predicted the discovery of the cosmic microwave background radiation
2665723 the british scientist james clerk maxwell suggested that electricity and light waves were two forms of the same thing
2665724 canst thou send lightnings that they may go and say unto thee here we are
2665725 you are re interpreting the writing job 38 35 is simply the biblical god boasting that only he has the power to control lightning
2665726 that they may go and say unto thee here we are
2665727 sure that would explain the first part but why was it worded with the addition to the last part that they may go and say unto thee here we are
2665728 seriously dan i would not use arguments unless i could understand them now you might be just confused by my arguing well that is what happens when you use arguments you do not understand so dan be careful where you take your notes from make sure you understand them well do a bit of homework also make sure what is it that you are criticizing this is why we cannot take creationists seriously they always show no understanding of any theory they criticize
2665729 still evolution explains diversity of life and origin of life is another problem
2665730 not true the bible says things are made from their own kind kinds are probably best represented today by the classification families
2665731 so it is quite possible that they thought lightning was a being that could stop and speak
2665732 you are annoying i accuse you of fallacies without even reading the arguments ergo you are wrong
2665733 you are attempting to argue against people who do not believe in
2665734 none is righteous no not one no one understands no one seeks for god
2665735 even acts of generosity and altruism are in fact egoist acts in disguise
2665736 you know in your heart of hearts that god exists
2665737 you deny gods existence because you dont want to submit to his authority
2665738 sorry dan there is no secular plot to repress creationism theres simply no evidence for it thats all
2665739 they just do not pretend that science and religion are the same
2665740 evolutionists cant seem to separate science from religion they sometimes imply or even state outright that the scientists who reject evolution do so because religious brainwashing has prevented them from being able to think rationally

2665746 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2665747 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2665748 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2665749 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2665750 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2665751 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2665752 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2665753 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2665754 i know my response is kind of roundabout but this is where my thinking has been
2665755 most people think poster and its so much more than that its not really that at all
2665756 thats when genius struck for klein a mother of three who lives in california she was tired of digging around for old check stubs and stray gum wrappers every time she wanted to give another mother her phone number suddenly she knew what she needed she needed business cards klein who designed her own cards and now sells them online isnt the only mom to have this revelation business cards for moms also called mommy cards and mommy calling cards
2665757 michalk says it was such a great idea she copied it and since then at least two of her friends have borrowed the idea and started handing out cards of their own
2665758 i wanted them to look like a moms she says
2665759 its definitely intimidating but being there is a good way for us to see other talented dancers and be inspired by other talented people

2665761 but by working with sandpaper files and his good knowledge lee can put the necessary curve on the mouthpiece to make it respond just right it seems so arcane but it is so necessary to making clarinetists happy
2665762 he has a beautiful sound and wonderful lyricism a clarinet player who is world class in every way
2665763 the culture in utah is very family oriented and its a family oriented play i think theres a lot of synergy between that and the mormon culture
2665764 its about whats human in us as opposed to any other identifying label
2665765 the story of fiddler resonates with a lot of people you dont have to be jewish to understand it
2665766 in directing a play one of the most important things is to figure out what the basis of the story is and for me the story is about a family
2665767 you could take that story and set it in 100 different cultures and it would still resonate
2665768 while there are a lot of divisions there are also a lot of commonalities
2665769 utah itself was largely founded because there was a people who were driven from their homes because of their religious beliefs
2665770 its such a great message about the traditions and the breaking of them

2665799 i dont think we understood what it meant to be an olympian and to put on a usa uniform we didnt realize all the people we were representing growing up i never thought about being an olympian all i thought about was playing in the nba
2665800 but in the last couple of years ive come to understand what this is about
2665801 and i know now this is 20 times bigger than an nba championship the whole world is watching here
2665802 the thing is we have a lot of winners on this team i dont have an nba championship or a gold medal but i won three of four state championships in my high school career and we went on to win 109 games and lose just six

2665822 truly i tell you with no one in israel have i found such faith
2665823 tensions and hostilities between georgians and ossetians are in no way justification for russian troops crossing an internationally recognized border
2665824 i again call on the government of russia to immediately and unconditionally withdraw its forces from the territory of georgia
2665825 i condemn russias aggressive actions and reiterate my call for an immediate ceasefire
2665826 russia must stop its bombing campaign cease flights of russian aircraft in georgian airspace and withdraw its ground forces from georgia
2665827 for many years i have warned against russian actions that undermine the sovereignty of its neighbors
2665828 unfortunately we have seen in recent days russia demonstrate that these concerns were well founded
2665829 the current escalation of military conflict resulted in part from the lack of a neutral and effective peacekeeping force operating under an appropriate un mandate

2665833 so then while christ is the law he is also liberty while he is sin for he was made sin for us he is righteousness and while he is death he is life for in that he suffered the law to accuse him sin to condemn him and death to devour him he abolished the law he condemned sin he destroyed death he justified and saved me
2665834 being dead to the world means that every legitimate pleasure in the world becomes a blood bought evidence of christs love and an occasion of boasting in the cross when our hearts run back along the beam of blessing to the source in the cross then the worldliness of the blessing is dead and christ crucified is everything
2665835 self has no claims upon us for it has done nothing for us it has been a wall of iron between us and christ is that a reason that we should serve it it has been a mountain of ice between us and the world to come is that a ground of claim over us no brethren self has done nothing to make us either live to it or die to it it never can do anything shall we then bow to it shall we serve it shall we do it homage we ask on the other hand what has the lord not done what indissoluble innumerable bonds are there between us and him as the living the dying and the rising one the whole of our life is to be his as his life was for us surely he has earned this if he has earned anything at all the least that we can give him is our life the undivided service of our being in every part in our doing in our speaking in our planning and in all our daily round of business so that every part of our life shall be a witness bearing for him

2665854 mr president former secretary of state colin powell says the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism
2665855 if a former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and former secretary of state feels this way dont you think that americans and the rest of the world are beginning to wonder whether youre following a flawed strategy
2665856 if theres any comparison between the compassion and decency of the american people and the terrorist tactics of extremists its flawed logic
2665857 its just i simply cant accept that its unacceptable to think that theres any kind of comparison between the behavior of the united states of america and the action of islamic extremists who kill innocent women and children to achieve an objective

2665872 whenever i thought of china two pictures would slip into my mind the great wall and clusters of factories
2665873 what i have seen tonight has totally smashed my fixed ideas and concepts about china
2665874 china is a great nation that is culturally and economically rich
2665875 the opening ceremony has helped erase that big question mark that has puzzled me for many years
2665876 the big screen seized my attention instantly after i casually cast a side look at the big screen
2665877 i bet that this opening ceremony that carries a very strong message of peace and friendship will help those who do not understand china well recast their concept of the country
2665878 the opening ceremony is the best and also the most appropriate advertisement for china
2665879 you know it just goes to show that god is universal and god is love and no state man or woman should fear the influence of loving religion
2665880 once again i had a very uplifting experience going to a church
2665881 it was a spirit filled feeling as you know i feel very strongly about religion and im so appreciative of the chance to go to church here
2665882 this is a good testament to the importance you place on u s relations with china
2665883 i looked up and he waved the flag and nodded his head

2665920 orwell is as pertinent to the world now as he ever was
2665921 his incredibly distinctive writing and thinking about political matters his extraordinary decency the internet allows the diaries to be more digestible for the average reader you can find out what he was thinking on a certain date
2665922 i went to the archive and zoomed through the diaries and just wept they show orwell practicing being a writer and an observer you see in the diaries he smells out orthodoxies and presses them until he and the reader are more critical
2665923 warmish day with showers after the rain enormous slugs crawling about one measuring about 3
2665924 i have known since about 1931 stephen spender says he has known since 1929 that the future must be catastrophic i could not say exactly what wars and revolutions would happen but they never surprised me when they came since 1934 i have known war between england and germany was coming and since 1936 i have known it with complete certainty
2665925 it is clear from what american papers one gets hold of that anti british feeling is in full cry and that all the isolationists after a momentary retirement have re emerged with the same slogans as before what always horrifies me about american anti british sentiment is its appalling ignorance ditto presumably with anti american feeling in england
2665926 because he is one of the few writers who brings comfort and understanding to everyone who lives in totalitarian societies of which there are many around he believes that writing and thinking are the front line against lies and injustice he is an eloquent original uncontrollable writer on the side of justice since when is that not relevant

2665930 i knew what i was told about the war was totally false
2665931 in 1968 i came back and dan was across the hall at rand
2665932 he had been a total hawk in vietnam but everything about him seemed shattered it was as if he was trying to grow himself back he was going through a metamorphosis he was very tortured there was no way he could justify the war anymore
2665933 i knew that he was the one person with the combination of guts and passionate concern about the war who would take the risk of helping me
2665934 no i am not interested in doing that right now
2665935 i can see what you are saying but i am spending 2000 month in seo and cant afford anything else
2665936 i want my manager to introduce the video and have shots of the pool the rooms and oh yeah could we include the bbq area because that really

2665941 i was proud of all my players tonight and getting a point keeps us right in the competition they all worked unbelievably hard in very trying conditions sometimes we did turn possession over too quickly but that might have been down to the occasion physically they did everything they could possible do
2665942 we have to work very hard as a team because were playing against top quality people have to realise that these are the 16 best teams in the world weve made a massive achievement by qualifying but now were playing against players from the top leagues around europe eight out of my eleven were from the a league which is great credit to the competition
2665943 it is in truth not for glory nor riches nor honours that we are fighting but for freedom for that alone which no honest man gives up but with life itself

2665959 where ashes grow like wheat into ridges and hills and grotesque gardens
2665960 dimmed a little by many paintless days under sun and rain brood on over the solemn dumping ground
2665961 because jay gatsby had broken up like glass against toms hard malice
2665962 theyre a rotten crowd youre worth the whole damn bunch put together
2665963 americans are obstinately unwilling to play the role of peasants
2665964 i do not have privileges to change this please contact the system administrator
2665965 like moths among the whisperings and the champagne and the stars
2665966 sea change of faces and voices and color under the constantly changing light
2665967 a dim background started to take shape behind him but at her next remark it faded away
2665968 a sudden emptiness seemed to flow now from the windows and the great doors endowing with complete isolation the figure of the host who stood on the porch his hand up in a formal gesture of farewell
2665969 at the enchanted metropolitan twilight i felt a haunting loneliness sometimes
2665970 slow thinking and full of interior rules that act as brakes on my desires
2665971 one of the few honest people that i have ever known
2665972 w henever you feel like criticizing anyone just remember that all the people in the world havent had the advantages youve had
2665973 a sense of the fundamental decencies is parcelled out unequally at birth
2665974 was lonely no longer he was a guide a pathfinder an original settler
2665975 wouldnt it be cool if i met rick and he wanted me to guest blog on his brilliant blog silicon florist
2665976 dang it would blow my mind if melissa offered to edit my stories
2665977 neglects the important differences between a gas centrifuge uranium enrichment program and a reactor based program
2665978 far more military ordinance than that used on either reactor attacked by israel
2665979 acquire centrifuge items abroad often illicitly allowing it to create reserve stocks of critical equipment and raw materials
2665980 intelligence agencies simply lack reliable information on the full scope of irans centrifuge facilities and activities
2665981 considering the modular replicable nature of centrifuge plants we conclude that an attack on irans nuclear program is unlikely to significantly degrade irans ability to reconstitute its gas centrifuge program
2665982 it is time to set aside the military option and concentrate instead on credible diplomatic approaches to end irans growing nuclear weapons capabilities
2665983 a nation that is afraid to let its people judge the truth and falsehood in an open market is a nation that is afraid of its people
2665984 obviously some of them were trying to trigger ethnic and religious tension and conflict which could be manipulated to serve the interests of umno and the government it leads
2665985 united behind a commitment that every american man woman and child be guaranteed to have affordable comprehensive health care
2665986 house republicans have remained on the floor speaking directly to the chorus of americans filling the house visitors gallery requesting that speaker pelosi reconvene the house and allow a vote on comprehensive common sense approach to reducing the price of energy
2665987 there is nothing that the republicans are proposing that will have an impact on the price at the pump yeah 10 years from now 2 cents but what we are saying is free our oil in 10 days not 10 years and thats what we will keep pushing
2665988 obama has criticized bush for his fiscal irresponsibility and now hes using bushs baseline as a yardstick by which to measure fiscal responsibility
2665989 congress hasnt agreed to extend the bush tax cuts because they dont have the money to pay for it
2665990 its not unreasonable to say were inheriting a budget thats going to have substantial deficits into the future
2665991 said a democratic congressional aide who spoke on condition of anonymity so he could speak candidly
2665992 leaving some of the tax cuts in place would cost us a small fortune
2665993 i dont know that any blue dog has a good way to pay for that
2665994 president bush created this problem we would put in place rules so it never happens again
2665995 but a sound budget is based on making realistic promises and sticking to them
2665996 it was the first time in a state election where race could have been a factor and wasnt
2665997 she fit the demographic perfectly she was active in the churches the majority of voters are female and she got blown out
2665998 i think its special that it happened in memphis because this is where dr king died
2665999 whites have voted for blacks and blacks have voted for whites in this state but never like this before in the past the only thing that brought us together like this was university of memphis tigers basketball barbecues and music
2666000 if youre a good representative if you put forth substantive legislation people will support you
2666001 we are on offense on the most important domestic issue before the country which is the energy crisis
2666002 we have blunted obamas momentum both nationally and in the key states where were ahead even or just slightly behind in a horrific political year
2666003 the most underappreciated dynamic of the race is the intensity advantage
2666004 thats why george bush won in 2004 they had an intensity gap and we have it now
2666005 people are very mediocre predictors of their own behavior what they tell you in june and july will not necessarily comport well with what they do in november
2666006 what is going to finally be the catalyst for the changes i need to make
2666007 youre a rare beauty that never stops overflowing your heart is so genuine and your spirit is so real these are things that i love and respect about you
2666008 i call it the lexington project my friends but you can call it anything you want
2666009 i have never knowingly submitted a false disclosure form required by law as a u s senator
2666010 the impact of these charges on my family disturbs me greatly i am innocent of these charges and intend to prove that
2666011 nobody thinks that bush or mccain have a real answer for the challenges we face so what they are going to try to do is make you scared of me
2666012 those folks know they dont have any good answers they know they had their turn over the last eight years and made a mess of things
2666013 they know they can only win by making you scared of me
2666014 baselessly forecasted that john mccain would make claims about obamas physical appearance and middle name
2666015 like most celebrities he reacts to fair criticism with a mix of fussiness and hysteria
2666016 it should be a given that toys are not dangerous
2666017 each and every one of the core conclusions of the oig opr report is consistent with and indeed derived from ms goodlings testimony before the house judiciary committee
2666018 we treat you one way you treat us another way
2666019 all we want to do is be treated fairly in the united states of america we dont want anything special we dont think you ought to go overboard just treat us the way we treat you most of your products come in duty free we want our products like those manufactured right here in euclid ohio going into that colombia market without a special tax on it

2666029 salah satu cara orang orang yahudi untuk mengusir rakyat palestina dari tanah dan kampungnya adalah dengan mengepung desa mereka dari tiga arah satu arah dibiarkan terbuka setelah dari tiga sisi dikepung orang orang yahudi yang bersenjata itu menembaki orang orang palestina siapa saja tujuannya adalah untuk menimbulkan ketakutan sehingga mereka orang orang palestina itu keluar dari rumah rumah mereka dan meninggalkan kampung mereka cara cara ini biasa dilakukan pada malam hari tatkala orang orang palestina tengah terlelap sehingga ketika mereka berlari meninggalkan rumahnya mereka tidak membawa bekal apa pun
2666030 setelah desa berhasil dikosongkan maka orang orang yahudi itu saat itu juga menduduki wilayah tersebut dan mengklaim tanah itu sebagai tanah milik orang yahudi the homeland
2666031 selain cara mengepung dari tiga arah orang orang yahudi juga menggunakan cara pengepungan empat arah

2666034 it is true that marijuana became illegal because of racial stereotypes and it is probably if not the biggest one of the biggest reasons
2666035 im sorry for arguing and not realizing how much stress you have gone through with the kids while i was at work
2666036 all i needed to do was be patient with them and marijuana helped relax and build patience for my kids now when there is something that they cant have i sit down with them and explain to them why in reasons theyll understand
2666037 its not what it is that makes it bad its how you use it to make a positive future

2666058 the thing i dont want is for this to go to trial and a jury to give him probation

2666066 when he broke ground on jamaica beach he was only 30 years old a young man with a vision
2666067 it was something very unique when you look at the desolate barren island land then who could have envisioned all the communities on the west end and where they are at today he might have been a little ahead of his time
2666068 jamaica beach was my favorite project because i was so personally involved in it
2666069 the rich people had a second home but the middle class didnt
2666070 the first thing we had to do is convince people they needed a second home and then we had to convince them that jamaica beach is where they wanted to be

2666123 i knew that he was the one person with the combination of guts and passionate concern about the war who would take the risk of helping me
2666124 the main thing putting a fire under the market is that crude oil prices continue to come down that is lifting everything that is not in the energy patch

2666150 along with his commitment to clean air and water and to conserving open space he has been a leader on the issue of global warming with the courage to call the nation to action on an issue we can no longer afford to ignore by addressing this problem responsibly john mccain believes we can meet our obligation to be proper caretakers of creation in a manner of which we can be proud by protecting our country strengthening our economy and addressing the challenges of our time rather than leaving a much worse problem for our children

2666166 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2666167 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2666168 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2666169 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2666170 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2666171 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2666172 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2666173 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2666174 in an era where media consolidation is occurring at an all too rapid pace its essential to look for alternative news sources that are free from corporate bias the future of our rather stupid species depends on it sites like yours have made a massive impact on me over the last year im very grateful
2666175 spiderednews is a really good resource thanks for the effort and time you put in to providing it
2666176 when he told us he quit his job i said what do you mean you quit your full time job with benefits and dont know what you are going to do after the trip
2666177 he said this is a good time in my life to do it
2666178 so far weve raised 1 800 so we will be able to award at least three 500 scholarships next spring
2666179 they hope to be able to award five 500 scholarships
2666180 one hundred percent of the money they raise will go for the scholarships they are paying all the administrative fees and trip expenses out of their own pockets
2666181 the oregon coastline was amazing we have been breezing through towns and have had a lot of tourists and locals asking us a lot of questions about what were doing
2666182 its always fun to talk to them about our trip we are trying to shed some of our gear and purge some weight since we will be biking into a headwind and have several miles of hills to do so every ounce counts
2666183 how many hams does it take to hoist an antenna
2666184 mainly its just enjoyable to get on the radio and talk to somebody and say hi and find out how everythings going with them
2666185 there are a whole bunch of hams in this area
2666186 useful pursuit of something positive that has challenges for both adults and teens
2666187 they can for example warn other drivers of slippery roads or of a crash which just happenend
2666188 we should keep in mind that with 24 percent of europeans driving time spent in traffic jams the costs caused by congestion could reach 80 billion euros by 2010
2666189 so clearly saving time through smart vehicle communication systems means saving money
2666190 we are in a society today that is so vulnerable
2666191 hams are always excited to find someone who is interested in their hobby
2666192 we issued a permit for one thing and they built another
2666193 if they refuse we just go ahead with the hearing
2666194 the problem got so bad we were actually considering switching to kingsports 911 system for our dispatching
2666195 im talking about entire shifts when he lunsford couldnt get any transmissions through to central dispatch hed make a traffic stop and couldnt call in to tell them where he was the vehicle description or the license plate because someone was keying over him
2666196 after talking to the heads of the other law enforcement agencies in the county i contacted the fcc as a last resort it was a serious safety issue and i wasnt going to wait around until one of my officers got killed i wanted this to stop and i wanted to know who was responsible
2666197 instead we learned that the two men are civilian fcc employees who were in the area working on a radio complaint
2666198 whitaker and i have prepared warrants charging both men with counts of impersonating police officers
2666199 i talked to the fcc district supervisor and he said he has no evidence of any officer in hawkins county especially a church hill officer doing anything inappropriate over the radio
2666200 ive told him that if and when he develops evidence to let me know and ill be the first one to suspend the officer
2666201 a novel idea would have been to tell the truth yeah were fcc employees and were investigating radio complaints
2666202 or at the very least theres hundreds of lies they could have told my officers they happened to pick the one lie that theres a crime in the books against
2666203 they could have said were grocery store inspectors were gasoline inspectors they could have named any number of lies that would not be criminal
2666204 when i was made aware that church hill was contemplating bringing charges against fcc agents who were acting in an undercover capacity in church hill i called chief mark johnson and indicated to him that i did not feel that charges against those individuals under these circumstances would be in the best interest of the city of church hill or the state of tennessee
2666205 i indicated to him that i was not trying to interfere with his prerogative of bringing charges but i was just stating my feeling on the matter at the time
2666206 im generally aware of those allegations i asked the tbi to look into it i have not seen their complete report yet so i would rather not comment on that at this time
2666207 my colleagues in sweden and japan tell me that exposure to microwave radiation from cell phones are potentially dangerous and that this should be acknowledged by the phone companies which they dont bother acknowledging
2666208 really at the heart of my concern is that we shouldnt wait for a definitive study to come out but err on the side of being safe rather than sorry later
2666209 days after the meth agent incident occurred in june i was contacted by tbi personnel and told that top tbi brass were hot over the issue and would be pushing for punitive actions against all four people involved in the impersonation scam
2666210 we were asked to provide tapes and paperwork to the tbi to assist in their investigation
2666211 so last week we picked back up on our investigation of the two fcc civilians
2666212 if they the fcc agents had claimed to be chpd officers we would push harder for charges but since they claimed to be working with tbi drug agents and the tbi has taken its current stance i have decided to void our warrants on the two civilians involved
2666213 the suspect said that officer lunsford stopped cars for no reason he especially did not like to hear officer lunsford running tags on the radio the suspect said when he lunsford started running tags he would key up his radio microphone and hit it he did this because he did not like to hear him on the radio he said that every time kenny would start running tags one right after the other he would do this at one time his the suspects exact words were every time that expletive gets on the radio i take that mic and at this time he took his hand like it was holding a microphone and started hitting it against his other hand he acted like he was bragging about what he was doing and there wasnt nothing that could be done about it
2666214 the outcome we were hoping for in this case was for the radio to be clear for emergency traffic
2666215 that has been accomplished the person or persons who were doing this not only put my officers life at risk but also put at risk the safety of the citizens of mount carmel church hill and hawkins county as a whole
2666216 i think this thing is going to work just fine
2666217 there are some unreinforced masonry buildings downtown and were aware of those
2666218 many of those have been retrofitted to make them safer but were aware of areas in town that may need a little extra attention
2666219 in escondido youre on those ultra hard granite rocks they transmit energy very efficiently so youre not going to get a lot of die down if theres a brick chimney thats probably going to fall
2666220 youre actually getting more energy hitting the top of the mountain then you are down at the bottom
2666221 since it hasnt had major movement for about 315 years that could easily produce something from a magnitude 7 5 all the way up to a magnitude 8
2666222 what you really need to generate a tsunami is an upward thrust or a down drop
2666223 i think it was a fairly strong earthquake but people are kind of thinking well it wasnt too bad and moving on with their lives which is unfortunate
2666224 are the kids emergency cards at schools up to date
2666225 for safety reasons we dont pre establish routes because things change
2666226 in southern california you have the wildfires and you never know what direction theyre going to come from so if you told people to go to this street and turn left you might be turning them right into the fire
2666227 its what weve been building up to for the last two years
2666228 peter was my best friend and he was really into cb i became involved too later when peter decided to take an amateur radio licensing class it was natural that id go along with my buddy and take the class too
2666229 and here we are years later both advanced class and both working at arrl hq in the same department
2666230 glenn was an enthusiastic arrl staff member and amateur radio operator
2666231 he would even stay after hours to assist me in the product review process and he made me feel at home when i first arrived at arrl hq in addition he got me involved with yccc and serious contesting glenn was a great guy
2666232 i always liked glenn and was happy to have him in the department his death was such a shock
2666233 i am calling on the central government to provide us with the necessary resources not only to be able to bring relief to residents after the disaster but to take measures to prevent or at least minimising the consequences of natural disasters ramnarine said
2666234 to develop proper drainage systems action must be taken to reduce the incidence of flooding which is a perennial problem in so many parts of the region
2666235 our focus must include the reduction if not prevention of the consequences of natural disasters while at the same time employing a management approach to disaster preparedness
2666236 the partnership with ttars is another positive step to be on the alert and to alert the citizenry about the potentials of disasters and as such we have to be prepared for any eventuality

2666265 the clippers made it very difficult for me to go over here with the insurance with them not wanting me to go kaman said
2666266 i was a little disappointed in that at the time with the way they handled stuff they lied to me a couple of times

2666287 if you are going to get injured please have the decency of doing it at the start finish line
2666288 our first unit didnt play that long friday i dont know yet that we can all of a sudden be a pass heavy team and throw the ball all over the place
2666289 with a right tackle that was injured the last half of the year coming back a new left tackle and not very much line depth theres no part of me right now that could tell you we would be able to change right now from where we were last year

2666293 it was crazy my first block out there was zach thomas
2666294 once you do that nothing really worries you anymore once you get out there its football
2666295 we didnt turn it over or have any penalties in the first half thats a good sign that youre not making any silly mistakes in the first preseason game
2666296 ive been definitely able to see progress at training camp and we were able to carry it over from practice to the game
2666297 hopefully by the last preseason game ill be ready and focused to go my timing is messed up right now but ill be alright man
2666298 we didnt play our first group very long offensively and defensively
2666299 that was on purpose one they looked sharp when they were in there two we needed to look at the rest of the guys

2666345 in jan 2007 some political leaders in the congress in order to gain local zilla president posts involved themselves in our organization called themselves chiranjeevi fans and created a disturbance

2666390 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2666391 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2666392 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2666393 i flew into washington national airport and took a taxi to the house of the temple on northwest 16th street upon arriving at the temple i was met by a receptionist who asked if i were there to receive the 33rd degree
2666394 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2666395 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2666396 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

2666399 demo riku i figured out something now you cannot try to replace the person you like with somebody else even though if i try to like somebody else instead of dark san niwa kun for example its not good i do not think i could be happy dont you think its mysterious the person you might live with in the future might be underneath this sky i wonder what that person is doing right now
2666400 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2666401 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2666402 have done a cracking job shes sleeping okay shes eating okay and shes quite fond of vegemite on toast

2666406 i help out a little bit and i really enjoy it
2666407 im just a volunteer but i like to help whenever i can
2666408 let me tell you something ive learned since i retired texas high school coaches do a great job
2666409 this is an incredible honor and im excited about this event
2666410 i was only going to see him twice a year
2666411 now ive got to see him everyday in practice you dont see a guy like that everyday
2666412 hes a beast im getting worn out but its a good thing for me because its just making me better too if you can handle him you can handle pretty much anybody else
2666413 you just have to learn from your mistakes thats what i did and thats how i looked at it
2666414 it doesnt matter if youre joey the milkman or whoever regardless if you go to the super bowl or not you have to learn from your mistakes you get punished for them
2666415 i think the most difficult part is just coming to the realization that youre no longer wanted by your organization
2666416 you spend eight years with an organization and in the blink of an eye youre no longer wanted there
2666417 thats just the crude part of the business thats sometimes hard to accept emotionally physically and mentally i feel good about the situation i actually have an inner peace about it
2666418 im a stubborn guy and i like to catch touchdowns
2666419 i prefer not to play special teams but right now i understand we have a pretty good team and im in this thing 100 percent whatever i can do to help this team im willing to do
2666420 how they prepared for this was im ready this is how im going to do it and this is how im going to get ready
2666421 theyll have to re evaluate their offseason program because when they come back 2009 theyll still just be young guys who didnt do well in the beginning
2666422 we came in prepared enough to do what we could do we had a lot of other distractions but we were in shape it was just a tough deal that we both got hurt
2666423 the conditioning test was just a tough deal we didnt have a lot of time to prepare for it it was thrown at us pretty fast no excuses though we should have passed
2666424 she hasnt shown up and were not out there as e television network looking for her
2666425 the first touchdown felt good because the first team was in there against their first team
2666426 it was crazy my first block out there was zach thomas
2666427 once you do that nothing really worries you anymore once you get out there its football
2666428 we didnt turn it over or have any penalties in the first half thats a good sign that youre not making any silly mistakes in the first preseason game
2666429 ive been definitely able to see progress at training camp and we were able to carry it over from practice to the game
2666430 hopefully by the last preseason game ill be ready and focused to go my timing is messed up right now but ill be alright man
2666431 we didnt play our first group very long offensively and defensively
2666432 that was on purpose one they looked sharp when they were in there two we needed to look at the rest of the guys
2666433 thats not the type of thing he should be doing thats bulk lifting that they had him doing there
2666434 thats exactly what theyve been telling him that he needs to lift and be a powerlifter
2666435 losing a pound was normal to him but because of the bulk lifting stuff he had so many muscles so guess what didnt come off
2666436 its not him losing on the scale theres really more to it than that
2666437 i just want to be best friends with all my customers
2666438 well you said you liked sunflowers the other day so i thought id get you some
2666439 see monty now she thinks im feeling guilty about something i cant win
2666440 one in five women given blooms for no special reason have dispensed with flowery words of thanks and accused their men of having a guilty conscience
2666441 you try not to step on peoples toes but sometimes it happens
2666442 they destroyed his marriage and destroyed him professionally for a time
2666443 it was a shock that all of a sudden hes a raging alcoholic

2666452 i was ashamed when i read the script that id never been more curious about her life actually
2666453 i just assumed that i knew her because of reading her work
2666454 i inherited the image of jane austen as a sort of a dried out old spinster and in doing my research i found she was anything but that she was wonderfully alive very fun a bit naughty and so much so much more alive than id ever thought and so it was wonderful the idea of playing the woman before the icon
2666455 i thought we had the best shot at winning best innovative because what we have done there is come up with a bra specifically for augmented women and we had a doctor who spent over 10 years getting it to fit perfectly so i was sort of surprised we didnt win that one
2666456 i was pleasantly surprised to win for the bustier i was in earlier this year and we had one of the biggest windows of where they were displaying this one item in the window it was quite amazing

2666459 i knew what i was told about the war was totally false
2666460 in 1968 i came back and dan was across the hall at rand
2666461 he had been a total hawk in vietnam but everything about him seemed shattered it was as if he was trying to grow himself back he was going through a metamorphosis he was very tortured there was no way he could justify the war anymore
2666462 i knew that he was the one person with the combination of guts and passionate concern about the war who would take the risk of helping me
2666463 as a party we have to remember we are the big tent and have to make room for people with diverse views on this issue
2666464 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2666465 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2666466 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2666467 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2666468 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2666469 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2666470 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2666479 we cant overestimate how the hatred and prejudice in society affects gay people generally
2666480 the reason weve been oppressed is that people have been able to nail us in the closet now people are talking about us its out in the open it only becomes more apparent what needs to be corrected
2666481 its hard for gay men and women to calculate how much fears like genuine and how much they are paranoid in some places near dance clubs in manhattan teenagers prowl looking to attack the nearest homosexuals
2666482 o ye who believe fear allah and give up what remains of your demand for riba if ye are indeed believers
2666483 if you do it not take notice of war from allah and his messenger but if ye turn back ye shall have your capital sums deal not unjustly and you shall not be dealt with unjustly
2666484 there should be a gap between purchasing the commodity and selling it to the customer and the risk of owning the commodity during the period should be borne with all its basic components and all its essential consequences
2666485 the payment obligations of the firms operating with murabaha financed goods and services are independent of the profitability of the enterprise unlike profit sharing thus exposing it to the charge of being inequitable as in the case of debt financing
2666486 i would prefer that bai muajjal is removed from the list of permissible methods altogether even if we concede its permissibility in legal form we have the overriding legal maxim that anything leading to something prohibited stands prohibited it will be advisable to apply this maxim to baimuajjal in order to save interest free banking from being sabotaged from within
2666487 islam says in clear terms that the lender is not justified in earning a fixed rate of profit irrespective of the operational results of the business
2666488 ideally the real alternatives to interest under an islamic economic system are profit loss sharing and qard hasan
2666489 it is therefore imperative that the use of these methods should be kept to the minimum extent that may be unavoidably necessary under the given conditions and that their use as general techniques of financing must never be allowed
2666490 it would not be advisable to use it widely or indiscriminately in view of the danger attached to it of opening a back door for dealing on the basis of interest
2666491 the basis of this technique though not prohibited according to hanafi and hanabali schools of fiqh and that too in exceptional circumstances its wide spread use is not permissible as mark up does not differ in essence from the interest system
2666492 it is unfortunate that this warning was disregarded and the mark up system was made the pivot of the new arrangements
2666493 the ghost of interest is haunting banks to calculate a fixed rate percent per annum in many modes of financing including murahaba mark up etc the spirit behind all these contracts seems to make a sure earning comparable with prevalent rate of interest and as far as possible avoid losses which otherwise could occur
2666494 they second line techniques have failed to do away with undesirable aspects of interest thereby they have retained what an islamic bank should eliminate
2666495 the major condition for the permissibility of a mark up transaction is that it should not be charged on lending or advancing money it must be based on the genuine sale of a commodity with all its substantive consequences
2666496 murabaha or bia muajjal is a transaction of sale effected on the basis of deferred payment
2666497 we are conscious of the fact that the transaction of a sale of murabaha based on mark up even after fulfilling its necessary conditions is not an ideal mode for the extensive use of islamic banks still the banks will have to resort to this transaction in certain cases especially in the initial phase of transformation
2666498 perhaps the most challenging issue facing the implementation of an islamic financial system is the development of risk bearing instruments that can provide the investors with a sufficient degree of liquidity security and profitability to encourage their holding
2666499 2dly if the same royal prerogative was exerted for the punishment of women convicts it would indisputably produce very happy effects it is to the low and abandoned women that hundreds of young fellows owe their destruction they rob they plunder to support these wretches let it not seem cruel that we make one remark of which we are convinced experience would justify the propriety the execution of ten women would do more public service than that of an hundred men for exclusive of the force of example it would perhaps tend to the preservation of more than an hundred

2666508 they the teeth are absolutely invaluable it underpins everything that we learn about these animals theyre kind of like gold
2666509 having the teeth is quite unique because they were whole family pods and you dont get access to pods in any other way
2666510 to study these animals in the wild if theyre still alive and swimming around you just cant do it so even if you went to do biopsies for skin samples you just cant do it you never get the whole pod
2666511 you can count those ridges and it basically gives you the age of the animal

2666531 laws in violation of private contracts as they amount to aggressions on the rights of those states whose citizens are injured by them may be considered as another probable source of hostility
2666532 obviously where interest rates are is a matter for the reserve bank and it acts independently and we dont speculate on what the reserve bank might do about interest rates
2666533 but if interest rates were to fall then we expect banks to pass that on to mortgage holders
2666534 if you think your bank is giving you a bad deal then shop around and get a better deal she said
2666535 if the reserve bank of australia wants to reduce mortgage interest rates rather than simply prevent further increases in mortgage rates then it needs to act decisively and reduce the cash rate by 50 basis points in september macquarie bank senior economist brian redican said
2666536 of course it could be argued that if the rba did cut interest rates by 25 basis points in september but mortgage rates only fell modestly then the rba could always follow this up with another 25 basis point cut in october mr redican said

2666565 ill make inquiries about the progress of their cases through the indonesian legal and judicial system and again make the point that when those processes have completed that if any of those three still remain the subject of the death penalty well be making a plea for clemency in accordance with our normal processes

2666570 the backstabbing and conflicting strategies that produced an epic meltdown
2666571 i cannot imagine american electing a president during a time of war who is not at his center fundamentally american in his thinking and in his values
2666572 the anger and toxic obsessions overwhelmed even the most reserved beltway wise men
2666573 h er advisers couldnt execute strategy they routinely attacked and undermined each other and clinton never forced a resolution s he never behaved like a chief executive and her own staff proved to be her achilles heel
2666574 what is clear from the internal documents is that clintons loss derived not from any specific decision she made but rather from the preponderance of the many she did not make
2666575 i dont mean to be an asshole but changes to important statements and other critical campaign communications simply have to go through howard
2666576 howard is the person who is ultimately responsibility for making sure that we deliver our messages the right way and i hope everyone will support and respect him in that role
2666577 this circular firing squad that is occurring is unattractive unprofessional unconscionable and unacceptable after this campaign is over there will be plenty of time to access blame or claim credit
2666578 i would be impressed if obama called on nancy pelosi to bring our do nothing congress back into session to hammer out an energy bill that is designed to strip oil of its strategic value and burst the oil speculation bubble

2666593 im definitely not going to show what ive got until the final
2666594 i wasnt expecting for the norway guy to go that fast hes definitely on for his race but everybody else just looks kind of scared the entire semifinal one field sat there to watch my semifinal race and what i was going to do because now ive got everybody thinking why is he going so slow
2666595 i won my first world championships in lane two and that was my breakout meet and im going to be in lane two

2666603 have granted us exclusive jurisdiction for u s troops and dod defense department employees the iraqis can bring forward any concerns on any cases and we may decide to let them handle it
2666604 thats always been on our minds in terms of a scenario we could face

2666606 it demonstrates at the very least that you cannot count on a military jury to throw the book at people
2666607 it doesnt demonstrate the wisdom of the process and it doesnt illustrate the fairness of the process
2666608 they understand chain of command and the relative roles of people and this guy was a nobody
2666609 it is really a question of how a military panel would view a four star generals driver he was a driver this is a decision consistent with their military training and understanding
2666610 we had a court we had a jury it was a military jury they heard the evidence they gave him five months
2666611 that ought to be his sentence either we believe in american justice or we dont
2666612 perhaps its trying to make them ice look more humane

2666615 these members failed to understand the trajectory of the slugs that killed the president he stated he felt this point would be discussed further but of course would represent no problem
2666616 though we did experience some difficulty with all the members of the warren commission ford was of considerable help to the bureau
2666617 we have concluded based on lab access records witness accounts and other information that dr hatfill did not have access to the particular anthrax used in the attacks and that he was not involved in the anthrax mailings
2666618 im not downplaying this race by any means but i have to put that race behind me

2666620 you know it just goes to show that god is universal and god is love and no state man or woman should fear the influence of loving religion

2666623 this is a good testament to the importance you place on u s relations with china
2666624 i looked up and he waved the flag and nodded his head
2666625 that was a pretty cool feeling to have the president say congratulations and have him in the crowd
2666626 i know you came here from the swimming center and would like to offer you my congratulations on the excellent performance of mr phelps
2666627 but the conservative government will not release the report said dimitri soudas a spokesman for mr
2666628 over the past six months i been honoured to serve prime minister harper and canadas new conservative party

2666636 i try to bring a little levity to the situation and make sure that to the degree we can were enjoying this campaign
2666637 we both shared this sort of irreverent sense of humor at what was normally a stuffy social function
2666638 it defeats the purpose of mr khan being an adviser to the prime minister he would then be a pundit rather than an adviser on such an important issue
2666639 all these people are pundits it is tiresome for this prime ministers office to continually take the canadian people for idiots
2666640 if khans entire report is partisan in nature then it would make perfect sense for the pmo to keep it secret you dont give public political advice when you have a private ear why would the tories want the liberals to know their political strategy for selling tory middle eastern policy to muslim voters
2666641 soon after mr dion was elected liberal party leader in early december mr khan contacted his office and offered to share his expertise and serve as an advisor to mr dion on afghanistan mr khan says his call was never returned

2666666 i dont think we understood what it meant to be an olympian and to put on a usa uniform we didnt realize all the people we were representing growing up i never thought about being an olympian all i thought about was playing in the nba
2666667 but in the last couple of years ive come to understand what this is about
2666668 and i know now this is 20 times bigger than an nba championship the whole world is watching here
2666669 the thing is we have a lot of winners on this team i dont have an nba championship or a gold medal but i won three of four state championships in my high school career and we went on to win 109 games and lose just six
2666670 i know what it takes to win and i think i know how to do it the right way on this team i think we all do now we understand what it takes to be an olympian

2666674 i approached him and asked what he was doing out so late he told me in a very matter of fact way that his family were at home asleep and he was going to the shop
2666675 the first my partner and i knew about it was being woken by a policeman at the bottom of the bed which was a real shock
2666676 they said they had found my son but i had no idea he had gone anywhere
2666677 hes very adventurous but its a complete surprise he would do something like this
2666678 when we asked why he went out he said he wanted sweets but in any case he didnt have any money on him
2666679 man i can do this in just a few days if i just work steadily and constantly
2666680 i think that national reconciliation will come about not as some understand it as a reconciliation with this political party governed by an ideology or a specific mentality
2666681 you can go into the street and meet with a sunni in shia areas or with a shia in sunni areas where they live together once again

2666695 the thing i dont want is for this to go to trial and a jury to give him probation

2666709 he said you and your muscleman dont scare me ill protect myself
2666710 that was what i was trying to do 50 years ago and the attorney general of texas stopped me
2666711 when he broke ground on jamaica beach he was only 30 years old a young man with a vision
2666712 it was something very unique when you look at the desolate barren island land then who could have envisioned all the communities on the west end and where they are at today he might have been a little ahead of his time
2666713 jamaica beach was my favorite project because i was so personally involved in it
2666714 the rich people had a second home but the middle class didnt
2666715 the first thing we had to do is convince people they needed a second home and then we had to convince them that jamaica beach is where they wanted to be

2666735 the georgians have dug in at the heights and they dont want to leave our fighters aided by the russians have been trying to flush them out of there
2666736 at this point we are particularly concerned that the conflict appears to be spreading beyond south ossetia into abkhazia
2666737 all of them are waiting for dawn to start active actions
2666738 russias aid arrived a bit too late and the town was completely destroyed we dont have tskhinvali anymore
2666739 georgias aspiration to join nato is driven by its attempt to drag other nations and peoples into its bloody adventures

2666752 to send a firm signal of the iocs moral consideration that this case has brought the olympic movement very much into disrepute
2666753 there was a whole string of events that took place in this sorry tale they really resulted in what the ioc sees as a scandalous saga

2666755 a lot of states actually have laws against beer pong like the drinking aspect of it and they dont actually recognize it as a sport
2666756 its a sport cause its like two players on a team you play against another two players theres a strategy involved
2666757 because we play beer pong at the bars doesnt mean we want to binge drink

2666762 this issue should be discussed i did it before i have done it today and i will continue to do so in the future
2666763 this issue should be discussed i did it before i have done it today and i will continue to do so in the future
2666764 since then we have a great high priest who has passed through the heavens jesus the son of god let us hold fast our confession
2666765 the basis for the patriarchal religion was the natural family order most especially the patriarchal authority handed down from father to son ideally the firstborn often in the form of the blessing
2666766 at this point in salvation history family and church are coextensive houses are domestic sanctuaries meals are sacrifices hearths are altars all because fathers and their firstborn sons are empowered as priests by nature
2666767 melchizedek king of salem who brings out bread and wine
2666768 melchizedek is shem 10 who became a king due to his greatness he was the head of fourteen nations in addition he was a priest he received this from noah his father through the rights of succession
2666769 david was clothed with a robe of fine linen as also were all the levites and david wore a linen ephod
2666770 moreover i declare to you that the lord will build you a house when your days are fulfilled to go to be with your fathers i will raise up your offspring after you one of your own sons and i will establish his kingdom he shall build a house for me and i will establish his throne forever i will be his father and he shall be my son i will not take my steadfast love from him as i took it from him who was before you but i will confirm him in my house and in my kingdom for ever and his throne shall be established forever
2666771 after the development of the israelite monarchy the king is referred to as the first born son king solomon the son of david functions as a priest at the dedication of the temple according to ps 110 4 he is a priest after the order of melchizedek not only because jerusalem is identified with the salem of gen 14 cf ps 76 2 but also because he has received the title of first born son
2666772 everything that the priesthood of the old covenant prefigured finds its fulfillment in christ jesus the one mediator between god and men
2666773 abstains from using the title of priest the reason is that the priesthood he claims is not like the jewish priesthood then in place
2666774 looked out for its own interest and glory and heaped heavy burdens on the ordinary faithful
2666775 those who are called high priests in the texts and who command the highest degree of priestly power within the jewish nation reject the message of the gospel
2666776 it is a fact that in late judaism there was widespread expectation of a priestly messiah a messiah from the house of levi to whom the kingly messiah from the house of judah would be subordinated an ideal priest who would be quite different from the traditional priesthood in which men were so disappointed
2666777 first it was royal and then it is become sacerdotal so therefore also in regard to christ for king indeed he always was but has become priest from the time that he assumed the flesh that he offered the sacrifice
2666778 abolishes the levitical priesthood and restores on a supernatural level the priesthood of the first born sons
2666779 christ is a priest after the order of melchizedek not only because of the foreshadowing of the eucharist in the offering of bread and wine but also because he is the first born son of god as shem melchizedek is the first born son of noah
2666780 the priesthood of jesus acquires its dignity efficacy and duration from the fact that he is the son of god
2666781 see how great he is abraham the patriarch gave him a tithe of the spoils and those descendants of levi who receive the priestly office have a commandment in the law to take tithes from the people that is from their brethren though these also are descended from abraham but this man who has not their genealogy received tithes from abraham and blessed him who had the promises it is beyond dispute that the inferior is blessed by the superior here tithes are received by mortal men there by one of whom it is testified that he lives one might even say that levi himself who receives tithes paid tithes through abraham for he was still in the loins of his ancestor when melchizedek met him
2666782 but if he who bears a type of christ is so much better not merely than the priests but even than the forefather himself of the priests what should one say of the reality thou seest how superabundantly the author of hebrews shows the superiority
2666783 the author of the epistle to the hebrews has in his mind a priesthood which is universal has been in the world from the beginning and possesses an unbroken life of growth running up at last into the perfect achievement of our lord jesus christ in genesis he found a record of a king priest not israels race who was nevertheless recognized by the founder of israel and is entitled by the author of genesis priest of god most high he blessed abraham that is he stood on his godward side through him on that day in the far off beginnings of the worlds history abraham drew near to god the author has also to shew that this ancient abiding universal priesthood has never been superseded by the levitical but has gone on side by side with it and at last outstays the aged and worn out levitical institution and ready for his purposes he found a psalm in which a later king of israel is hailed priest after the order of melchizedek the narrative in genesis and the appeal to it in the later psalm give him the illustration the argument above all the name he wants and he describes this priesthood as priesthood after the order of melchizedek
2666784 luke is unmistakably presenting jesus in the narrative as a priest a priest not in virtue of his being a levite but in virtue of his being a first born son
2666785 w hy did jesus accept a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins theologians have often answered correctly it seems by stating that jesus baptism identified him with israel as her sin bearing substitute jesus was baptized when all the people were being baptized this fits snugly with a priestly interpretation for the high priest was the old covenant sin bearer
2666786 genealogies were particularly important for priestly houses to qualify for service israels priests had to prove descent from aaron and later from zadok thus the genealogy of the pentateuch runs from adam to aaron while lukes runs from the melchizedekan priest jesus back to adam
2666787 jesus when he began his ministry was about thirty years of age
2666788 the blessing of the little children the exorcisms and expulsions of demons and especially the forgiveness of sins whereby christ reconciled men to god the name the holy one of god mk 1 24 cf jn 6 69 which is given christ by a possessed person is sometimes said to be a priestly title since priests were said to be consecrated to their god lv 21 6 2 chr 23 6 35 3 and the high priests were said to wear on his turban a plate with the inscribed words consecrated to yahweh ex 28 36 jesus liked to apply to himself psalm 110 in which the messiah is a king and a priest according to the order of melchizedek mk 12 35 36 14 62 in luke 24 51 jesus blesses his disciples as he leaves them and ascends to heaven this solemn blessing seems to recall the blessing given either by the high priest cf si 50 22 or by melchizedek in whom the letter to the hebrews sees a prefiguration of christ the priest
2666789 our lord had always pictured the kingdom as a feast
2666790 all the mystery of the kingdom is contained and expressed in the eucharist
2666791 every time the new testament speaks of christs role by alluding to the self offering of the servant of yahweh it is implicitly presenting jesus to us as the priest of the new covenant the accounts of the institution of the eucharist in which jesus refers to isaiah 53 he gives as food and drink his own body and blood that are offered for mankind in his passion are usually considered to be an implicit testimony to his priestly status
2666792 according to leviticus 16 the jewish high priest sacrificed two victims for sin then entered the holy of holies and sprinkled the throne of mercy with the blood of the victims this final action was the decisive one for the expiation of sins the death of christ on the cross corresponds to the immolation of the two victims by the high priest and the ascension of christ corresponds to the high priests entrance into the holy of holies as well as to the sprinkling of the throne of mercy with the blood of victims
2666793 christs priesthood cannot be more perfect by reason of the union of the priest and the victim and of the dignity of the latter
2666794 a supreme liturgy in which the beautiful fruits of grace would be poured out upon the world and enter the hearts of the faithful through the channels of baptism the holy eucharist and the other sacraments
2666795 discusses the tabernacle or temple more than any other new testament book except perhaps for johns apocalypse which gives prolonged descriptions of the heavenly temple the author speaks more of the tabernacle than the temple but what he says of the former also applies to the latter
2666796 part of jesus doing what adam should have done included establishing the new temple and extending it obediently
2666797 on easter day christs body became the temple of the new people the place where they gathered together their point of unity the dwelling place of glory where the multitude would rest in adoration contemplating the face of god and hearing his word there they would come to offer the sacrifice of praise and expiation they would adore and beseech in the past the jews used to pray in a stone temple in jerusalem but the hour has come when the true adorers adore in spirit and in truth in the glorified christ the true temple of gods holiness and in the spirit of god the supreme truth and divine holiness who filled christ on easter morning
2666798 the church will exist in her fulness only where the priesthood of christ through christian worship continues to be exercised
2666799 christian worship is the place of passage through which the double current of love mounts from earth up to heaven and from heaven down to earth
2666800 suffers sheds his own blood operates through his own will but through his own will lost and found in the will of god that is he obeys and therefore governs natural law and is not bound by artificial rules
2666801 one cult and one liturgy are at the heart of christianity the blood soaked cross remains forever planted at the center of the true religion
2666802 fine he can go ill just be like keble and pusey then who stayed behind
2666803 to be a student of history is to cease to be protestant
2666804 well its because i have to remove the dog house to do the test
2666805 if you pull the dog house off which takes all of about 45 seconds ill do it for 45
2666806 unknown god in the account of acts 17 cast off his pagan ways and submitting himself to christ became a christian
2666807 valla introduced a wide range of historical and philological arguments
2666808 doubtful whether the areopagite wrote anything at all the term areopagite denotes a judge not a philosopher furthermore the claim of dionysius in one of the letters ep 7 2 that he observed the eclipse of the sun at the hour of the saviors death outside of palestine is as blatant a fiction as the epistolary form of the report
2666809 it is known that george of scythopolis johns successor wrote the ps dionysius of alexandria
2666810 will always occupy a prominent place among the curiosities of literature and among the most remarkable systems of mystic philosophy
2666811 an absolutely simple god frameworks for reading pseudo dionysius areopagite
2666812 an absolutely simple god frameworks for reading pseudo dionysius areopagite
2666813 in any case after philoponus the only explanation given for the resemblances between proclus and the dionysius was that proclus had borrowed his own theories from dionysius
2666814 either god has revealed himself to us giving us a lasting message of truth and provided that this truth be preserved secure and certain through an office capable of teaching the truth without error or he has not revealed himself at all at least not definitively and once and for all in christ
2666815 w hile apostles were on earth there was the display neither of bishop nor pope their power had no prominence as being exercised by apostles
2666816 st john was equal to pope st clement with respect to the power of executing christs plan for example in founding local churches st clement was superior to st john with respect to the authority of governing the church universal but st john was able to compose inspired canonical books
2666817 is the heir of the ecumenical hierarchy of the fourth century
2666818 according to leo the primatial role of the roman see was founded on two facts the intimate union of christ and peter and the legacy of peters ministry that survives in his vicars the bishops of rome
2666819 will be able to appreciate the reverence with which the apostolic see observes the rules of the holy fathers by reading my writings in which i have rejected the claims of the bishop of constantinople and you will understand that i am with the help of the lord the guardian of the catholic faith and of the decrees of the fathers
2666820 made a claim to universal sovereignty implying an authority which extended over both spiritual and temporal realms
2666821 asserted that the roman church had never departed from the way of truth to embrace any error whatever
2666822 and this could not be secured unless any question of faith that may arise be decided by him who presides over the whole church so that the whole church may hold firmly to his decision
2666823 the proximate premises for papal infallibility are present but the conclusion is never explicitly drawn
2666824 is to be obeyed by all catholics as an unerring standard in faith and morals
2666825 it is primarily the pope who is infallible the churchs infallibility is prior to that of the pope only as a final cause but not as an efficient cause the former idea of the church as the primary reality that then in a certain sense transfers its own truth to its presiding head is now interpreted in such a way that the causality takes its beginning from the top and then penetrates the whole
2666826 is generally confessed now even by protestant historians viz that the concentration of ecclesiastical power in the previous centuries was simply necessary for the civilization of europe
2666827 the traditional belief where necessary by promulgating it in the form of a dogma that is a formula that is taken as a norm and is legally binding
2666828 exercised only when the magisterium is forced to do so by the threat to the faith of the church brought about by a nascent heresy
2666829 only such a center can be an effective protection against the drift into dependence on political systems or the pressures emanating from our civilization only by having such a center can the faith of christians secure a clear voice in the confusion of ideologies
2666830 the very idea of revelation implies a present informant and guide and that an infallible one if christianity is both social and dogmatic and intended for all ages it must humanly speaking have an infallible expounder else you will secure unity of form at the loss of unity of doctrine or unity of doctrine at the loss of unity of form you will have to choose between a comprehension of opinions and a resolution into parties between latitudinarian and sectarian error
2666831 it appears that olivi by no means played the key role in the development of the doctrine of infallibility that tierney ascribes to him on the one hand the earlier period of the decretists and still more that of high scholasticism with thomas aquinas and bonaventure came closer to the doctrine than tierney acknowledges on the other hand the crucial next step was not taken by olivi and the authors who followed him but only occurred as a result of the conciliarist debates beginning in the fifteenth century
2666832 if a question arises as to what the apostolic doctrine is on a particular point she has infallibility promised to her to enable her to answer correctly
2666833 the progress of the whole people of god depends in the highest degree on the ministry of priests
2666834 differ widely in style and emphasis but the fundamental project remains the same arguments about the doctrine of the trinity elaborate treatises on the nature of language signification and metaphysics as well as homilies sermons and practical exhortations to spiritual purification all these dynamic and developing features of early christian theology were organized around the singular goal of maximizing the grip of scripture on the imagination of the early church
2666835 students should be shown what the fathers of the church both of the east and west have contributed towards the faithful transmission and elucidation of each of the revealed truths
2666836 the new decree was to be for the church today what the seminary decree of trent was for the stormy age of the reformation
2666837 continuity with existing traditions and the adaptation to present circumstances with their demands had to be harmonized
2666838 was the strong emphasis on a new orientation in seminary education
2666839 many complained of what they considered the dry juridical and somewhat negative tone of the document
2666840 three norms are mentioned as having guided the decree the laws that had proved themselves over long experience the new orientations that had been won in the council and the concrete need of the world today
2666841 the following order should be observed in the treatment of dogmatic theology biblical themes should have first place then students should be shown what the fathers of the church both of the east and west have contributed towards the faithful transmission and elucidation of each of the revealed truths then the later history of the dogma including its relation to the general history of the church lastly in order to throw as full a light as possible on the mysteries of salvation the students should learn to examine more deeply with the help of speculation and with st thomas as teacher all aspects of these mysteries and to perceive their interconnection they should be taught to discern them always present and effective in liturgical actions and in the entire life of the church they should learn to seek the solution of human problems in the light of revelation to apply its eternal truths to the changing conditions of human affairs and to express them in language which people of the modern world will understand
2666842 the original text mentioned only patres in order to emphasize explicitly the importance of eastern theology the text was made more specific through the
2666843 at present students know neither greek nor latin if they are not even acquainted with latin it is utopian to provide them a formation in patristics translating the fathers into modern languages impoverishes them and renders many of their insights and even their basic notions quite unintelligible translation thus deprives the original terms of vigor and charm since they are polyvalent in themselves and can be understood only in relationship to other analogous terms translations also impede making spontaneous comparisons between the text of scriptures the personal style of a particular author and its similarity with the style of other fathers or of conciliar statements thus translations have limits of all kinds exegetical and dogmatic that block any endeavor to comprehend the fathers if mastering latin is very important then mastering both latin and greek is still more important the great fathers as well as the great councils made use of greek or latin
2666844 should acquire a knowledge of latin which will enable them to understand and make us of so many scientific sources and of the documents of the church
2666845 the study of the fathers of the church has been regarded for centuries as a sine qua non in the formation of the catholic theologian
2666846 as long as christian theology is anchored in its normative tradition i e seeks a continuity with credal and magisterial orthodoxy it needs the study of early christian thought in order to apprehend the origins of its understanding of god christ humankind the cosmic
2666847 time when the christian religion became condensed into that basic format which is still recognizable today
2666848 it was in the spirit of the council that the study of scriptures had to be the first of the theological disciplines to be discussed
2666849 apart from the actual study of scripture biblical thinking should also govern the daily reading of the scripture become the personal possession of the student and shape his whole attitude to life
2666850 any student who picks up a treatise by one of the fathers cannot but notice the intensely scriptural focus
2666851 in order to appreciate the richness of revelation the students must pursue it further in the chief phases of the tradition of the church in the patristics of the east and west
2666852 witnesses to a tradition inherited from the apostles and scholars qualified to transmit and interpret in an authentic way the truths revealed within and beyond the scriptures
2666853 avoid passing trends all the better if they link patristics with knowledge of the revealed sources
2666854 should love and reverence the most blessed virgin mary who was given as a mother to the disciples by jesus christ as he was dying on the cross
2666855 hail we say o holy and mystic trinity who have called us together in this church dedicated to mary mother of god
2666856 students should learn to live according to the standard of the gospel to be firmly established in faith hope and charity so that the practice of these virtues may develop in them a spirit of prayer may strengthen and protect their vocation and invigorate their other virtues intensifying their zeal for winning all men to christ
2666857 the fathers a good number of whom were monks committed christian ascetics did not regard the life of prayer conscious striving for union with god in christ and his spirit as irrelevant to the practice of theology
2666858 students should be thoroughly penetrated with a sense of the mystery of the church
2666859 a man possesses the holy spirit in the measure in which he loves the church
2666860 by charity if we rejoice in the catholic name and faith
2666861 a share in the whole life of the church which expresses itself not only in legal norms but in the church movements that renew it because christ is at work in them
2666862 holiness of the fathers must be brought to mind their virtue as instruments docile to the holy spirit guarantees the truth of their testimony this same spirit which inspired the sources of revelation granted the fathers both officially as pastors of the church and individually as
2666863 they bear witness to the resurrection in a future life
2666864 that which is promised to us is already present with you and the object of your prayers is with you ye are of this world and yet not in this world this age has held you but has not been able to retain you but what a great thing it is that angels because of incontinence fell from heaven into this world that virgins because of chastity passed from the world into heaven
2666865 you should before all things maintain the barriers of chastity as also you do knowing that you are the temple of the lord members of christ the habitation of the holy spirit elected to hope consecrated to faith destined to salvation sons of god brethren of christ associates of the holy spirit owing nothing any longer to the flesh as born again of water that the chastity over and above the will which we should always desire to be ours may be afforded to us also on account of the redemption that that which has been consecrated by christ might not be corrupted for you adorn it while you exhibit it and in its exercise you set forth its more abundant praises being made its ornament while it also is yours each lending and borrowing honor from the other it adds to you the discipline of good morals you confer upon it the ministry of saintly works for how much and what it can effect has on the one hand been manifest by your means and on the other it has shown and taught what you are wishing for chastity is the dignity of the body the ornament of morality the sacredness of the sexes the bond of modesty the source of purity the peacefulness of home the crown of concord
2666866 precious gift of god which they should ask for humbly and to which they should hasten to respond freely and generously under the inspiration and with the assistance of the holy spirit
2666867 it is only on the basis of tradition that the actual systematic work of theology can begin which seeks to penetrate speculatively the entire content of the revelation that has been handed down and to grasp its inner connections
2666868 on a celebrated occasion thomas aquinas declared that he would exchange all of paris for a certain commentary of the fourth century archbishop of constantinople john chrysostom ca 347 407 on st matthews gospel

2666878 the attacks are occurring in regions of georgia far from the zone of conflict in south ossetia they mark a dangerous escalation in the crisis
2666879 this is about annihilation of a democracy on their borders
2666880 we on our own cannot fight with russia we want immediate cease fire immediate cessation of hostilities separation of russia and georgia and international mediation
2666881 the actions of the georgian powers in south ossetia are of course a crime first of all against their own people
2666882 the territorial integrity of georgia has suffered a fatal blow
2666883 we have urged an immediate halt to the violence and a stand down by all troops we call for an end to the russian bombings and a return by the parties to the status quo
2666884 our units are well equipped with anti tank rockets and they thwarted a russian tank attack
2666885 whatever side is used to bomb civilians and the positions of peacekeepers this side is not safe and they should know this
2666886 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2666887 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2666888 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2666889 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2666890 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2666891 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2666892 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2666893 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2666937 we will not rest until duke and the fascist president of the university gergiev tchokin rot in jail
2666938 no matter how many examinations david duke has passed the volume of his research number of academic citations of his dissertation or the cleverness of his literary style his work libels the jewish people it concludes that zionism is an ideology of ethnic supremacy and that israel is a jewish supremacist state its all a lie in truth israel is the only true democracy in the mideast
2666939 no matter how camouflaged in pseudo intellectualism his historical and scientific inquiry for such anti semitic writings he should be stripped of his doctors robes and given a prison uniform we will not rest until duke and the fascist president of the university gergiev tchokin rot in jail
2666940 soon their only choices for a leader will be a mass murderer such as ariel sharon of sabre and shatila or a maniac who wants to ethnically cleanse all of palestine benjamin netanyahu

2666950 were gonna turn a sixteen year old kid into what would be our last hope for survival and if things escalate which they probably will can we count on him to be that last resort for us you all know as well as i do that zycort is more powerful than any field operator we have in this building and he can tear this place to pieces in a matter of minutes that kid is our only hope of challenging him do we think we can really do that
2666951 the issue were primarily faced with right now is are we really prepared to do what needs to be done is t 367 as a whole prepared for this kind of event and unfortunately no one in front of me right now can vouche for this kid except for one person bill
2666952 youve spent the most time with him how do you weigh in
2666953 least i can say that we can use him i agree with stephanie on her point this kid is one of the most dogged people ive ever met hes been able to roll with punches better than any of us ever expected we all can agree on that point but hes also very smart too hes a deep thinker and he just gets it he understands what were asking of him i know some of you may have trouble believing that but i do he can wrap his head around the concept and for me thats reassuring logistical thinker somewhat steady emotions and a strong sense of self preservation that together means we have a superhero again to say the least

2666992 i strongly condemn the outbreak of violence in georgia and urge an immediate end to armed conflict
2666993 now is the time for georgia and russia to show restraint and to avoid an escalation to full scale war georgias territorial integrity must be respected
2666994 t he news reports indicate that russian military forces crossed an internationally recognized border into the sovereign territory of georgia russia should immediately and unconditionally cease its military operations and withdraw all forces from sovereign georgian territory
2666995 the government of georgia has called for a ceasefire and for a resumption of direct talks on south ossetia with international mediators the u s should immediately work with the eu and the osce to put diplomatic pressure on russia to reverse this perilous course that it has chosen
2666996 immediately and unconditionally cease its military operations and withdraw all forces from sovereign georgian territory
2666997 john mccains top foreign policy adviser lobbied for and has a vested interest in the republic of georgia and mccain has mirrored the position advocated by the government
2666998 we sealed off the areas where teams dont normally do well against barcelona
2666999 they didnt make a lot of chances going to old trafford at 0 0 we have a marvellous chance
2667000 they had a lot of play around the box but our concentration was very good
2667001 on the negative side we should have done better with possession we had opportunities to counter attack but gave the ball away too easily
2667002 its not easy to beat barca because they play fantastic football but several things won us the game
2667003 the concentration at the back we protected the space really well and with our play up front we could have scored three or four goals
2667004 i think we were too nervous in the first half but in the second half we played with much more conviction
2667005 towards the end of the game they had a go and were very glad we got through that spell in the last 15 minutes
2667006 it was a bit of a hang on job but they didnt really make any chances and thats down to our defence
2667007 sometimes the referee is in a bad position but he was five yards away from kuyt and it was 100 per cent
2667008 its difficult to understand how we did not win the game we had a lot of possession and a lot of chances
2667009 i think weve something really special here theres something really special with this team and we want to go there and show were a special team
2667010 i feel good because our target was to be in the semi final of the champions league and we did it
2667011 perhaps he is looking for something to destabilise us before the match
2667012 benitez was a manager i respected a lot until now i found him not only very competent but also classy
2667013 but he has really disappointed me here his words demonstrate a weakness a top manager would never go so low to attack a player
2667014 maybe he should concentrate on his own teams game and if he wants me to stay on my feet maybe he should tell his defenders to stop hitting me
2667015 in the first leg carragher and the other one skrtel didnt stop and not just with me i finished the match with bruises everywhere
2667016 last year i broke a rib against liverpool in the champions league semi final strangely that escapes the statistics of benitez
2667017 it will not affect me if i fall i will always get up the best response i can give will be on the pitch
2667018 he has more weapons in attack with fernando torres in particular
2667019 but i find them less balanced and more vulnerable in defence they give you more space
2667020 the liverpool of 2005 and 2007 defended better but the team is still very strong
2667021 there was a lot of tension and emotion on the pitch it was a big match and we clashed
2667022 these things happen and five minutes later everything was forgotten
2667023 ballack is someone i really appreciate as a player and as a man he has had to work really hard this season but he has come back very strong
2667024 he is making the difference he is chelseas most important player at the moment
2667025 we need to score one goal and maybe that will be enough
2667026 chelsea will be under pressure their supporters will be expecting something special and you cannot defend at home and lose 1 0
2667027 their supporters will not be happy with that so chelsea need to attack and we need to attack so it will be a very open game
2667028 torres has the mentality to reach the final he wants to play and he is very focused and can concentrate
2667029 for him to be in a european cup final in his first season at liverpool is a dream he wants to experience
2667030 maybe chelsea will be under more pressure they want to win but they know they have failed at this stage three times recently
2667031 their fans will try to push them to the final but the same applies to our fans because we want the trophy too
2667032 even if we concede it still means we must score if we score then chelsea have big problems because they must get two and if we get another then they will have to score three it is tougher for them in such a situation
2667033 it could be penalties again but i have great faith in pepe reina and i know that if fernando torres has the sort of chances this time that he missed in the first leg then he will not miss them a second time chelsea must be aware of that
2667034 i was clear after watching a lot of games i believe everyone would have the same idea everybody can see it in the games

2667053 most militaries maintain a military intelligence corps with specialized intelligence units for collecting information in specific ways militaries also typically have intelligence staff personnel
2667054 critical vulnerabilities are indexed in a way that makes them easily available to advisors and line intelligence personnel who package this information for policy makers and war fighters vulnerabilities are usually indexed by the nation and military unit with a list of possible attack methods
2667055 critical threats are usually maintained in a prioritized file with important enemy capabilities analyzed on a schedule set by an estimate of the enemys preparation time for example nuclear threats between the ussr and the us were analyzed in real time by continuously on duty staffs in contrast analysis of tank or army deployments are usually triggered by accumulations of fuel and munitions which are monitored on slower every few days cycles in some cases automated analysis is performed in real time on automated data traffic
2667056 packaging threats and vulnerabilities for decision makers is a crucial part of military intelligence a good intelligence officer will stay very close to the policy maker or war fighter to anticipate their information requirements and tailor the information needed a good intelligence officer will ask a fairly large number of questions in order to help anticipate needs perhaps even to the point of annoying the principal for an important policy maker the intelligence officer will have a staff to which research projects can be assigned
2667057 developing a plan of attack is not the responsibility of intelligence though it helps an analyst to know the capabilities of common types of military units generally policy makers are presented with a list of threats and opportunities they approve some basic action and then professional military personnel plan the detailed act and carry it out once hostilities begin target selection often moves into the upper end of the military chain of command once ready stocks of weapons and fuel are depleted logistic concerns are often exported to civilian policy makers

2667217 we anticipate that there could be a signing after the leaders have met to thrash out the remaining issues

2667219 m s de cuatro a os de su vida gastaron mar a y eduardo en un noviazgo aparentemente feliz que se acab cuando terminaron la carrera que estudiaron juntos fue como si hubieran agotado los temas de conversaci n que ten an en la universidad para entrar en una competencia profesional que lejos de dar trascendencia a su relaci n marcaba territorios incompatibles finalmente eduardo confes que cuando se dio cuenta de que su noviazgo le reclamaba mas formalidad tuvo miedo de continuar porque necesitaba tiempo para saber si mar a era la mujer con quien realmente deseaba pasar el resto de su vida su caso es el de cada vez m s parejas modernas que huyen de la responsabilidad como del demonio incluso cuando ya tienen todo preparado para la boda quiz s no supieron nunca que el verdadero amor no se traduce en sentir bonito cuando se est frente a la pareja y que tampoco significa estar de acuerdo en todo lo que se hace porque cuando realmente se ama a alguien se adquiere el compromiso moral de ayudarlo respetuosamente a ser mejor a que crezca como ser humano en todos los aspectos cuando los j venes sue an con encontrar al pr ncipe azul o a la s per mujer para ser felices siempre tendr n que plantearse con toda seriedad si no est n esquizofr nicos porque un mundo as solo se da en las letras o en las telenovelas donde navegamos a merced de la imaginaci n del autor pero no en el mundo donde el creador ha dispuesto para los hombres la felicidad y el sufrimiento los logros y los fracasos la aceptaci n y el rechazo y la lucha constante y permanente desde que nacemos hasta que dejamos de respirar hace poco llego a mis manos una informaci n de cimac en la que martha celia herrera psicoterapeuta del centro de interdisciplina conductuales asegura que las mujeres aun hoy conservan la expectativa de encontrar a un hombre maduro productivo estable rico inteligente paternal que cambie pa ales que las acompa e al pediatra que sepa preparar papillas que sea una excelente pareja tierno que externe sus emociones que no pida relaciones intimas cuando ella est enojada que sea emp tico ellos entre tanto buscan a la mujer de sus sue os productiva inteligente excelente anfitriona que desee uno o dos hijos cuando l lo decida que no pida dinero que sea autosuficiente independiente y aut noma que colabore en la econom a familiar y que cuide a los ni os que lave planche cocine y tenga bien arreglada la casa adem s de que se d tiempo para cuidar su apariencia que siempre est s per delgada que sea vea sexy etc etc la doctora herrera dice que con la revoluci n sexual y el feminismo se rompi el equilibrio tradicional entre el papel que correspond a a los hombres y el que estaba destinado a las mujeres los varones se asustan frente a las mujeres que compiten con ellos en su espacio laboral y que a menudo est n m s calificadas que ellos y esa amenaza a veces se extiende al campo sentimental influye tambi n que se dividieron los roles pero nunca quedaron delineados ahora la mujer tiene m s actividades que antes porque debe estudiar trabajar y atender a su familia hecho que resulta desconcertante para todos las expectativas femeninas y las masculinas son irreales y poco objetivas muchos ni siquiera son capaces de expresar lo que esperan del otro yo no soy psicoterapeuta pero se que en la vida nada es m gico ni gratuito los hombres y las mujeres hemos sido siempre los mismos aunque las circunstancias han cambiado y en este rengl n no tan positivamente como seria deseable hoy queremos que todo sea f cil y desechable pero eso no es posible en las personas nadie est ya hecho la vida entera no nos alcanza a veces para irnos moldeando seg n nuestras metas y proyectos de la misma manera dos seres inacabados que tendr an que estar conscientes de que van a esculpirse juntos durante toda la vida anhelar un pr ncipe azul o una s per mujer junto a nosotros no es un pecado pero si puede llegar a convertirse en un obst culo para ser felices al lado de un ser humano de carne y hueso con potencialidades y miserias que como nosotros necesita comprensi n y verdadero amor para perfeccionarse poco a poco si hoy tantas relaciones se rompen despu s de un tiempo de tratarse en su noviazgo es precisamente porque no estamos dispuestos a trabajar para forjar una relaci n sana sincera basada en el verdadero amor que no es solo romanticismo sino prueba constante de fidelidad comunicaci n respeto y de humanidad curiosamente la doctora herrera concluye que mientras estudian licenciaturas maestr as y doctorados hombres y mujeres no se dan tiempo para habilitarse en pareja para hablar de si mismos todo eso se queda guardado y cuando cumplen 30 a os o m s deciden tener un compa ero suponen que como por arte de magia contar n con habilidades que no desarrollaron porque nunca se dieron tiempo para hacerlo para relacionarse con otra persona hay que estar dispuesto a negociar a manejar enojos a discutir no pelear porque aunque existan puntos de vista diferentes es posible conseguir objetivos que satisfagan a los dos dice la doctora pero eso cuesta quiz s el problema radica en que nadie desea comprometerse a entablar la lucha por lograrlo demasiado ego smo dir a yo cada d a son m s las mujeres y hombres profesionistas independientes inteligentes y de exito que ven pasar los a os sin encontrar pareja personas de todas las clases sociales se encuentran frente al mismo problema son solteros y solteras se han quedado atrapados as en un espacio dentro de la sociedad actual muy limitado en cuanto a diversiones y actividades y se les dificulta mucho encontrar personas en su misma situaci n ya no se diga para casarse sino simplemente para acompa arse y entablar una buena amistad ya no existe la palabra solter n a y su imagen ha cambiado 180 grados ya no es el hombre o la mujer gris amargada vestido como fraile o monja seg n sea el caso ahora son seres impecables atractivos as de muy buen car cter que van supliendo la juventud con personalidad y desarrollo humano e intelectual que hay demasiadas mujeres y pocos hombres es una idea que se escucha todos los d as y que ha llegado a penetrar profundo en la conciencia de las mujeres de todos los estratos sociales este punto se da como un hecho apoyado en estad sticas generalmente falsas o bastante caprichosas a un n mero determinado de mujeres les corresponde un n mero equivalente de hombres a diferencia de la idea com n de que por cada hombre hay cinco o seis mujeres pero la soledad no es exclusiva de aquellas personas que son solteras hay mujeres que aun estando rodeadas de mucha gente llegan a sentirse muy solas y a sufrir de carencias afectivas tambi n entre mujeres y hombres casadas os que comparten su vida con su pareja es frecuente encontrar solas acompa adas para poder amar verdaderamente hay que renunciar a creer que ese sentimiento es el fin de la soledad y estar dispuestos a aceptar dos soledades la del otro y la propia y es que amor es confesar si yo te amo como tu eres aunque no correspondas a mis sue os y a mis esperanzas tu realidad me da mucho m s regocijo que mis sue os

2667233 the policeman involved in the kidnapping was close to this family they tried to kill them the girls to prevent them from telling the truth
2667234 bocog is deeply saddened to learn of the tragic attack on two relatives of the coach for the united states mens volleyball team
2667235 beijing is a safe city but unfortunately we are not immune to violent attacks
2667236 with regards to the games we think we have sufficient security measures we hope to make sure people have a good experience but at the same time their safety will be assured
2667237 i would like to express my heartfelt sympathy to you and the family of the victims over this unfortunate incident
2667238 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2667239 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2667240 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2667241 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2667242 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2667243 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2667244 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2667245 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2667246 so how long will you stay in the united states
2667247 thats close in american airspace they would never allow that
2667248 behold i see the heavens opened and the son of man standing at the right hand of god
2667249 nach dem rennen habe ich gesehen wie der pr sident mit der fahne geschwenkt und mir den daumen nach oben gezeigt hat das war ein gro er und bewegender moment
2667250 ich habe meinem coach gesagt dass ich ber diese distanz nicht mehr schwimmen mag
2667251 dieser platz war in etwa realistisch trotzdem sind wir traurig dass es nicht zu mehr gereicht hat
2667252 our partnership with brussels airlines is particularly good for the clients of both airline companies as our route networks essentially are complementary as opposed to overlapping airbaltic has an excellent range of products in terms of flights to cis countries baltic countries and regional centres in scandinavia while brussels airlines offers attractive destinations in africa
2667253 the airline sector is in trouble losses this year could reach us 6 1 billion more than wiping out the us 5 6 billion that airlines made in 2007 falling demand and rising costs are re shaping the industry
2667254 to survive the crisis urgent action is needed airports and air navigation service providers must come to the table with efficiencies that deliver cost savings labour must understand that efficiency is the only path to job security and governments must stop crazy taxation and give airlines the freedom to merge and consolidate where it makes business sense
2667255 the piperjet exhibited excellent control response around all three axes
2667256 the ergonomics and the basic operation of the side stick control were excellent with well balanced and harmonized control inputs required for the air speeds that we tested moreover the expected level of pitch trim change with power applications was minimal and easy to overcome
2667257 the result is a strong performance in a highly challenging environment it marks the reward for the hard work that has been invested by all of the lufthanseats and all of the groups companies such as swiss it is the result of careful precautions
2667258 the undoubtedly very good first half result should not allow us to lose sight of the major challenges that lie ahead our company has the great opportunity to emerge relatively stronger from the increasingly difficult market and competition situation that we find ourselves in we have laid the foundations and will not jeopardize our future we have shown in the past that we are prepared for these kinds of situations and are capable of reacting to them our financial strength and operating adaptability will grant us the opportunity to remain profitable and strong and to continue to make our company more attractive for our shareholders customers and employees
2667259 although we defeat about rice but we must be the winner about trend
2667260 this issue should be discussed i did it before i have done it today and i will continue to do so in the future

2667264 i strongly condemn the outbreak of violence in georgia and urge an immediate end to armed conflict
2667265 now is the time for georgia and russia to show restraint and to avoid an escalation to full scale war georgias territorial integrity must be respected
2667266 t he news reports indicate that russian military forces crossed an internationally recognized border into the sovereign territory of georgia russia should immediately and unconditionally cease its military operations and withdraw all forces from sovereign georgian territory
2667267 the government of georgia has called for a ceasefire and for a resumption of direct talks on south ossetia with international mediators the u s should immediately work with the eu and the osce to put diplomatic pressure on russia to reverse this perilous course that it has chosen
2667268 immediately and unconditionally cease its military operations and withdraw all forces from sovereign georgian territory
2667269 john mccains top foreign policy adviser lobbied for and has a vested interest in the republic of georgia and mccain has mirrored the position advocated by the government
2667270 we shall pay any price bear any burden meet any hardship support any friend oppose any foe in order to assure the survival and the success of liberty
2667271 civilizations flourish the most where the masses are passionate about their liberties
2667272 ive been running this race since i was 13 years old
2667273 third was my best coming into today and to win it is a dream come true for me
2667274 im really excited to win it was my second time running it competitively
2667275 i wanted to run the first 10km hard i didnt want to leave it until the final 4km because its pretty easy from there
2667276 i started running when i was at school so it would be 50 or 60 years
2667277 ran away from the teachers to wag and hide and ive never stopped
2667278 this year i was just happy to make it over the finish line
2667279 last year i was waiting at the finish with a bandana on my head and no hair
2667280 it seems obvious that the nation is no longer able to wage war and its ability to defend its own shores is doubtful
2667281 said declaration does not comprise any demand which prejudices the prerogatives of his majesty as sovereign ruler
2667282 i got into an email discourse over the car and i came off of it thinking
2667283 the agent said we are going to be watching him we cant be watching you
2667284 many of the freshman students and my junior peers for that matter are shy about critiquing the work of others and are embarrassed to allow others to see their own work
2667285 however not one of them have made a complaint about the actual wiki or weblog in itself
2667286 stephs connection with the students seems to be on a level as an advisor and friend
2667287 i find rhetorical writing difficult but depth is a must without examples and details there is a lack of interest in the piece
2667288 the wiki and the blogs create a dialogue between writers
2667289 by allowing her classes to use the wiki as a resource for learning steph is creating a classroom

2667324 het was erg warm in london het is geen geheim dat ik niet van behas houd het kan gebeuren dat borsten uit je shirt vallen
2667325 de britse twintiger vindt het dan ook belachelijk dat mensen het incident als een publiciteitsstunt zien
2667326 she has earned the trust and respect of fellow leaders big leaders like president hu jintao
2667327 you can name any other leader there but our president was chosen to sit at the head table it shows the respect of the chinese leader and the chinese people for her and i have seen it other world fora where she has been able to hold her own have her views listened to and accepted by world leaders
2667328 today the philippines china relations are at an all time high in fridays luncheon for 80 heads of government only a dozen were at the head table kasama dito ang pangulo ng pilipinas the president of the philippines was one of them of the 80 not all can have bilateral meetings with hu but in groups only a few had bilateral meetings and one on one this morning saturday morning one of them was the philippine delegation
2667329 it also came on the heels of the tragedy of 9 11 which changed the world and heightened world concern regarding terrorism which generated so many unfortunate events including a global economic slowdown similar to whats happening now
2667330 great part to the leadership of china in the summit and afterwards

2667393 its very difficult to provide services to men who have sex with men in countries that dont acknowledge they exist or criminalize them if they do exist
2667394 to follow mexicos bold example and pass laws against homophobia
2667395 to me that was a strong indication of her love she is a fabulous person
2667396 for all intents it appears to be a random attack by a deranged man
2667397 the only thing weve heard is they were not identifiable except for a small volleyball pin which would probably be invisible to a guy
2667398 its certainly a down day certainly for the u s people
2667399 here it is supposed to be a great time of happiness and peace and all that thats what we work hard for then for one person to be able to put a dark cloud on that
2667400 its hard to put it in words thats not something thats supposed to happen
2667401 i dont know if theres another word for it we said a prayer for them in the locker room i get goosebumps talking about it its something obviously that just changes the events right now for the olympic games
2667402 so far our database check and preliminary analysis suggest that todays murder suicide was an isolated though brutal murder of one person and assault on two others
2667403 we dont believe this was targeted at american citizens and we dont believe this has anything to do with the olympics

2667421 one day in september 1968 respected president kim il sung visited a pit face of the construction of the metro and gave guidance to the project for many hours he looked at the stairs to the entrance of the pit and stepped on the steep stairs one by one to the end in this way the happiness of the people was provided by the goodness of the president who took the trouble of the people into his first consideration
2667422 it was one day in february when six months had passed since the opening of the pyongyang metro
2667423 on september 5 1973 there took place an opening ceremony of the pyongyang metro
2667424 i think it is difficult to build the metro but it is not to cut the tape
2667425 violence against women violates the rights and undermines the dignity of our sisters mothers and daughters it undermines our democratic victory
2667426 as we celebrate our women on this day we remember gail and many others whose lives were brutally snuffed out through unacceptable criminal violence
2667427 equally we would like to make an earnest appeal to community structures and in particular families to stand up against and report incidents of women and children abuse
2667428 they are also less involved in the formal banking sector but they do have more store cards or retail accounts
2667429 national womens day is the celebration of the role and contribution of women to public life in the struggle for freedom in the building of a new non racial and democratic south africa and in building our future
2667430 these efforts appear to be designed to turn the day into something frivolous similar to either valentines day or mothers day
2667431 you use the monkey bread fruit if you have a belly ache
2667432 if youre tired you eat the leaves they are good for you
2667433 opening the european market to this product will make a real difference to poor rural communities there offering them a potentially life changing source of income
2667434 ive collected the fruits since i was a little girl with my grandmother
2667435 its better to sell here than there you dont have to wear yourself out going to thies
2667436 now we collect 150 to 200 tonnes of baobab fruit each harvest in the last weeks there has been an explosion in demand
2667437 we are thinking we will need a much bigger harvest next time
2667438 in senegal alone we estimate we could collect 13 thousand tonnes of fruit
2667439 and if it becomes an important revenue the farmers will know that they have to protect the tree
2667440 there are cattle herders that cut the leaves to feed their animals but we are starting to stop them now thats not good because we need the trees to produce fruit
2667441 everybody is asking for our products so they can test them

2667445 you have to know what youre talking about you cant grandstand
2667446 i knew what i was told about the war was totally false
2667447 in 1968 i came back and dan was across the hall at rand
2667448 he had been a total hawk in vietnam but everything about him seemed shattered it was as if he was trying to grow himself back he was going through a metamorphosis he was very tortured there was no way he could justify the war anymore
2667449 i knew that he was the one person with the combination of guts and passionate concern about the war who would take the risk of helping me
2667450 everything that we were doing i was totally into tims a complete genius and the album even went into a direction for me that was kind of a dream come true where you put me with someone like tim who people think of as like a hip hop or pop producer and we made the most album oriented album of my career where its really a record thats more like pink floyds the while or queens a night at the opera
2667451 i learned that i have to be careful with students i have to stay professional while teaching
2667452 who would give a child a pornographic magazine sealed in a brown envelope send them off to school with it and tell them not to open it

2667456 more than a third of school kids report being victims of cyberbullying

2667464 a google search of fan fiction brings up over 26 million hits
2667465 but advocates for fan fiction are trying to counter a perception that fan fiction is a marginal endeavour a bizarre pastime for emotionally immature people obsessed with reworking ephemeral works of popular entertainment to produce amateurish second rate writing
2667466 sub genres include mpreg where a man gets pregnant deathfic where a major character dies curtainfic where the characters typically a gay male pairing go domestic and engage in such comfortably bourgeois exercises as shopping for curtains together and au alternative universe where the characters are displaced into an entirely new fantasy setting
2667467 the existence of fan fiction on the internet even though posted non commercially might erode their market for licensing subsequent books or other derivative works the caution that authors have to exercise around managing their rights can be frustrating to fans and difficult for authors who dont want to discourage keen readers but must
2667468 another concern is that an author working on a series might encounter in fan fiction an idea that is similar to or the same as the authors own if the author goes ahead and makes use of his own idea having also seen the fan fiction in question ironically he may risk a law suit for copyright infringement brought by the fan
2667469 authors earn money by licensing valuable subsidiary rights such as film television and merchandising rights to media companies who may lose interest if the rights are not free clear and exclusive
2667470 even without a lawsuit if a fan writer speculates online that the series writer plagiarized her idea it may be enough to seriously damage the authors reputation

2667501 itulah bentuk bantuan kita kita kaji semula harga kontrak selalunya kalau harga kontrak telah ditandatangani kita tak boleh kaji semula tapi oleh kerana keadaan luar biasa kerajaan telah bersetuju butiran akan dimaklum dalam surat pekeliling

2667504 kalau kita dapat berfikir secara strategik kekayaan orang melayu dan bumiputera dalam bidang hartanah boleh dilonjakkan kalau kita nak tentukan modal dapat digunakan dengan sebaik mungkin ia mesti berlandaskan kepada ilmu dan pengetahuan tanpanya kita tidak mungkin dapat menjana kekayaan pada tahap yang maksimum
2667505 kalau disebut bagaimana kita nak menjana kekayaan sama ada atas nama individu atau atas nama sesuatu kaum maka aset tanah adalah aset yang penting malah kalau lihat daripada segi faktor yang boleh menyumbang kepada kekayaan secara tradisi ia meliputi tanah tenaga dan modal
2667506 itu kita lihat daripada segi peratusannya kalau kita lihat daripada segi nilainya mungkin jauh lebih rendah

2667619 respect the elders and never contradict them in any way
2667620 i think were really happy with silver because i dont think we were expecting to get that
2667621 it felt great i felt like i had more energy so im really psyched about my 50
2667622 its just bizarre i think i might be older than her parents
2667623 but when youre swimming in the water i know that the water doesnt know what age you are
2667624 she was the first to go under 30 4 30 and itll give me some motivation for the future
2667625 it was a tough race but i cant really be mad im happy to get my first medal ever at the olympics
2667626 i felt like i had to go out fast with these girls my first hundred was almost a second faster than normal i felt to even be in the race i kind of needed to do that
2667627 i was trying i didnt have it at the end
2667628 i felt fairly relaxed going into this one i felt in control of my nerves
2667629 it was a new race for me and something i really had to go into with a different mindset and really focus on my own race
2667630 i cant complain when you go your best time i gave it every ounce of energy i had
2667631 i came up a little short of gold today however its an honor to swim for a great nation and in front of the president

2667635 he was someone who had a name a face a personality who could just about talk about anything
2667636 was good for city hall as well as for the livejournal members
2667637 when am i speaking for myself and when for the city
2667638 its simply inappropriate for me to pretend that i can unofficially take part in any online community even as decent and thoughtful a community as dslj this was therefore a mistake
2667639 having someone whos able and willing to look into our questions and issues with the city really makes a huge difference
2667640 it reminds me that there are reasonable people working behind the scenes and that actually makes me eager to work with the city on issues
2667641 i dont know of any examples where the city is responding via a nonsanctioned website
2667642 thats not saying it doesnt happen but thats not typical the city usually wants control
2667643 weve seen a decreasing trust in government the web or e mail or these postings offer an opportunity to really rebuild trust
2667644 i think this is a relatively new frontier for a lot of people who are engaged in government
2667645 there are almost certainly people out there whove thought about this and been smarter than i was and said nah this is really not the way to go
2667646 theres no question that the day i cease to be a city official and become again just a resident i will rejoin the davis square livejournal community
2667647 i knew what i was told about the war was totally false
2667648 in 1968 i came back and dan was across the hall at rand
2667649 he had been a total hawk in vietnam but everything about him seemed shattered it was as if he was trying to grow himself back he was going through a metamorphosis he was very tortured there was no way he could justify the war anymore
2667650 i knew that he was the one person with the combination of guts and passionate concern about the war who would take the risk of helping me
2667651 im confident that we have the wherewithal to get it done
2667652 theyre used to being out on the perimeter a lot where they can make 3s so they open up the floor a lot
2667653 and they also use the ball to go through the low post not necessarily to score but to set up everybody on the outside it is a little bit more of a finesse game
2667654 its very hard to have a dominant low post player i think tim duncan kind of figured that out
2667655 all it takes is a couple of quick calls and somebodys in foul trouble
2667656 were trying to impress upon him thats what you have to look out for
2667657 you can make some noise but unless youre the mayor of some town the newspapers dont pay attention
2667658 if there is a threat of violence that requires police to use force then certainly that is an option they may pursue
2667659 the truth is that we dont even discuss it in our legal meetings anymore because we know that these arent cases that can be litigated
2667660 searched homes looking like tornadoes hit them with drawers and trash cans removed and dumped out
2667661 since the vast majority of criminal defendants plead guilty the issue of a search warrant never sees the light of day
2667662 montgomery police unit files suit to block use of patrol car cameras
2667663 my confidence showed even here in the olympic road race
2667664 i was surprised to be fifth but late in the race i wasnt surprised anymore
2667665 i wanted more than fifth the more i raced the more i gained confidence and security
2667666 i was maybe a little too far back on the initial attack
2667667 i really thought we were going to come back but there were too many teammates of teammates up there and a little bit of cat and mouse
2667668 could incite acts of violence by a small radical segment
2667669 america is uh is no longer uh what it could be what it once was and i say to myself i dont want that future for my children
2667670 we got the impression he didnt want to extend the lease
2667671 its a real pain you have to shove the boat down an embankment
2667672 its particularly tough for people who arent as savvy with boats and trailers
2667673 at the moment i am not close to concluding any transfer deal because i am too busy here
2667674 maybe next week something can happen but for now we have to focus on the champions league and forget about transfers because it is a big target for us
2667675 i dont know where to begin is it my head or hands that sin
2667676 no im sorry but i cant take your on call that weekend
2667677 er zijn zon 200 zwembaden in vlaanderen per zwembad betekent dit dus 500 uren extra zwemplezier vijf extra uren in de weekends of twee uur elke avond van de week
2667678 wij hadden verschillende doelstellingen en die zijn allemaal uitgekomen de eerste en lichtste doelstelling was een goed totaal te behalen daarna wilden we beter doen dan op het voorbije ek in lignano en met 7 kg meer dan toen is dat meer dan gelukt en tot slot gingen we voor belgische records en ook dat heeft hij gedaan met verbeteringen in het totaal en in het trekken tom heeft zes goede beurten gehad wat uitzonderlijk is zeker op de olympische spelen nu is hij al minimum 16e maar van de a groep zullen er zeker nog een paar tussenuit vallen we hadden gehoopt op een plaats tussen 12 en 16 dus ook met zijn plaats zijn we tevreden nu nog zien hoe hoog hij precies eindigt
2667679 tom zelf was ook uiterst tevreden hij maakte een luchtsprong na zijn laatste beurt en we hadden ook een speciale supporter met prins filip na de wedstrijd is hij met ons komen praten hij heeft ons gefeliciteerd en was heel enthousiast nu gaan we rusten want we zijn heel vroeg moeten opstaan en daarna gaan we naar de a groep gaan kijken
2667680 in het begin hadden we moeite om naar de juiste kleur te spelen na twee drie balcontacten leden we al balverlies op het eind van het duel was er eigenlijk geen sprake meer van een wedstrijd door alle wissels maar als je die begin en eindfase eraf haalt wisten we een half uur te controleren in de tweede helft zijn we meer gaan voetballen het was een leerzame wedstrijd
2667681 ik wil niet positief of negatief zijn maar er zijn verschillende bedrijven ge nteresseerd in val saint lambert
2667682 daar ligt voor sommige investeerders het echte probleem eens dat geregeld is kan het bedrijf geherlanceerd worden
2667683 het was goed dat ik hier in peking kon bidden dit illustreert dat god universeel is en geen enkele overheid man of vrouw zou de liefde voor een godsdienst mogen vrezen
2667684 i wore a loose fitting t shirt it was very hot in london and its no secret i dont like wearing bras
2667685 my boob fell out twice and people on the blogs are saying it was a publicity stunt
2667686 can i just say i have been keeping myself very much to myself recently ive been gardening decorating my new flat and looking after my grieving grandfather
2667687 were facing an economic blockade and this has forced us to take this natural route and march to muzaffarabad
2667688 our produce mainly apples is rotting at least 1 500 truckloads of fresh fruit are waiting to be transported to markets outside kashmir
2667689 i hope those remaining five will also be released as they had not done anything to harm the peace
2667690 they did it in memory of those who were killed in 1988 and i hope the authorities who have declared plans to establish democracy in the country will treat those youths leniently and release them quickly
2667691 in certain areas of north cotabato with a specific group of milf all peaceful means have been exhausted to resolve the conflicts and we are now compelled to resort to the application of justifiable force
2667692 theyll remain deadlocked and each side will use it to become more deeply entrenched in their positions
2667693 hamas has agreed to close the file of political detentions and fatah showed its readiness too but there were no measures of datesset for doing so
2667694 in light of the high extent of commercial and economic relations between the eu and iran if the europeans impose sanctions they will definitely be hurt
2667695 we have said we will continue looking to see how best to apply pressure to the iranian regime and we will continue to do that
2667696 current developments as well as relations between irans atomic energy organisation and the iaea were discussed in a positive atmosphere
2667697 i want america to know that im like totally ready to lead
2667698 it would be pink on the outside pink carpets pink furniture pink jammies the men on her staff would be cool with be shirtless chippendale types with names like leon
2667699 instead of a bowling alley in the basement of the white house paris would have a pilates studio and oh yeah shed have foam parties in the oval office for the white house staff and old girlfriends from boarding school
2667700 she would answer all questions while walking and posing for a wall of photographers and theyd be yelling out paris look here
2667701 the first half of every conference would be about what shes wearing paris would realize that as president she would have to tone it down a little shed lean toward prada
2667702 what would happen is rihanna would step off the plane in fishnet stockings music would blare and whole countries would melt at the sight of her
2667703 it would be like bush at the crawford ranch she would be in l a more than she would in washington d c
2667704 the concept had been on the table for some years now all countries have finally agreed on the formation and implementation of the saarc food bank
2667705 properly realised it would serve as a milestone in strengthening the existing cooperation among the nations of south asia
2667706 this involves the construction of new food warehouses in member countries local procurement and the international purchase of extra food grains and developing an administrative system and a distribution network so it is likely that it will take some time before operationalising the saarc food bank
2667707 my views developed in the course of time but i have always believed in what i did and never acted against it
2667708 the soviet government had let the genie out of the bottle and however hard they tried later they couldnt put it back in
2667709 russia can neither be grasped by the mind nor measured by any common yardstick no attitude to her other than one of blind faith is admissible
2667710 broke russias back the red terror unleashed by its leaders their willingness to drown russia in blood is the first and foremost proof of it
2667711 the bitter russian experience which i have been studying and describing all my life will be for us a lesson that keeps us from new disastrous breakdowns
2667712 people have come to the conclusion that the closer he is to wanting to obtain power the more difficult others will make it for him to achieve that
2667713 a lot of people are very tired after living through the first sodomy trial which had a chilling effect on the country even until today people thought it was blatant political manoeuvering
2667714 the new sodomy charges against anwar ibrahim are all a political game because he is now a real threat to the prime minister
2667715 anwar was cleared of all the sodomy charges before so what are they trying to prove now we have all grown up in the last 10 years and people are not so stupid to just accept all these things blindly
2667716 it looks like the government is out to fix him again everyone knows that the charge against him is nothing but a lie
2667717 the only thing we can do now is to vote for anwar and make sure he gets to parliament and eventually form the government only then can we right all that is wrong in this country
2667718 i would like to inform you that the total expenses registered since 14 october 1997 amounts to 23 million french francs and this is uniquely for the groups we support these are liberation army of rwanda alir 2 300 men ex far 1 565 men and lastly interahamwe 1 250 men
2667719 witnesses some only 12 at the time testified to being raped by french troops from operation turquoise in the refugee camp set up for tutsi survivors at cyangugu belgian and german witnesses spoke of the training given to the interahamwe and the financing of the interim government by paris
2667720 so accusing france today of its complicity in those horrible events would logically lead to accusations or self accusations against every other government even though frances role was more direct than the purely passive one of other countries
2667721 a person working in the bank reported it we have several teams looking for her we have to be certain
2667722 no matter how little money and how few possesions you own having a dog makes you rich
2667723 run rabbit run dig that hole get the sun and at last when the work is done dont sit down its time to dig another one
2667724 you are not better than me no matter wat you think or do your not because your not me but if you were me you would be better than yourself
2667725 time goes fast but when you slow it down it stops and when it stops all of us keep moving in the wrong direction
2667726 people can critisize you but if you believe them then they will keep on but if let it go there will be no one left to critisize
2667727 actions speak louder than words but if you let words speak louder than your actions who is the true winner
2667728 people think that popular people are all that they are just people like us if they look at us in the position that we are in what does that make us

2667746 im not angry at all and i left behind a little boy ernesto is three and a half years old he lives with my momma now i used to miss him terribly especially at night lying on my cot in the tent at fob mercury just outside mosul but since ive been here my sadness is gone im so happy that hes safe and free that my heart no longer aches for him instead it swells with pride
2667747 dont you miss your wife and little girl arent you mad that you had to die in a fiery helicopter crash depriving chrissy of her daddy
2667748 i do miss my wife mr thomas i miss her every time im away from her thats called love likewise i miss my daughter chrissy shell be six next week by the way but i must say emphatically that she has not been deprived of her daddy i am her daddy and when she thinks of me speaks of me dreams of me im overwhelmed with joy that shell know im in heaven continuing to watch over her and her mother this isnt about my death mr thomas its about my life and just as with my comrades here my life ended for a purpose for a greater good
2667749 how do you know that she knows youre still her daddy her protector how do you know that she knows your in heaven
2667750 i know mr thomas because each night i hear my chrissys prayers one of the perks for being here and no i dont call this heaven this is the port of embarkation heaven is over there through those gates
2667751 you see no soldier marine sailor airmen or coast guardsmen ought to arrive to heaven without a proper greeting its the least we can do considering their sacrifices and id like to add that through those gates are at least a thousand others who have volunteered to take our place here
2667752 what about you private velleux surely you see the travesty in dying at such a young age your life wasted
2667753 with all due respect sir my life was not wasted my life was spent defending your right to publish articles in your newspaper criticizing my life my life made a difference in providing the very freedoms you take for granted to a group of people who still dont understand what freedom means my life ended while saving a school full of young afghan girls from an ied that was meant to kill them all my life was not wasted sir
2667754 im sorry private excuse me brian i didnt mean to offend you and i was out of line the truth is i respect what your life represents
2667755 if i might id like to ask just one last question but before i do id like to say how honored i am to be here among this group and i apologize if i came off antagonistic
2667756 if you were offered your lives back a second chance if you were to leave heaven and go back would you take it
2667757 and id go back to iraq to finish the job i started
2667758 mr thomas we dont belong in heaven we belong on the battlefield on the front lines defending america and our way of life but were here our missions complete we only pray that there will be others to follow our paths so that those who follow your path can continue to publish newspapers and our kids can continue to ride buses free from fear it sucks to be dead mr thomas but it is truly blissful to know that america remains free rest assured sir there are no tears in heaven no tears
2667759 my dear friend jaymes and i are so excited to announce the birth of parker foster aiken
2667760 hindi totoo yan hindi naman kami magkaaway hindi rin naman kami magka close
2667761 one hopes that with the new regime in place theyll be able to get a stern message across to rios about his at the very least occasional lack of effort but for now their hands are tied its not like they could put joe inglett or brad wilkerson out in centrefield tomorrow with cliff lee on the mound nor should they
2667762 the attacks are occurring in regions of georgia far from the zone of conflict in south ossetia they mark a dangerous escalation in the crisis
2667763 this is about annihilation of a democracy on their borders
2667764 we on our own cannot fight with russia we want immediate cease fire immediate cessation of hostilities separation of russia and georgia and international mediation
2667765 a ceasefire would not be a solution the fighting is still going on the georgian forces are continuing to be on the south ossetian territory
2667766 the actions of the georgian powers in south ossetia are of course a crime first of all against their own people
2667767 the territorial integrity of georgia has suffered a fatal blow
2667768 we have urged an immediate halt to the violence and a stand down by all troops we call for an end to the russian bombings and a return by the parties to the status quo
2667769 our units are well equipped with anti tank rockets and they thwarted a russian tank attack
2667770 whatever side is used to bomb civilians and the positions of peacekeepers this side is not safe and they should know this
2667771 i am using it in different ways like checking email searching the internet and learning how to record music
2667772 now at least they have an idea about what a computer is
2667773 they were interested to learn that the computer can check your spelling
2667774 i heard one of the teachers say that the kids are going to school daily as they believe i will visit with my xo laptop
2667775 no state man or woman should fear the influence of loving religion
2667776 this trip has reaffirmed my belief that men and women who aspire to speak their conscience and worship their god are no threat to the future of china
2667777 made it clear that trusting their people with greater freedom is necessary for china to reach its full potential
2667778 he has been driven to be outspoken by the appalling prospect of his silence in the wake of worsening chinese repression
2667779 were trying to make it clear that they need to step it up
2667780 if he would go the power of house churches in china would grow
2667781 that action will send a message to the chinese government and the rest of the world that the united states regards religion as important
2667782 si je parle plus fort que toi cest moi qui ai raison
2667783 here in calgary we need warm bodies for jobs the public sector city post office are understaffed because they cant compete with the private sector
2667784 our economy is in terrible shape and it is only going to get worse as more companies lay off full time employees
2667785 this is a sign of the continuing massive failures of the harper regime things will only get worse
2667786 i was thinking about what id like to have at home and i was thinking what can i do
2667787 i got information about a windmill and i try and i made it
2667788 i dont want him to be seen as william the windmill maker
2667789 we have heard about this windmill and so we wanted to see it for ourselves
2667790 people do desire what is happening here they come and admire
2667791 they think that they might get the same support if they build a windmill
2667792 in every generation there is a chosen one one girl in all the world one born with the strength and skill to hunt the vampires
2667793 in every generation there is a chosen one one girl in all the world one born with the strength and skill to hunt the vampires
2667794 come let us go up to the mountain of the lord
2667795 a few of our congregations are interpreting the action that congregations are no longer expected to provide medical insurance coverage for their pastors
2667796 reaffirms the value of congregations providing health insurance coverage for pastors and families
2667797 has spoken out strongly and repeatedly in opposition to slavery and the slave trade passing antislavery resolutions in 1797 1812 1813 1837 1845 1853 1854 and 1857
2667798 our complicity in the global network of slavery through consumption of goods and services produced by slave labor
2667799 take a strong statement to the body of annual conference
2667800 it is a genuine attempt to address the really ugly kinds of behavior that we all have seen sometimes in our agencies or on the floor of annual conference
2667801 is our attempt to say we have got to stop hurting each other
2667802 our intent in this collaboration is that all three boards can reach consensus on a refinement of the resolution
2667803 took an old oil drum to the tinsmith at the trading center and asked him to help me cut it into new blades
2667804 these funds will also pay for the enhanced lighting and power in my home as documented on the blog im working on a project right now to benefit my extended family many of whom live in the five homes in my immediate neighborhood i am eager to tell you about it but want to wait until it is finished first
2667805 due to your generosity i have received many donations so far
2667806 serve one another with whatever gift each of you has received
2667807 the attacks are occurring in regions of georgia far from the zone of conflict in south ossetia they mark a dangerous escalation in the crisis
2667808 this is about annihilation of a democracy on their borders
2667809 we on our own cannot fight with russia we want immediate cease fire immediate cessation of hostilities separation of russia and georgia and international mediation
2667810 a ceasefire would not be a solution the fighting is still going on the georgian forces are continuing to be on the south ossetian territory
2667811 the reports from people is that its an absolute nightmare two kids today where we delivering food made it out of south ossetia but their parents didnt and they dont know if they are alive or dead because phones are down
2667812 the actions of the georgian powers in south ossetia are of course a crime first of all against their own people
2667813 the territorial integrity of georgia has suffered a fatal blow
2667814 we have urged an immediate halt to the violence and a stand down by all troops we call for an end to the russian bombings and a return by the parties to the status quo
2667815 our units are well equipped with anti tank rockets and they thwarted a russian tank attack
2667816 whatever side is used to bomb civilians and the positions of peacekeepers this side is not safe and they should know this
2667817 they have employed strategic bombers the most potent air weaponry in the russian arsenal they have launched ballistic missile attacks on georgian territory
2667818 the line were hearing right now from russia is quite tough
2667819 if the russian side is simply convinced it wants to keep pressing the attack militarily there is not much the georgians can do theyre being hit very hard so we have to rely on diplomacy
2667820 the violence is endangering regional peace civilian lives have been lost and others are endangered we have urged an immediate halt to the violence and a stand down by all troops we call for an end to the russian bombings
2667821 promozioni compleanni ecc so solo che sono stata promossa una settimana prima di gracewee

2667823 wait for the lord be strong and let your heart take courage
2667824 this rapid response team is what we hope to replicate throughout the country
2667825 it creates a first line of volunteers who are ready to respond once the response grows we can send in additional volunteers from other states
2667826 is more than we will be able to staff with california volunteers so the plan is to extend our reach as much as possible
2667827 we will staff each center with less than a full team of certified child care workers they would then work with and supervise local volunteers after presenting a brief orientation on the essential elements of our program
2667828 might just be calling every member of the congregation and just touch base
2667829 it is such chaos right now that we cant do anything
2667830 often the organized work follows the clean up part of it is probably where we would start
2667831 i know whats it like to be homeless and penniless
2667832 just seeing all that devastation and it wasnt just the buildings it was the humans
2667833 there was such a need there for just a smile
2667834 buildings can be rebuilt and replaced but the people will take longer
2667835 ive done dirty and tough work before but ive never done it for a good cause
2667836 i dont have much whatever i have and experience i share with others i know what it can do for others because its been done for me
2667837 lilly asked where can they best invest resources to build up the church and they settled on pastors
2667838 im still trying to figure out what it means to be a pastor in this emerging world and its actually a lot of fun
2667839 fewer people are identifying themselves as christians we cant just assume theres respect for christians and christianity
2667840 the reign of god shows up where we least expect it we want to control outcomes rather than be surprised by grace
2667841 to work together for a better fairer and more faithful united states
2667842 we individual christians and churches commit ourselves to a culture of peace and freedom that embraces nonviolence nurtures character treasures the environment and builds community rooted in a spirituality of inner growth and outward action
2667843 there may be as many as three million survivors who need assistance
2667844 chicken soup for the soul stories for a better world
2667845 after 13 months of prayer and about 1 5 million the new sanctuary now boasts high wooded ceilings fine furniture and a fresh coat of paint
2667846 all of our vulnerable churches and people of the oregon and washington district are okay from the latest wrath of winter weather
2667847 more than 1 000 homes in lewis county have waist deep water in the house and other counties are also affected
2667848 however the office of deacon is remembered it is an office nearly as old as the denomination
2667849 most importantly wherever there was an expressed human need deacons assumed responsibility to address those needs thus in this 300th anniversary celebration year it is timely to review the legacy and character of deacons in our denomination as we enter another century of opportunities to serve and to care
2667850 be careful what you pray for because you might get it
2667851 germantown church hosts opening event of the 300th anniversary celebration
2667852 we want to work with learn from and serve the whole church
2667853 a step in the church of the brethrens effort to witness to the compassion and love of jesus for all peoples especially to the impoverished and the estranged
2667854 this gift is a song of partnership with agglobe across agencies between the church of the brethren and the korean presbyterian church in america among haves and have nots praise god
2667855 a number of persons expressed to us how meaningful and important it was for the us church to be present for this gathering
2667856 while the church faced significant challenges our observation was that reason compassion and community prevailed
2667857 the spirit of the meeting reflected considerable unity and a sense of common purpose to upbuild the church
2667858 this was especially evident in an instance where a person of maturity and grace who might have been an obvious choice for leadership chose to stand aside in the interests of the whole body
2667859 we clearly sensed gods presence preparing the way for this meeting guiding the delegates toward making a number of wise and courageous decisions we rejoice in gods goodness and in the dedication and faithfulness of the dominican brethren
2667860 surrendered to god transformed by christ and empowered by the spirit
2667861 laura and i just had the great joy and privilege of worshiping here in beijing
2667862 you know it just goes to show that god is universal and god is love and no state man or woman should fear the influence of loving religion
2667863 this trip has reaffirmed my belief that men and women who aspire to speak their conscience and worship their god are no threat to the future of china
2667864 they are the people who will make china a great nation in the 21st century
2667865 the attacks are occurring in regions of georgia far from the zone of conflict in south ossetia they mark a dangerous escalation in the crisis
2667866 what we have in south ossetia can only be called ethnic cleansing and genocide
2667867 we werent expecting the local chinese to be excited and welcoming of our supporters because they live in a world where the chinese blast them with propaganda all the time
2667868 we hope by making them hear and see our message about tibet it will alert them to the fact that there is something not right in tibet
2667869 safeguards are now in place that we believe would prevent this from recurring
2667870 there are insufficient safeguards on the agencys use of national security letters and other intrusive surveillance tools
2667871 especially dangerous is the fbis power to impose gag orders on those ordered to disclose information
2667872 one guy in my spanish class was mad at me
2667873 we are the fastest growing social network on the web and the third largest
2667874 he thought oh great this is like a facebook for high school
2667875 the first week we launched over 300 people joined just from my school montgomery high school in skillman n j dave and i werent popular or anything so we could tell that it was going to work
2667876 actually its a lot less stressful than being responsible for the entire site by yourself
2667877 it is hard because i do spend so many hours working i didnt make that many friends in my first year of college
2667878 im perfectly fine with that i dont have time to go party and stuff like that which sometimes i do miss
2667879 i have had job offers for when ive graduated from college but none that im taking too seriously
2667880 i feel like myyearbook com is something im good at
2667881 we will not rule out additional charges down the road
2667882 we will amend the complaint to reflect his true identity once we have that confirmed
2667883 he was eccentric but he seemed to have a broad range of knowledge
2667884 its all circumstantial theres just no way he could do it they grabbed a convenient person
2667885 my experience of him during that time is that he was a very loving giving man and this doesnt make sense at all
2667886 if he needs to blow his own trumpet well fine
2667887 but my mother who was a simple housewife she showed me the snake when i was a child
2667888 how dare this man come in here and name a snake after his wife

2667891 during an attack by what local law enforcement authorities have indicated was a lone assailant
2667892 they were not wearing apparel or anything that would have specifically identified them as being members of our delegation
2667893 out of respect for the families involved we cant say more than that
2667894 i walked up and asked him what he was doing
2667895 he said you and your muscleman dont scare me ill protect myself
2667896 that was what i was trying to do 50 years ago and the attorney general of texas stopped me
2667897 when he broke ground on jamaica beach he was only 30 years old a young man with a vision
2667898 it was something very unique when you look at the desolate barren island land then who could have envisioned all the communities on the west end and where they are at today he might have been a little ahead of his time
2667899 jamaica beach was my favorite project because i was so personally involved in it
2667900 the rich people had a second home but the middle class didnt
2667901 the first thing we had to do is convince people they needed a second home and then we had to convince them that jamaica beach is where they wanted to be

2667908 we earned those slots on the field of play and theyre taken away from us
2667909 it just seems the u s could not get a break i dont know what it is
2667910 we can understand his frustration when he finally learned what had been repeatedly officially confirmed all the way

2667924 the thing i dont want is for this to go to trial and a jury to give him probation

2667941 we are absolutely devastated by what has occurred for their loss and for everything they are going through
2667942 we are a family and well get through this together as a family
2667943 your government has been very attentive very sympathetic and i appreciate that a lot
2667944 to me that was a strong indication of her love she is a fabulous person

2667961 i believe with the shortage of labour in canada more and more companies will be going abroad not only to india china and the philippines but also eastern europe
2667962 those countries beyond canada certainly provide a good labour pool
2667963 if you look specifically at north america the traditional networking technologies like routing and switching theres probably a little gap but not very very critical
2667964 i think the gap is mainly in the areas of new technologies or what we call at cisco the advanced technologies particularly in the areas of voice wireless and security
2667965 if you owe the bank a thousand dollars and cant pay you have a problem if you owe the bank a billion dollars and cant pay they have a problem
2667966 this is the first significant bipartisan change in our policy toward iraq
2667967 it is vha veterans health administration policy to assist patients who seek to exercise their right to register and vote however due to hatch act title 5 united states code u s c 7321 7326 requirements and to avoid disruptions to facility operations voter registration drives are not permitted
2667968 we believe that the earlier directive better addressed the need for a consistent voter registration policy for our veterans
2667969 while the changes made in the new directive seem small the impact is large it appears to us that the department took one step forward for our veterans and the right to vote by directing that assistance be provided with voter registration and with securing absentee ballots but then took a large step back by prohibiting voter registration drives
2667970 office of special counsel has made it clear that federal employees even those who are considered to be in sensitive positions may
2667971 we would appreciate knowing the type of disruptions the va envisions might occur during voter registration drives by nonpartisan organizations such as the league of women voters or veterans organizations and why any potential disruption could not be addressed by less restrictive means
2667972 we judge that in fall 2003 tehran halted its nuclear weapons program
2667973 we assess with moderate confidence tehran has not restarted its nuclear weapons program as of mid 2007
2667974 we do not have sufficient intelligence to judge confidently whether tehran is willing to maintain the halt of its nuclear weapons program indefinitely
2667975 we judge with moderate confidence iran probably would be technically capable of producing enough highly enriched uranium sometime during the 2010 2015 time frame
2667976 we judge with high confidence that iran will not be technically capable of producing and reprocessing enough plutonium for a weapon before about 2015
2667977 this nie does not italics in original assume that iran intends to acquire nuclear weapons
2667978 we assess that iran seeks to develop a nuclear weapon
2667979 we all agree then that the iranians are trying to get nuclear weapons
2667980 we are not going to do iran on my watch
2667981 a war with iran for which the u s is so ill prepared
2667982 iraqs sectarian violence from sliding into an all out civil war
2667983 for months the white house rejected claims that the situation in iraq has deteriorated into civil war
2667984 for the most part news organizations like nbc hesitated to characterize it as such after careful consideration nbc news has decided the change in terminology is warranted and what is going on in iraq can now be characterized as civil war
2667985 we should mention we didnt just wake up on a monday morning and say lets call this a civil war this took careful deliberation we consulted with a lot of people
2667986 the white house objects to the terminology that nbc news is now using and here is part of the statement that theyve released while the situation on the ground is very serious neither prime minister maliki nor we believe that iraq is in a civil war
2667987 well firstly let me say perhaps its easier to deny that this is a civil war when essentially you live in the most heavily fortified place in the country within the green zone which is true of both the prime minister the national security adviser for iraq and of course the top u s military commanders however for the people living on the streets for iraqis in their homes if this is not civil war or a form of it then they do not want to see what one really looks like
2667988 goebbels core philosophy based on a tabloid style populist approach was said to have been partly inspired by the ideas of the first lord northcliffe
2667989 to conduct propaganda in such a way that it will stand up to critical examination of intellectuals
2667990 intellectuals always yield to strength and this will be the ordinary man in the street
2667991 smarter minds than bush in the administration or advising the administration are quite happy with the increased talk and flutter about civil war in the media and the general population because this facilitates a face saving exit from iraq without first having to acknowledge and learn from the fact that an imperial oil war was the precipitating cause of this entire disaster
2667992 the americans have tried to kill me in the past but have failed it is certain that the americans still want me dead and are still trying to assassinate me
2667993 i am an iraqi i am a muslim i am free and i reject all forms of occupation i want to help the iraqi people this is everything the americans hate
2667994 the americans are occupiers and thieves and they must set a timetable to leave this country we must know that they are leaving and we must know when
2667995 we are fighting the enemy that is greater in strength but we are in the right
2667996 even if that means our deaths we will not stand idly by and suffer from this occupation islam exhorts us to die with dignity rather than live in shame
2667997 the occupiers have tried to provoke us but i ordered unarmed resistance for the sake of the people
2667998 we have been patient exercising statesmanship but if the occupation and oppression continues we will fight
2667999 hizbollah and the mahdi army are two sides of the same coin
2668000 we are together in the same trench against the forces of evil
2668001 what happened with the badr organisation and the mahdi army in many parts of iraq is the result of a sad misunderstanding
2668002 those criticising the iraqi intervention is left speechless when you ask them what their alternative was
2668003 i think its important for the president to lay out a timetable as to how long our troops will be involved and when they should be withdrawn
2668004 this is too good a soap opera we need barack obama bloodied up politically and its obvious that the republicans are not going to do it and dont have the stomach for it as you probably know
2668005 how do you interpret this folks she could have said thank you she could have said thank you in fact i was expecting in her victory speech last night to be thanked
2668006 cuyahoga county board of election has launched an investigation that could lead to criminal charges against voters who maliciously switched parties for the march 4 presidential primary
2668007 one voter scribbled the following addendum to his pledge as a new democrat
2668008 the most stringent protection of free speech would not protect a man falsely shouting fire in a theater and causing a panic the question in every case is whether the words used are used in such circumstances and are of such a nature as to create a clear and present danger that they will bring about the substantive evils that congress has a right to prevent
2668009 any registration in force in advance of any primary election must remain valid through the subsequent general election

2668015 flights from london to manila for example average just 16 hours add to that the many airline specials and its easy to see why this area is becoming an international community
2668016 theres been so many issues this neighborhood faces in terms of violence and crime and some gang issues
2668017 its just really important that we have a program that brings people together in a positive manner
2668018 es realmente un gran honor que me reciban en estas circunstancias tambi n me honra mucho el recibimiento que me ha hecho buenos aires el mundo tiene que saber que argentina es tan apasionada con la m sica como con el f tbol me emocion mucho conocer al presidente

2668039 wir k nnen sexuell nicht treu sein und wollen andere beziehungen aber wir haben keine geheimnisse voreinander und gehen nie auseinander unter keinen umst nden
2668040 liebe bedeutet sicherheit aber die lust ist riskant die grausame wahrheit ist doch die je unf higer man zum sex ist desto f higer ist man zur liebe dem reinen gef hl es steigert die sexuelle lust nie auch nur einen deut wenn man jemanden liebt oder mag im gegenteil wenn man jemanden nicht mag verabscheut oder gar hasst kann es viel lustvoller sein man denke nur an die aggression ja gewalt die zu gutem sex geh rt
2668041 oh gott wenn ich das jetzt mache findet sie mich vielleicht ekelhaft

2668062 you like to think you did enough all camp to stay on the team but you never know
2668063 sometimes its just the numbers the goal is never to let it happen again this is my third year now i need to take advantage of every opportunity
2668064 theyre not going to keep andre johnson on the inactive list if he can play
2668065 hes real scrappy you look at him hes a smaller guy but he goes out and plays with a big heart and thats all that matters
2668066 his biggest asset is that hes just a football player
2668067 he ran a great route to come back and get the ball
2668068 he does a lot of things right makes very few mistakes and knows all the positions
2668069 he finds a way to get open i spent a year and a half with new england receiver wes welker in miami and hes got some of the same qualities he has a great feel for getting separation from the corner thats what quarterbacks look for and he almost never drops a pass
2668070 it never becomes old hat to get in the end zone
2668071 i know they say act like youve been there before
2668072 but i say celebrate like you might never get there again
2668073 my first year was about trying not to make mistakes and last year was about learning all i could
2668074 i remember in 1960 as part of the north scranton junior high class going to rocky glen
2668075 rocky glen was unique because it was family owned by the sterlings who made us feel a part of it all
2668076 i can count on one hand the number of races ive started to sweat before the race starts
2668077 it feels like you have hot cream all over your body once you go full gas you cannot breathe
2668078 i know it looks bad but i dont think its as bad as it looks
2668079 maybe ill be coughing a little bit later but i honestly dont feel the pollution it actually felt good once we got in the hills and it was overcast or whatever you call this
2668080 were professional cyclists so we go all over the world endure all kinds of conditions and were all dealing with the same thing
2668081 ive raced in some pretty nasty places ive raced in south america and central america where there are old cars are dripping oil on the road potholes in the pavement and dogs in the road were used to it this course here was on brand new pavement and it was beautiful
2668082 to pass from beijing and tiananmen square and climb along the great wall china is a country full of history dreams and incredible beauty
2668083 overall i think its been a good week of practice
2668084 i think we have a lot of things to work on but i appreciate this group has energy they like football and theyre coachable in that we improved on some things we talked about from yesterday to today they protect the passer better our receivers are a little gimpy right now theyre a little tired and a little sore and they dropped some passes jairus byrd stood out to me today on defense he did a couple of great things that secondary as we talked about before is legit we still need to make sure were solid on that front seven in terms of our run defense
2668085 i thought jeremiah johnson has done a really nice job
2668086 i think hes running the ball very very well hes got a great sense and feel for this offense and so does andre crenshaw
2668087 i think linebacker spencer paysinger is doing a nice job although hes a little bit hobbled right now on defense i love our secondary t j ward did a great job earlier today ripping and stripping the balls out and again he made a great hit on ed dickson in the scrimmage that actually scared me
2668088 i obviously want to see both sides dominate and flex their muscles and do some really good things
2668089 i thought the first team offense put together a really good drive early they were on the brink of scoring
2668090 overall our defense weve got some guys that are flying around really with great energy who are wanting to hit people and thats good
2668091 was ist denn hier los jetzt aber sofort hinlegen und schlafen
2668092 its very appropriate that it an inconvenient truth got an oscar from the land of make believe
2668093 its knowledge theres always a message in my comedy and you may not get it that night its like time bombs itll get you a week later youll understand

2668185 daddo its kind of pointless us writing in sooper sekrit envelopes about who really is the winner youre going to get the viewing audience to do a phone in poll a handful of skeptics will be smart arses and text in the word richard and youll fail to actually show a compared tally of who is the winner something like because someone texted da chik wi stomach cramps channel 7 executives smack their heads on the table and destroy all evidence before the tv show but never fear oh strong stomached readers this entertainment masquerading as some sort of reality tv is finally over and i dont have much more to add that the hasnt covered already with a very nice tally of votes that richard saunders skewered during the show too but what the hell perhaps youd like to get at least one laugh out of this train wreak we can certainly demonstrate that such a program cannot escape the scrutiny of online commentators australias next top want to be a psychic antp indeed bites the dust when it comes to sites and message boards uncovering the aspects that are dodgy dubious or just plain bad editing practices in fact in many ways its rather like what the great blog demonstrated with their run down of the most recent australias next top model the more you flail with conviction that youre the more fail you bring to the photoshoot alex girdwood australias next top not the biggest bully on the show demonstrating via mime richard boo skeptic saunders mental state when he has to listen to stacey spookier than all the leatherwear that the contestants favour demarco yap on about how magical everyone is the show took a short break from a montage of events earlier in the series to ask everyone whether they believe in death replies of course otherwise id be out of a job stupid thinking is real blog featured the following summation of the antps revealing who did we think would be the winner hidden envelopes that they did at the start of all this malarky one in thirty five chance the odds arent that long that someone would guess it correctly id argue the odds are slightly better than the raw probability since there is form to consider it was apparent in week one even to those of us who knew nothing of the contestants beforehand that some were not especially good performers we should assume the contestants had some prior knowledge of the strengths of their opponents so if we take just two of the worst performers out of the calculation the odds of picking the final three close to just one in ten with a one in sixty chance of getting them in the right order too i personally would add my own theory to the mix which is probably best reflected by this card trick by penn and teller that no matter what happens producers of the one would make a big thing that someone got close to or chose at least one out of the final three and certainly the fact that most people were putting themselves first would help with the smug factor of gosh im pretty good at this sort of thing aint i more cold reading personally i found this the most dull and repetitive aspect of the program throughout because the ever present thought of yes but how much was edited out kept popping up in my mind nettiemoores audience notes from the episode reflect how much of the psychic readings

2668193 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2668194 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2668195 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2668196 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2668197 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2668198 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2668199 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2668200 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

2668582 with declining budgets most wildlife agencies are not well equipped to manage the growing number of species at risk so they are depending more on volunteers to help with wildlife management operations

2668729 in a world threatened by sinister and indiscriminate forms of violence the unified voice of religious people urges nations and communities to resolve conflicts through peaceful means and with full regard for human dignity
2668730 all the more important at a time when some people have come to consider religion as a cause of division rather than a force for unity
2668731 at the same time a significant amount of the christian groups and other religions must overcome their prejudice to muslims and islam
2668732 i think you would agree that the ecumenical movement has reached a critical juncture
2668733 we must guard against any temptation to view doctrine as divisive and hence an impediment to the seemingly more pressing and immediate task of improving the world in which we live
2668734 you criticized our settlement policy and i tried to explain to you the restraints which we put on ourselves on the one hand and the need to keep the pace of life going on on the other hand
2668735 and while you disagree with us at least i hope you understand better the position of israel on some of these issues
2668736 it erodes trust it heightens palestinian suffering it makes the compromises israel will need to make for peace more difficult
2668737 so we are very clear not just britain but the whole of the european union what should be done we are also clear that the violence must stop too terrorism is a major obstacle to palestinian statehood and the efforts to ease movement and access restrictions which must continue
2668738 this should not stand in the way of achieving an agreement between us and the palestinians
2668739 we are closer than ever as i said in paris last week to an agreement
2668740 we have some disagreements which are very significant but i believe that we can overcome these disagreements within the time frame that has been set which is hopefully the end of this year
2668741 using bombs to stave off war views july 19 was surprising in its insistence that israel is likely to attack iran between november and january
2668742 indispensable step before deciding how to bring about the best response
2668743 until this mision is completely established unmik will have all the responsibilities
2668744 now i know without a doubt that the lord sent his angel and rescued me from herods clutches
2668745 yeah ok i ask for forgiveness in jesus name but ill tell you what ill also throw in seven solid quiet times this week ill pay my tithe this month and ill even read leviticus
2668746 if we confess our sins he is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness
2668747 therefore since we have a great high priest who has gone through the heavens jesus the son of god let us hold firmly to the faith we profess let us then approach the throne of grace with confidence so that we may receive mercy and find grace to help us in our time of need
2668748 hay una cuesti n de legitimidad que hay que respetar pero tambi n hay una cuesti n de legalidad

2668752 queremos mostrar la p rdida de la calidad de vida en nuestra ciudad
2668753 mide la paranoia que generan los medios demostrando que algunos lugares no son tan inseguros como se dice
2668754 creo que mi generaci n es la ltima que vivi una infancia en la que se pod a jugar tranquilo en la calle o tomar mate en la vereda de cualquier barrio porte o en cambio mi hija no conoce las plazas sin rejas
2668755 esto no quiere decir que cobos sea candidato a nada
2668756 planteamos l neas de acci n superadoras y no nos resignamos a aceptar la agenda que nos imponen
2668757 hab amos hablado de nueva pol tica di logo y consenso
2668758 a conspiracy quite openly made by them agreed upon and worked out
2668759 madonna and guy ritchie share their secret to a happy marriage and no its not the penetrator
2668760 women are like tea bags they dont know how strong they are until they get into hot water
2668761 het was goed dat ik hier in peking kon bidden dit illustreert dat god universeel is en geen enkele overheid man of vrouw zou de liefde voor een godsdienst mogen vrezen
2668762 de cli ntenraad leeft niet op voet van oorlog met het bestuur met de brief geven we aan dat er een tandje bijgezet moet worden wij willen resultaten zien
2668763 met de brief hebben we extra piketpaaltjes neergezet voor het bestuur
2668764 wij hebben deze brief binnen gekregen en hij verbaasde ons dat komt omdat de inspecteur die zich met zorgbalans bezig houdt de belofte heeft gekregen dat er positieve veranderingen doorgevoerd zouden worden
2668765 bij het laatste bezoek is de indruk ontstaan dat de situatie onder controle was onze inspecteur gaat nu op basis van deze brief weer praten met het bestuur het is een zorgwekkende situatie
2668766 de in de brief genoemde problemen hebben de aandacht van de or
2668767 wij gaan deze maand nog in gesprek met de raad van bestuur hierover
2668768 dat wij te kampen hebben met personeelsproblemen is al langer bekend dat is een probleem waar de hele markt mee te kampen heeft
2668769 de verhoudingen van de raad van bestuur en de cli ntenraden en de or zijn goed wij werken gezamenlijk aan passende maatregelen
2668770 its a challenge for midsize cities to raise this kind of money for conventions like these
2668771 i think both the rnc and the dnc recognize they are going to have to find a way to do things a little differently in the future
2668772 has full confidence that he will be able to close the gap
2668773 by law the presidential candidates themselves cannot receive unlimited corporate contributions
2668774 but those who are fundraising for them can receive those contributions and apply it to the biggest advertisement of the presidential campaign the nominating convention
2668775 its important to have this cynical hard nosed group of national reporters to put those who want to be president to the test
2668776 but in peoria and albuquerque reporters have an obligation to report on what the candidate said and to do it that day thats good too
2668777 decent good honest wonderful people who love their country and cherish the constitution of the united states
2668778 sen obamas run for president has the world witnessing history
2668779 he was promising it up on the stage but behind the scenes he was admitting it wouldnt go anywhere
2668780 die russische regierung erneut auf georgiens territoriale integrit t und souver nit t zu respektieren
2668781 sie war mit jemandem zusammen der sie nicht gut behandelt hat
2668782 we feel that a customer would want to buy products that cesar recommends since hes a specialist in his field
2668783 ihr modellprogramm beruht berwiegend auf spritfressenden fahrzeugen die fast unverk uflich geworden sind
2668784 es ist daher nicht wahrscheinlich dass alle drei traditionskonzerne die n chsten jahre berstehen werden
2668785 steigende lpreise h here rohstoffkosten und die dollarschw che hinzu gesellt sich die schw cher laufende konjunktur
2668786 voraussichtlich wird china in diesem jahr ber zehn millionen kraftfahrzeuge bauen und verkaufen
2668787 low cost fahrzeuge haben das potenzial das mobilit tssystem zu revolutionieren stellen sie sich etwa vor dass k nftig preisg nstige elektroautos verf gbar sind statt eines autokaufs bezahlen sie dann hnlich wie beim mobilfunk eine mobilit ts flatrate an den stromkonzern ihres vertrauens und erhalten das stadtauto kostenfrei dazu
2668788 aber wir sehen momentan keinerlei anzeichen die f r einen einstieg eines gro en investors sprechen
2668789 der indische tata konzern hat bereits die britischen traditionsmarken jaguar und land rover bernommen
2668790 wir sehen einen einbruch der gesch ftserwartungen auf breiter front
2668791 zweimal ein minus bei den auftragseing ngen in folge das ist ein deutliches zeichen der konjunkturelle h hepunkt ist berschritten
2668792 die einschl ge kommen n her allerdings werden nicht alle getroffen
2668793 der wettbewerb um marktanteile und produktionsauslastung wird 2009 h rter mit anderen worten der druck auf die margen wird zunehmen
2668794 die maschinenbauer im mdax beispielsweise sind finanziell durchweg gesund und k nnen auch eine durststrecke durchstehen
2668795 der abschwung hat gerade erst an kraft gewonnen es w re jetzt viel zu fr h dar ber zu spekulieren wann die schw chephase wieder endet
2668796 es wird in deutschland eine harte landung geben aber keine rezession
2668797 wenn jetzt schon von rezession geredet wird ist das eindeutig bertrieben zumindest im konomischen sinn
2668798 auf das vierte quartal wird es ankommen dort wird man sehen wie die konjunkturabk hlung wirklich durchschl gt
2668799 in den usa wird faktisch eine rezession antizipiert und auch bei uns wird eine markante abschw chung in den kursen vorweggenommen
2668800 der markt hat sich schon positioniert f r eine deutliche abschw chung daraus ziehen wir zuversicht f r die zukunft denn das negative berraschungspotenzial ist damit berschaubar
2668801 but just because something is new doesnt mean its a good idea to include it in the debates
2668802 viele anleger haben ihre positionen geschlossen sie wollen sich auf das sportereignis konzentrieren
2668803 ein guter verlauf der olympiade k nnte jedoch der startschuss zum wiedereinstieg sein
2668804 schaffen wir es selbst vor heimischem publikum nicht die meisten medaillen zu holen verlieren wir aber auch unsere ahnen das gesicht
2668805 erringen wir wie vor vier jahren in athen nur eine goldmedaille werde ich mich vom h chsten geb ude in peking st rzen
2668806 die entwicklung verl uft zwar nicht mehr so dynamisch wie in den vergangenen jahren die j hrlichen wachstumsraten werden jedenfalls weiterhin deutlich h her ausfallen als in den industriel ndern
2668807 wer die aktuelle schw che zum kaufen nutzen will muss sehr selektiv vorgehen
2668808 die drei verwaltungsbezirke haben mit ihren exportaktivit ten ber jahre hinweg eine wichtige rolle bei der schaffung neuer arbeitspl tze gespielt nun aber m ssen viele betriebe schlie en
2668809 ende juli etwa wurde die mehrwertsteuerr ckerstattung auf textilexporte angehoben
2668810 so k nnten ein verzicht auf zinserh hungen seitens der zentralbank und eine ausweitung der kreditvergabe die inflation in china anheizen und den inlandskonsum schw chen
2668811 jeder der mich gew hlt hat oder f r mich wahlkampf betrieben hat steht obama sehr viel n her als mccain

2668814 will leave a great gap in our political cultural and national lives words cannot describe the depth of sadness in our hearts
2668815 my feeling is the issue should have been aired and people should have had the opportunity to speak and vote it up or down
2668816 the caucus system is the exact opposite of everything ive been fighting for in terms of maximizing democratic input
2668817 that we have put 18 million cracks in the highest glass ceiling
2668818 there are different approaches within the democratic party about how best to achieve the commitment of universal coverage
2668819 wasnt effectively controlled by obama although his people certainly had a hand in it hes the candidate and he will have to run on this platform thats not unreasonable the issue of the caucuses wont be resolved here at the platform it will be resolved on the dnc level and they will have their full day in court i guarantee you
2668820 understand how a person comes to the u s senate and before theyve done one thing there decides they can be president
2668821 if he has the surgery hes out the rest of the year
2668822 if he doesnt theres still a chance he could be out the rest of the year its a blow
2668823 hes a guy who goes out there every day gives you 100 percent every day and is one of the leaders of this team emotionally and on the field its very disappointing for him and us
2668824 he went for the ball and didnt see me and his hand went into my stomach
2668825 i made a mistake in the first that put us in a hole and then battled the entire night
2668826 i caught a couple of tough breaks there in the sixth and couldnt hold the lead
2668827 anytime you can get to them early thats how you beat those guys
2668828 adopting best practices worldwide is given a top priority in the department senior officials from the department have made a tour to advanced countries to share expertise and look into their fruitful experiences we carried out a comprehensive study of the proposal before selection deliberating on providers expertise proven capabilities and quality of service we are quite confident that the solution and the accompanying service will exceed our expectations and the network will provide significant improvements in service levels
2668829 its not the discipline and the way we coach he has to have more poise than that it wont happen again im pretty sure of that
2668830 i thought the running backs were really good we are definitely a much better team running back wise
2668831 it looks like we are going to have some depth they show signs of being a really solid unit something we have not had
2668832 great computer crash of 2008 so im especially grateful for all the others who nominated posts and wrote posts of their own
2668833 benson built a single seat jet air plane its wing span was i believe 13 and it could go up to 300 mph
2668834 everyone did a great job and were really happy with silver because i dont think we were even expecting that
2668835 i knew it was going to be a tough race all the way through
2668836 looking and seeing all three of us together pretty much at the 200 i wasnt really comfortable with having that close of a race
2668837 i usually have more of a gap but it made my breaststroke a lot stronger
2668838 i saw lochte was going slower and i tried to do everything to go better than phelps but i dont have enough power for that
2668839 i looked up and he waved the flag and nodded his head
2668840 that was a pretty cool feeling to have the president say congratulations and have him in the crowd
2668841 i did everything i could so thats all i can ask for
2668842 that was amazing setting another world record you cant ask for anything else that was a great way to start off the meet for usa
2668843 i sort of turned around and thought i saw 4 31 and i was thinking that hurt a lot for a 4 31
2668844 but when i walked over and saw the 4 29 i thought thats amazing
2668845 it was a tough race but i cant really be mad
2668846 i was only like a half second off my best time so im happy to get my first medal of the olympics
2668847 glasvezelgebruikers zijn actiever op sociale netwerksites en de sociale cohesie onder de glasvezelklanten is groter
2668848 mensen voelen zich door de maatschappelijke insteek van glasvezelprovider onsnet meer verbonden met elkaar ze voelen zich lid van iets locaals dat is anders bij een landelijke breedbandaanbieder ook maken mensen met glasvezelaansluiting meer gebruik van juridisch en medisch advies op internet dat komt onder meer door de hoge snelheid van het internet men kan meer doen in minder tijd
2668849 it would be easier for the world to survive without the sun than to do without holy mass

2668865 the state doesnt have a revenue problem it has a spending problem
2668866 and what a convincing difference it has been 34 27
2668867 interestingly all this is true but that does not take away from the creditable performance of indias domestic it market
2668868 at 24 5 billion the indian domestic it market is not exactly a small market yet in dollar terms it grew 50 per cent in other words it added half of itself to it
2668869 over the next few years staff augmentation and project based deals would gradually dwindle to be replaced by more comprehensive outsourcing engagements

2668880 the thing i dont want is for this to go to trial and a jury to give him probation
2668881 the settlement gave those children a sense of security that could not be guaranteed if they had to sit across from him in the courtroom and testify before a jury
2668882 it isnt one of those things where you drop a meter in the water and read a needle
2668883 the key centres of population are broadly secure and so the people can live a normal life which means the economy can regenerate which of course raises the standard of living which keeps people on the right side
2668884 that enabled the marines with the assistance of acompany to clear the snakes head of enemy forces
2668885 one of the key reasons that the insurgency has changed so much is that the command structure has been shattered
2668886 youve only got to look at mullah dadullah lang who was a key commander who was killed some time last year and more recently sadiquallah and a couple of others who have been killed in helmand
2668887 you take the leader and the flock is questioning why its there and what its doing
2668888 this is a hugely fertile valley its always been the bread basket of afghanistan if theyve got the processing plant and the means to get it out then actually it becomes economically viable for a farmer to grow a whole lot of fruit which means he doesnt have to grow opium in the long term
2668889 it takes time its not something were going to get right this year or next year you cant give someone an alternative livelihood tonight
2668890 we shall continue our commitment to this country until the job is done

2668894 when he broke ground on jamaica beach he was only 30 years old a young man with a vision
2668895 it was something very unique when you look at the desolate barren island land then who could have envisioned all the communities on the west end and where they are at today he might have been a little ahead of his time
2668896 jamaica beach was my favorite project because i was so personally involved in it
2668897 the rich people had a second home but the middle class didnt
2668898 the first thing we had to do is convince people they needed a second home and then we had to convince them that jamaica beach is where they wanted to be
2668899 it left me feeling so tired and unwell i didnt have the strength for it
2668900 i realised i could only go back on a very loose basis and thats not me it was a heartbreaking decision
2668901 absolutely i would i have only retired for the foreseeable future i want to win things again thats what drives me i think thats what has kept me going over the last year
2668902 wembley was mind blowing but i can never talk about it without thinking about the semi final we were hanging on for dear life wembley was being knocked down the next season so we knew we would never get the chance to play there again
2668903 he was the most professional manager i ever played under and he will always go down in history for the wembley run
2668904 i personally think he has made the right decision because i think he does need to concentrate on getting himself back to full health i have already said to him once he is back i would like him to come and work for me in some capacity he has still got a lot to offer

2668927 his influence was unprecedented in its extent and its comparative immediacy
2668928 this most beautiful system of the sun planets and comets could only proceed from the counsel and dominion of an intelligent and powerful being
2668929 could not spring from any natural causes but were impressed by an intelligent agent
2668930 to treat of the world without saying anything of its author would be impious
2668931 supposes design and contrivance and consequently is a sign of production or creation
2668932 man of ordinary understanding who has seriously set about the matter and has duly weighd the evidences
2668933 the simplicity of the laws that prevail in the world
2668934 the works of nature offer everywhere proofs of the unbounded power and the consummate wisdom of their author

2668941 the revenue earned by the temple was also perhaps the main issue behind the legal tangle and the current confrontation in which tribal people have been used as cannon fodder
2668942 where will we go the maharanas of mewar gave us the right to conduct prayers here they also made valuable offerings to the god
2668943 i wont let the mandir go either to the devasthan or to the tribals
2668944 some members of the jain community say that some leaders of the vaishnava community are behind instigation of the tribals
2668945 the priests get a large fraction of all the offerings because of this selfish interest the group of priests do not want the management to go to the jains
2668946 none from the tribal community approached the police or the government with any representation after the firing
2668947 their action against the police was an expression of suppressed anger as most of the time they have been at the receiving end of police action
2668948 these jains have become millionaires because of us what do we have last year when the floods came the government announced rs 6 000 for each family whose home was destroyed many of us are yet to get that amount
2668949 in any agitation only the adivasi gets killed we want the devasthan department to take over the management of the temple and use the revenues for the development of this region
2668950 where will we go the maharanas of mewar gave us the right to conduct prayers here they also made valuable offerings to the god
2668951 i wont let the mandir go either to the devasthan or to the tribals
2668952 in april lakhs of tribal people come here to worship and it may become a delicate situation
2668953 there was this main square where we were shooting for bachna ae haseeno in freezing italy that used to be full of tourists during the day and so we got there at 3 am and 4 am to get that empty look it was a lot of pain but the results show
2668954 yeah weve finally managed to show that actresses can get along there wasnt much interaction on the sets but weve been meeting everyday to promote the film were not the best of friends but at least we can make conversation and help each other out
2668955 we just wanted to be open about it in that particular piece because it was our way of giving respect to our relationship and our families but now the media should focus on our careers not where were going for dinners or our holidays
2668956 im independent too responsible and have opinions though im only 22
2668957 indian languages are similar sounding but i couldnt understand this so to speak it right chinese actors on set helped me

2668987 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
2668988 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
2668989 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt

2668995 there were several explosions in several places in the county seat of kuqa this morning and we heard them from the hospital
2668996 i heard some bombs and then i heard some machine guns
2668997 we came down to the lobby this morning and it was breakfast as usual
2668998 weve all heard that there was a bombing early this morning
2668999 this doesnt usually happen its happening now because of the olympics but i dont know who is doing it
2669000 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
2669001 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
2669002 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
2669003 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
2669004 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
2669005 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
2669006 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
2669007 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
2669008 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
2669009 but those kids over there are sitting on the floor
2669010 it doesnt matter you arent allowed to sit on the floor you need to sit in a chair get off the floor
2669011 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
2669012 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
2669013 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
2669014 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
2669015 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
2669016 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
2669017 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages

2669024 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
2669025 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
2669026 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
2669027 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
2669028 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
2669029 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
2669030 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
2669031 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
2669032 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
2669033 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
2669034 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
2669035 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
2669036 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
2669037 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
2669038 yeah so what it wasnt what we had expected we would like to order something else
2669039 oooh if it smells good itll probably taste good drool drool
2669040 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
2669041 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
2669042 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
2669043 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
2669044 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
2669045 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
2669046 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
2669047 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
2669048 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
2669049 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
2669050 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
2669051 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
2669052 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
2669053 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
2669054 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
2669055 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
2669056 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
2669057 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
2669058 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
2669059 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
2669060 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
2669061 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
2669062 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
2669063 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent

2669069 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
2669070 when he discovered a suspicious configuration file in the corelocation section of the memory upon investigating he discovered a link to a page on apples website which
2669071 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
2669072 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
2669073 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
2669074 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
2669075 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
2669076 l get r mycket sv rt men i mitt jobb m ste man vara optimist
2669077 det r uppenbart att det r r sig om ett cyniskt utnyttjande snarare n en solidaritetshandling
2669078 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
2669079 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
2669080 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
2669081 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
2669082 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
2669083 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
2669084 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
2669085 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
2669086 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
2669087 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
2669088 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
2669089 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
2669090 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
2669091 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
2669092 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
2669093 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
2669094 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
2669095 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
2669096 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
2669097 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
2669098 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
2669099 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
2669100 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
2669101 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
2669102 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
2669103 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
2669104 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
2669105 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
2669106 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
2669107 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
2669108 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
2669109 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
2669110 porque yo no tengo donde publicarlas yo no tengo revista
2669111 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
2669112 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
2669113 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
2669114 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
2669115 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
2669116 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
2669117 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
2669118 who are open to doing something on the production side
2669119 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
2669120 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
2669121 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
2669122 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
2669123 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
2669124 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
2669125 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
2669126 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
2669127 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
2669128 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
2669129 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
2669130 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
2669131 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
2669132 if you love something let it go life there is only one it shouldnt be spent sitting on our ass specially if its a good looking one lol have adventures even little ones when you look back at your life i bet you wont remember a lot of the times you planted your ass on a couch and watched reality and game shows you will remember the laughing the sex the fights the places the meals the wounds the debates and the hugs

2669137 ideologies affect the topics discussed the manner of discussion the factors included or left out or inadequately stressed in arguments comments and models and attitudes shown sympathetic or hostile to past and contemporary economists works and views
2669138 based upon above statement it can be argued that there are a lot of differences between islamic and conventional banking systems both at micro and macro levels
2669139 speculation if mistaken tends ultimately to be self correcting in any commodity market
2669140 the real cause of unemployment is speculative demand for money
2669141 the speculative motive is derived from moneys use as an asset as a store of value
2669142 tools of production are treated servants in islam and man the master
2669143 if i am right in supposing it to be comparatively easy to make capital goods so abundant that the marginal efficiency of capital is zero this may be the most sensible way of gradually getting rid of many of the objectionable features of capitalism
2669144 im sitting on top of the rock with peach juice dripping down my chin in the silence of the screaming wind no human voices within and i am at peace

2669174 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
2669175 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
2669176 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
2669177 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
2669178 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
2669179 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
2669180 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
2669181 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
2669182 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
2669183 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
2669184 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
2669185 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
2669186 the instructor had a lot of information to give us and was very knowledgeable good speaker
2669187 i was able to get a lot of useful information from this class in not just crisis negotiation but how to utilize this information in taking all types of in progress calls for service
2669188 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
2669189 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
2669190 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
2669191 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
2669192 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
2669193 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
2669194 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1

2669205 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
2669206 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
2669207 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
2669208 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
2669209 as soon as a durable peace takes hold we need to move forward with dialogue and peaceful negotiations

2669223 the public security bureau always misuses its power they have lost their humanity
2669224 in the olympic village you can find religious freedom maybe some foreigners can worship
2669225 but i tell you the real crisis in china now is that there are no reformers left the power struggle among the leadership is for power not reform to have real political reform they would lose their power
2669226 this trip has reaffirmed my belief that men and women who aspire to speak their conscience and worship their god are no threat to the future of china
2669227 made it clear that trusting their people with greater freedom is necessary for china to reach its full potential

2669250 i love creativetechs marketing program i get their tips newsletter every week they are so consistent with it theyve never missed a week the tips arent always things i need but its amazing how many times theyll hit something that i need to know that day
2669251 most people make the mistake of marketing as selling how great they are i would never read an email from creativetechs if they were just bragging about themselves and yet here ive invited them into my personal computer on a weekly basis
2669252 ive heard they get 100 000 visits on their tips website each month so theres this whole international community out there that knows this small business in seattle which is in a way unheard of theyre thought leaders within the community thats a perfect place to be and its all based on knowledge they look really smart and they are smart
2669253 ive taken a lot of courses and wasted lots of money with some of those so called national real estate
2669254 its hard to go wrong with a family thats been successfully doing this business for over

2669259 hes used to national tv and exposure the notre dame program the schedule they play in front of the fans they play before at home and on the road it doesnt faze him when he comes here its one of the reasons outside of the fact that hes a success oriented young man and at the same time he has good stuff to go along with it that hes been able to make this transition in chicago so rapidly
2669260 i think that tells you something it tells me that i like him and that i have confidence in him

2669265 we as their neighbors have watched what elk grove has done across the river elk grove was a wonderful community first rate
2669266 i think we are going to be in a dogfight before we are through
2669267 its unusual but we really wanted to do what was right for kids
2669268 it is exciting to see a district be able to do this
2669269 it has happened here and there but it certainly isnt prevalent especially in these budget cutting days
2669270 teacher contact time is so important to student achievement every minute counts
2669271 we have kids not learning at high enough levels and part of that is that we need more time with them
2669272 but we can create a protective halo in the forests that surround schools and homes by removing the ladder fuel
2669273 what people think of as a normal forest is actually unhealthy in many cases fires used to come through every five or so years it was a natural occurrence if you stood in this same spot in the early 1800s this forest would have looked much like this
2669274 if a fire came through now itd make a lot of smoke but wouldnt be such a threat to lives and property
2669275 anytime people need to stretch dollars they use their public libraries
2669276 i think were going to see evidence of that i hope those who have discovered the library will become advocates if theyre threatened
2669277 june 5 was a tragic day for me and my family and it was a tragic day for the deputies who were injured
2669278 we were all victims that day but this lawsuit is victimizing our family again what do they want my husbands dead my sons dead do they want my house and my 10 year old car
2669279 with the firefighters rule the reasoning is that they voluntarily agreed to undertake these risks they know going in that fighting crime or fighting fires is dangerous
2669280 additionally they are paid well to encounter the risks theyre given a whole packet of benefits to compensate them if theyre injured so allowing them to sue citizens would almost be like double taxation
2669281 if people worry that they might be sued by police officers or firefighters they might hesitate to call on them for help and that would be bad public policy
2669282 but i just want to say this we are confident that the firefighters rule will not bar the claim
2669283 i feel like god has his hand wrapped around me
2669284 i feel like i lost my brothers but theyre in a better place now
2669285 i give my grace to them and love them all

2669296 there was an incident involving angie everhart and her boyfriend
2669297 he was gone from the location of the incident before deputies arrived there were minor injuries but they did not require medical attention he was subsequently booked for misdemeanor spousal battery
2669298 i lament the loss of a ferociously funny and hardcore family man my thoughts are with his wife rhonda and their family bernie mac you are already missed
2669299 bernie mac was one of the best and funniest comedians to ever live but that was the second best thing he did
2669300 bernie was one of the greatest friends a person could have
2669301 losing him is like losing 12 people because he absolutely filled up any room he was in
2669302 this is a very sad day for many of us who knew and loved bernie he brought so much joy to so many he will be missed but heaven just got funnier
2669303 its hard to put into words just how i feel and what a painful loss this is bernie was a brother a friend and one of the comic masters of our time sharing the marquee with him during the phenomenon of the kings of comedy tour bonded us like family and created a unique moment in comic history marking some of the most meaningful memorable and fun times of our lives his comedic approach was his own brand and will definitely stand the test of time the level of his talent always inspired me and other comedians to bring their a game i promise you that you never wanted to be the guy who had to follow bernies set as a husband and father he was the man and my thoughts and prayers are with his family he will truly be missed but so well remembered
2669304 his passing is such a major loss to the acting and comedy communities
2669305 bernie mac was the personification of the word real he kept it real
2669306 that kind of genuine spirit that he carried all time cannot be easily duplicated but i will do my very best to try
2669307 its like somebody says something and they run like wildfire with this stuff
2669308 you got to come with a little extra to satisfy them
2669309 when i started in comedy in the clubs in 1977 blacks couldnt do certain clubs not because they were segregated they just didnt want to put the black comics out there in los angeles the clubs would have a black night people would say why dont you come by and do something i would say im a comedian dont put a title on me dont limit yourself how you start is how you finish
2669310 if you let people put tags on you youll never be able to remove them youve got to make people respect you respect is bigger than dollars and cents
2669311 why cause you scared of me scared im a say something you expletive right think i wont say something
2669312 i have this personality and theres a downside to it too but i have this thing where its like okay ive chosen to bungee jump off this ledge i have to do it and if the cord snaps well i might as well enjoy the ride down
2669313 am i gonna look back and say god i wish i could have gone to that that concert id rather be listening to my son sing songs id rather be watching him sleep
2669314 we ichat with chris constantly no matter what is going on in my life relationship wise chris takes absolute precedence its important for ryder to hear me say how wonderful chris is and how much chris misses him

2669316 when i was in australia they had a placenta tree that was on the river and all the placentas of all that tribe all that clan whatever aboriginal tribe that was all the placentas went under that one tree and it was this huge behemoth of just health and strength
2669317 this tree was just growing taller and stronger above the rest of mother nature around it it was gorgeous
2669318 i have a chance for tomorrow and well i have to wait
2669319 after that i got mad and i lost concentration for the rest of the round
2669320 well it looks like you cant send your scores in time and youre finished
2669321 if the world were to draw any lessons from what i did there would never be any wars
2669322 we shouldnt really stoop so low to wage wars against each other
2669323 as far as the hugging and kissing goes i do that with many friends i have many friends around the world and will always do that there should be no hatred among athletes and people
2669324 politicians should straighten out the situation today and if they dont well have to get involved
2669325 when it comes to sports we will always remain friends and nothing will effect our friendship even in such a scary event as shooting
2669326 we are friends indeed weve been shooting together for a long time she used to shoot for the soviet union we are really friends and dont get mixed up in political things sports is not politics
2669327 the most beautiful people we have known are those who have known defeat known suffering known struggle known losses and have found their way out of the depths these people have an appreciation sensitivity and an understanding of life that fills them with compassion gentleness and a deep loving concern beautiful people do not just happen
2669328 success is the ability to go from one failure to another with no loss of enthusiasm

2669344 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2669345 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2669346 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2669347 omg im more tired than 2 elephants after sex goodnight dont let the sugar plum fairies bite
2669348 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2669349 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2669350 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2669351 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2669352 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

2669379 for the sake of the environment it is critical to look at future steel vehicle as all vehicles from a life cycle assessment lca perspective
2669380 based on the recent lca study and model developed at the university of california santa barbara implementation of more efficient powertrain systems elevates the importance of the emissions from material production placing greater emphasis on selecting a low greenhouse gas intensive material such as steel
2669381 compared to other materials used to reduce vehicle weight these advanced high strength steels produce five to 15 times less ghg emissions during the material manufacturing phase which greatly reduces a vehicles life cycle carbon footprint
2669382 were not just looking at the vehicle design and its impact on ghg at the tailpipe
2669383 were concerned with the whole life cycle of the vehicle from the emissions produced and energy used to create raw materials all the way to the impact of recycling if the whole life cycle is not taken into account there is the distinct possibility of having a net increase in ghg if the wrong material choice is made this isnt just speculation weve got very clear models that demonstrate this

2669387 in sterreichs lebensmittelhan del herrscht marktversagen und die konsumenten zahlen t glich drauf anstatt dagegen anzuk mpfen bt sich der zust ndige wirtschaftsminister bar tenstein in unt tigkeit oder beschr nkt sich auf das werfen von nebelgranaten so ist etwa seine ank ndigung von intensiven preiskontrollen im februar 2008 zu werten deren ergebnisse bis heute nicht einmal ver ffentlicht wurden
2669388 die menschen in sterreich stellen bereits ihr konsumverhalten um viele verzichten auf urlaub oder schr nken sich im alltag ein diese alarmsignale m ssen vom zust ndigen wirtschaftsminister ernst genommen werden es ist daher eine geringsch tzung der bed rfnisse der sterreichischen konsumenten wenn bartenstein jetzt vermeldet dass die wettbewerbsbeh rde zu wenige kompetenzen habe warum hat langzeit wirtschaftsminister bartenstein das nicht l ngst ge ndert oder hat die vp schon seit jahren v llig auf effektive markt berwachung verzichtet
2669389 der wirtschaftsminister ist offenbar nicht einmal dazu in der lage die st ndlichen preis nderungen der mineral lmultis einzuschr nken f r die konsumenten wird dadurch tanken zum lotteriespiel man wei nicht einmal ob bei der tankstellenkasse noch der gleiche preis gilt den man beim zufahren auf der anzeigetafel gesehen hat wie wenig nachvollziehbar die preisbildung der lfirmen ist zeigt sich etwa anhand der aktuellen entwicklung die roh lpreise sind um mehr als 15 prozent gesunken der treibstoffpreis blieb aber nahezu gleich auch hier greift bartenstein nicht ein denn durch sein nichtstun steigen t glich die einnahmen von finanzminister molterer aufwachen und handeln herr bartenstein

2669394 it is a neck and neck race between 2007 and this year over the issue of ice loss
2669395 we thought arctic ice cover might recover after last years unprecedented melting and indeed the picture didnt look too bad last month cover was significantly below normal but at least it was up on last year
2669396 when we did the first climate change computer models we thought the arctics summer ice cover would last until around 2070
2669397 it is now clear we did not understand how thin the ice cap had already become for arctic ice cover has since been disappearing at ever increasing rates every few years we have to revise our estimates downwards now the most detailed computer models suggest the arctics summer ice is going to last for only a few more years and given what we have seen happen last week i think they are probably correct
2669398 it does not really matter whether 2007 or 2008 is the worst year on record for arctic ice
2669399 the crucial point is that ice is clearly not building up enough over winter to restore cover and that when you combine current estimates of ice thickness with the extent of the ice cap you get a very clear indication that the arctic is going to be ice free in summer in five years and when that happens there will be consequences
2669400 the trouble is that sea ice is now disappearing from the arctic faster than our ability to develop new computer models and to understand what is happening there we always knew it would be the first region on earth to feel the impact of climate change but not at anything like this speed what is happening now indicates that global warming is occurring far earlier than any of us expected

2669534 dialog city an event converging art democracy and digital media
2669535 i would characterize them as projects that encourage civic engagement we wanted to find a way to give voice to different types of expression from the community but not in a way that was partisan or political
2669536 theyre posing the essential questions like what is news what is the truth what is a lie and getting people to think about it
2669537 we wanted to have a colorado element in play so it wasnt just all out of state artists
2669538 because were a museum based in latin american culture it is about art but what can happen is the art becomes a tool to really start addressing very important issues
2669539 what were trying to show in a way that people can experience viscerally is that were all made of the same flesh iranians and americans and by extension all human beings
2669540 modern dance is a truly american form that has such freedom of expression and the fact that were getting to take it to this communist country is pretty mind blowing

2669542 none of us has been to china before except jackson
2669543 its such an amazing opportunity sometimes i cant even find the words for it i have to pinch myself
2669544 and it made me aware of how little i knew about what was going on in the world i had no idea why there would be an attack on the u s
2669545 before that i was young and i was still in school and i was focused on myself but after that i was just really curious about what was going on in the world with contemporary events and just trying to figure it all out
2669546 particularly with something like the dnc and the rnc which are all about constructing myths and really big values for people to attach to
2669547 my interest in a certain way is being a part of that dialogue as an artist not leaving that space of cultural imagination purely to politicians or purely to the media or purely to public relations companies
2669548 dialog city an event converging art democracy and digital media
2669549 i stand on the street with a protest sign or invite 75 to 100 people to speak a text in public because im interested in raising certain questions about politics which i cant do as an activist i can only do as an artist
2669550 contemporary artists are really engaged right now in the discourse about what this country does and how to engage in it and how to have an impact on it
2669551 theyre responding to the world around them which is kind of scary right now
2669552 there is so much suffering and pain and so many problems that are bigger than me and my personal issues that ive got an obligation or a responsibility to talk about bigger things
2669553 its not blatantly addressing the election say its not telling anyone to do anything in particular but it is just my reactions to what is going in the world right now so in that way i would say it is political
2669554 i dont think that one piece of artwork is going to stop a war or something but i do think it contributes to a conversation
2669555 and i think thats really important to have conversations and make people more aware of what is going on
2669556 the sole purpose of any play should be to change the entire world thats it
2669557 because if everyone in the world sees your play and understands it then everything in the world should change you shouldnt shoot for anything less than that
2669558 the political comedy that works best is a direct challenge to the audience in some way
2669559 nobody likes to see some jerk stand on a stage and scream condescendingly at the crowd and in a nutshell thats a lot of plays and that stinks because you are not inspiring people
2669560 what i want to see is an audience that is so outraged you have no choice but to laugh about it and then go out and make the world a better place
2669561 a lot of political theater actually ends up being vaudeville
2669562 if you put george bush on stage and threw a pie at him thats vaudeville an old and respected tradition of theater but its not a play when you start pretending it is a play you should be compared to clifford odetts and bertolt brecht when really here you should be compared to w c fields
2669563 we do plays and no matter what the circumstances any play has to have a dramatic arc
2669564 you still have to be dramatically engaging and tell a coherent interesting story
2669565 i dont pay much attention to corporate media now but i am sure by now i would have heard if john mccain had renounced the bush policy in iraq
2669566 thats everything i need to know about st paul its easier for me to be loving and forgiving from afar
2669567 to avoid having to take innocent lives in exchange for corporate gain
2669568 this bush mccain policy in iraq is dangerous to my nation and as a patriot and as a marine i cannot support it
2669569 if somebody came to my play and absolutely disagreed with me to the extent that they then went out and started to lend active support to some pro war iraq veterans i would feel like i had achieved my purpose even more so than if somebody came in who was opposed to the war and said yep he was right and then did nothing
2669570 good theater gets people off their couches and if theres anything we need in america right now its to get people away from the tv and doing something about what they believe in whatever that is
2669571 when you think about it the odd couple is about two guys who grew up in a society where the men are the powerful ones and divorce is unspoken of
2669572 that play was one of the key influences in the huge expansion of the abolitionist movement and moving the country toward the emancipation proclamation and the civil war
2669573 theres nothing funny about the subject or the victims because its too horrific
2669574 but what you can do is have your audience laugh at the truth of the farce of the situation at those contractors taking all of that money to build nothing our job is to tell you facts that you dont necessarily know the comedy is just the delivery system
2669575 but part of it always should be about the audience uncomfortably laughing at themselves because if you agree that all of this is horribly wrong shouldnt you be out in the streets doing something about it

2669656 i think its important that the public consider that because if we want to get products to and from the marketplace safely and quickly and we want to get passengers to and from school and work quickly and safely additional investments will be needed
2669657 and we have to think honestly and rationally about where that money would come from
2669658 you cant ride a bike with a load of logs you cant carpool with a load of logs there may be some need for a differential there

2669677 a parents primary question after a game teaches the child what is important
2669678 its far better to ask did you have fun or what did you learn than did you win when parents value improvement and fun over the score of the game the child begins to place more emphasis on learning and enjoyment the shift emphasizes the process of the sport rather than the results of the game it comes back to placing value on things that the child can control

2669963 i was shocked that there are 1 000 energy drinks out there
2669964 hooters has an energy drink and playboy and random and 99 percent of them are the same thing carbonated sugar water with caffeine

2669990 proven that they can dig out of a hole because you have to believe they can create return fast enough to help you catch up from any down period you want them to be able to live up to the expectation you had for the fund when you first bought it which means you have to believe they can get performance back to what you expected over time
