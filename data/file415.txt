4150232 so the point that i was making at the time was that the political dynamic was the driving force between that sectarian violence and we could try to keep a lid on it but if these underlining dynamic continued to bubble up and explode the way they were then we would be in a difficult situation i am glad that in fact those political dynamic shifted at the same time that our troops did outstanding work

4150239 the company involved in the super exciting haynesville shale region which could be one of the largest domestic on shore natural gas fields ever
4150240 the stock has been coming on lately as more investors learn about the companys potential in the haynesville shale region
4150241 discovered in march of this year the haynesville field according to energy and capital could conservatively hold 168 trillion cubic feet of natural gas
4150242 there was always a notion that a big find was in the space that the company currently owns 2 700 acres but when it was first explored back in the 1950 crude oil prices were much lower and there was no technology to get to the natural gas
4150243 most folks dont realize that there is a gold rush in domestic resources going on right now in part to new technologies to find and drill for crude oil and natural gas this has created a fantastic problem of no rigs and too few pipelines
4150244 this makes the deal with petrohawk so special another element to the arrangement is the fact that petrohawk will pay all expenses associated with drilling the first well the financial arrangement will be 60 40 with mainland getting the latter
4150245 that is a very favorable ratio for a junior resource company and it means they may not have to go to the public for additional funding that would dilute present shareholders there are some analysts that think this is a 9 00 stock but i think it could be a 13 00 stock by the end of this year
4150246 i interviewed the ceo of petrohawk in june when i anchored cavuto on the fox business network and natural gas is going to play a prominent role in our energy use for decades to come
4150247 in fact i spent time with t boone pickens last month in wyoming and his plan is more about natural gas to run our cars than wind mills to power our electric grid i also spoke with the ceo of mainland and his optimism is clear
4150248 of course this is a small cap play and cash flow may not begin until late in the year so there are greater than average risks
4150249 that may explain why the shorts have been on the attack right now im told there is a 20 million share naked short position that is a significant amount of folks that may have to cover in a hurry
4150250 technically the stock has room to 8 00 and through there i think that the shorts will begin to cover and the stock should rally to 10 00 fairly quickly our long term price target is 13 00
4150251 nervous investors should consider a stop loss at 5 30 although we would more than likely be buyers on weakness unless there was a material fundamental change in the company and its potential

4150381 if transpromo is to be effectively exploited there needs to be an improvement in customer data standards two fifths of the population have received bills or statements addressed to the wrong person in the last six months which could seriously undermine consumer attitudes to advertising carried in those documents the opportunities presented by transpromo are probably very considerable but their effective use requires british business to make significant enhancements to the way it manages and updates customer records

4150425 its a very seminal period an opportunity to both celebrate 20 years of content and the fact that the source was a leader in chronicling the culture of hip hop
4150426 im on a mission to restore it to the community that gave birth to it and open the door to those that currently enjoy and influence that hip hop culture
4150427 its exciting because we believe that we can do it
4150428 we shared with him what we were trying to do the vision of hip hop and where we thought it needed to go and he thought it was refreshing and clever
4150429 were just going to expand on what the source has always done well
4150430 a core focus but not 80 percent of the book
4150431 i think that what were trying to do is evolve it as hip hop has evolved and become an international force to evolve it without losing its core essence that was the centerpiece of its earliest beginnings and greatness but it has to evolve just like hip hop has to evolve
4150432 it is a force nobody can deny the force or the power of the source but is it the same as it was five years ago no
4150433 it does not deliver with the same punch that it used to
4150434 if they are true to the dna of the publication
4150435 it left off so much of what is the key ingredients of hip hop and lifestyle now which is lifestyle fashion online new media international aspects of how people embrace content
4150436 if anything we want to restore it restore it to greatness and its no 1 spot
4150437 you kind of either just look around and laugh or just like enjoy it
4150438 were in awe its a whirlwind and were happy to be on the ride
4150439 for us having this album finally hit stores and having them sing the songs knowing that they can actually hear them and have it in their possession is the most amazing thing for us were so excited
4150440 they really in the last year kicked into high gear with coming to the shows following the music and continuing to talk about it online
4150441 the online thing has been really big for us the youtube videos the myspace all of that but for us all of them outside make it all possible
4150442 weve been here since monday afternoon at twelve so weve been camping out all night and it was so cold when it hit 3 a m
4150443 we just kept on hanging on cause we love the jonas brothers so much well do anything for them
4150444 maybe one day id write a song and somebody would sing it and then no one would really know that i wrote it
4150445 it would be kind of exciting and i had heard that prince did that and it was just kind of a goal for me

4150447 the panel will be moderated by dana todd chief marketing officer for newsforce inc and chairperson of the board for sempo
4150448 for sempo ses san jose has always been a very important search event in terms of the breadth and depth of the sessions the quality of the attendees and the opportunity to acquaint people with what sempo has to offer organizations
4150449 this year looks particularly promising because in reviewing the program i see that it includes far more brand name companies than in the past which is one more indication that search has become deeply embedded into the mainstream
4150450 whats so funny about what clowns do and why do we like this
4150451 when we were recording at sound city studios i found it very easy to get drunk and stay there
4150452 i also found it easy to amuse my friends joshua any time hes down i just want to make him happy and nothing delights him more than seeing me on rollerblades one night i got sh faced and long story short when the head of sound city one of the pre eminent recording studios wakes you up at 7 in the morning in their upstairs parking lot and youre wearing nothing but a tank top cutoffs and rollerblades youve got f ing problems
4150453 i was rolling with a certain hollywood figure who may or may not have been aforementioned as a guest singer on this record and this tattoo artist i was rolling with in order to keep her in my life as my friend it meant the end of the potential for another aspect of our relationship so it was more of a disappointment
4150454 thats the worst kind of heartbreak in a way because it was the heartbreak of being an adult
4150455 i get off the phone with this girl and i said out loud f now im a f ing fool
4150456 i dont care what anybody says when youre hanging out with celebrities you never expect to get involved with them emotionally no matter how much you like them
4150457 this album is kind of i hate to sound corny but its kind of a mature look at hollywood
4150458 i fell in love with hollywood the city itself in a randy newman sort of way so i guess the album is about a variety of things di swinging in hollywood and acting tougher than you really might be
4150459 i really believe if you want to keep doing what were doing in this business youve got to grow
4150460 you have to go somewhere you have to be on a curve not on a line
4150461 not that its a good one but i have some sort of reputation and i could f that up doing the wrong thing thats suddenly a consideration thats never been present before thats going to affect everything the trick was learning how to give appropriate time to certain things but what im glad to see is really on this record its the same story two best friends having a sh s and giggles good time making rock and roll
4150462 theres a time and place for everything and now is the time
4150463 this upcoming album theater of the mind is an event and all the songs on it are events
4150464 i felt like there was no bigger event in hip hop at this moment than me and t i working together
4150465 it was always turmoil between our camp and his camp us as the bosses of our companies everyone is gonna follow our lead wed figure if it aint no problem and we dont have no issues no beef then theres no reason we shouldnt be able to get together and make music that was an executive decision that was made on both our behalves
4150466 i was surprised just as much as everybody else was
4150467 i talked to luda and he said it was time to sit down do business make grown man moves both of them got albums coming out time to try new things cris did something for t i too that nobody heard yet its about to come out soon its a good move
4150468 its showing that once great minds set their differences aside they can make something happen
4150469 thats two grown men not two grown males grown men
4150470 are these folks so new to politics are they so arrogant that they think hes different from every other nominee weve ever had
4150471 we applaud tyra banks and the cw for making this historic visibility of transgender people possible
4150472 if i was going to go gay for another actress it would have to be cate blanchett
4150473 absolutely we could talk about a theater and she has played a guy really well so if i got bored thatd be nice
4150474 the worst thing that happens to you can be the best thing if you dont let it get the best of you
4150475 a few years ago there were still technical hurdles to actually signing and using dnssec but in the past few years a lot of software tools both commercial and open source have come out and now its a completely solved problem
4150476 all thats left is the far less tractable purely political problem
4150477 arguing over who gets to hold the cryptographic keys in the long run should wait until were not facing a critical threat

4150484 i was so calm that i think i could have seen each face in this venue
4150485 the quest to have more medals than spitz will be something very important
4150486 and hes keeping the attention of the public he is a great athlete
4150487 i felt tired before the competition but after it i feel relaxed
4150488 there were a number of candidates to sing that song and at the end of the day the artistic directors picked the best voice and the best performer
4150489 i dont see there is anything wrong with it if everybody concerned agrees
4150490 the counterfeit games designed to look good from every angle
4150491 bring some sanity and proportion back to both the opening ceremony and the games themselves
4150492 our president may have gone there just to watch the games the chinese leadership does not take that view
4150493 they want to send a message the message of flawless execution
4150494 shows once again how political the sponsorship of the olympics is for the chinese
4150495 this is pretty unfair for the girl who was not picked to perform live
4150496 this girl has a great voice and they should recognize that she deserves to be seen she should definitely perform at the closing ceremonies
4150497 if your son is playing on a football team suddenly the coach may decide that hes not playing hes going to stay on the bench
4150498 the right information has to be given to the people
4150499 its too early to feel excited and i still need time to experience the happiness
4150500 it was a long way for me to win this medal and i think it was gods award for all my suffering and hard work
4150501 i hope russian wrestlers could win 10 golds in the olympics the more the better
4150502 anyway i felt something heavy the silver medal on my neck now so i cannot complain more
4150503 from the very beginning we were ahead of them in points compared with the last match we were more relaxed
4150504 we had a good start which put a lot of pressure on our opponents we had very good rhythm organization and momentum
4150505 they are very strong team we tried our best to play to our best standard but we still lost
4150506 we dont think much about the points and medals we will adjust ourselves according to the next opponent and be well prepared for the next match
4150507 we were late in our attack and we could not play our game
4150508 our shots were affected by the wind but we came back in the third game strong
4150509 were not even halfway into the games right now and were a second half team weve always been a second half team
4150510 i would have loved the medal the first medal for canada would have been awesome to have
4150511 i couldnt pull it through but that doesnt mean we wont be having one soon
4150512 we have talked about this scenario many times before and it has not phased us in the slightest
4150513 we are ready to go same time same channel but friday
4150514 fourth place is probably the worst spot you can get at the olympic games
4150515 we still have 10 days to go at the olympics and there are going to be lots of medals coming from canadian athletes
4150516 all the hard work and stuff that ive done over the last 23 years is what allowed me to get here
4150517 this is really the show this is where we get to have a good time
4150518 y al cant que nos fuimos es un local peque o con barra en todo el lateral y unas mesitas redondas pero altas con dos niveles de altura te sientas alrededor de la mesa en unos taburetes altos y te pones ciego tienen un plato de
4150519 those two objectives may have demonstrably failed but 65 remains a mountain under the alternative member system which was designed to give diminishing returns as you get closer to the magic number some wonk should do a graph itd probably look a bit like
4150520 if we work hard and make a clear case for a green agenda
4150521 presumably because herbs are green too whatever the logic im always pleased to see people making the case for green votes its sage advice
4150522 ensure the strictest compliance with human rights and the rule of law in the enforcement of anti terrorist measures
4150523 happier learn the secrets to daily joy and lasting fulfillment

4150533 thats shocking the academic debate is between some who say that junior enlisted ranks lean slightly republican and some who say its about equal but no one would point to six to one
4150534 that represents a tremendous shift from 2000 when the military vote almost certainly was decisive in florida and elsewhere and leaned heavily towards the republicans

4150639 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
4150640 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
4150641 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
4150642 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
4150643 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
4150644 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
4150645 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
4150646 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
4150647 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
4150648 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
4150649 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
4150650 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
4150651 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
4150652 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
4150653 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
4150654 who are open to doing something on the production side
4150655 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
4150656 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
4150657 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
4150658 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
4150659 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
4150660 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
4150661 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
4150662 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
4150663 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
4150664 i wanted to take my kids in an rv and do a lot of national parks driving
4150665 really for the last three years and i just chose not to do it
4150666 thats real money it has a real impact on their behavior
4150667 i saw the line and looked at the price tag and said oh my god it was good while it lasted
4150668 si alguien tiene prisa por presentarla antes y sumarse con ello a una suerte de negociaciones para obtener alg n beneficio lo estar a haciendo a t tulo personal
4150669 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
4150670 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
4150671 the united states of america stands strongly as the president of france just said for the territorial integrity of georgia
4150672 i would consider that to be bluster from the foreign minister of russia
4150673 we are very concerned about these reports it is a serious situation
4150674 were hoping he will travel up later today for talks and a medical and we are very hopeful that we will sign him up
4150675 i would think it is unlikely that it will be done by saturday but we will make every effort
4150676 of all our targets justin was top of the list so its excellent to get the chance to open talks with him
4150677 hes got fantastic potential hes already a very good player an england under 21 international hes very well schooled and hes got a lot of premier league experience with both arsenal and sunderland
4150678 we had jeremie aliadiere come from arsenal and we know in terms of his lifestyle he is a good professional
4150679 because we all attach different pieces of metadata to our video clips and because were all looking in different ways for the video that we watch theres just no great way to service the exact thing that you think youre looking for and that the advertiser is paying for its just a complicated model across the board
4150680 its done by buzz whats most popular whats most viewed whats most shared those type of metrics
4150681 what advertisers are really looking to buy for is by whats
4150682 but actually monetizing video clips from search not such a big opportunity for advertisers because when you thing about it a search result is really a bounce thru like when you got there youre going to go right to the original site and not stick around to watch some ads whereas if youre going to watch a whole program the consumer will be more likely to watch some paid ads
4150683 this is not just a yahoo situation its across the board
4150684 i personally think that video search is one of the areas that has the most tremendous potential for improvement over the next couple years there are more and more companies developing voice recognition and facial recognition technology as these technologies become more robust and better tested you can scan the video content and build the text tagging associated with it so then it becomes searchable i think theres a tremendous opportunity for video there
4150685 it needs to work it just doesnt work right now
4150686 we at yahoo are focusing on the big television budgets and no television buyer would think about video search there are some digital advertisers who think they know the audience they want to reach that might be searching and want to spend their dollars there but its all really small
4150687 the more the different types of content you expand online the more the searches evolve into simply showing your website for x to showing a video about y which is related to x so advertisers have to be able to expand the set of keywords theyre advertising on in order to capture that new involved behavior
4150688 were doing a number of experiments not only with the search results but with the advertisements it can run in order to help advertisers embed extra information in there we have to think about going forward not only are we structuring our content on the website correctly but are we advertising with that structure to make it easier for the person to access what theyre looking for and also with creating new content are we thinking about how that new content can augment our clients advertising campaigns so they can actually see a snapshot of what theyre going to before they actually commit to the click and charge the advertiser
4150689 we tried to do our best and it was not good enough the forwards just did not have enough of the ball and our man of the match was pepe reina that says everything about us
4150690 we will need a big improvement at anfield we know we did not play our best game against liege
4150691 we struggled we could not pass the ball to our team mates anywhere near enough
4150692 it was a difficult night and difficult to know what really went wrong but the good thing was a clean sheet and that will give us the edge in a fortnight for the second leg
4150693 we know it was not our best game but we want to step things up and we know there is quality in the team we have shown that in pre season and now we must show it in competitive matches too
4150694 we have some big games coming up so we must not play like this again we are looking forward to saturday and the first league game at sunderland to show who we are and what we are

4150781 the courier journal will lay off about 15 employees and leave other positions vacant as part of a broader cost cutting move by the newspapers parent gannett co the newspaper announced today
4150782 an unspecified number of jobs will be cut at the courier journal by not filling vacant positions overall gannett will eliminate about 1 000 positions or 3 percent of its total work force
4150783 arnold garson publisher of the courier journal said in a memo to employees that the local layoffs arent as deep as those experienced at many other metro newspapers this year
4150784 as you all know the newspaper industry like many other businesses and industries is in the midst of a difficult economic time garson wrote adding that the company doesnt see the present trend of declining revenues improving anytime soon
4150785 layoff notices will be completed by aug 27 garson said and severance packages will be offered to those who lose their jobs severance and continued medical benefits will be based on length of service
4150786 garson said in his memo that any future job eliminations will depend on whether revenue continues to decline
4150787 we have no choice but to keep expense trends consistent with our revenue trends
4150788 newspapers have been cutting jobs by the thousands recently mcclatchy co owner of 30 daily newspapers including the lexington herald leader recently announced plans to eliminate 10 percent of its staff or about 1 400 jobs companywide

4150795 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4150796 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
4150797 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
4150798 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
4150799 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
4150800 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
4150801 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
4150802 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
4150803 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
4150804 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
4150805 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
4150806 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
4150807 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
4150808 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
4150809 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
4150810 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
4150811 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
4150812 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
4150813 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
4150814 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
4150815 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
4150816 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
4150817 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
4150818 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
4150819 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
4150820 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
4150821 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
4150822 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
4150823 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4150824 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
4150825 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
4150826 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
4150827 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
4150828 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
4150829 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
4150830 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
4150831 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
4150832 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
4150833 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
4150834 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
4150835 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
4150836 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
4150837 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
4150838 these young people have clearly worked hard and we should celebrate their success
4150839 but with one in four candidates now achieving an a grade we need to be sure that the most talented students are being properly stretched
4150840 the new regulator must now act by reviewing these top grades so that we can be fully confident that the apparent improvements are real
4150841 there is now a clear divide at the heart of our education system the rate of improvement in the a grade pass rate in the south is nearly three times greater than in the north
4150842 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
4150843 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
4150844 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
4150845 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
4150846 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
4150847 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
4150848 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
4150849 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
4150850 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country

4150910 reclaiming public spaces as a space for public imagination and enlightenment where they have become propagandistic barriers to thought and awareness
4150911 wir haben kein nationales register und f r den moment verzeichnen die sektionen keine massenabg nge das ph nomen ist nebens chlich
4150912 today as we fast approach a decade of zinwas existence the plans for service delivery remain in boardrooms and all the nation gets are frequent updates of the challenges facing the authority
4150913 today water shortages persist and if everyone is to be honest with themselves zinwa is merely giving the same excuses for non delivery that local authorities gave when they failed to fulfil their statutory responsibilities
4150914 the city is currently experiencing pockets of high incidence of diarrhoeal diseases which could be attributed to the current water crisis but no deaths have been recorded
4150915 water shortages in homes schools churches beerhalls and other public places are of grave concern to the city as the hygiene in those places and the health of people is severely compromised
4150916 quality water provision is one of the items topping my agenda indications are that all is not well at zinwa in terms of meeting their mandate of providing quality water
4150917 consistently called upon the government to reverse the zinwa takeover and return the responsibility to manage water supply to the city council
4150918 i used to work as a till operator for a local shop owner who gave me coins to throw away because they had become useless i followed his instructions now that they the coins are back in circulation i have something to smile about
4150919 i found about nine trillion dollars z 9 000 in the new currency about us 60 on the first day of my secret treasure hunt and half of that the following day but the gold mine is drying up now
4150920 and that makes me the envy of many people who put on a jacket and tie six days a week and yet get peanuts from their employers
4150921 i have been struggling to put money on the table for years but in the past four days the sun has been shining brightly through my window thanks to the return of the coins
4150922 i can now give my children money to spend at school and i have even managed to pay up the top fees that the school was demanding
4150923 my employers throw these coins everywhere and when they are away at work i look in every hidden corner even madams underwear closets for them they dont know it but i have managed to gather about three times the salary they give me a month in a short space of time
4150924 sometimes we fight over the coins that we find in the streets but that the fights is a lot of fun in these hard times
4150925 we have to make as much hay as possible while the sun shines
4150926 the coins are bringing back temporary joy in two weeks or so they will be despised because they would have been rendered useless by the hyperinflationary environment we are operating under
4150927 no amount of tinkering with currency denominations will address the zimbabwean crisis
4150928 allowing people to scrounge for old money from their drawers will make it impossible to know how much currency is on the market
4150929 could further push up inflation which has now hit stratospheric levels
4150930 we are just dotting the is and crossing the ts we should be forming a government in which we will be sharing power within the next few days
4150931 we have agreed to adopt a system which is almost similar to the french model in which both the president and the prime minister wield a lot of power
4150932 generally we have been agreed on many issues and that is why we have almost completed the talks in a short time everybody involved in the talks acknowledges that the people have suffered for too long as a result of the political and economic hardships caused by the political stalemate
4150933 the talks have gained so much momentum that it would almost be impossible to abort them
4150934 all parties have increased the number of negotiators and technical committees while support staff have been flown in to south africa to prepare for the signing ceremony expected by saturday as zanu pf we have started inviting guests who should attend the ceremony where the power sharing deal will be signed
4150935 the mdc responded by saying home affairs which controls the police and justice were non negotiable as they wanted to safeguard themselves from possible unfair treatment before the justice delivery system
4150936 that is why very few people are surprised by reports that the homicide section of the countrys largest police station in harare was bombed over the weekend
4150937 the mdc felt zanu pf needed to clean up the mess that it had created by running down the economy local government was preferable as the mdc now controls most of the local authorities and it would give them influence to consolidate its presence countrywide
4150938 we humbly suggest that the outcome of the ongoing talks should lead to the setting up of a transitional authority headed by nonpartisan technocrats mandated to come up with a people driven constitution as well as create an environment conducive to the holding of truly free and fair elections within a period of not more than two years
4150939 we reiterate our calls for the establishment of a transitional authority with a specific mandate of taking zimbabwe to a lasting democracy as opposed to a power sharing gnu
4150940 a gnu is a stopgap measure which gives the ruling zanu pf party breathing space before reverting back to its war path on the opposition supporters and the broader pro democracy movement

4150942 lets make no mistake about this a deal that does not involve opposition leader morgan tsvangirai the man who won the free and fair election in march is null and void and it seems the old man president robert mugabe is just not ready to hand over power to those that have legitimacy
4150943 we are moving in circles and that makes me sick very frustrated
4150944 there has been a disagreement with one element of the talks which has to do with an agreement with power sharing morgan tsvangirai asked for time out in order to reflect on this matter so that we reconvene them later
4150945 just like in the run off where mugabe contested alone this empty deal is in all essence a zanu pf agreement
4150946 mutambara did not run in the presidential elections and is just too happy to have some relevance in zimbabwean politics
4150947 all my hopes of returning to a normal life in the near future have been dashed by mugabes unwillingness to relinquish power
4150948 prices keep going up as our pockets shrivel there is no electricity no water and unemployment will rise even further as industries close all because of an obsession with power an obsession that benefits a few people at the expense of the majority
4150949 many in formal employment thought that an internationally accepted deal would bring back the spark to their jobs but there seems to be no light at the end of the tunnel
4150950 i am convinced that mugabe is living in perpetual fear and the brave face that we see on television masks a man who is in a deep quandary
4150951 even if he mugabe wanted to give tsvangirai some executive powers there are many powerful people within his party who would lose out and these people seem to be pressuring him to deny the mdc leader what rightfully belongs to him and to the people
4150952 after parliamentary elections the opposition won more seats than zanu pf and that was good since it reversed the then ruling partys ability to make decisions based on its majority in parliament
4150953 however with the stance taken by mutambara the opposition is now divided there are some in the opposition who would grab any chance to be in positions of power and i am afraid that mugabe might announce a cabinet that includes members from tsvangirais party a development that could further weaken his party if some of those members decide to accept what is offered
4150954 since january everyone has been talking about elections and nothing has been moving we have gone for too long without a parliament
4150955 and who is tsvangirai to think that he can hold us to ransom after all he is nothing but the mouthpiece of britain and the united states and is responsible for all the suffering we are experiencing today
4150956 legitimate leader of zimbabwe because he won the 27 june run off and led the war against imperialism while he spends sleepless nights trying to find ways of totally empowering the people of this country
4150957 the political leaders acknowledge that none of them on their own with their political parties have the capacity to solve these problems and so they have to work together
4150958 tsvangirai was not happy that he would have presided over a few social and economic ministries while mugabe retained executive powers as executive president while security ministries would have fallen directly under the control of mugabe
4150959 no the talks have not collapsed they can never collapse as long as we have tongues for talking
4150960 i have over the last two years acquired a fleet of 12 cars and several houses in mutare and in the capital harare
4150961 when the diamond rush began very few people believed the stones were precious in fact a company which had been doing some explorations here even went as far as to say the stones were worthless industrial diamonds
4150962 we had nothing to lose because we had little to occupy our time as street dwellers we collected as many stones as possible and when buyers started flooding in we realised we had made a lot of money
4150963 the whole area is like a militarised zone which can only be accessed by the powerful there are checkpoints leading into and out of marange complete with sniffer dogs
4150964 one of the vice presidents has a big diamond field which is guarded by the military during the presidential campaigns president robert mugabe visited a diamond field together with the first lady grace mugabe we dont know the reason behind the visit but one of the most heavily guarded fields is said to belong to the first family
4150965 unfortunately our clients are not the traditional tourists they are diamond traders who usually hire the services of local prostitutes and many actually pay using the scarce us dollar
4150966 there has been an upsurge in crime and corruption following the discovery of diamonds our cells in the city are full and we are now holding some of the suspects in police cells outside mutare it is either that the suspect stole somebody elses diamonds or sold another person fake diamonds
4150967 most of them are here to pay bail money for friends relatives or spouses engaged in diamond trade
4150968 cases of children dropping out of school are higher in marange where the diamond fields are found
4150969 the explanation from the children and their parents is that they see no need to pursue education when diamond panning can provide instant riches
4150970 after seeing the change in lifestyles of other people in the city
4150971 transactions in most commodities and services such as medical consultations rentals even purchasing firewood are now done in foreign currency even commercial sex workers now demand payment in foreign currency
4150972 i resigned from the civil service just over three years ago and used to ply the border route when it was less lucrative when the diamonds were discovered business improved and i have increased the number of my taxis to four
4150973 there are no conditions obviously what is missing is that the waiver is void if there is another atomic test

4150981 women tempt us they come here in their short skirts and tight jeans and ask us if we want to have a good time
4150982 naturally as men at times it is tough to say no i use protection whenever i have sex with a woman
4150983 at times i can settle for r100 us 13 for the night it is better than nothing there are more women here
4150984 the situation in zimbabwe has seen more women trying to make quick money by offering their services to us in south africa they just want money that will enable them to take care of their families back home
4150985 the women in south africa are expensive but across the border in zimbabwe you can have a great time for a few bars of soap and goods like salt and sugar
4150986 the hiv vulnerability of young women including schoolgirls and young vendors who seek an income from commercial or casual sex with truckers and other groups of older men with income is distressingly high
4150987 dont worry mkoma brother i will look after your car your small boy is here
4150988 i do not charge a fixed amount some give me r5 us 0 65 per car some give me food and some just drive away
4150989 i make more money in south africa especially when i carry the 20 litres of fuel i am paid r10 us 1 30 the zimbabweans across the border pay in zimbabwe dollars which cannot buy anything
4150990 some of the children come in from zimbabwe in the morning and return in the evening they go through the border and no one seems to do anything to stop them from crossing
4150991 i am worried about the little girls who enter the parking lot for the trucks one wonders what happens in the dark the girls can be raped
4150992 we actually sleep next to the police houses at night we are safer there
4150993 sylphet from btl after taking on another boss that undoubtedly caused maternity officials to collapse laughing at their naming pandemonium warden says the developer should think real hard about their final fantasy xi pre game warning that states we have no desire to see your real life suffer as a consequence
4150994 i was a fool to fall into the trap the shameless husband used his wife as bait to extort the livestock from me and even though i hardly knew the woman many people now think i had a love affair with her
4150995 in the past i used to bring at most one case of infidelity a year to my headmans court but i am now dealing with several such trials a month it is difficult to tell between a genuine case and a staged one because in all cases the women are found in compromising positions by their husbands or the husbands relatives
4150996 to use bizarre ways to get any form of foodstuffs or money
4150997 in this part of the province we hardly harvested anything since the rains were erratic there was no fertiliser and humanitarian aid is not forthcoming those who can manage a full meal of sadza thick maize meal porridge and boiled vegetables a day are considered lucky
4150998 true my family is poor and there are times when we went without food
4150999 but i was still going to school and for my parents to sell me off like a commodity is unfair to me because they used an old fashioned practice to solve the problem that we were facing while i will be confined to a home that i dont enjoy
4151000 most of the time when i am alone in bed i seriously consider following my sister who refused to be imprisoned
4151001 even when the men insist that they used a condom no one listens to them and again that is not fair because young girls unwillingly lose their virginity and expose themselves to sexually transmitted diseases
4151002 sheer desperation and the widening poverty cycle set off by the current economic meltdown
4151003 the crop that i planted was severely damaged after war veterans ordered my workers off the land as they campaigned for president robert mugabe in the june presidential elections and the little that survived is still facing many challenges which include persistent power cuts and shortages of fertiliser
4151004 power cuts are becoming frequent and as a result the load shedding schedule that the zimbabwe electricity supply authority zesa had availed is not being followed on most days we get electricity during the night and it is impossible to do any meaningful irrigation at that time
4151005 most of the wheat and maize i planted has died off and i will realise far less than what i was supposed to get if electricity was supplied continuously
4151006 close to half of the wheat i planted is damaged and the one field i am tending now is of poor quality due to the water shortage and i have cancelled any future plans of growing any winter crop
4151007 if i had not got any interruptions on the farm i would have put over 100 hectares under irrigation but the countrys politics is affecting current production
4151008 this is my first winter wheat crop but most of it has been destroyed because i have not been able to draw enough water to irrigate the crop and the power outages have been very frequent of late the harvest i will get will be far below my expectations
4151009 the crop was damaged at an early stage as we used to have power for about three days a week but now electricity supplies are being cut almost daily and this is disturbing irrigation cycles most of the wheat is now facing problems
4151010 the projected wheat winter crop is not good but we have learnt a lesson and already we are now preparing for the summer crop
4151011 we are making sure that seed companies are getting seed and fertiliser ready for the season and already we have imported 30 000 tonnes of seed for the 2008 09 season the country needs 50 000 tonnes of seed for planting two million hectares of maize and the rest will be supplied by local manufacturers
4151012 zimbabwe requires 400 000 tonnes of wheat per annum but this year we will hardly get 80 000 tonnes and the reasons are several power shortages and a serious shortage of compound d fertiliser which was nowhere to be seen in the country and as a result many farmers reduced the amount of land they planted
4151013 we will get the smallest crop of wheat that has been produced in this country this year and the only solution to the current farming crisis is to have a political settlement that will address the current problems anything else is just a stopgap measure
4151014 the hopes are that the humanitarian restrictions will be lifted but i fear that they will not be lifted in full and we are worried about that
4151015 the parties agree that in the interim they will work together to ensure the safety of any displaced persons and their safe return home and that humanitarian and social welfare organisations are enabled to render such assistance as might be required
4151016 the crop assessment mission estimates that 2 04 million people in rural and urban areas will be food insecure between july and september 2008 rising to 3 8 million people between october and december and peaking to about 5 1 million at the height of the hungry season between january and march 2009
4151017 a lot of our members say they have placed their staff on leave until the situation becomes much clearer
4151018 the problem with the lifting of that ban is that it was not effectively communicated to the local structures especially in rural areas where the security of field workers can no longer be guaranteed
4151019 our appeal now is that the government should allow the united nations to conduct a fresh audit of the humanitarian situation in the country to assess the impact that the election related political violence has had on the people
4151020 activities conducted by ngos are designed to be sustainable like empowering communities to improve their livelihoods by producing their own food and not the welfarist distribution of food which is just a stop gap measure
4151021 structural integration is primarily concerned with physical changes in the body it affects the whole person we are made up of emotions attitudes belief systems and behavior patterns as well as the physical being all are related align the physical structure and it will open up the individuals potential clients often report positive changes stating less stress greater self confidence and improved ability to handle lifes changes
4151022 the six month moratorium is suggested here as the most credible foundation and seed for the retransformation of market trends and micro level pricing behaviour into stable and predictable modes
4151023 we have the power to invoke further measures but we do not want to use the emergency rules emergency measures can be taken but we do not want that yet we can do that to deter unjustified price increases
4151024 our only problem is that the maximum withdrawals have been increased to z 2 trillion us 200 per customer per day and as a result we have run out of cash the reserve bank has not given us any additional supplies of money
4151025 what monetary policy that was a political statement that was made the nonsense about zimbabwe being under sanctions was not monetary there were a few currency changes but that is where it ends freezing wages is not going to end hyperinflation
4151026 the main causer of hyperinflation is gideon gono who is printing money which is being used for handouts and is being given to political thugs to beat up people
4151027 we are looking at a situation whereby the us dollarisation of the economy is going to increase because our own money would have become worthless
4151028 can no longer be our partner it would be better if he went
4151029 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace

4151094 reclaiming public spaces as a space for public imagination and enlightenment where they have become propagandistic barriers to thought and awareness
4151095 home prices in the u s are likely to start to stabilize or touch bottom sometime in the first half of 2009
4151096 now mayor daley with his green initiatives would never allow streets and sanitation to let actual blood drip down michigan avenue but its not looking pretty
4151097 reclaiming public spaces as a space for public imagination and enlightenment where they have become propagandistic barriers to thought and awareness
4151098 its a very seminal period an opportunity to both celebrate 20 years of content and the fact that the source was a leader in chronicling the culture of hip hop
4151099 im on a mission to restore it to the community that gave birth to it and open the door to those that currently enjoy and influence that hip hop culture
4151100 its exciting because we believe that we can do it
4151101 we shared with him what we were trying to do the vision of hip hop and where we thought it needed to go and he thought it was refreshing and clever
4151102 were just going to expand on what the source has always done well
4151103 a core focus but not 80 percent of the book
4151104 i think that what were trying to do is evolve it as hip hop has evolved and become an international force to evolve it without losing its core essence that was the centerpiece of its earliest beginnings and greatness but it has to evolve just like hip hop has to evolve
4151105 it is a force nobody can deny the force or the power of the source but is it the same as it was five years ago no
4151106 it does not deliver with the same punch that it used to
4151107 if they are true to the dna of the publication
4151108 it left off so much of what is the key ingredients of hip hop and lifestyle now which is lifestyle fashion online new media international aspects of how people embrace content
4151109 if anything we want to restore it restore it to greatness and its no 1 spot
4151110 its his poll ive spent a lot of time in living rooms at train stations and in parades and im getting great response across the district he roskam has high name recognition hes been a politician most of his adult life the polls will go up and down
4151111 its not an open seat like it was two years ago
4151112 the republican national party deemed that duckworth would not take this karl rove and dick cheney came out for roskam i hope obama will visit the district for me
4151113 the difference between her and morgenthaler is that the out of district candidate is having trouble raising money shes not sparked much interest in grass roots she has not raised much money from labor unions or from congressmen shes woefully underperforming in fundraising you need to communicate with voters and that takes money
4151114 drastically rising prices at the pump and skyrocketing costs of home heating oil and gas are hurting minnesota families
4151115 our dependence on foreign oil is a national security issue and our nation needs innovative solutions to solve this crisis
4151116 his record as a state legislator is the exact opposite of what he is saying now
4151117 in st paul paulsen has consistently sided with big oil to oppose tough measures to fight global warming and promote energy self sufficiency
4151118 erik paulsen is in the hip pocket of special interests including big oil and energy companies
4151119 paulsen has already accepted pac contributions from exxon mobil and the petroleum marketers association of america as part of the 13 5 million big oil has given republicans this election
4151120 i was there and it was about finding solutions to problems and bringing parties together
4151121 i personally think that congress ought to be in session today and not on vacation
4151122 we are experiencing our own las vegas recession because of the lack of a comprehensive energy plan
4151123 ought to be calling on nancy pelosi to bring congress back into session because as we drive down the street to this great college there are businesses with for sale signs on them there are casinos and the resort industry laying off people there is no more important issue than energy right now which affects our economy and jobs
4151124 i was able to vote for myself because i live in the district
4151125 theres a huge difference im not sure who she voted for because she doesnt live in the district
4151126 she believes we need to have solutions not gimmicks that involves working in a bipartisan manner to come up with a comprehensive plan the republicans had the house the senate and the presidency for six years and came up with no real energy policy
4151127 dina titus might be a block outside of the district since jon porter and his republican friends redrew the map at taxpayer expense during a special session but the price of gas is the same on either side of the district line
4151128 hes doing the right things working for the people hes ours
4151129 if the democrats were to win this election i think it would be really bad for this country they want to raise taxes increase the size of government and other near socialist programs
4151130 you kind of either just look around and laugh or just like enjoy it
4151131 were in awe its a whirlwind and were happy to be on the ride
4151132 for us having this album finally hit stores and having them sing the songs knowing that they can actually hear them and have it in their possession is the most amazing thing for us were so excited
4151133 they really in the last year kicked into high gear with coming to the shows following the music and continuing to talk about it online
4151134 the online thing has been really big for us the youtube videos the myspace all of that but for us all of them outside make it all possible
4151135 weve been here since monday afternoon at twelve so weve been camping out all night and it was so cold when it hit 3 a m
4151136 we just kept on hanging on cause we love the jonas brothers so much well do anything for them
4151137 maybe one day id write a song and somebody would sing it and then no one would really know that i wrote it
4151138 it would be kind of exciting and i had heard that prince did that and it was just kind of a goal for me
4151139 but we do know for very accomplished very practiced individuals that high pressure situations are a very bad time for them to start thinking about their actions
4151140 the balance beam is a ridiculously hard activity i dont even know if i could walk on one but the big question for these athletes is why do they slip on actions they have performed flawlessly thousands of times in the past
4151141 the very best athletes put themselves in a bubble just focus on the moment and let their bodies do what theyve trained to do without letting their minds get in the way
4151142 at the very top level thats the difference between the winners and the also rans
4151143 i know from talking to gymnasts that nothing compares to the olympics
4151144 everybodys human sometimes things happen in sports that we cant explain thats what makes them interesting

4151146 free software is a matter of liberty not price to understand the concept you should think of free as in

4151167 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4151168 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent

4151173 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
4151174 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
4151175 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
4151176 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
4151177 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
4151178 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
4151179 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
4151180 we are actually reviewing iphones from a hsbc group perspective and when i say that i mean globally
4151181 a decision on a piece of hardware like that would potentially be deployed conservatively to 200 000 people
4151182 you know its a big decision especially when you have an existing fleet out there
4151183 but its definitely something we are considering from a hsbc group perspective
4151184 we always explore the potential application of new technologies and this is no different
4151185 no i dont i think the iphone would change some underlying infrastructure considerations from an enterprise perspective but apple have been pretty smart with the design

4151195 why do people buy isp services from them when there are others out there that do provide a good service
4151196 sure when the service becomes erratic its often down to a bt line issue but you can do what you want and often for less money than bt charges if you use bt and complain about it what are you showing other than poor judgement

4151680 in an action alleging physical and sexual assault in violation of plaintiffs civil and constitutional rights decision dismissing sua sponte plaintiffs pro se complaint for failure to file an amended complaint in her actual name rather than a pseudonym is vacated and remanded where the district court erred when it 1 denied plaintiffs request to litigate this action under a pseudonym without first balancing plaintiffs interest in anonymity against the public interest in disclosure and prejudice to defendants and 2 subjected plaintiffs pleadings to a standard far stricter than that applicable to pro se litigants

4151685 girls of the o back to the topic i 301 every page somewhere never return 404 i think i like olive garden
4151686 you have to wonder when they look at what they consider a loophole with such excitement
4151687 that would suggest manipulating the process and i think opens the door to suspicion
4151688 its a massive fight and it will be my last
4151689 ive known for a while when i want to go out and as long as i put on a great performance this is my time
4151690 if i can do that then ive achieved everything ive wanted to achieve in my career i would never forgive myself if i came to my last fight and threw it all away complacency is not in my mindset
4151691 but i know in my heart this is the right time to stop and my aim is to remain undefeated i want to win and win in style
4151692 they said the crowd was too big and that it was too dangerous
4151693 i was surprised and people were not happy but the police began dispersing everyone who had gathered and they gradually started to leave
4151694 it is exciting for the whole life of every chinese citizen
4151695 all the preparation has been about security crowds accumulate really quickly in china and before you know it youve got 10 000 people in one space they know how to disperse crowds but i dont think they know how to gather them for a festive occasion

4151709 you can serve your time and still have your rights taken away
4151710 i studied the history of black disenfranchisement in the state we had the grandfather laws and the tissue paper ballots when a black man came to vote they gave him a tissue paper ballot that was later thrown out there were lynchings and riots weve got a long history of depriving people of the right to vote in florida
4151711 such laws are constitutionally suspect if someone has fulfilled their legal obligations in prison why are they still being punished after release why do former felons lose the right to act politically in their own self interest once they are supposedly free what exactly is constitutional about depriving american citizens of one of their most basic civil rights how does disenfranchising the formerly incarcerated encourage them to be productive members of society most ridiculous is the presumption that such laws are tough on crime how does preventing ex felons from voting prevent crimes from being committed
4151712 the three tiers of review that were established by the april 2007 rule changes which can be cumbersome and costly could be collapsed into one resembling the approach taken under former gov reubin askew simply to verify completion of sentence

4151726 we will vigorously defend ourselves against this complaint as we believe that we worked in the best interests of our investor and issuer clients this complaint attempts to link a single client interaction with overall market conditions which affected all student loan issuers and as such we believe there is no basis for these specific allegations

4151729 the 3g iphone has been out for a month but signs of problems are appearing that should give competitors some breathing space
4151730 problems include high incidence of dropped calls switching onto edge while the device is stationary and loss of reception while in good coverage we believe that these issues are typical of an immature chipset and radio protocol stack where we are almost certain infineon is the 3g supplier

4151755 the company involved in the super exciting haynesville shale region which could be one of the largest domestic on shore natural gas fields ever
4151756 the stock has been coming on lately as more investors learn about the companys potential in the haynesville shale region
4151757 discovered in march of this year the haynesville field according to energy and capital could conservatively hold 168 trillion cubic feet of natural gas
4151758 there was always a notion that a big find was in the space that the company currently owns 2 700 acres but when it was first explored back in the 1950 crude oil prices were much lower and there was no technology to get to the natural gas
4151759 most folks dont realize that there is a gold rush in domestic resources going on right now in part to new technologies to find and drill for crude oil and natural gas this has created a fantastic problem of no rigs and too few pipelines
4151760 this makes the deal with petrohawk so special another element to the arrangement is the fact that petrohawk will pay all expenses associated with drilling the first well the financial arrangement will be 60 40 with mainland getting the latter
4151761 that is a very favorable ratio for a junior resource company and it means they may not have to go to the public for additional funding that would dilute present shareholders there are some analysts that think this is a 9 00 stock but i think it could be a 13 00 stock by the end of this year
4151762 i interviewed the ceo of petrohawk in june when i anchored cavuto on the fox business network and natural gas is going to play a prominent role in our energy use for decades to come
4151763 in fact i spent time with t boone pickens last month in wyoming and his plan is more about natural gas to run our cars than wind mills to power our electric grid i also spoke with the ceo of mainland and his optimism is clear
4151764 of course this is a small cap play and cash flow may not begin until late in the year so there are greater than average risks
4151765 that may explain why the shorts have been on the attack right now im told there is a 20 million share naked short position that is a significant amount of folks that may have to cover in a hurry
4151766 technically the stock has room to 8 00 and through there i think that the shorts will begin to cover and the stock should rally to 10 00 fairly quickly our long term price target is 13 00

4151791 the government also decided to scrap the tax rebate on a slew of energy intensive highly polluting products or resource products such as pesticides zinc and silver the government reduced the rebate rates of the value added tax for more than 2 800 items of products last year including hundreds of textiles and garments the move then helped to slow the nations ballooning export growth
4151792 ive got a theory about the motivations well i dont know that i could i dont know that i can put this one on the air
4151793 we know weve been told that elizabeth edwards is smarter than john edwards thats part of the puff pieces on them that weve seen ergo if elizabeth edwards is smarter than john edwards is it likely that she thinks she knows better than he does what his speeches ought to contain and what kind of things he ought to be doing strategy wise in the campaign if she is smarter than he is could it have been her decision to keep going with the campaign in other words could it be that she doesnt shut up now thats as far as im going to go
4151794 it just seems to me that edwards might be attracted to a woman whose mouth did something other than talk
4151795 my theory that i just explained to you about why you know what could have john edwards motivations been to have the affair with rielle hunter given his wife is smarter than he is and probably nagging him a lot about doing this and he found somebody that did something with her mouth other than talk

4151819 consumers demand a product from a clean factory where employees are paid well while simultaneously demanding a cheap price that leaves me between a rock and a hard place

4151823 but moving to vietnam means working in a country that is the size of one chinese province that hasnt much skilled labor and is about 15 years behind china in terms of infrastructure
4151824 u s companies that go west will do it for the governments tax subsidy and the belief that secondary and tertiary cities have less turnover and more competitive wages
4151825 china is the largest growing major economy in the world with well over a billion in population and a growing middle class
4151826 even as costs rise chinas improving efficiencies in supply chains and its growing domestic market are creating new opportunities and generating new client relationships for foreign investors
4151827 china is a legitimate market in itself and i know many other businesses that are manufacturing for the china market and not to export
4151828 business owners have to look at total costs including lead times and gas prices they may find that although china isnt cheap anymore there are hidden costs with moving
4151829 china is known in the u s for having poor quality items but the country is ready to move on to innovation

4151831 the problem with running a campaign thats based on cult of personality is that cracks in the grandiose facade of obamas life become very damaging
4151832 thats where you can get a readers attention and have substantial impact
4151833 is nothing but a series of lies that were long ago discredited
4151834 the reality is there are many lie filled books like this in the works cobbled together from the internet to make money off a presidential campaign
4151835 the book is going to change a lot of opinions
4151836 its a different version of the man than hes been presenting
4151837 this is an attempt to perpetuate those politics for four more years
4151838 one of the reasons i wrote this book is to keep obama from getting elected
4151839 as it became clear that he was going to win the democratic nomination for president it seemed irresponsible to stand by as so many were offering admiration piety even worship to of all things a politician because the idea of barack obama as a reformer is a great lie
4151840 one thing weve learned so far with biographies in the 21st century is that every book is going to be one persons take

4151847 redemption the myth of pet overpopulation and the no kill revolution in america
4151848 weve evaluated several existing ordinances in texas to come up with one that would be appropriate for victoria
4151849 the primary purpose for coming up with a palatable and well written ordinance is ultimately to come up with a no kill city shelter
4151850 instead of spending a lot of time putting animals to sleep it is incredible to me how many animals are put to sleep here
4151851 this is a very solid group of people and they have other interests too
4151852 so were not just pet lovers morally we just think its the right thing to do
4151853 we hope to get a no kill policy it will take a few years to get there but it can get there its happening in other parts of the country successfully

4151859 everyone has got a particular relationship with krishna in his original constitutional position
4151860 established means re establish it is already established we have got different types of relationship that is called
4151861 similarly we have got an eternal relationship with krishna when you will be perfect in love in loving krishna then in what status of life you will love that you will under that will be revealed that is called
4151862 you have got original relationship with krishna nitya siddha krishna bhakti srimad bhagavatam lecture december 7 1974
4151863 our separation from krishna we dream this body and so many relationships with other things first the attachment comes to enjoy sense gratification even with krishna desire for sense gratification is there there is a dormant attitude for forgetting krishna and creating an atmosphere for enjoying independently just like at the edge of the beach sometimes the water covers sometimes there is dry sand coming and going our position is like that sometimes covered sometimes free just like at the edge of the tide as soon as we forget immediately the illusion is there just like as soon as we sleep dream is there
4151864 we cannot say therefore that we are not with krishna
4151865 actually no one falls down from vaikuntha they only think they are fallen or dream they are fallen but in perpetual reality one can never fall down
4151866 we are eternally conditioned but as soon as we surrender to krishna do we then become eternally liberated

4151890 i know our show isnt exactly frontline but we definitely tried to weed as much comedy into the situation as possible because these men and women let me know very quickly that when youre dealing with these kinds of injuries you just gotta laugh

4151917 we recognize that in america this is going after somebody who is more comfortable with technology
4151918 the truth is that in other countries its becoming a part of their culture the trend is coming and as a fashion company its very important to identify trends and get ahead of them
4151919 this is about someone whos interested in our brand and interested in technology and wherever the two meet thats whats appropriate
4151920 in the preceding days he worked his regularly scheduled shifts without incident
4151921 he said he was interested in volunteering but that was obviously a lie
4151922 they introduced themselves and at that time he pulled out a handgun and shot chairman gwatney several times
4151923 not only a strong chairman of arkansas democratic party but also a cherished friend and confidante
4151924 michelle and i are heartbroken to hear about the tragic loss of chairman bill gwatney were praying for his family and friends and all who worked with him and loved him
4151925 it makes you wonder what got into somebody to do something so horrible
4151926 bill gwatney was our friend our partys leader and so many times our partys conscience
4151927 our state and our party are better for all that bill gwatney has done
4151928 arkansas has lost a great son and i have lost a great friend
4151929 there is deep pain in arkansas tonight because of the sheer number of people who knew respected and loved bill gwatney
4151930 he was an admirable arkansan and gave so much to this state and his party
4151931 profoundly saddened by the senseless loss of chairman bill gwatney
4151932 bud doggetts many friends will remember him as a wise counselor to a long line of board of trade leaders as a trusted mentor to many in the business community and as a passionate advocate for the city he loved
4151933 through his more than 50 years of service to the greater washington board of trade he secured jobs for youth and the communitys disadvantaged population helped develop what is now the k street corridor and was instrumental in steering the board of trades endorsement of walter washington d c s first mayor
4151934 he was president of the board of trade in 1967 when race relations were a critical issue in the city
4151935 bud was prolific in his charitable efforts and his spirit of community service was unmatched
4151936 the board of trade and all of buds friends across our region will miss him greatly
4151937 there is no reason why fares should go up as a result of this for the consumer it means they will have access to a much bigger network we will coordinate our schedules to make it easier to connect between airlines and you will have greater access to cheaper fares
4151938 there will be nothing to stop the customer from taking a fare with aa outbound and taking a fare with ba on the inbound leg
4151939 it is anti competitive it will force up fares and it will mean that passengers get a worse service because if you get rid of competitors by combining ba with aa you have got no one snapping at your heels to make you improve your product
4151940 this is an open market and that is the big difference between now and 2001 anybody can come in and compete
4151941 we have to get away from fossil fuels and dependence on oil and natural gas
4151942 its the season for traveling and last year the hotel was full the olympics should have brought business to beijing but the reality is too far from the expectation
4151943 thats where nursing staff took these babies and left them to die
4151944 christ hospital and we now know other hospitals and clinics around the country are involved in an abortion procedure called induced labor abortion
4151945 my experience was that they the babies survive as short as a few minutes to once almost as long as an eight hour shift
4151946 to be clear these were living babies who were left out to die and they were issued both birth and death certificates according to illinois state law
4151947 when she told me what she was doing i couldnt bear the thought of this suffering child dying alone
4151948 and so i cradled and rocked him for the forty five minutes that he lived
4151949 was unmoved and actually opposed the born alive infant protection act
4151950 thought that infanticide was acceptable and voted to protect it some people said that barack obama was uninformed or may not have fully understood the implications of this bill but he voted against it three times thats calculated
4151951 as chairman of the health and human services committee in 2003 he stopped the identical wording from being introduced
4151952 barack obama can play word games but at the end of the day his opposition was responsible for living babies being left out to die and that is indefensible
4151953 comes as close to infanticide as anything i have seen in our judiciary
4151954 of course we believe everyone should deserve the protection of this bill who could be more vulnerable than a newborn baby so of course we agree with that we join with an aye vote on this i hope it will in fact be unanimous
4151955 in which he voted for any regulation or restriction on the practice of abortion
4151956 the moment i stepped into the camps here in lebanon i thought i was in palestine
4151957 i hope people living in beirut come to see the film
4151958 a window into palestine maybe feel a little more connected to the palestinian hip hop scene there
4151959 this film is about a loss of identity as much as anything else
4151960 hip hop is a way of telling their stories as they reclaim that history
4151961 if their parents arent teaching them theyre simply brought up as israeli arabs and not palestinians
4151962 lets talk about what it means to be palestinians living in the state of israel
4151963 you saw in the film how that one kid called himself an arab and not a palestinian this is what my palestinian friends are taught in israeli schools
4151964 dam has affected the youth in their hometown especially because they are active in the schools and it doesnt hurt that their music has gotten really popular kids are listening and wanting to read more books by palestinian writers and know more about their cousins in the west bank and gaza they want to be like dam
4151965 the film inspires me to want to break down the social barriers that exist for palestinians living in the refugee camps here
4151966 our music is as much for palestinians there as it is for the lebanese here
4151967 there is a very real geographic separation within the palestinian hip hop movement
4151968 these groups are all restricted physically by the israeli government and the film shows how they use their music to channel their frustrations and connect with their peers
4151969 they cant travel to see each other so they trade beats and vocal tracks over the internet right now all the groups are reaching out to other arab rappers throughout the world the us based crews the philistines and the nomads the iraqi hip hop crew from canada euphrates and they are also working on collaborations with several african and latin america based hip hop crews
4151970 were working with dam and another group from the west bank ramallah underground my partner tnt and i are laying down our vocals and we should have something finished soon
4151971 one day i hope we can perform together but it will probably be in europe before its either here or in palestine

4151974 his claims have been a staple of old media reports from the beginning but now that stanek has revealed the truth we will have to see if the old media corrects the record or if they suddenly just go mum on the subject like they have so far
4151975 so we are forced to realize that obama knows the truth but is trying to rewrite history and with the willing accomplices in the old media he has succeeded in doing so thus far
4151976 now this story is no matter of mere opinion there is no possibility that obama just has a different opinion on a controversial national issue than we do
4151977 what we have here is obama simply telling a lie and knowingly doing so will the old media continue to cover up for him like they have done for the last four years
4151978 obama cover up revealed on born alive abortion survivors bill
4151979 the catholic league has been getting many phone calls and e mails regarding sen obamas support for infanticide to read more about how while in the illinois state senate obama led the fight to deny medical care to infants born alive as a result of botched abortions and let them die unaided in hospital rooms check out the links below
4151980 we consider this video though it names no one to be a photographic list of an anti semitic nature and therefore liable to criminal prosecution
4151981 theres a sense today that college students are very busy with their schedules and their lives and in order for them to take time out they need to be incentivized
4151982 if you believe that judaism is a viable religion for many different reasons and youre able to show it in a way thats truly meaningful thats truly exciting
4151983 and i dont think you need to pay people to do that
4151984 we simply want to try to introduce young jews who havent had the opportunity to learn about judaism
4151985 they go to university and might be well versed about science mathematics and literature but their jewish education may be very fragile
4151986 aishcafe was kind of the beginning of wanting to know more about judaism and really identify with my judaic roots
4151987 to me it was an avenue for religious growth that was something i wanted to do for a while and this was an opportunity to do it
4151988 i really felt i had something i could relate to
4151989 for me and for a lot of people theres a sense that religion can be backwards but this shows it in another light
4151990 no era uno de los objetivos de mi carrera y no hab a pensado en ello trato de mirar m s lejos y acertar esta proposici n podr a ser un paso hacia atr s

4151995 for the years 2003 2004 and 2005 the todd market forecast was rated 1 for the preceding ten years by for the year 2006 we slipped to 3 and in 2007 we were ranked 5
4151996 over the course of the two weeks we were in india we saw the best and worst of humanity
4151997 padma as you can imagine is in shock at the same time she has really stepped up to provide the strength and nurturing her little brothers need she is a special special person
4151998 we are not even at the point of discussing padmas return to the stage
4151999 im very confident she will return to music soon because its her release and i really feel its what her father would want her to do
4152000 music is escapism pure and simple right now one of us is facing an unimaginable tragedy and everyone is responding accordingly

4152030 si parte de la imaginer a en mi obra es algo tremebunda se debe a que soy una persona fundamentalmente miedosa y pesimista siempre percibo esa ndole voraz del universo que puede da arte o aplastarte de un plumazo por mucho que midas tus pasos

4152036 the real negotiations with iran are carried out by the west turkey only plays a minor role but it is an important one i think there is not any risk of turkey overplaying its cards it is just a mediating role nothing more
4152037 the state department with rice does not want a military conflict with iran and would like to see turkey act as a facilitator to find a solution to the crisis over the nuclear program of iran
4152038 i think turkey is important for europe and the united states also because of the fact that turkey is very important in projecting peace stability and even democracy in the middle east i think the parties in europe who are most in favour of eventual turkish accession to the eu consider this fact that turkey play such an important role in the middle east

4152047 its a challenging time to introduce an all new light duty pickup but dodge never backs down from a challenge
4152048 with more standard features and a lower msrp than 2008 models the all new 2009 dodge ram gives consumers thousands of dollars more in value our all new 2009 dodge ram has it all head turning design class leading interior amenities capability for every need customer convenience features inside and out built in craftsmanship and safety for every occupant all at a great value and with our new crew size cab model were now competing in the fastest growing and highest volume part of the light duty pickup segment

4152051 very agitated and shaking and they feared for their safety
4152052 they introduced themselves and at that time he johnson pulled out a handgun and shot chairman gwatney several times he then turned and left the business
4152053 we are deeply saddened by the news that bill gwatney has passed away
4152054 should not have happened and that you dont want to happen again
4152055 i think everybody has had an occasion where their physician did a test and they just didnt hear back
4152056 theres a fair amount of risk and harm that results from testing mistakes and slips
4152057 i get 50 to 60 new documents labs x rays consults hospital notes every day
4152058 some will get sent to the wrong doctor and some results never get sent at all despite our best efforts to develop a system that will close this loop there are some documents i just don t get
4152059 people forget that there are hundreds of other patients with thousands of test results the office is dealing with dr
4152060 we do what we can to tell patients test results and with our computerized records we do a better job than most and i see that as our responsibility
4152061 in the days and weeks ahead the department of defense will re examine the entire gamut of our military to military relationship with russia and will make changes as necessary and appropriate depending on russian forces
4152062 that certainly is not our desire i think frankly we have been pretty restrained in this and i would say beginning with my remarks at the vercunda conference a year ago february where now prime minister putins speech was regarded by virtually everyone there as very aggressive we have tried not to respond in that manner i think what happens in the days and months to come will determine the future course of u s russian relations
4152063 i would consider that to be bluster from the foreign minister of russia
4152064 anymore is an interesting add i have never been one to believe that you form national security policy on the basis of trust

4152073 what the hell you gonna do about it sit there and bitch and complain and ruin the next two months of your life because something didnt go right for you or do you say you know fuck it lets learn from it lets accept it understand that it didnt happen and move on
4152074 there are kids that were hoping for a couple by now
4152075 we were hoping for the same medals they were it hasnt worked out yet but there are lots of kids on the field of play next week that maybe will make up the difference
4152076 its always frustrating for those watching whether back in canada or here for the games to see us not winning as many medals as they would like in the first week but i played enough football to know that you dont call it a game until the gun goes ending the fourth quarter
4152077 fourth place is probably the worst spot you can get at the olympic games
4152078 for many of my clients business travel is just a part of life

4152085 we hoped we would be steady with all three rides
4152086 i had hoped for a bit more but had to think about my team for a safe score
4152087 she started spooking at something on the side of the ring
4152088 it took me totally by surprise midway i knew there was no hope
4152089 one low score and the team is gone like with the u s with four its more exciting

4152100 when we couldnt pay the rent we had to move
4152101 i remember at first i was just going to day camp there and the next thing you know were living in the bottom of the basement
4152102 instead of four different high schools i lived with four different families in high school
4152103 i knew what my mom was experiencing she was working two jobs to help feed us i just knew getting to college was the answer
4152104 i was like do i pursue track and field knowing im not going to be getting paid for a while or just use my economics degree and go get a regular job

4152106 i remember last year i had like 12 meets in a row at third
4152107 the energy and the enthusiasm she showed indoors you could see just springboard her into what she did at the trials
4152108 im taking it like i took all the other championships this year
4152109 i still feel like the underdog like i have something to prove
4152110 theres always a group of human beings that can beat another group of human beings
4152111 when our outside shots are going were even tougher but even without that were still tough to beat
4152112 as long as we keep the pressure on teams in this tournament i feel well impose our will and eventually break them down
4152113 du forst r jo ingenting og alts forst r du heller ikke en disse

4152120 definitions are often based on convenience such as what data is available to the researcher
4152121 researchers need to be mindful about which sub groups of businesses they are studying
4152122 the results may not be applicable to other sub groups or small businesses as a whole
4152123 this is especially important in policymaking where what appears to work for all businesses may in fact not work for non employers or vice versa
4152124 that is the feeling i have been looking for and it feels very good
4152125 i said to him for todays competition just let it go
4152126 you are out there by yourself if you think about competing with others that is when the mental mistakes can happen because you are not so strong psychologically
4152127 i was in very good shape back then if i couldnt win a gold then i thought i could never get a gold extra training would not have had an effect
4152128 hes been encouraging me saying you didnt win but this does not mean you cannot win in 2008
4152129 its going to be really tough to catch yang wei
4152130 anyone who knows me knows in the all around i once had a failure in the very first apparatus and then did well to catch up i also have done very well for the first five events then failed in the last
4152131 i prepared for any difficulties and expect any difficulties i will never give up
4152132 what shes feeling today is a little disappointment because you know how much hard work you put in and for swimmers the olympics is it
4152133 it just didnt happen some days your body just doesnt work my body picked a bad time not to work
4152134 i do really well just kind of being in a stable environment
4152135 not traveling much not switching things up much maybe if it hadnt been quite as long it would have been better
4152136 even though i had disappointing swims i went to the olympics
4152137 i feel like im just beginning on my way hopefully ill go on to bigger and better things in the future
4152138 shes just human we make mistakes and we learn from it
4152139 shes still so young shes going to look back and its just going to be a great learning experience for her
4152140 the last one was pretty much a complete disaster in many ways so shes way ahead of the game
4152141 with every race i think shes kind of grown a little bit and gotten better shes doing these tough doubles too and she made the choice to do that and has handled all of that extremely well
4152142 and if we can really let people see that and draw in the fans maybe we can change the state of the sport
4152143 people want to know that theyre watching the real thing not wwe wrestling
4152144 we have to prevent from choking the life out of the sport
4152145 but i feel that day by day there is no pressure on me
4152146 i just dont want to hear about drugs i dont want to hear about the cheaters
4152147 i just want to hear about the exciting matchups that were getting ready to see with liu xiang and robles defar isinbayeva theres too many exciting athletes competing for us to talk about its time to show the greatness of our sport

4152167 securing funding for this campaign is recognition that our local businesses and citizens are being heard
4152168 our success is important and our contribution to the economic well being of the commonwealth is valued
4152169 that is the feeling i have been looking for and it feels very good
4152170 i said to him for todays competition just let it go
4152171 you are out there by yourself if you think about competing with others that is when the mental mistakes can happen because you are not so strong psychologically
4152172 i was in very good shape back then if i couldnt win a gold then i thought i could never get a gold extra training would not have had an effect
4152173 hes been encouraging me saying you didnt win but this does not mean you cannot win in 2008

4152177 during the favre situation he stood up and answered those questions each and every time saying hes the quarterback of this team and hes ready to lead us some guys wouldve gotten a little flustered but it didnt faze him at all

4152224 what shes feeling today is a little disappointment because you know how much hard work you put in and for swimmers the olympics is it
4152225 it just didnt happen some days your body just doesnt work my body picked a bad time not to work
4152226 i do really well just kind of being in a stable environment
4152227 not traveling much not switching things up much maybe if it hadnt been quite as long it would have been better
4152228 even though i had disappointing swims i went to the olympics
4152229 i feel like im just beginning on my way hopefully ill go on to bigger and better things in the future
4152230 shes just human we make mistakes and we learn from it
4152231 shes still so young shes going to look back and its just going to be a great learning experience for her
4152232 the last one was pretty much a complete disaster in many ways so shes way ahead of the game
4152233 with every race i think shes kind of grown a little bit and gotten better shes doing these tough doubles too and she made the choice to do that and has handled all of that extremely well
4152234 the growth of the health sciences consulting business has been phenomenal and its benefits to the company reach far beyond its bottom line contributions

4152237 during the second quarter we continued to focus on returning united fuel to profitability and took numerous important steps to achieve that objective as quickly as possible
4152238 primarily we concentrated on reducing operating costs and better managing our working capital needs by downsizing our corporate organization rationalizing operations selling excess inventory and dormant assets and improving invoicing and collections
4152239 high product prices have put substantial pressure on our credit lines which are designated by dollar amounts versus volumes so carefully managing our working capital became paramount as fuel prices reached all time highs in the second quarter of 2008
4152240 it has taken a lot of hard work by our dedicated team but we are pleased to report that we were profitable on an operating basis in june and are on target to remain profitable in the third and fourth quarters
4152241 across from a hospital between a pink clothing store and a shoe store
4152242 if shes complaining about you let me tell you something bad about her
4152243 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4152244 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4152245 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4152246 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4152247 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4152248 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4152249 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4152250 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
4152251 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
4152252 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
4152253 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
4152254 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
4152255 results for the first six months demonstrate that the companys breadth of operations has helped stabilize its overall performance in spite of the weak market locally for the sale of new homes
4152256 the company increased revenues from our rental apartment properties and increased the number of lots delivered to lennar corp in st charles fairway village however these increases were not enough to offset a decline in the sales of commercial parcels an expected decrease in homebuilding sales in puerto rico and increased administrative costs
4152257 moreover in the local market the current inventory of homes available for sale and the rate of absorption suggests that the companys pace of lot sales as called for in its sales agreement with lennar corp may be difficult to sustain over the next six to twelve months
4152258 the company expects to continue to rely on its investment property portfolio the sale of commercial parcels and make continued investments in our remaining land holdings until the sales environment for new homes begins to improve
4152259 the increase in multifamily apartment rental revenues resulted from increased revenues from sheffield greens apartments in st charles as construction was not completed until january 31 2007 and not fully occupied during the first quarter of 2007 in addition there were overall rent increases at other rental properties in the united states and puerto rico
4152260 the timing and pace of the settlement of sales of commercial parcels vary from quarter to quarter
4152261 but overall demand for such parcels in st charles remains strong
4152262 the company has substantially completed several major infrastructure improvements in st charles and has broken ground on the top of the hill a highly desirable residential parcel in parque escorial
4152263 the company is continuing to make significant investments that add to the value of our land holdings in the united states and puerto rico
4152264 and should be evaluated over an extended period of time because of the nature of our business in that context we believe these results demonstrate the effectiveness of our companys sound business model which combines land development with our rental apartment portfolio to diversify our corporate revenue sources
4152265 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
4152266 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
4152267 the original intention was to make a live album out of the whole tour selecting different songs from different nights but so many of the best ones just seemed to come from that last night in gdansk that in the end we thought oh well just do the whole thing from gdansk

4152308 where a man and a woman are proved to have lived together as a man and wife the law will presume unless the contrary be clearly proved that they were living together in consequence of a valid marriage and not in a state of concubinage
4152309 the law presumes in favour of marriage and against concubinage when a man and woman have cohabited continuously for a number of years
4152310 if there were circumstances which weaken and destroy the presumption of long years of cohabitation the courts could not ignore them
4152311 there is a strong presumption in favour of wedlock where the partners have lived together for a long spell as husband and wife the presumption was rebuttable but a heavy burden lies on the person who seeks to deprive the relationship of the legal origin to prove that no marriage took place law leans in favour of legitimacy and frowns upon bastardy
4152312 its very exciting to get the chance to show everyone in rotterdam what formula 1 is all about
4152313 driving through the centre of the city will certainly be spectacular to watch and very exciting for me as the driver too

4152316 there is no reason why fares should go up as a result of this for the consumer it means they will have access to a much bigger network we will coordinate our schedules to make it easier to connect between airlines and you will have greater access to cheaper fares
4152317 there will be nothing to stop the customer from taking a fare with aa outbound and taking a fare with ba on the inbound leg
4152318 it is anti competitive it will force up fares and it will mean that passengers get a worse service because if you get rid of competitors by combining ba with aa you have got no one snapping at your heels to make you improve your product
4152319 this is an open market and that is the big difference between now and 2001 anybody can come in and compete

4152322 men are being portrayed negatively by exaggerated statistics on dowry harassment or domestic violence cases women often use the act to separate from the husbands in lieu of an attractive alimony
4152323 the current domestic violence act suffers from gender bias as it is only made for protection of women
4152324 women call me up just to ask if they can use the act to bring around their husbands or to separate them from their parents they do not understand the seriousness of the law this is predominantly an urban phenomenon
4152325 we have websites and helplines that reach out to only internet savvy people but we want to create awareness among those who do not have access to the net
4152326 today girls come with their parents and give their opinions earlier it was considered dowry but today they are vocal of their need actually its more of a fashion trend this trend is increasing for the upper class
4152327 earlier parents bought some stuff but today with fashion needs have also gone up earlier you could give 2 things now everybody has a longer list of fridge tv microwave etc to be given
4152328 nowadays we are sent to the grooms house to get sizes etc earlier a godrej cupboard would be given but today the whole room has to be designed the grooms side says do up the whole wall set up a separate dressing room along with bedrooms and the payment mostly comes from the girls side
4152329 we tell our parents to to spend the money on our education instead of the dowry

4152459 were just going to expand on what the source has always done well
4152460 a core focus but not 80 percent of the book
4152461 i think that what were trying to do is evolve it as hip hop has evolved and become an international force to evolve it without losing its core essence that was the centerpiece of its earliest beginnings and greatness but it has to evolve just like hip hop has to evolve

4152508 its one of those things that men have to do and uh and in those days i wasnt responsible to anybody except myself and to the navy of course
4152509 this is an unprecedented opportunity for a community that is underrepresented on television
4152510 we applaud tyra banks and tv network the cw for making this historic visibility of transgender people possible
4152511 shes hired some pretty high powered consultants to advise her and put it all together the website will be a registry like for a bridal or shower registry where low income women list things they need for their babies more well off people will then go on and buy stuff for the children

4152517 one of my first memories was of watching alan shepard fly his mercury capsule atop a redstone rocket i have lived my entire life dreaming of space operation immortality is essentially a celebration of that same adventuring spirit and an offering of hope for the future i am deeply honored to participate
4152518 looking back to the influences that impacted my career tracy hickmans chronicles series left a lasting impression on me
4152519 his novels were my first exposure to epic fantasy and even though i read them at an early age the setting and characters he created still continue to influence me all these years later
4152520 o tribunal a toda hora est a proferir decis es sobre pessoas dos mais diversos estratos sociais
4152521 my mother taught us to appreciate what we have been given
4152522 nor would she ever encourage or allow a 14 year old child to alter her body
4152523 i am not judging people that do but i am just saying that its not something that my family finds necessary to do especially when youre not even fully developed yet
4152524 it is hard enough being 14 years old and you have enough insecurities to begin with then add being in the public eye
4152525 anecdotally a lot of interest is being expressed and there are some who are buying
4152526 one of the big things thats sending them south is our currency
4152527 has been on par or nearly on par with the u s dollar for some time now and that has many thinking that it has levelled off and probably isnt going any higher
4152528 in a good position because they know what their currency is going to be and their exchange rates
4152529 theres a limit to our second home real estate market
4152530 what were finding is that the people were getting inquiries from and who appear to be buying are baby boomers that have retired or are about to retire
4152531 there was definitely an increase in the number of canadians buying property in florida
4152532 they say oh boy we can finally buy our property after renting all these years then they say well what is happening with the economy is it going to go lower are we going to buy and then lose money
4152533 it is best to have the funds to pay for a u s property up front especially when the currencies are at or near par
4152534 they can take out a mortgage on that or do a line of credit or some personal debt
4152535 if you take the u s way youre probably not going to be really bad off when it comes to currency fluctuations
4152536 in the u s if youre a non resident they require you to put down 30 to 40 per cent of the property value
4152537 plus you need six months worth of reserve you have to put six months of your mortgage payments insurance payments and your property taxes in an escrow account looked after by an escrow agent
4152538 theyre not looking to come down to florida and flip a property

4152542 eu fiz v rios desmentidos e mandei carta ao doutor paulo lacerda negando que fui o respons vel por este material
4152543 ive been collecting garbage on the streets and teaching people to do the same i do this to show people that all the chinese people want civilized and harmonious games
4152544 they have gotten rid of a lot of uncivilized behavior and now things are improving regarding traffic control environmental pollution and showing respect for the elderly
4152545 its the opportunity of a lifetime so im so glad i have the chance to use my time and energy at the beijing olympic games
4152546 i want to see how a city changed and how the athletes change going from international competition to the olympic games so im just excited to catch the olympic spirit
4152547 there are a lot less english speakers here than ive anticipated
4152548 the saving grace of the olympics here is the beijing people are so welcoming
4152549 i feel very happy because i like to help out and i like to talk with foreigners because they are so nice i like helping out foreigners
4152550 we were street kids we would pick up garbage on the street we were beggars actually our life was very poor
4152551 i want to participate in this event and thats why i spent the last five years spent my own money to get them here today
4152552 russian tanks have been on the move russian troops have been behaving extremely aggressively and theyve been in the process of basically completing ethnic cleansing of all georgian populated areas of south ossetia and abkhazia
4152553 we expect russia to meet its commitment to cease all military activities in georgia and we expect all russian forces that entered georgia in recent days to withdraw from that country
4152554 this is not 1968 and the invasion of czechoslovakia where russia can threaten a neighbor occupy a capital overthrow a government and get away with it
4152555 if the sheba farms are delivered then you have no pretext whatsoever for anybody to come and fire from here on israel and from israel to here and the lebanese south would be stabilized for the long term
4152556 the reason they are fighting us is not because this or that border arrangement or territorial dispute but because they want to eliminate us and any non muslims infidels in the middle east
4152557 when we pulled out from lebanon in 2000 the un dictated the final line of withdrawal enough is enough and an end should be an end
4152558 a prenup requiring long term care insurance makes sense for any couple concerned about protecting their assets careers or ways of life
4152559 the bride should be especially concerned since women live longer than men and tend to inherit the care giving chores
4152560 i love the guy but im not signing up to be his nurse or purse
4152561 like millions of other women over 40 sarah knows first hand what caring entails
4152562 she spent countless hours caring for her now deceased stepmother and father and for a friend who died of cancer and now wants a life of her own
4152563 with her husband to be covered by long term care insurance sarahs assets will be protected
4152564 her time and lifestyle will also be protected also she has children and grandchildren whose inheritance will be protected should the need for care materialize she can spend quality time with her husband letting others perform the nursing chores and she can relax knowing that her own financial future will be secure
4152565 by getting married instead of staying single he can get a discount on his long term care policy
4152566 and of course he can also enjoy the benefits sarah enjoys with her policy protection of his own assets and peace of mind knowing he will not burden his children with future care expenses or chores
4152567 he wont have to worry about becoming her nurse or wallet should she require care before he does
4152568 wedding bells should signal wonderful times ahead not cloudy possibilities that can be avoided

4152572 i have no idea where that story has come from no one has approached us about paul konchesky because it is pretty obvious to everyone we are not interested in the slightest about selling paul konchesky
4152573 and if i was paul konchesky i would be very sad to see my name linked with a 2million transfer when i am a player who is worth a lot more than that
4152574 god only knows where that has come from there must be a reason for it someone must have an agenda and is using pauls name to further it
4152575 paul konchesky is not for sale he is our star left back
4152576 his name has never even been mentioned in the eight months i have been at this club
4152577 i had a disease called congenital analgesia which means i couldnt feel anything
4152578 and i was supposed to be in love with you
4152579 and i wouldnt say shes toughened up but instead the problems hitting her now have become bigger at first it was learning to use a typewriter and now its a baby with the father of the baby someone she works with
4152580 some people just arent as likable as others no matter what they do pete campbell does the same stuff as don draper but drapers way more likable and gets away with things
4152581 jon is the lead and he always has something going on
4152582 but i dont think the rest of us feel left out or that we dont get our moments
4152583 i dont think anyone in our cast has any doubt that he always has the best story line in mind and thats what were there to serve
4152584 yesterday he said to me the next episode were shooting is about objects and i said ok
4152585 he always has this grand idea and were just lucky to be part of it
4152586 over seven episodes i had four stages of padding and three stages of makeup
4152587 but ive learned more about the similarities than the differences between then and now
4152588 usually you look back on another era in terms of the milestones but at the same time people were just living their lives

4152597 they would like it to be but it simply isnt us
4152598 the 9600 gt really has become a great valued product for people who are gaming on older monitors capable of only 1280 x 1024 with high detail if youre happy to drop the detail to the medium levels though you should get a decent game experience as high as 1680 x 1050 which is great news for 22 wide screen gamers while ecs havent done much with the card the inclusion of not only a full version game but a recent one is excellent news and helps the card stand out from the pack when compared to some of the others which dont include much more than cables and a driver cd the only real problem we have with the card is the availability in the land down under but thats not really ecs fault its not uncommon for companies to release cards with a certain game bundle to specific regions fortunately if youre looking for a 9600 gt and wouldnt mind a copy of frontlines for a few extra dollars youre not going to have any issues finding one in the states with companies like newegg listing them as in stock the ecs 9600 gt is a good choice for people who are looking for a mid range graphics card and a game that they might actually play its so often we find ourselves looking at game bundles and walk away feeling a bit underwhelmed its good to see that ecs are keeping track of whats new on the market and hopefully they follow suit with future graphics card releases
4152599 expensive therapies need stronger evidence to get applied in clinical practice
4152600 i believe we look more carefully at the evidence if a therapy is expensive and if it is lacking as it is in isar react 3 then i think the implication of the trial will be that interventional cardiologists will use more and more ufh in patients similar to the ones in this study
4152601 i thought that there was a significant reduction in bleeding which is what we expect to see in patients treated with bivalirudin
4152602 those people forget why the combined composite end point of ischemia and bleeding complications came out in the end to be similar if there is a reduction in bleeding complications you should realize that something happened to the ischemic complications that balanced things again we should not forget that there was a trend to more myocardial infarction with bivalirudin as compared with heparin its always difficult in evaluating such composite end points in which the components are moving in two different directions thats why i say that we should evaluate the trial on the basis of the primary end point any other considerations are not sound
4152603 the lack of benefit in terms of the primary end point the much lower price of unfractionated heparin and the much larger experience with unfractionated heparin should make interventionalists use ufh during pci in patients similar to those included in the isar react 3 trial
4152604 the hypothesis is that patients at high risk for bleeding might benefit from bivalirudin and that those at higher risk for mi or ischemic complications might benefit from a more potent therapy in this direction such as looking at both of these issues
4152605 many clinicians did not know they could not have known that bivalirudin does not reduce procedural thrombotic complications in low risk troponin negative patients accordingly bivalirudin which is much more expensive than unfractionated heparin need not be administered to all such patients
4152606 however clinicians will undoubtedly value the small but statistically significant reduction in bleeding with bivalirudin differently and that is appropriate in patients in whom the fear of bleeding is great and the potential consequences profound bivalirudin ought to be preferred it causes less bleeding than heparin as administered in this trial
4152607 before the use of a loading dose of clopidogrel it was always a relationship between dose of heparin increased risk of bleeding and reduced risk of ischemic complications but maybe with the systematic use of clopidogrel loading we dont need such a high dose of ufh
4152608 during the course of development of the portal we sat down and consulted with numerous partners to find out what they wanted in a portal in return i am pleased to say we have created a community platform that will promote stronger relationships and provide the vital tools necessary to deliver the highest levels of service to our mutual customers worldwide

4152642 thanks to safer vehicles aggressive law enforcement and our efforts countless families were spared the devastating news that a loved one was not coming home last year
4152643 you can be sure that were not stopping here the quest is not over until that bottom line number is zero
4152644 as these new statistics show we are making progress but far too many of our friends neighbors and family members are still getting killed or seriously injured
4152645 this is a number that is going to make the fed very concerned
4152646 inflation is not going to run away its going to be reduced
4152647 the bad news is that this is because were in a recession recession kills inflation
4152648 credit is not bad its bad if you use it badly i encourage people to look at it as a tool that they manage you can get good rates rewards frequent flier miles you use it dont let it use you
4152649 the most important thing to improve your score is to have a credit card an installment loan is a fixed payment and you dont have to manage surprises
4152650 a credit card is self managed and you decide how much you charge each month how close you get to your limit whether you let it grow each month or pay it off
4152651 at 600 to 620 it would mean a higher fee up to around 700 and above that no additional fee
4152652 a 20 000 limit over several cards with just 4 000 charged is better than one card with a 5 000 limit with the same 4 000 charged you want to show youre not charging up to the max
4152653 many inquiries in a short period of time might suggest you are trying to take on large amounts of debt both issues are signs of risk
4152654 as long as its on the credit report whether its open or closed low balance or no balance or old or new if its on the report the score is going to count it when counting that mix or when looking at the ideal number of cards closing it is never going to help your score
4152655 so many people are using credit to live beyond their means
4152656 in an ideal world everybody would pay in full and youd use your credit card for convenience there are times when it is neat to be able to use credit where you can spend more than you pay in one month or at holidays or for emergency but youve got to stop and create a plan to get it paid back it keeps your revolving balance low
4152657 manage your debt so that 28 percent of gross monthly income is your housing payment 38 percent for all payments to creditors

4152686 i have been scared mutilated and disfigured by offshore plastic surgery in thailand
4152687 after the doctor refused to refund my money or pay to have the damage he had done to my face fixed by another doctor or do the surgery over again himself i attempted to report the doctor to government and professional medical associations to no avail
4152688 even the attorney i attempted to hire just gave me a run around for several weeks promising to take action against the doctor and never doing so
4152689 i later discovered that there are extremely few successful medical malpractice cases against medical doctors in thailand that result in a cash award currently there are only about 60 outstanding medical malpractice cases on file with the medical council of thailand for the entire country and this number of cases is being pointed to by thai medical council authorities as being unacceptably large
4152690 the liability and the responsibility that physicians have to their patients in america is very high and that doesnt necessarily exist in foreign countries if you have a problem
4152691 when you dont know what someone is trying to tell you and your life is at stake its really scary
4152692 the u s marketplace to seriously step outside the box and look at medical tourism as a real solution to the rising costs of healthcare
4152693 most of the benefits of the 6 4 billion medical tourism promotion in thailand over the past five years have gone to private hospitals while the public health system has shouldered much of the cost in terms of the brain drain and deteriorating working conditions for government employed doctors and nurses the countrys public health system is still a long way from meeting its target of providing one doctor per 1 800 people thousands of vacancies remain unfilled due to an exodus of government employed doctors to the lucrative private healthcare industry
4152694 medical tourism could worsen the internal brain drain and lure professionals from the public sector and rural areas to take jobs in urban centres
4152695 does not augur well for the health care of patients who depend largely on the public sector for their services
4152696 unless national laws or regulations are set up so that these revenues are taxed explicitly and channeled to the public sector
4152697 he was a brave soldier who made the greatest sacrifice anyone could make for everyone elses freedom

4152708 you cant fault the effort of the players when theyre a man down they were absolutely fantastic again
4152709 the referee was perhaps a wee bit inconsistent in the way he let some things go and pulled up others for us
4152710 but thats just part of the game and you just have to get on with it and i think we did that
4152711 we fell short of the goal we had set internally which was to make the quarter finals but we didnt fall short by much

4152714 we started looking for some discount prices on the hewlett packard 4350 laser printer and there really wasnt any bargains to be had not many people selling the 4350 for discount price anywhere this didnt exist yet and im sure its because the owners of the 4350 were businesses usually reviews come from private owners who enjoy internet surfing and writing we bought one and its amazing we started our online search at because they had a specific review write up on the hp 4350 laser printer that site didnt sell printers but they did have some helpful links to companies that sold the 4350 we ended up finding the lowest price from one of those companies sorry cant remember the link to the site we bought it from i can tell you this though its an amazing printer period no problems yet and weve had it for 6 months now

4152751 wir gingen ins studio und spielten jeden tag und alles m gliche passierte die chemie zwischen uns nahm ein eigenleben an dabei herausgekommen ist gute organische musik
4152752 wir haben viel m he auf die produktion verwandt inklusive gitarrenorchester und einiger unserer alten markenzeichen aber im kern h rt man uns drei spielen drei musiker die wirklich und wahrhaftig im studio zusammen spielen so etwas findet man heutzutage sehr selten aber genau das h rt man auf dem neuen album
4152753 sagt man berhaupt noch album keine ahnung aber dies ist wirklich und davon sind wir berzeugt ein album im traditionellen sinn des begriffs etwas das man auflegen und sich an einem st ck anh ren kann das den h rer auf eine reise entf hrt die themen und stimmungen darauf sind gro z gig angeordnet und verlocken den h rer den tag f r eine stunde anzuhalten sich hineinziehen zu lassen und etwas neues zu erleben
4152754 heutzutage so scheint es uns ist diese art von album ein bisschen aus der mode gekommen insgesamt tendieren cds dazu eine sammlung von songs zu sein h ufig von verschiedenen teams produziert und in willk rlicher reihenfolge zusammengestellt ausgehend von dem gedanken dass die h rer sich die st cke auf ihren ipods sowieso neu zusammenstellen diese option bleibt jedem nat rlich immer noch aber unsere lehrer waren die beatles und hendrix blues und soul damit kann sich jeder denken welche richtung wir eingeschlagen haben

4152762 o tratamento poderia ser feito com a reposi o da enzima atualmente um procedimento extremamente caro e que precisa ser feito de forma cont nua a alternativa seria introduzir no paciente o gene normal que passaria a codificar a prote na necess ria

4152768 credit is not bad its bad if you use it badly i encourage people to look at it as a tool that they manage you can get good rates rewards frequent flier miles you use it dont let it use you
4152769 the most important thing to improve your score is to have a credit card an installment loan is a fixed payment and you dont have to manage surprises
4152770 a credit card is self managed and you decide how much you charge each month how close you get to your limit whether you let it grow each month or pay it off
4152771 at 600 to 620 it would mean a higher fee up to around 700 and above that no additional fee
4152772 a 20 000 limit over several cards with just 4 000 charged is better than one card with a 5 000 limit with the same 4 000 charged you want to show youre not charging up to the max
4152773 many inquiries in a short period of time might suggest you are trying to take on large amounts of debt both issues are signs of risk
4152774 as long as its on the credit report whether its open or closed low balance or no balance or old or new if its on the report the score is going to count it when counting that mix or when looking at the ideal number of cards closing it is never going to help your score
4152775 so many people are using credit to live beyond their means
4152776 in an ideal world everybody would pay in full and youd use your credit card for convenience there are times when it is neat to be able to use credit where you can spend more than you pay in one month or at holidays or for emergency but youve got to stop and create a plan to get it paid back it keeps your revolving balance low
4152777 manage your debt so that 28 percent of gross monthly income is your housing payment 38 percent for all payments to creditors

4152793 for obamas part it is not necessary to play the race card
4152794 where there is evidence of criminal wrongdoing we vigorously investigate it and where there is enough evidence to charge someone with a crime we vigorously prosecute
4152795 but not every wrong or even every violation of the law is a crime
4152796 that is the feeling i have been looking for and it feels very good
4152797 i said to him for todays competition just let it go
4152798 you are out there by yourself if you think about competing with others that is when the mental mistakes can happen because you are not so strong psychologically
4152799 i was in very good shape back then if i couldnt win a gold then i thought i could never get a gold extra training would not have had an effect
4152800 hes been encouraging me saying you didnt win but this does not mean you cannot win in 2008
4152801 its going to be really tough to catch yang wei
4152802 anyone who knows me knows in the all around i once had a failure in the very first apparatus and then did well to catch up i also have done very well for the first five events then failed in the last
4152803 i prepared for any difficulties and expect any difficulties i will never give up
4152804 most of our kids are more likely to go to school and to not use drugs
4152805 usually we try and get out every wednesday and usually play basketball at his house because hes got a big garage where you can play basketball
4152806 everybodys job is to do a better thing make the world better
4152807 you see an impact when you actually show up and actually be accountable and be somebody you can look up to
4152808 we usually try and go sledding a couple times and then all the winter sports and stuff like that

4152817 meth continues to just be a terrible problem for kansas
4152818 its a progression of people learning how to bypass the safeguards we have put in place
4152819 we dont even know if they went across the street or on down the road
4152820 kansas is by far the most proactive state in dealing with meth
4152821 our log prevents customers from accidentally or intentionally buying more than the legal limit and the system is fully integrated chainwide
4152822 if you go to a walgreens in kansas and buy the limit you would not be successful in crossing the state line and buying more than allowed at another walgreens
4152823 thanks to safer vehicles aggressive law enforcement and our efforts countless families were spared the devastating news that a loved one was not coming home last year

4152831 we spoke to al jazeera openly about this and we also wrote a letter to al jazeeras headquarters in doha saying that it was unacceptable for a media powerhouse to become a quarterback for a coup against a legitimately elected government
4152832 we did notice that al jazeera gave significant air time to the mauritanian military which opened the doors to critics who accuse the channel of supporting the takeover
4152833 compared to other channels like al arabiya bbc al hurra and al alam al jazeeras performance remains the better it was more professional and more unbiased
4152834 i can assure you that our media coverage of the political events in mauritania before and after the coup has been very professional and balanced no side can accuse us of any being biased in favor of any political party within the mauritanian political scene
4152835 being accused of bias is the least price we pay in our work the journalist has always been the person sought after by political sides to representent their causes and when the journalist doesnt play this role the reactions differ can go from accusations to physical elimination as has happened to many journalists throughout the world

4152838 its a very seminal period an opportunity to both celebrate 20 years of content and the fact that the source was a leader in chronicling the culture of hip hop
4152839 im on a mission to restore it to the community that gave birth to it and open the door to those that currently enjoy and influence that hip hop culture
4152840 its exciting because we believe that we can do it
4152841 we shared with him what we were trying to do the vision of hip hop and where we thought it needed to go and he thought it was refreshing and clever
4152842 were just going to expand on what the source has always done well
4152843 a core focus but not 80 percent of the book
4152844 i think that what were trying to do is evolve it as hip hop has evolved and become an international force to evolve it without losing its core essence that was the centerpiece of its earliest beginnings and greatness but it has to evolve just like hip hop has to evolve
4152845 it is a force nobody can deny the force or the power of the source but is it the same as it was five years ago no
4152846 it does not deliver with the same punch that it used to
4152847 if they are true to the dna of the publication
4152848 our growth both externally as well as internally was massive the sheer number of new servers and their associated applications proved especially challenging as we attempted to reconcile our business expansion within the physical limits of our current infrastructure we knew virtualization was a means through which we could effectively and intelligently approach our integration challenges
4152849 i know there are some reports out there about john lynch i can tell you that i met with john yesterday he came in we talked he took a physical but right now hes not under contract with the patriots
4152850 so until he is i wouldnt have any further comment on that other than what i just said that he was here if and when that happens then well address it but until then i really dont have any other comment on it

4152855 apakah setiap hasil bap harus ada pengakuan para tersangka hak saksi tersangka ataupun saksi harus dilindungi bukan malah di siksa ini benar benar tindakan tidak manusiawi
4152856 kejadian sadis seperti pengakuan kedua saksi itu jangan dibiarkan begitu saja ini harus diusut dengan tuntas kapolri harus menindak tegas anggotanya yang tidak profesional ini perlu agar masyarakat lainnya jangan terus menerus menjadi korban penganiyaan di kantor polisi

4152868 it does not deliver with the same punch that it used to
4152869 if they are true to the dna of the publication
4152870 it left off so much of what is the key ingredients of hip hop and lifestyle now which is lifestyle fashion online new media international aspects of how people embrace content
4152871 you kind of either just look around and laugh or just like enjoy it
4152872 were in awe its a whirlwind and were happy to be on the ride
4152873 for us having this album finally hit stores and having them sing the songs knowing that they can actually hear them and have it in their possession is the most amazing thing for us were so excited
4152874 they really in the last year kicked into high gear with coming to the shows following the music and continuing to talk about it online
4152875 the online thing has been really big for us the youtube videos the myspace all of that but for us all of them outside make it all possible

4152895 the united states of america stands with the democratically elected government of georgia we insist that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia be respected
4152896 georgia is a democratic government in the caucasus that has elected leaders to call it a project of any place of anybody perhaps belies more about what russia thinks about its neighbors that what it thinks about u s policy
4152897 generally these are encompassed in the facilities cost of the buildings
4152898 when we present the roi case to customers they find it very compelling but its not as granular as in the server virtualization world
4152899 we think we have a unique portfolio in terms of breadth from the client side and access devices to notebooks to hardware for the data center coupled with differentiated software and manageability offerings
4152900 when you look at the market a couple of years out people will be using all types of virtualization platforms and technologies hps strategy is to be the best option that brings them all together
4152901 hp is working very closely with vmware to make the client virtualization paradigm simple to use and deploy we want to provide a leading experience for our customers both from an end user perspective and an it perspective
4152902 here is the recipe lynn is looking for it is from the family that my sister wisconsin delegates to get perks obama snapshots obama tea obama cookies
4152903 they told us it is not enough but they are yet to say what is enough
4152904 if we do not sell it we will not get it back
4152905 a number of bridge bloggers were explicit about their desire to cross cultural barriers with their writing
4152906 mugabes party latest antics show that the regime is not sincere on the dialogue process the mdc said in a statement
4152907 snap crackle and pop the 2008 u s open soundtrack
4152908 the evidence was more than sufficient to continue the trusteeship
4152909 just as soon as the operations of the lodge permit
4152910 go where you are inspired toward what moves you to that lyric that keeps you up at night
4152911 ive always wanted the best for the people in my life except for bombita she was in the fifth grade with me and she can die
4152912 and hope at the end of the day connects us all no matter how different we are
4152913 my career mantra and personal mantra are the same dont let anyone tell you your dreams cant come true
4152914 nobody is saying that dangerous drugs should be sold legally to anyone who wants them at whatever price
4152915 but we should learn from other countries that have reduced the criminal penalties that they use for drug users without increasing drug problems
4152916 theres a system in place in portugal whereby anyone caught in possession of less than 10 days supply of any drug cocaine heroin and cannabis are not prosecuted criminally but they are referred to civil panels that can put in place civil penalties but their main aim is to dissuade people from future drug use
4152917 there is no evidence at all that using less of a criminal approach has increased its use
4152918 the proportion of people that have taken illegal drugs in the age group 16 25 is just over half
4152919 drug use has become the normalised activity for young people in this country not all drug users are criminals in other ways
4152920 this argument about sending messages has been often used in drug policies there is no evidence at all that people listen to the messages that drug laws send out
4152921 we have no intention of either decriminalising or legalising currently controlled drugs for recreational purposes drugs are controlled for good reason they are harmful to health
4152922 it is very difficult to make direct comparisons with the drug use and drug policies of different countries or cultures
4152923 ill be working the rest of my life to make it right
4152924 tous nos locaux sont sensibles on passe les papiers au terminal pour en v rifier lauthenticit
4152925 we are really happy to have achieved this because a lot of people didnt believe in the german team
4152926 i feel really excited i achieved my goal i used to do a 34 now i managed a 32 so i am really happy i believe i could do a lot better i would like to do a 22 at some stage
4152927 there will always be people who want to try their best at the olympics and there should be space for them
4152928 some of the hotels on the island have pools and we beg them to let us use them
4152929 it was shown live on tv and you could say that it caused quite a ripple for somebody to come from such a small village and then become an olympian that is something special
4152930 i think the olympic ideals are fostered on their ability to compete irrespective of where you are from and i think that spirit is important
4152931 it is amazing to see their faces and to see them in the warm up
4152932 probably this will live longer in their hearts than it will in ours
4152933 i started last september and they only switched my phone lines on two weeks ago
4152934 everything has been a battle since everything has been a fight
4152935 we really must get up to 37 but with the hurdles of civil service the difficulty with getting people through the background checks and just finding qualified applicants the process has been much slower than expected
4152936 over the course of many decades louisiana and new orleans have earned a reputation as being exceptionally tolerant of corruption
4152937 this fueled the demise of the local economy as it drove many companies away and kept them away
4152938 we have some issues with corruption and bureaucracy but no more than any other urban environment
4152939 we have promised an end to corruption and incompetence in state government make no mistake about it this is a massive first step
4152940 at first they didnt feel so good about it they had trained for a long time to reach this position but after a while they understood that the games is for everyone that this is the olympic spirit
4152941 a third wave of design follows and departs from twentieth century experiments in both form and content which have traditionally defined the spheres of avant garde practice
4152942 however i learned a lot about advertising and wish i had been older and more experienced so that i could have handled the situation as it was a most interesting position
4152943 theyve finally after all these years theyve gotten the names out all of these people had been told never to mention they were with the oss
4152944 were saying the oss was a lot bigger than they were saying
4152945 however i learned a lot about advertising and wish i had been older and more experienced so that i could have handled the situation as it was a most interesting position
4152946 theyve finally after all these years theyve gotten the names out all of these people had been told never to mention they were with the oss
4152947 one can forget about any talk about georgias territorial integrity because i believe it is impossible to persuade south ossetia and abkhazia to agree with the logic that they can be forced back into the georgian state
4152948 our position on georgias territorial integrity is not going to change no matter what anybody says
4152949 and so i would consider that to be bluster from the foreign minister of russia we will ignore it
4152950 we dont want them here what we need is friendship and good relations with the russian people
4152951 we let her stay here and now shes blaming everything on us
4152952 one can forget about any talk about georgias territorial integrity because i believe it is impossible to persuade south ossetia and abkhazia to agree with the logic that they can be forced back into the georgian state
4152953 our position on georgias territorial integrity is not going to change no matter what anybody says
4152954 and so i would consider that to be bluster from the foreign minister of russia we will ignore it
4152955 we dont want them here what we need is friendship and good relations with the russian people
4152956 we let her stay here and now shes blaming everything on us
4152957 this should be done through services not ftp sites or zipped up shapefiles
4152958 i managed to fill up a shopping cart full of everything one might need to create the perfect drink or throw one hell of a bash and i want you to win it
4152959 bernard kouchner a exprim le d sir de le rencontrer il nous a t l phon hier soir il va y avoir une rencontre
4152960 bernard kouchner a exprim le d sir de le rencontrer il nous a t l phon hier mercredi soir il va y avoir une rencontre
4152961 du point de vue des tib tains le fait de rencontrer le dala lama ce nest pas anti chinois
4152962 je serais tr s heureuse de rencontrer le prix nobel de la paix
4152963 je voudrais le rencontrer les contacts sont en cours avec mon cabinet et le bureau du repr sentant du dala lama pour trouver le meilleur moment
4152964 il a un programme charg du fait de cette visite pastorale il est l pour une dizaine de jours je ne doute pas quon arrivera trouver une date d s que possible
4152965 on va voir si cest possible que a se passe le plus vite possible
4152966 pendant des mois je nai cess de prendre position sur la question du tibet
4152967 je ne vois pas ce quil y a de choquant ce que la premi re dame de france rencontre le dala lama
4152968 cest videmment beaucoup trop tard limpact dune r ception pendant cette visite dao t alors que se d roulent les jeux olympiques de p kin aurait videmment t beaucoup plus fort sur le plan politique
4152969 cest une faute a l gard des chinois nicolas sarkozy a montr quil tait extr mement changeant puisque il avait dabord conditionn sa participation la c r monie douverture des jo une entrevue avec le dala lama avant de changer davis je ne suis pas s r que les chinois eux m mes appr cient ce genre de comportement
4152970 ce dala lama a quelque chose qui manquait aux autres
4152971 the aircraft will be carrying medical supplies shelters bedding those types of things
4152972 that will be the first flight in there are plans for another flight tomorrow as we continue to assess the wide range of humanitarian assistance options that we might be able to provide both in the immediate and long term humanitarian capabilities
4152973 were looking at a broader range of assets and capabilities that we might bring to bear on the humanitarian need there
4152974 weve had a strong relationship with georgia for many years now
4152975 we can also refocus family support and education programs to discuss alcohol misuse and to educate all on resources available in the military in the department of veterans affairs and in the civilian community
4152976 the national guard is constantly seeking better ways to maintain and improve the behavioral health and general well being of its warriors through synergistic programs including chaplain support family support employment assistance advocacy counseling and training and this new position is another way of meeting those needs
4152977 we recognize the unique needs of our citizen soldiers and airmen and are constantly looking for innovative ways that we can better meet those needs
4152978 and in the days ahead we will use u s aircraft as well as naval forces to deliver humanitarian and medical supplies
4152979 russia has also stated that it has halted military operations and agreed to a provisional cease fire
4152980 unfortunately were receiving reports of russian actions that are inconsistent with these statements
4152981 we expect russia to meet its commitment to cease all military activities in georgia and we expect all russian forces who have entered georgia in recent days to withdraw from that country
4152982 were concerned about reports that georgian citizens of all ethnic origins are not being protected
4152983 all forces including russian forces have an obligation to protect innocent civilians from attack
4152984 to begin to repair the damage to its relations with the united states europe and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world russia must keep its word and act to end this crisis
4152985 some countries dont have enough need for airlift to purchase their own c 17s
4152986 with a full payload the c 17 can go a distance of 2 400 nautical miles and up to 28 000 feet
4152987 it can convert to airline or cargo seats it can handle a combination of passengers vehicles track vehicles cargo medical evacuations hummers fire trucks helicopters an abrams tank up to 75 metric tons and can land on short austere landing zones
4152988 initially there will only be u s personnel manning the c 17s
4152989 but with training the countries will be able to use their own pilots and loadmasters it will take a year and a half to train the countrys crew and for them to be comfortable with the c 17 to fly on their own
4152990 i realized with my last pair to go oh the olympic record is only 144
4152991 if you shoot the olympic record in qualification rounds and youve got a little bit of a lead you expect to come out with gold
4152992 but after i went out there in the final and missed that first pair it was a little dicey there for a second but i brought it all back together
4152993 i finally made a final in the olympics i came in like 12th in sydney and 17th in athens and finally came out and put a good day together this was the only thing i was worried about for the last two years
4152994 that and i had my teammates with me the military has been great to me theyve helped me fulfill a dream that without them i dont think wouldve ever happened i owe everything to them
4152995 it gave me a lot of discipline i was fortunate enough to go into the army marksmanship unit its great having those guys to train with every day they really pushed me along just working with them all day every day it keeps you in it
4152996 for right now they asked me to come to the olympics and win a gold medal for the united states
4152997 i dont know how to better represent them than with a gold medal in my hand
4152998 theyve been here all week and to the last two olympics watching me to have them here and to finally win a gold medal for them is incredible the crowd was amazing the facilities were incredible
4152999 this game is all about putting four good rounds together and honestly i could only manage two i had a mediocre round and a bad round so when youve got two good rounds they dont offset the mediocre and bad rounds
4153000 thats where you finish when you shoot like i did in the final
4153001 glenn eller and i started shooting against each other a long long time ago and we actually enlisted in the army together in the fall of 2006 this was half of our goal we wanted gold and silver at the olympics we came really close but im happy for him
4153002 when were out on the shooting line we take the gloves off and go at it as hard as anybody else
4153003 i dont feel bad when he misses a target if he would have lost the gold medal yeah i would have felt badly for him but not if i was in the silver medal position id be chasing him the whole way
4153004 joining the army was probably the best thing i couldve done for my shooting career just because of the discipline and structure that comes along with the army
4153005 the army marksmanship unit at fort benning has world class shooting facilities we shoot with and against some of the best in the world
4153006 ive been training with the 2008 olympic gold medalist for the last two years straight since i joined the army so the army has definitely taken my shooting to the next level
4153007 my heartfelt thanks go out to everybody who has been behind me this whole time but its glenns day
4153008 theyre over there fighting for my freedoms which i enjoy very much and theyre leaving their families and their wives and most of them have smaller children
4153009 theyre over there worrying about their life for one thing but on the other hand theyre worrying about what their children and their wives are going through if i can help them that way then thats a little less worry that they have
4153010 i asked them why they thought they needed to do that and they said it was to ease the pain of us being gone and that it was a small price to pay for what we were doing
4153011 its too bad all employers arent this good to work for and its easy to see how easy it is to work for them for 26 years
4153012 you go to work every morning knowing that you work for good people
4153013 theres no other employer that tops them they deserve the red carpet treatment from the army for what they do
4153014 theyre all pretty humble people anyway but when they come back theyre so appreciative
4153015 with the other people listening to them out there on a daily basis i think it makes the other people better americans and makes them appreciate what they really have here
4153016 its a great honor for me to be selected as one of the recipients
4153017 for my employees to nominate me for that that was an awesome thing im just proud to be a part of it
4153018 el plan de retirada de las fuerzas rusas a n no ha sido adoptado pero el env o de refuerzos est suspendido las tropas que ya est n desplegadas en osetia del sur no pueden retirarse todas a la vez hemos sufrido bajas y los materiales deben ser reparados y sometidos a un mantenimiento
4153019 los combates en la etapa final fueron encarnizados y las partes beligerantes emplearon armamento pesado lo que hizo aumentar el n mero de bajas
4153020 durante otros dos d as las tropas rusas permanecer n en la regi n para realizar procedimientos de entrega de las funciones de control a los organismos de aplicaci n de la ley georgianos despu s de eso se retirar n
4153021 las fuerzas rusas han dejado el puerto de poti esta ma ana
4153022 esperamos que tambi n hoy las tropas rusas se retiren de zugdidi y que tendremos todo el control sobre gori
4153023 its a very strong feeling very strong feeling because it mobilizes people its vernacular mobilization i would say
4153024 its something which keeps people together and its something for which people are really ready to be killed
4153025 once a os es m s que suficiente hicimos un plan gradual pero no se cumple
4153026 hubo dos pr rrogas la segunda de las cuales se cumpl a ma ana y yo no estaba dispuesto a permitir otra m s
4153027 los clubes pidieron otra postergaci n hasta agosto del a o pr ximo y la decisi n del gobierno es otorg rsela
4153028 el tema de violencia en el f tbol no se soluciona con las butacas no se puede mezclar violencia f sica con seguridad
4153029 transformar la realidad requiere mucho tiempo y excede el tiempo de funci n de cualquier funcionario
4153030 son de los m s variados desde una cuesti n econ mica por menor venta de localidades hasta un tema cultural
4153031 aqu era una cuesti n cultural ir a los boliches cerrados con bengalas hasta que en croma n murieron 200 hijos nuestros
4153032 los sistemas de seguridad se pueden transformar y eso de la cultura se puede cambiar pero es necesario tener firmeza pol tica para mantenerlos
4153033 la gente no entiende la importancia de que haya butacas o no sabe de las tragedias que se generaron por tener a los espectadores de pie
4153034 the spores involved were very unlikey to have been made by a nonscientists in a garage laboratory and certainly not in a cave in afghanistan
4153035 disgruntled american scientists as was likely the case with the case with the spores used in amerithrax
4153036 the question policymakers now face is how much preparation is enough how do we know when we are safe or at least as safe as we can expect to be the underlying programs continue to be sold to the congress and the american public largely by playing on fears of bioterrorism
4153037 spliced a gene for diphtheria toxin into a plague genome creating a genuine monster of a pathogen they were also thought to have stitched in genes that blocked a victims immune system from responding depriving the body of its first line of defense
4153038 half of our troops who died in this war died of the flu not from artillery shells bullets or poison gas we dont really know how many died worldwide estimates range from twenty five million to fifty or even a hundred million
4153039 between six and seven hundred thousand perished more than have died in all u s wars through vietnam
4153040 sinto que tenho o dever de defender a identidade tibetana e falar em voz muito alta contra o brutal regime chin s que destr i a terra natal de meu pai
4153041 i know hes always wanted to play in a professional side with danny it nearly happened once for lancashire and thats the nearest hes got
4153042 if i can facilitate that on the right terms for the club then id love to
4153043 i can remember paul playing so well over a number of years but obviously the directors are perhaps a little more conservative because there is a question mark at the minute over his durability
4153044 thats been reflected in his number of appearances over the last two years those factors will be taken into account but we will be chatting to pauls agent and if we can come to some agreement id be delighted
4153045 cooperar plenamente con las instituciones democr ticamente elegidas y particularmente el parlamento
4153046 contexto de crisis pol tica e institucional aguda que consegu a la obstrucci n sistem tica del funcionamiento de la instituci n parlamentaria por pr cticas anticonstitucionales del ex presidente de la rep blica en alusi n al derrocado mohamed uld chiej abdalahi y de su gobierno
4153047 individual units tend to only see their own circle of operations
4153048 before that it was impossible to follow all the development projects and changes going on inside the wire
4153049 many afghans are very good at brick and mortar and they are very smart
4153050 i believe afghans are watching and will find a way to bring more technology to afghanistan
4153051 in terms of electrical and mechanical engineering afghanistan is a generation or two away from the united states in terms of technology
4153052 i get to know my patients and they let me know exactly what they want i love the work that i do
4153053 with all the war casualties coming in right now it is important that we use our capabilities to help those wounded warriors
4153054 senior airman jones has an artistic background and he uses his knowledge of sculpting color and contours to restore missing or altered facial features he has a passion for his craft and he is filling big shoes right now
4153055 who seem to spend a disproportionate amount of their time looking for deleted smiths singles and original not rereleased underlined frank zappa albums theyre as close to being mad as makes no difference
4153056 the screen door slams marys dress waves like a vision she dances across the porch as the radio plays
4153057 i dont have to sell my soul hes already in me
4153058 keep that faith keep your courage stick together stay strong do not yield do not flinch stand up were americans and well never surrender
4153059 i probably should have mentioned what you all already know these are tough times
4153060 there is no question the tether is a condition of our bond
4153061 he does not have the authority to change or alter the bond in a different case
4153062 he the mayor is subject to conditions of the other bond
4153063 hes played and been successful at this level so thats a major plus for him
4153064 hell also get to spend a year learning our system and running the offense and be in a position to give us two good years
4153065 ugo played for two very good junior college programs and for an outstanding coach in steve eck
4153066 he provides us with another big body and his ability to play multiple positions also gives us some versatility hes clearly big enough and strong enough to play inside and defend and he has some skills away from the basket too
4153067 the best thing about ugo is that we have him for three years thats part of what made him so attractive
4153068 hey i always thought that but never spoke up about it
4153069 how much talent is required to let a mecha fight for you
4153070 los pueblos originarios no fueron incluidos en la discusi n de la lge
4153071 el fiscal de la forestal mininco ha estado amedrentando a las comunidades mapuche de chequenco y antinao oblig ndoles a declarar en contra de nosotros que actualmente nos encontramos recluidos en la c rcel de temuco y de angol a muchos mapuche de la comunidad se les est ofreciendo dinero y artefactos como celulares para que declaren y esp en a su propia gente
4153072 la pr ctica de los consejeros viola la ley ind gena 19 253 y los principios ticos al asumir posiciones vitalicias y patrimoniales sobre la conadi
4153073 nosotros queremos que el gobierno le d una soluci n a los problemas de tierra que tenemos en diferentes comunidades tambi n rechazamos la actuaci n de estos consejeros que est n imponiendo su derecho afirmando que el trabajo que ellos hacen es verdadero nosotros decimos que el gobierno est buscando un medio para buscar soluciones en estas comunidades
4153074 magn fica demostraci n de la incapacidad de di logo de los estudiantes de chile
4153075 igual de vehemente de apasionado de arriesgado en la defensa de sus err neos principios pol ticos su padre me explic ella era militante de la ultraderecha de sus d as
4153076 y de inmediato la sentencia de expulsi n quedar sin efecto
4153077 umbral de un verdadero golpe de estado contra el orden constitucional
4153078 al t pico estilo de las dictaduras que precedieron a la recuperaci n de la democracia en 1982
4153079 toman aeropuertos toman cortes departamentales electorales y balean carros coches de ministros
4153080 las fuerzas armadas son los garantes de la democracia concepto que incluye el precepto constitucional de garantizar la estabilidad del gobierno legalmente constituido sea el actual o cualquier otro que recoja la voluntad del pueblo que es el gran soberano
4153081 los resultados del proceso cualquiera que estos fueran con la mayor cordura y sentido de responsabilidad
4153082 tratamos de producir obras de denuncia claras y provocadoras que hagan reaccionar a la prensa y suscitar esfuerzos de destruccion de la obra por parte de aquellos que no puedan soportarla haciendo mucho ruido y volviendo accesible el mensaje a los que no pertenecen al campo
4153083 hice abundante cosecha de esqueletos y craneos en los cementerios de los indigenas sometidos que vivian en las inmediaciones del azul y en blanca grande
4153084 thank fuck thats nearly finished im bursting for a piss
4153085 my real age is 16 i dont pay any attention to what everyone says
4153086 never has any media outlet called me to check the athletes ages
4153087 we are a sports department how would we have the ability to do that
4153088 we already explained this very clearly theres no need to discuss this thing again
4153089 comes as close to infanticide as anything i have seen in our judiciary
4153090 of course we believe everyone should deserve the protection of this bill who could be more vulnerable than a newborn baby so of course we agree with that we join with an aye vote on this i hope it will in fact be unanimous
4153091 in which he voted for any regulation or restriction on the practice of abortion
4153092 i wouldnt put a timetable on it the three of them paterson senate majority leader dean skelos and speaker sheldon silver can sit down and meet any time its not that hard to arrange
4153093 i expect both of those to be resolved by early next week at the latest
4153094 esto es una provocaci n inaceptable en un estado democr tico
4153095 es muy distinto venir aqu al lugar mismo donde est n ocurriendo los hechos y constatar que la denuncias son absolutamente efectivas esta situaci n no es tolerable en un estado democr tico
4153096 es una provocaci n inaceptable esta presencia pr cticamente militar con tanquetas micro cascos subametralladoras fusiles es algo que jam s hab a visto en mis tres per odos que llevo como parlamentario y como presidente de la comisi n de derechos humanos
4153097 el 11 de julio inform por oficio al ministro del interior de la gravedad de los hechos que est n ocurriendo en nuestra comuna y hasta la fecha no he recibido respuesta alguna percibo que est violencia puede hacernos perder el raciocinio y de ah las consecuencias pueden ser fatales por eso pido el m ximo de preocupaci n para resolver este problema
4153098 no queremos m s que la justicia militar resuelva los casos que involucre a la polic a y a los mapuche todos sabemos cual es el resultado al final siempre se protege a carabineros y los mapuche tienen que pagar como culpables eso es una deuda que el gobierno que la c mara de diputados tiene que cambiar no es posible que esto contin e
4153099 todav a estoy presa pero siento que de alguna manera se est abriendo la justicia y espero que se cumpla lo que tiene que ser lo real la libertad tiene que llegar porque aqu no hay nada que tenga que ver con esos asaltos y la verdad sigo pensando que hay todo un sistema extra o que todav a no logro entender
4153100 no es el camino de justicia que debe haber en chile
4153101 a ver el lugar de reposo de mat as catrileo el fue mi hermano mi amigo que me acompa en los d as de prisi n fui a rendirle homenaje
4153102 porque yo no ten a factura para comprobar que los 180 000 que se robaron eran m os
4153103 yo siento mucho sufrimiento estos a os que el hijo est preso son un dolor muy grande la comida no la puedo aprovechar la como entre l grimas a ra z de este problema de los que llevan la justicia me he enfermado tuvieron que llevarme al hospital espero que dejen en libertad a mi hijo y me lo entreguen en buenas condiciones como estaba l al ser detenido
4153104 la legitimidad y normalidad del acto plebiscitario reafirma la consolidaci n del proceso democr tico boliviano y la solidez de sus instituciones
4153105 it was the most unprofessional irresponsible investigation that ive ever seen in my life and now theyre still trying to validate that pathetic investigation
4153106 everyone has to understand that mr byron is not the one that went to law enforcement asking for a deal law enforcement went to mr byron
4153107 i think the investigation stands exactly where it has always stood and this is unfortunately where the sheriffs office jumped to the conclusion that the aisenbergs were responsible for their missing child
4153108 la votaci n de este domingo fue el mayor desaf o que ha enfrentado la gesti n de morales
4153109 para ser confirmado en su cargo el presidente necesita un m nimo del 53 7 de los sufragios el porcentaje que logr en las elecciones de 2005 mientras que los prefectos deben obtener la mitad m s uno de los votos
4153110 tambi n fueron confirmados en sus puestos cinco de los ocho prefectos que se sometieron a la votaci n mientras tres deber n abandonar sus labores
4153111 i am just speaking from the heart about dominic cork who has been fantastic for us

4153154 rather than rush into another billion dollar bond this year our communities are calling for water reform that ensures california does not drift further into water crisis
4153155 california is in the midst of a severe water crisis and we need solutions today
4153156 we need to invest in our water system so it can meet the needs of the environment and the economy there is no single issue more important to california today and to our future generations
4153157 the governor presents this bond as a forward thinking comprehensive solution but in reality its the same old thing another version of past proposals to build more dams put in a peripheral canal and bail out corporate agribusiness
4153158 california has to put its own house in order before asking us to support another bond
4153159 instead of committing to a cost effective statewide water conservation plan modeled on the advances pioneered in southern california this plan wastes billions of dollars on outdated technologies
4153160 unfortunately they just lifted the call and ab 1806 failed passage on a vote of 18 21
4153161 reconsideration was granted but it does not look like we will be able to get the votes to get the bill off the senate floor
4153162 we tried to lobby the members to get the last few votes but unfortunately the fact that the bill went on call gave the opposition more time to lobby members to move into the no column

4153207 forget osama putin is now the worlds most dangerous terrorist
4153208 one of your guests claimed the bush administration wasnt sufficiently engaged with russia to prevent this situation baloney how many times has putin been to crawford bush just misjudged him
4153209 i find it odd that president bush has condemned russia for attacking a sovereign country was iraq not a sovereign country too
4153210 with russia building a monopoly on energy and our unwillingness to get off of foreign oil world war iii is inevitable thanks for being the only analyst with the courage to tell the truth
4153211 russia is feeling threatened and when a superpower like the usa arms and trains an ex soviet state russias position is legitimate how would america feel in their position
4153212 drilling for oil is only part of a comprehensive energy plan the republicans are putting forth
4153213 by not taking action against russia or iran we have convinced the world we can be walked all over this is what dooms us to world war iii
4153214 when the chips are down and russia invades georgia killing hundreds and destroying their homes all we can do is watch to make sure the pipeline is ok with friends like us who needs enemies
4153215 im not confident mccain or obama will do anything to really deal with our oil problem
4153216 anyone claiming to be a republican who is voting for a socialist like obama isnt a republican by definition
4153217 how could your guest compare obama to reagan reagan wanted smaller government
4153218 ronald reagan was a multi term governor before he went to the white house obama can only dream of those credentials
4153219 i am retired navy when you go against the captain of your ship its considered a mutiny republicans voting for obama are guilty of a mutiny of the worst kind
4153220 that was a very fair and balanced presentation bill your guests were calm intelligent rational people who gave very good reasons for supporting obama
4153221 they may call themselves republicans but i call them traitors to the party if theyre voting for obama they are not true conservatives
4153222 shame on you oreilly you let your guests get away with comparing sen obama with the current administration w isnt running
4153223 mr obama has no clear plan for the problems facing our country he only says what the people want to hear
4153224 republicans for obama is an oxymoron the guy is more to the left than ted kennedy
4153225 im not impressed by media trying to make a fool out of john edwards or anyone else over an extra marital affair he made a mistake he admitted it leave him alone
4153226 i hope you were successful contacting the fbi to inquire about opening a case against john edwards
4153227 bill we need to know the truth about the money edwards gave away he needs to be held accountable stay on the story
4153228 edwards vehemently denies paying off his mistress but he had also vehemently denied having an affair in the first place at this point i wouldnt believe john edwards if he vehemently denied his name is john edwards
4153229 you can bet if edwards was a republican nancy pelosi and her gang would be scrambling back into session to set up a special committee to investigate
4153230 although it looks like john edwards political career is over all is not lost he now has lots of time to concentrate on selling his outdoor awnings
4153231 you are way off target blaming the airlines for tarmac delays faa leadership is to blame for its self destructive way of dealing with air traffic controllers
4153232 this is displaced aggression im sure the airlines are as disgusted by tarmac delays as the passengers a bill of rights cant solve weather delays or equipment failures get real
4153233 im tired of hearing the airlines vilified no pilot leaves the gate knowing the plate will wait multiple hours before takeoff
4153234 i hate how the airline says enjoy your flight three times before takeoff even after youve been waiting for three hours to leave the ground

4153239 jen who decided to move on she is very fond of john and has thought he might be the one she finds him funny sexy and very talented plus he understands all the aspects of living in a fishbowl but in the final analysis she just got tired of his roving eye
4153240 technological innovation and increasing of knowledge are fundamental to sustainable economic growth
4153241 we invited the media from asian countries because they play a key role in knowledge economy
4153242 as a matter of fact south koreas transition towards knowledge economy was started by the media
4153243 thanks to the forum i could identify the key factors to successful development
4153244 they came down to three points only innovation education and ict
4153245 i received information and creative ideas from other countries participants
4153246 of course any countries including cambodia can become a knowledge economy
4153247 as long as we have the clear will and we focus on quality education by improving the education system to meet the international standard or at least aseans standard
4153248 the public sector needs to have a clear political will towards knowledge based economy
4153249 i think it will not be difficult for cambodia to become a knowledge based economy like south korea because our country is small and we have quite a lot of intellectuals and natural resources
4153250 but we do not have decided yet to take this step
4153251 it is urgent to put knowledge economy at the heart of your countrys development strategies
4153252 achieving knowledge economy is a matter of will and determination vision is important
4153253 education is key to improve living standards and the cambodian government gives high priority to education
4153254 but cambodia comes out of conflict and although we achieved peace and national reconciliation there remain several priorities so the governments current focus is on primary and secondary education its goal is education for all
4153255 but not just higher education from elementary all the way up to university level we dont need quantity anymore we need only quality of education
4153256 for knowledge economy to take place there is a need to change mind sets cultures in nations firms banks and so on
4153257 i believe the more you have freedom the more you can be innovative
4153258 there must be an openness to facilitate experiencing which starts from kindergarten to adulthood
4153259 he daeje chin was allowed to explore and his innovative ideas on moving south korea with high technology and promoting e government have been accepted
4153260 gdp per capita in south korea was only us 300 in the 1970s
4153261 now 4 percent of gdp per capita is coming from the ict industry to reach our target of us 30 000 per capita in 2015 new growth engines must be identified
4153262 knowledge and innovation based policies are spurring growth and competitiveness around the globe
4153263 and there is a need to think of the future under a knowledge economy heading for all countries
4153264 korea has been successful in its transition to knowledge economy
4153265 and it is important for developing countries to now create the foundations of knowledge economy

4153282 the fact that increasing numbers of people are feeling the pinch is to be expected but these figures give an interesting picture of how people are actually coping with it at this time
4153283 whats interesting is that 51 of people still feel they are managing easily which may seem a high figure to some considering all the stories in the news at the moment
4153284 but its telling that the figure has fallen so sharply since 2006 which was a relatively good time for the economy
4153285 when the economy gets into trouble the effects can take a while to filter through many people are still managing well following the buoyant economy of 2006 to late 2007
4153286 but as the problems begin to filter through for example to homeowners struggling to sell their homes consumers facing higher food prices and bills etc we may well see more peoples circumstances take a turn for the worse
4153287 consumer confidence can be affected by things like the media portrayal of the economy but a large part of it does come down to personal situations
4153288 even those who have not been terribly affected by the credit crunch will have noticed how quickly the price of food and household costs are rising
4153289 we would advise everyone to keep a close watch on their finances at this time
4153290 a debt adviser will talk you through your situation and help you to decide the best course of action for example if you have a number of debts that you are struggling to balance with your household commitments a debt consolidation loan could help debt consolidation loans work by grouping all your debts together so you only repay one creditor instead of many
4153291 payments can be rescheduled over a longer period of time than the original debts meaning payments are lower which could be a useful way of freeing up extra money for your other living costs but be aware that rescheduling your debt consolidation loan will probably involve paying more in interest in the long run iva individual voluntary arrangement or debt management plan might be more suitable if youre unsure as with any debt solution speak to a debt adviser first
4153292 what is clear is that russia has invaded georgias sovereign has encroached on georgias sovereignty and it is very important for us to resolve this issue as quickly as possible
4153293 clearly over the course of the last 24 hours this crisis has escalated
4153294 russian aggression must not go unanswered and that its continuation would have serious consequences for its relations with the united states
4153295 i am saddened that it is politically inconvenient to acknowledge what everyone knows the iraq war is largely about oil

4153300 hydrogen is potentially a very important piece of the long term energy puzzle
4153301 before we begin to see more hydrogen powered cars on the highways though we have a number of important technical and economic challenges dealing with how hydrogen will be produced transported stored and converted into a useful energy source thats why research development and innovation including work being done at duke and other universities are a vital part of the equation
4153302 for technologies such as hydrogen production and hydrogen powered fuel cells to compete in the marketplace you have to create a new energy system that is cost effective compared to the alternatives
4153303 one step toward that goal is for the federal government to establish a broad based environmental policy that encourages lower greenhouse gas emissions
4153304 hydrogen is part of a balanced and diverse energy portfolio that will help address our future energy environmental and economic security needs
4153305 this tour provides americans an opportunity to see what the future could hold for hydrogen powered vehicles as we work to help make these vehicles cost competitive and available for all

4153321 mounting fears of a full fledged global recession have caused a profound shift in investor strategy over the last month setting off a powerful dollar rebound and a flight to relative safety in us assets
4153322 what started as a us financial crisis is morphing into a global economic crisis investors now expect a downturn of such intensity that it will prevent inflation from taking hold
4153323 we have always said that in order to keep louisiana safe we need both to strengthen the levees we have now and restore the wetlands and coastal areas that serve as our natural hurricane barriers
4153324 this new plan fulfills both of those priorities we congratulate governor jindal and everyone who worked with him to develop the plan for a job well done
4153325 the state has done a great job with this proposal but now the federal government needs to step up to the plate and provide its share of the funding that is already authorized for restoration projects
4153326 we will continue to work with the state and the u s army corps of engineers to get large scale restoration projects ready for funding and construction in upcoming federal and state budgets
4153327 this plan shows a substantial commitment to projects that will allow us to restore wetlands by using sediment that would otherwise have gone to waste
4153328 these projects will restore the mississippi rivers capacity to build land and allow us to take advantage of storm protection provided by our natural resources
4153329 the barrier islands act as a speed bump for storm surge and wave energy
4153330 louisiana loses the equivalent of 32 football fields worth of wetlands every day and that includes many of our barrier islands this leaves coastal communities vulnerable to the full wrath of hurricanes the new funding will help us rebuild those speed bumps and bring back our first line of defense against storms
4153331 this certainly helps the pc become a much better center of communications in the home
4153332 intel and jajah have a common objective to deploy technology building blocks that deliver a richer communication experience for consumers
4153333 the combination of our technologies enables added convenience and energy efficiency for consumers who want the pc to be a genuine two way communication platform for their ip based telephony services
4153334 this certainly helps the pc become a much better center of communications in the home
4153335 recent examples of the changing vendor landscape include the siemens joint venture that combines enterasys with siemens enterprise voice and hewlett packard procurves acquisition of colubris for wireless lan

4153350 wwfs new tagging project will shed new light on tuna migratory routes and behaviour which will enable far more effective recovery and management plans both for the tuna and the fishery that depends on them
4153351 the plan behind this project is to fill the gap between the little we do know about bluefin behaviour in the mediterranean and what we need to know
4153352 when we have better data we would urge fisheries decision makers to use it to make better informed choices for the management of this endangered species

4153354 agribusiness firms are already spending millions to defeat proposition 2 and they hardly needed an illegal infusion of check off funds authorized by the usda to supplement their political campaign
4153355 expending these funds within 90 days of the election is a transparent attempt to influence the vote on proposition 2 the egg industry and usda had 49 other states in which to spend this money but it chose to do so in california right before the election and thats unethical and illegal
4153356 california egg producers are undertaking a campaign to defeat the measure
4153357 the american egg board voted to set aside 3 million
4153358 industry groups are already gearing up to blitz the public with propaganda advocating that farm animals be confined in tiny cages where they cannot even turn around and extend their limbs

4153376 this could be a slam dunk for gregor but its not an automatic win
4153377 this has the potential to become the political equivalent of a 50 car pile up
4153378 we move in totally different circles the opportunity to bring our circles together was just way too exciting
4153379 but we werent able to give prospective candidates the attention they deserved in the weeks since the
4153380 well be running more than a full set of parks board candidates a good compliment of city council candidates and were still working on recruiting candidates for school board
4153381 i guess theyll review it and either call me for an interview or approve me outright
4153382 i think the npa has had some really good parks board commissioners in the past i feel comfortable with them
4153383 is the tent going to be large enough to accommodate someone like myself that will be the test for sure there hasnt been anything yet that has shown me otherwise
4153384 theres a momentum in this city a momentum that wants to defeat the npa how that plays out vis vis parties its way too early to say
4153385 were in discussions with vision vancouver and we hope to reach an agreement with them as soon as possible
4153386 i think part of the reason gregor is so popular is that people from cope and vision like him and what he stands for they like him also because he says he wants some kind of common campaign if we were to run our own mayoral campaign that would significantly change the dynamic that is operating right now
4153387 if the left is united this campaign will be a cakewalk for gregor if theres a split in any way peter ladner and the npa will rule the next city council
4153388 neither executive has clarified how many seats are up for grabs
4153389 that could lead to a lot of hard feelings if someone goes in and spends a lot of money and time to win one of these contests and finds out at the last minute that the party is only going to run six candidates they might feel cheated
4153390 if you run fewer than 10 you get a plumping effect
4153391 in a close race the party that plumps or has fewer candidates on the final ballot will come out ahead
4153392 i think some of these people are just viscerally excited by what happened in gregors campaign some of these community activists havent seen a political phenomenon like this for a long time
4153393 others well maybe there are people who might see an opportunity to get on to council
4153394 frankly the nomination race in my opinion will be much more complicated than the elections itself
4153395 that doesnt mean that were a sure thing in the election its just that this nomination contest involves much more complicated politics
4153396 ultimately in a minority parliament to get things done you have to have the support of at least one of the other opposition parties
4153397 two of the three opposition parties dont support the government and say we should be defeated mr dion says he doesnt support the government but wont say whether he will defeat us or not i dont think thats a tenable situation i think mr dion will have to make up his mind

4153403 i see nobody else to win the premier league but tottenham surely have the quality to fight for a top four finish
4153404 i cannot really say who the surprise team will be but year after year we always wait for a better newcastle
4153405 they are a top club they have huge support and they have good players so we wait for more from them

4153484 over the past three years we have consistently found the sequential trigger twice as safe as the more commonly used contact trip trigger
4153485 the contact trip trigger allows workers to rapidly fire the tool and more frequently results in injuries from accidental discharges double fires and ricocheting nails
4153486 we found that carpenters with more training were better equipped to handle the tool and less prone to injury carpenters were best protected when they received both classroom training and hands on instruction unfortunately most residential carpenters including immigrant workers are less likely to get training compared to the union workers we studied
4153487 there are currently no regulations that require the sequential trigger be used or that define minimal training requirements even though data suggests there should be

4153645 andy died two days before his 31st birthday on the day we found out i had actually been in town getting his card
4153646 when i got back home i found out he had died its the worst thing in the world no mother should have to bury their son
4153647 it still hasnt fully sunk in i am still in complete shock we still cant believe this has actually happened were devastated
4153648 i cant thank them enough they were absolutely brilliant when they found out about the lack of insurance
4153649 the last thing i said to him like i say to both my sons before they go anywhere is take care and i love you andy told me hed be fine and that he loved me too
4153650 that is a real comfort to know that was the last thing we said because you can take it for granted that you can just talk to them and cuddle them whenever you want
4153651 that is one of the most distasteful aspects of this whole case
4153652 scott jenkins made a comment saying for f sake check out that its like a badly packed kebab
4153653 he is under no illusions of the gravity of the offence of which he was convicted and presents himself as genuinely regretful
4153654 he takes responsibility for his actions accepts such behaviour cant be tolerated and that miss anderson was right to complain to the police
4153655 doing the right thing when everyone around her was not
4153656 you were only in this ladys presence to help her
4153657 if it was not for the good sense of one of your colleagues to speak out this would have been swept under the carpet and forgotten about
4153658 this is one of the grossest breaches of trust possible
4153659 they told me to wait some more days and then we shall see
4153660 sincerely i dont know what they will reply i dont know where stefano will play next year
4153661 clearly the bologna path is still warm as for the lad it would be an important opportunity that he doesnt want to lose so we are waiting for news from roma
4153662 what we definitely expect for this year is 20 percent plus growth for the industry in emea for software for the years going forward id see substantial growth
4153663 when you come into more difficult economic times you have people saving on big ticket items things like houses and cars and even travel people still want to have fun and spend time at home with their games and their friends

4153672 i believe that besides being an environmentally responsible action large scale renewable energy can provide stable cost effective electric prices far into the future however to facilitate the construction of such projects it is necessary that national grid be compelled to enter into long term contracts in order to provide lower cost financing for these projects such as the wind farm i have proposed
4153673 i was forced to veto the bill passed by the house and senate because it was fatally flawed renewable energy projects guaranteed by our ratepayers should be located in rhode island and also be cost effective and should not allow national grid to reap great monetary benefits without taking any risk
4153674 yes i enjoyed both camps i was able to spend some time with alabama coaches and i had a good time at the camp

4153676 ive havent gotten any new offers ive been offered by alabama ole miss usm and mississippi state
4153677 i would say that auburn and louisiana lafayette are both close to offering i really think auburn is close they send me a lot of mail
4153678 alabama is recruiting me the hardest they send me something everyday and i like their coaches a lot
4153679 weve talked about it i think wed both like to do that but we have to do whats best for us but we would both love to play together at the next level
4153680 no but i have a top three alabama ole miss and usm are my top three

4153690 ive always felt a sense of security and comfort putting my thoughts on paper unloading what occupies the mind and heart even can be quite liberating also the fact that the paper has no capacity to complain or whine over the whole drama is a plus right now id like to regard this conventional blogging as a venue where i put random mature thoughts that i have in the here and now though i still feel every inch of an 18 year old on the inside the outside doesnt quite follow unfortunately as it somewhat journeyed on its own to the inescapable aging degenerating lane lately ive come quite used to the fact that i already get achy joints here and there when i walk for 10 hours in a mall when i can do 12 hours before without feeling tired and hungry so my body is not what it used to be thanks to gravity and free radicals that we really get for free literally i e pollution but i think whats essential is that the state of mind stays young and positive and all else will follow you may have streaks of gray hair but it can look good on you if you carry it well it really depends on how one goes about something talk about right approach it makes a whole lot of difference
4153691 israel should be proud of its military which trained georgian soldiers

4153701 ive been searching and it seems that pantheistic monism cannot be proven through logic it turns into a self refuting statement because you say that you cannot arrive at proof through this conclusion through logic arent you using logic to come up with that very statement
4153702 i have a manifest nature for i experience a world of shapes and forms
4153703 i have an unmanifest nature for i am also the formless unborn awareness in which the manifest world appears
4153704 im struggling with anything that doesnt promote dualism i think pantheistic monism does become real if you dont transition into the physical life however the physical life still exists just as much as the spiritual oneness exists
4153705 be sure to leave a quarter on the back of the toilet when youre done
4153706 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
4153707 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
4153708 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
4153709 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
4153710 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
4153711 we need to re balance the education system so that we can maintain the academic rigour yet at the same time create space and structure for the school to achieve these other aspects and impart values
4153712 one of the things i hope wont happen is that those ideas after implementation will not be lost because sometimes when it goes down the next level it may become another set of goals another set of numbers
4153713 we demand a series of reasonable complementary measures if the return of income tax is inevitable
4153714 in addition the monthly subsidies for homeroom teaching should be increased by nt 2 000

4153717 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
4153718 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

4153724 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4153725 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4153726 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4153727 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4153728 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4153729 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4153730 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4153731 we are very excited to have scott on board because he brings exactly the right expertise to lead this forward thinking project through its implementation stage and beyond
4153732 minutes before the official announcement of pope benedicts election cardinal macharski points to the liberal reporters assembled in st

4153735 does tenna coles say what god does exactly to put food on the table
4153736 now shes talking to me like im addled and im starting to feel righteous indignation on the behalf of the people who did provide this food one of whom was
4153737 someone grew this out of the ground lets thank that person even though we dont know them
4153738 someone took care of it until it was ready to be picked an actual person picked this out of the ground and put it in a bag
4153739 and someone took it to a store where we could buy it
4153740 the nice boy who lets me help he sold it to us
4153741 and then we took it home and you cooked it and put it on a plate
4153742 and now youre shelling them so you can eat them so thank yourself too
4153743 if you think youre a senior you are a senior
4153744 george bernard shaw considered saint joan to be his greatest work and its easy to see why and theatre albas production imaginatively directed by charles nowosielski sees the actors add to this in a stunning loch side setting
4153745 thanks to safer vehicles aggressive law enforcement and our efforts countless families were spared the devastating news that a loved one was not coming home last year
4153746 you can be sure that were not stopping here the quest is not over until that bottom line number is zero
4153747 as these new statistics show we are making progress but far too many of our friends neighbors and family members are still getting killed or seriously injured
4153748 credit is not bad its bad if you use it badly i encourage people to look at it as a tool that they manage you can get good rates rewards frequent flier miles you use it dont let it use you
4153749 the most important thing to improve your score is to have a credit card an installment loan is a fixed payment and you dont have to manage surprises
4153750 a credit card is self managed and you decide how much you charge each month how close you get to your limit whether you let it grow each month or pay it off
4153751 at 600 to 620 it would mean a higher fee up to around 700 and above that no additional fee
4153752 a 20 000 limit over several cards with just 4 000 charged is better than one card with a 5 000 limit with the same 4 000 charged you want to show youre not charging up to the max
4153753 many inquiries in a short period of time might suggest you are trying to take on large amounts of debt both issues are signs of risk
4153754 as long as its on the credit report whether its open or closed low balance or no balance or old or new if its on the report the score is going to count it when counting that mix or when looking at the ideal number of cards closing it is never going to help your score
4153755 so many people are using credit to live beyond their means
4153756 in an ideal world everybody would pay in full and youd use your credit card for convenience there are times when it is neat to be able to use credit where you can spend more than you pay in one month or at holidays or for emergency but youve got to stop and create a plan to get it paid back it keeps your revolving balance low
4153757 manage your debt so that 28 percent of gross monthly income is your housing payment 38 percent for all payments to creditors
4153758 he has no idea of the hurt hes put my family through no idea at all
4153759 i think thats why he decided to get the needle because he cant stand it anymore this is a way out for him
4153760 theres no sense of joy what so ever it brings back those emotions that we through on december 24th
4153761 we played like we wanted to win we played together
4153762 we were very aware of their offensive sets we were very aware of their personnel and we played like that so we were kind of a step in front of what they wanted to do because we kind of knew everything already
4153763 any time you get beat its embarrassing and thats enough
4153764 and we can really use that as a tool to help us with our defense now and thats the name of the game because if you play good defense no matter how youre shooting the ball youre going to be in the game

4153770 the mpc has considered the recent economic developments and the outlook for inflation and has concluded that the repurchase rate will for now remain unchanged at 12 percent per annum
4153771 while there are clear signs that the economy is responding to the less accommodative monetary policy stance the mpc had to assess whether recent monetary policy actions are sufficient to bring inflation back to within the inflation target range over medium term
4153772 in trying to account for these changes certain assumptions have to be made and the central forecast is therefore additional uncertainty
4153773 cpix inflation is expected to peak at an average rate of around 13 percent in the third quarter of 2008 compared to 12 percent
4153774 this means that the inflation is expected to decline significantly in the first quarter of 2009 partly as a result of the re weighting and re basing effects
4153775 if the current oil price and exchange rate levels are maintained a further sizeable decline can be expected in september
4153776 it is a positive development for business and consumer confidence
4153777 although the short term inflation trends suggest that inflation will get worse before it gets better recent economic evidence indicates the medium term inflation has improved considerably
4153778 the repo rate was expected to remain the same due to factors like oil and food showing some relief
4153779 fuel on the other hand is coming down which we believe that it will play a major role in reducing the effects of inflation
4153780 people still need to be educated about using credit cards as credit contributes to the inflation rate banks on the other hand lure people into using credit cards and increase their debt which leads to consumers going deeper in debt

4153827 we expect higher balance borrowers to receive both rate relief and increased liquidity as was desired in the legislation while retaining the overall liquidity of the tba market

4153829 we expect the market to smoothly digest the change made under the new sifma guidelines and continue to provide liquid and efficient pricing for mortgage securities

4153892 ian struggled in the first inning but after that he started to throw the ball well
4153893 ian is getting better but he still suffers from those lapses and they seem to come in the first inning once he gets through that first inning hes ok
4153894 when we send him out there we know we have a good chance to win
4153895 hes been throwing the ball pretty well and obviously we like the guy because we traded for him
4153896 hes a big league hitter and hes become a very good situational hitter
4153897 and i think the other thing that hes done the last couple of months is work the count in his favor hes not afraid to spit on pitches and hes not reluctant to hit with two strikes i think thats the sign of a guy that is real confident
4153898 anytime you can get to them early thats how you beat those guys
4153899 were in a better place wednesday than we were tuesday thats what we got to keep focusing on weve got an opportunity to win the series
4153900 ill be out there im not one to miss starts
4153901 lets not talk about that and just hope it continues
4153902 we had seven quality at bats wednesday in 32 plate appearances we have to swing at better pitches thats pathetic
4153903 when you have seven quality at bats in 32 plate appearances youre not going to beat anybody much less a first place team
4153904 i didnt have a good feel for anything thats a frustrating feeling
4153905 ive never seen anything like it but ill take it
4153906 thats the sign of a good team taking advantage of your opportunities
4153907 the guy throws strikes he moves it around the zone
4153908 his command was good again tonight thats what moehler has to do and thats what hes been doing
4153909 i want to go out there and give us a chance to win
4153910 we dont have a lot of wins when im out there but i dont think ive had too many starts i dont think where we didnt have a chance to win
4153911 its important to focus on the present this is a young team but weve behaved maturely and it happened naturally were able to handle things
4153912 this is dangerous because were doing just enough to lose right now
4153913 thats not good we have to start doing the things that it takes to win
4153914 its kind of like a day off but not really
4153915 it just kind of gives the legs a break trying to get back instead of overworking them and trying to do too much
4153916 i didnt know when i was coming back but im happy that im back here now im just ready to get after it again
4153917 he comes to play hard he come up with big hits
4153918 you take a young pitching staff and put it up against the boston red sox and they are a team that knows how to make you work and knows how to take advantage of mistakes
4153919 now hes confident hes attacking the zone it makes it a lot easier for us behind him
4153920 if this doesnt help our confidence i dont know what will
4153921 hes an asset to any lineup hes definitely an asset to ours
4153922 we needed to have an offensive night like this that is huge for us

4153982 mobile operators in most of the world charge users to send updates
4153983 our challenge during this window of time was to establish relationships with mobile operators around the world such that our sms services could become sustainable from a cost perspective
4153984 we achieved this goal in canada india and the us we can provide full incoming and outgoing sms service without passing along operator fees in these countries
4153985 in countries like canada or the us where wi fi and internet access is fairly ubiquitous at this point sms is less of an issue for twitter users
4153986 there is an opportunity now for twitter to forge an alliance with a mobile operator that is switched on to the fact that twitter is the new text message
4153987 everyone understands that as a business twitter needs to make money in the same way that people are happy that google does search ads they want twitter to make money because they are fans of the system

4153990 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
4153991 were really excited about shifting the world to a new era where a roman inspired empire rises as the arch enemy of the overlord which leads to an epic clash between the regimented forces of a sprawling state and the faster harder more manic minion horde
4153992 but we now know that these other planetary systems dont look like the solar system at all
4153993 the shapes of the exoplanets orbits are elongated not nice and circular planets are not where we expect them to be many giant planets similar to jupiter known as hot jupiters are so close to the star they have orbits of mere days clearly we needed to start fresh in explaining planetary formation and this greater variety of planets we now see
4153994 such a turbulent history would seem to leave little room for the sedate solar system and our simulations show exactly that
4153995 conditions must be just right for the solar system to emerge
4153996 we now better understand the process of planet formation and can explain the properties of the strange exoplanets weve observed
4153997 we also know that the solar system is special and understand at some level what makes it special
4153998 the solar system had to be born under just the right conditions to become this quiet place we see the vast majority of other planetary systems didnt have these special properties at birth and became something very different
4153999 look sms is great in that it connects so many people around the world but the fees associated with it are an absolute joke its a very small amount of data yet carriers seem to think its okay to charge an arm and a leg for it
4154000 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
4154001 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4154002 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
4154003 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
4154004 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
4154005 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
4154006 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
4154007 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
4154008 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
4154009 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4154010 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent

4154024 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
4154025 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
4154026 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4154027 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4154028 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4154029 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
4154030 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
4154031 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
4154032 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
4154033 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
4154034 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4154035 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
4154036 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
4154037 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
4154038 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
4154039 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
4154040 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
4154041 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
4154042 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
4154043 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
4154044 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
4154045 unabashedly spiritual before it was admitted in polite company that progressives could be spiritual
4154046 she was hanging on for dear life from then on
4154047 in the theater of pain dona was an accomplished actress
4154048 when dona was born i thought she was the cutest little baby
4154049 she loved animals the kittens the dogs the puppies that we had over the years someone once traced our family tree all the way back to mayor dick whittington of london who had a cat it might benefit anyone in their quest for political office to go to the animal shelter and pick up a cat or a dog
4154050 but most of all she loved the city of berkeley with its climate of free speech and the political activism
4154051 i was proud of her five successful campaigns for the district 4 city council seat she once took a controversial political stand for which she received a death threat but i think she was right
4154052 it didnt matter to her what power it was we all knew how courageous she was when dona started fighting for the i 80 bridge i thought it would never happen but she doggedly pursued it until one day i was present at the groundbreaking
4154053 for the past 27 years i have had the great privilege to be donas companion and primary caregiver but in recent years it would not have been possible without a team of caregivers
4154054 dona did not want the public to know of her pain she was becoming increasingly quadriplegic but could still remember names and faces to an uncanny detail she would tell me could you call so and so and tell them such and such at this number even if she hadnt met the person in 10 years she loved life to the fullest and although she had many fears she refused to let any of those stop her of course she was not perfect no saint is
4154055 dona dreamed big but also dealt with the day to day stuff
4154056 she probably had more requests for neighborhood services than any other councilmember in the city whether it was traffic disputes or taking care of services for the elderly and the disabled today we finally have a site for the citys animal shelter because of her
4154057 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4154058 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4154059 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
4154060 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
4154061 hello you gave us the right to act and we did
4154062 however as far as i know it is a basic principle of the peacekeeping strategy that the peacekeeper should not be a neighbor who is directly a party in that conflict
4154063 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
4154064 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
4154065 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
4154066 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
4154067 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
4154068 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
4154069 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4154070 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4154071 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
4154072 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
4154073 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
4154074 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
4154075 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
4154076 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
4154077 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
4154078 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
4154079 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
4154080 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
4154081 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
4154082 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
4154083 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
4154084 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
4154085 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
4154086 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
4154087 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
4154088 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
4154089 if a heart is restarted the person from whom it was taken cannot have been dead according to cardiac criteria
4154090 removing organs from a patient whose heart not only can be restarted but also has been or will be restarted in another body is ending a life by organ removal
4154091 under current law it is not possible to procure a transplantable heart after cardiac death
4154092 if this was to become standard procedure then it could single handedly get rid of the problem of death on the waiting list
4154093 any program committed to transplantation deals with the tragedy of losing a child waiting for a heart
4154094 there is a primal fear people have of being declared dead wrongly
4154095 faced with that kind of issue i think physicians and transplant enterprises need to be mindful to reassure skeptical people that there will be no instance in which surgeons will procure organs from someone before they are dead
4154096 in recent communications she reported that she was very happy there was enjoying her work liked and respected the people whom she met and with whom she worked and was happy to be in a position where she could help others
4154097 we warmly recalled nicoles sense of humor her vitality her contagious laughter her ability to remain cool under stress and her personal vision of wanting to make a difference in the world we were somewhat comforted knowing that she was where she wanted to be and doing what she wanted to do
4154098 i see absolutely no reason for that and its silly
4154099 two judges have already found hes violated conditions of his bond
4154100 this is the first time a judge has stood up for him
4154101 there was never a dispute about travel restrictions and a tether as a condition of bond for our two felony charges
4154102 testing for tickets is one creative way to address the disease specifically the age group between 15 to 30 years of age
4154103 people can learn their status then be proactive about maintaining a healthy lifestyle taking preventive measures and becoming more informed about the social and medical services available for treatment this initiative is part of our teen summit program that we kicked off last year
4154104 as always he is holding his cards close and waiting for more information
4154105 yet another experiment that tells us quantum mechanics is right
4154106 really is an intrinsic connection between entangled particles not that some signal passes quickly between them when an observation is performed
4154107 i am sure we are not finished unveiling what the quantum effects due to entanglement really are and how powerful they can be
4154108 hes the only player in portugal who played for benfica but was also admired by fans of every other team including porto and sporting
4154109 i have memories from when i was little and my father played in the portuguese national team with eusebio my father was the first goalkeeper in portugal to save a penalty from eusebio eusebio was born on 25 january and i was born on 26 january for me hes a special person
4154110 from a professional point of view tomorrow will be an important chance for the team to improve but from a personal perspective it will have special significance as it is a return to portugal to play for a trophy dedicated to eusebio
4154111 eusebio played in the national team for many years and hes still close to the national team now
4154112 when we decided to plan our summer fixtures with the president massimo moratti and decided to play against benfica he remembered the 1965 european cup final in which inter beat the portuguese
4154113 the president also told me how at one point his father angelo was close to bringing eusebio to inter
4154114 it will be very exciting for everyone for us portuguese who return home to face benfica and for the president who will certainly remember that beautiful time in inters history
4154115 unlike at club level at national level you dont have the luxury of having your players day in and day out
4154116 we must remain focused that our main objective is to deliver a world class team for the 2010 world cup
4154117 other patrons may have inferred that the man was trying to assault the female
4154118 we have a useful instrument for regulating access and gathering statistics of all traffic flow monitoring and preventing irregular actions but the usefulness of the installation goes beyond just security it fosters better logistics in the port visitors and professionals have changed their attitude towards safety procedures with the awareness of the video surveillance system that ensures monitoring 24 7 of the whole port area for example many adopt correct work behavior they now always wear helmets and most of the moving vehicles stay within the established speed limits
4154119 to protect the dock i wanted a mixed solution to take advantage of the zooming and detailing functionalities of speed domes without having to give up the ability to follow events with 360 degree cameras with fixed optics
4154120 they are not willing to give me a longer contract yet so ive got no option but to get my head down and play for fulham
4154121 lets get one thing straight i have always wanted to sign for fulham and i still have two years here anyway
4154122 there will hopefully come a time when we can sort something out about extending it
4154123 im not saying it wont be as strong but it will never be the same
4154124 i get a different style of movement from it now as the ligaments are different
4154125 the first three or four games back last season it was strange but now im used to it
4154126 we can accept the loss as steaua are much further in front of us in terms of preparation and fitness
4154127 the main reason for the defeat was the mentality we had when we went out on the pitch
4154128 after three years we roma are still committing the same errors and its annoying because we are always trying to find the solutions
4154129 he has coached consistently since the 80s and we find him motivated for success
4154130 he may have no previous experience at national team level but he wants to achieve for him and that for us was very important
4154131 he may be unfamiliar to many people but we feel he can do the job he came highly recommended by some of the biggest names in the game
4154132 he will have an understanding of our situation as a developing country and be able to cope with some of the difficulties that comes with working here that other more established coaches may not have been prepared for
4154133 once we have settled on him we will stand by him we think that if we give him the necessary support and provide the right environment we will win together
4154134 what do you have to say about people commenting on your sisters implants
4154135 did you really just ask me that she is a 14 year old girl and you are a pedophile
4154136 of course we have our ups and downs but all in all my mother taught us to appreciate what we have been given
4154137 nor would she ever encourage or allow a 14 year old child to alter her body
4154138 the people who need visas are all now in baku and we expect the foreign office will complete the paperwork first thing on friday morning so we are very optimistic the game will go ahead
4154139 we are in regular contact with both member associations concerned for that match in swansea
4154140 how intelligent a spout that should make it easier to use
4154141 our office has been inundated with calls from people who desperately need advice in managing their financial challenges in an effort to meet callers needs my staff volunteered to change their hours
4154142 our employees have really stepped up to the plate in developing our extended service schedule monday through thursday 8 00 am 10 00pm and friday and saturday 9 00 am to 5 00 pm eastern standard time
4154143 this day is a celebration of our family helping other families throughout america
4154144 cambridge has undergone a lot of changes over the last decade and our employees have hung in there with us this is a small thank you to them and their families for believing in the wonderful work cambridge has done in servicing over 2 million americans in their quest to become debt free
4154145 we strongly urge you to take emergency measures to have it removed expeditiously
4154146 as far back as i can remember ive been a news junkie
4154147 it has only been 10 days but it seems like much longer the experience has been invaluable and my emotions have been on a rollercoaster ride excited scared miserable cold and wet coming back into the solent was an amazing feeling now im all guns blazing for the race in october
4154148 i feel exhausted battered amp bruised the bad weather and strong winds never stopped it was wild but we are fired up for the next race we have learnt a lot about the boat how to cope with certain situations and howling force 8 winds it has been the longest trip we have done to date and quite an eye opener victoria and i make a great team and have learnt to work well together although we were like ships passing through the night only actually spending time on the deck together when we needed to do a sail change
4154149 ho rinunciato a dei soldi per restare conta di pi la felicit
4154150 prima parlavo una volta ogni tre anni ora lo faccio ogni sei mesi mi sento bene anche se sono stanco dopo il test di ieri ma comunque sar pronto per linter
4154151 da quando sono nato vivo cos devo sempre dimostrare in ogni gara qualcosa di diverso dagli altri se sbaglio mi puntano ma non ho paura voglio solo stare bene fisicamente
4154152 il parere determinante stato quello di marotta che ci ha messo il grano qui ho trovato tutto quello che in dieci anni di calcio mi era mancato gente che quando le cose vanno male mi manda un messaggino per tirarmi su il morale dalle altre parti prendevano il fucile e mi buttavano nel burrone voglio ancora rimanerci per tanto alla samp se il direttore mi d via gli metto la gente contro
4154153 mancini lo stato per davvero forse fra sei sette anni potrei avvicinarmi a lui
4154154 se fossimo passati con la spagna ero molto ottimista mi spiace per donadoni che oltre ad essere un grande allenatore pure un grande uomo ha pagato in prima persona aveva tutti contro dal primo giorno lui non filogiornalista
4154155 se prima di cavolate ne facevo dieci al giorno ora sono cinque ma la mia indole non cambiata quando faccio le bizze tirano fuori tutto il mio passato
4154156 arrivato a un certo punto lui voleva cambiare aria ma andato in una squadra che nei prossimi 3 4 anni vincer tutto
4154157 ha pagato in prima persona pure lui dice sempre quello che pensa ma ha fatto vincere tantissimo allinter e stato massacrato dalla stampa e la societ non lo ha tutelato voglio dirgli per che rimane un grande
4154158 siamo competitivi una bella squadra certo che se dai a marotta la met di quello che spende corvino vinciamo tre scudetti consecutivi marotta il cassano dei direttori sportivi
4154159 nellarco di due tre anni mi piacerebbe lottare per la champions sarebbe come vincere un titolo mondiale
4154160 mi interessano poco i gol se mi dicessero che far 40 assist e zero gol andrebbe bene ugualmente
4154161 le sirene non suonano nella mia testa quelle le fai suonare tramite il procuratore quando vuoi bussare cassa il presidente vuole che io rimanga a vita a 31 anni mi scadr il contratto con marotta gi parliamo di allungarlo per altre 3 stagioni poi a 34 anni smetto
4154162 con tutte le cavolate che ho fatto sono andato al real se non fosse successo tutto questo sarei andato a giocare sulla luna da solo
4154163 uno dei tre giocatori pi forti al mondo se ha voglia di giocare non ce n per nessuno la juve un grande gruppo ma ranieri farebbe gi un gran lavoro raggiungendo i quarti di champions
4154164 ha due ciglioni grandi cos si presentato in conferenza stampa parlando italiano se dice che vuole vincere tutto pu farcela
4154165 lo sanno loro che siamo pi forti non dobbiamo mandarglielo a dire quando si avvicina diventano un po bianchi hanno paura
4154166 mi auguro che tu possa stare sempre insieme a carolina perch altrimenti noi ce ne andiamo
4154167 direttore a marotta ridendo n d r facciamo una squadra come si deve

4154173 the club said would you rather go to the world cup and sign an extension with your current club or focus on the future and look to a new club
4154174 i chose the latter and i didnt think i wouldnt play for almost 11 months
4154175 i went for the football and poland and romania gave me the opportunity with the socceroos
4154176 i played regularly in romania and poland at stages and enjoyed my career there

4154191 siento que s lo quieren plata los prefectos opositores y no tocar otros asuntos sin interpretar lo que piensa el pueblo boliviano
4154192 yo llego a la conclusi n de que el pueblo boliviano quiere autonom as quiere una nueva constituci n pol tica del estado
4154193 ahora ning n prefecto puede hablar de dos tercios m s de dos tercios de la gente quiere juntar la nueva constituci n con los estatutos auton micos

4154195 everywhere you turned there were bones belonging to animals that dont live in the desert
4154196 at first glance its hard to imagine two more biologically distinct groups of people burying their dead in the same place
4154197 which suggests he was eating a lot of protein and had an active strenuous lifestyle the kiffian appear to have been fairly healthy it would be difficult to grow a body that tall and muscular without sufficient nutrition
4154198 this mans life was less rigorous perhaps taking smaller fish and game with more advanced hunting technologies
4154199 this small portable laptop performs all the functions like any other laptop the product has been developed after years of research and the main focus was to maintain quality product at extremely economical price we are happy that the market response is great
4154200 everywhere you turned there were bones belonging to animals that dont live in the desert
4154201 at first glance its hard to imagine two more biologically distinct groups of people burying their dead in the same place
4154202 which suggests he was eating a lot of protein and had an active strenuous lifestyle the kiffian appear to have been fairly healthy it would be difficult to grow a body that tall and muscular without sufficient nutrition
4154203 this mans life was less rigorous perhaps taking smaller fish and game with more advanced hunting technologies
4154204 not ready to lead and obama has run a positive national message but also battleground state ads calling mccain like president bush
4154205 put hard working americans first by growing the economy eliminate tax cuts for companies that send jobs overseas create new jobs at home invest in education and cut taxes for working families
4154206 the platforms that nbc has for its exclusive olympics coverage the obama campaign says
4154207 we would not keep flying between scotland and ireland if the business was not there
4154208 no matter what system is used the stocking rate is key
4154209 when considering the number of cow calf pairs a producer can put on summer pasture its important to consider the fewest acres a grazing animal needs to meet performance targets plus the animals performance needs to be balanced with what the pasture requires to maintain a desirable and vigorous plant community
4154210 although continuous grazing has a negative connotation im not convinced its all bad
4154211 it can maximize an animals performance because the animal has the ability to select what it will graze
4154212 in a perfect world 75 to 90 percent rangeland and 10 to 25 percent introduced forages is a good ratio
4154213 sometimes producers wonder if fertilizing native pastureland is a good idea the answer to that is no
4154214 fertilizing tends to promote weed growth and changes the balance of native pasture and weeds in todays economic climate it is certainly not practical
4154215 we have be aware of how we speak observe traditions
4154216 technologies are developing in the hands of producers of fake visas as well
4154217 its like a firework show that doesnt stink smell bad or explode and you can do it inside
4154218 it was an amazing journey i visited forests witnessed illegal and industrial logging toured pulp mills and paper factories and met many inspiring people who explained the environmental and social impacts of paper manufacture and what we can all do to reduce them
4154219 most people think of paper as a harmless natural product but in fact the paper industry causes three times as much climate change emissions as aviation uses more water than any other industrial product as well as threatening forests and human rights in some producer countries
4154220 fortunately there is a lot that we can all do like recycling and reducing junk mail to lessen our paper footprints
4154221 with a satisfying sense of empowerment that you can crack your paper addiction
4154222 ive been writing away for years with no sign of a book and now three have come along at once
4154223 its all based on historic claims in connection with stock that producers had in 2001 and it has not been updated since
4154224 its an unfair system which has not been updated and resurveyed since it started and does not encourage people to increase their stock or start from scratch
4154225 we are hoping there will be another survey soon but it might not be until 2012 meanwhile were stuck with it its far worse than the old subsidy schemes even though this sale is up a few pounds on last year thats not going to help much with all the increasing bills
4154226 my prices were ok for the years work but they could have been better
4154227 my family have been in farming for generations my father had a farm in caithness before we moved to st vincents and we still get our tups from caithness we have very good bloodlines that we want to keep farming gets harder every year but its not the buyers fault its the supermarkets buying it cheap then hiking up the price for the consumer
4154228 i say this every year but im saying it again im relieved my top wethers were up 10 on last year but my top ewes were the same as previously at 60 my second and third draws were down on last year the single farm payment is an awful way of working and its a disgrace that people who give up are still getting it
4154229 the lambs that were in good bloom were up more than others while the smaller lambs were struggling perhaps due to the weather considering the number of dispersals theres been there was still a good show of sheep and plenty of buyers who come from all over the country from caithness to south of carlisle i have to say though that the single farm payment is not encouraging production
4154230 the new leader funds represent a major opportunity for sutherland community projects with worthwhile sums being made available across a wide range of fields
4154231 if a community initiative is accepted for leader funding it could help draw in match funding from other sources thus multiplying the benefits its really up to our community organisations to get cracking and make a case for their projects to receive help from leader
4154232 communities will be important contributors to the success of this new funding opportunity we need people to tell us what they think the priorities are for sutherland and to develop plans for particular projects leader will make worthwhile sums of money available for projects which meet the programmes criteria
4154233 it is a worthwhile sum of money running into several hundreds of thousands over the period to 2013
4154234 it will come on stream as soon as the administrative organisation is set up to disperse the money but that will not happen until october at the earliest the sutherland partnership looks set to be the body which will make decisions on which projects are funded we are making a bid to become that body and i believe our chances are good
4154235 people will have an opportunity to discuss and identify priorities for funding and to comment on a draft plan there will be a brief explanation of the programme and work on the development plan to date
4154236 the survey will enable us to test past employees and their families as well as those residents who had significant exposure to the creek
4154237 the committee will help keep the lines of communication open and ensure that we are responding to local concerns appropriately
4154238 it will also connect us to people who may have had some exposure so that we can ensure the project is comprehensive and complete
4154239 the point and distrac t from the real issue the persistent health disparities faced by women and men in the african american community
4154240 no need to resort to far flung conspiracy theories to explain the higher abortion rate among black women
4154241 those professing concern for the well being of african american women have an obligation to put the issue of abortion in its proper context and to support evidence based policies that would have a positive impact
4154242 number of specific steps policymakers can take right now that could dramatically improve the sexual and reproductive health of african americans and americans in general
4154243 my challenge to antiabortion activists is to stop throwing around inflammatory terms like genocide and instead channel their considerable energies and resources into supporting policies that reduce the need for abortion lets get serious about helping women and their families including women in the african american community
4154244 the results showed that the preferences of women who began using the contraceptive pill shifted towards men with genetically similar odours
4154245 not only could mhc similarity in couples lead to fertility problems but it could ultimately lead to the breakdown of relationships when women stop using the contraceptive pill as odour perception plays a significant role in maintaining attraction to partners
4154246 go ahead and try to wear out the replaced joints
4154247 how much does this pain or discomfort affect your lifestyle
4154248 the clock starts ticking from the moment a person develops symptoms of a heart attack
4154249 the pertinent measure of system performance is from the time of first medical contact with paramedics or other emergency medical personnel to reperfusion therapy reestablishing blood flow to the heart muscle
4154250 if pre hospital ecgs were more widely used and integrated with systems of care the time from first medical contact to balloon reperfusion could be reduced to less than 60 minutes
4154251 furthermore even when a pre hospital ecg is acquired the information is often not translated into effective action to decrease delays in treatment
4154252 it is a lost opportunity to improve the quality of care for stemi patients if the information from a prehospital ecg is not used to change downstream processes of care
4154253 this an extremely rare case of coinfection in a controlled monogamous relationship which showed us how a strong immune system in the elite suppressor kept the virus from replicating and infecting other cells
4154254 our findings offer hope to vaccine researchers because they reveal that the immune systems primary offense known as cd8 killer t cells can effectively halt disease progression by a pathogenic form of hiv
4154255 she was quite overwhelmed she had not been expecting it she said to me afterwards that she had been quite overcome and was on the verge of tears
4154256 she wasnt a regular collector for sutherland caledonian but only did it when they came to dornoch the band felt that they wanted to thank her for the times she had turned out my mum used to run the festival week on her own so it was appropriate that the presentation took place then
4154257 numbers of people flock to visit this long hidden relic of the ancient glory of brora
4154258 while women clearly are concerned about breast cancer roughly one quarter are still not getting annual mammograms and nearly 40 percent arent conducting monthly self exams
4154259 its critically important for women to take charge of their health through these screenings and to understand that survivability is greatly enhanced when breast cancer is found early
4154260 women particularly moms tend to put themselves and their health last and take care of everyone else in their lives first
4154261 the more they learn about their bodies and their risks the more women will understand that protecting themselves with these key steps for prevention and early detection is the most loving thing they can do for their families and themselves
4154262 this finding may yield new insights into a form of altered brain activity occurring in schizophrenia
4154263 it may also lead to new methods for screening drugs with potential as schizophrenia treatments
4154264 its analogous to tuning in the weak signal of a distant station on your car radio as opposed to picking up the strong signal of a station thats nearby
4154265 for the first time we were able to show that neuregulin 1 which has been genetically implicated in schizophrenia affects a brain activity that appears to be altered in schizophrenia
4154266 future studies of brain regions rich in erb4 receptors may yield important information on the nature of schizophrenia
4154267 vitamin d and health in the 21st century an update
4154268 given recent findings its easy to see why people are so enthusiastic about the potential power of vitamin d but we must recognize the limitations of any study and exercise caution when making broad public health recommendations
4154269 this is a very complex set of issues and there is still a lot we dont know about how vitamin d levels affect health especially across different age groups and ethnic populations
4154270 its tempting to think that an essential nutrient is safe at any level that if some is good more is better
4154271 weve learned that this isnt always true and there are potential harms associated with high levels of many nutrients
4154272 in the future as adoption of the technology increases outbound ivr will be commonly used with sms mms emails and direct mail for proactive customer communications
4154273 all those things result in lots of other mechanical parts and bits and pieces that have nothing to do with electrical energy

4154284 the joint business agreement will enable the airlines to reduce costs and attract new customers helping to mitigate pressure on fares from record fuel costs
4154285 this means that the airlines will have greater ability to invest in their products services and fleets employees and shareholders will also benefit from the agreement
4154286 there is no reason why fares should rise if this agreement is approved
4154287 make no mistake if this monster monopoly is approved it will be third time unlucky for consumers
4154288 it will still be bad for passengers bad for competition and bad for the uk and us aviation industry
4154289 under the joint business agreement the three airlines will cooperate commercially on flights between the united states mexico and canada and the european union switzerland and norway while continuing to operate as separate legal entities
4154290 warmly welcomed and strongly supports the application for anti trust immunity
4154291 anti trust immunity between oneworlds transatlantic partners would enable them to unlock even more of oneworlds potential enabling us to operate under the same rules as our alliance competitors
4154292 expand customer choice by supporting routes that would not be economically viable for the individual airlines

4154299 the scope of the school has grown and the business is changing so if were going to prepare people for that bigger and more complicated world that is branding today its probably limiting to think about it just in advertising terms
4154300 i didnt feel pressure before the competition i tried to relax
4154301 and in the race i just swam at my own pace not caring about others my coach said to me that we will have two chinese swimmers in the final so you dont need to force yourself to win gold you just need to try your best
4154302 it was so hard since i lost my first event but i held on
4154303 i would like to thank the spectators volunteers and my family who supported me and encouraged me i was so moved that i knew i could not give up and needed to persevere

4154305 what we definitely expect for this year is 20 percent plus growth for the industry in emea for software for the years going forward id see substantial growth

4154308 the proposal to re engage with the museum was irresistible
4154309 over the next few years other announcements like this will be made
4154310 the qatar national museum is being redesigned by the french architect jean nouvel and then further institutions will be built
4154311 this is the aim but it is not easily achieved as our countrys population is very small however we are asking the british museum to train our docents and we have a long term plan to bring in experts to train interns
4154312 the building has been designed to cater to the specific needs of the region the humidity and the heat and both of these have been carefully monitored
4154313 had asked for the paragraph on apsley house to be included within the exempt unpublished report
4154314 we went through a long path of negotiations until we reached this agreement
4154315 it opens new horizons for relations based on mutual respect the agreement turns the page on the negative past forever
4154316 i would have thought the council would take more care
4154317 i cant believe no one at the town hall noticed
4154318 we accept that the wrong photo was used but the text and detail contained in the leaflet is wholly correct
4154319 wahai sekalian manusia bertakwalah kepada allah dan perbaguslah usaha mencari rezeki karena jiwa tidak akan mati sampai sempurna rezekinya walaupun kadang agak tersendat sendat maka bertakwalah kepada allah dan perbaguslah dalam mengusahakannya ambillah yang halal dan buanglah yang haram
4154320 sesungguhnya allah taala itu baik tidak menerima kecuali yang baik dan bahwa allah memerintahkan kepada orang orang mukmin dengan apa yang diperintahkannya kepada para rasul dalam firman nya
4154321 hai rasul rasul makanlah dari makanan yang baik baik dan kerjakanlah amal shalih sesungguhnya aku maha mengetahui apa yang kamu kerjakan
4154322 hai orang orang yang beriman makanlah di antara rezki yang baik baik yang kami berikan kepadamu
4154323 ya rabb ya rabb sedang makanannya haram minumannya haram pakaiannya haram ia kenyang dengan makanan yang haram maka bagaimana mungkin orang tersebut dikabulkan permohonannya
4154324 aku tidak mengangkat sesuap makanan ke mulutku kecuali aku mengetahui dari mana datangnya dan dari mana ia keluar

4154336 as a scientist medical or mental health professional i agree with the following conclusions about abortion
4154337 some women come to regret their choice to abort the infant life they once created and sustained severe depression and loss of esteem can follow
4154338 it is time for the world to hear the truth about our pain abortion hurts women and we will be silent no more
4154339 description of all known medical risks of the procedure and statistically significant risk factors to which the pregnant woman would be subjected including i depression and related psychological distress ii increased risk of suicide ideation and suicide
4154340 healthcare professionals who assess or refer women who are requesting an abortion should assess for mental disorder and for risk factors that may be associated with its subsequent development
4154341 the royal college of psychiatrists recognizes that good practice in relation to abortion will include informed consent consent cannot be informed without the provision of adequate and appropriate information regarding the possible risks and benefits to physical and mental health
4154342 a portion of this needs to be adopted as an emergency so we can begin collection and stabilize where we are
4154343 id love to see a point where roe is irrelevant and could be repealed because abortion is no longer necessary but certainly in the short term or even the long term i would not support repeal of roe v wade which would then force x number of women in america to undergo illegal and dangerous operations
4154344 recognize d differing views on this question among americans in general and in our own party
4154345 i dont know enough about it to give you an informed answer
4154346 judicial advisory board is chock full of pro lifers as well
4154347 believe it or not the cover would have done better if they used that cute shiloh picture on the top right where shes holding one of the twins
4154348 well maybe brad and angelina can finally take a break from adopting and having kids they certainly wont be receiving this amount of money the next time

4154371 just a few minutes ago they russians entered poti in tanks
4154372 some of the guys have blue signs badges which means they should be peacekeepers
4154373 yesterday they came to the commercial port but today they only came to the military port to the coast guard area
4154374 people are afraid to go in there it might be mined
4154375 there are no russian armour or troops in the city of poti now
4154376 i think what they did was blow them up with some explosives
4154377 if ahmadinejad does not accept the accord on which agreement was reached the accord will not be signed during this visit
4154378 the united sates is now accepting musharrafs removal as a fait accompli
4154379 they just want that he should not be humiliated we dont want his humiliation either
4154380 they are saying if you do it according to the book its none of our business they have pushed against musharraf
4154381 but no one is actually in the mood to see what it is going to be like to be in the post musharraf era
4154382 there was never any direction by the governor never any direction by todd to make the call or to make any call to dps on this stuff
4154383 todd and sarah are scratching their heads why on earth hasnt why is this guy still representing the department hes a horrible recruiting tool you know i mean from their perspective everyones protecting him
4154384 its embarrassing for me to disclose at this time a conversation has occurred again unbeknownst to me
4154385 ultimately i think mr branchflower will focus on two or three people but its really up to him to decide
4154386 from that point on ive had a concern this person could fly off the handle and do something terrible to the governor to her family or to the public
4154387 i cannot stress enough that they have never asked me to follow up on this its never been implied nothing like that
4154388 the serial nature of the contacts understandably could be perceived as some kind of pressure presumably at my direction

4154401 he had the hours in the hot seat during the relevant times we looked at the records when he was at work and when he would have had time to drive to princeton n j
4154402 and its clear from those records that he had time on the relevant occasions to drive to princeton mail the envelopes and come back theres also evidence ill refer you to in the affidavits concerning where that mailbox was located in princeton n j in relation to some obsessive conduct on his part with regard to a sorority again its a chain its a chain of evidentiary items that assembled together leads to one reasonable conclusion and that is dr ivins mailed that anthrax in those envelopes from that mailbox in princeton

4154464 during the recent operations in basra sadr city and maysan iraqi troops uncovered convincing evidence that iranian lethal aid has continued to flow into iraq
4154465 whereas iran has proved time and again its good intention to help iraqs stabilisation development and prosperity through close cooperation with the iraqi government in different fields as well as to help iraqi people overcome their immense difficulties the u s government unwarrantedly insists on its unacceptable behaviour in scape goating others including iran for its own wrong policies in iraq
4154466 the continuation of the presence of foreign forces in the country and certain wring policies and practices on the part of foreign forces there
4154467 there is a mechanism which is agreed between iraq and these countries on what these countries can do through the meeting of interior ministers of these countries through the expanded neighbouring countries conferences which took place in kuwait and anther one that is going to take place in jordan in fall
4154468 we are going to continue these negotiations through diplomatic channels
4154469 we hope that any improvement in the relationship between iran and the u s will help the situation in iraq
4154470 it is noteworthy that despite these groundless allegations to date no single credible evidence has ever been presented to substantiate them
4154471 to the contrary several high ranking iraqi officials are on record stressing irans constructive role in the country and rejecting the solid allegation
4154472 the united states accuses iran because the two countries have as yet not resolved their outstanding disputes
4154473 the accusation is designed to stem irans rising regional influence which the u s itself helped to enhance by overthrowing two of the islamic republics most implacable enemies the taliban and saddam hussein regimes
4154474 in addition during these operations numerous jish al mahdi militia fighters and leaders of jish al mahdi associated highly trained special groups fled to iran where they received sanctuary
4154475 as far as the u s is concerned the accusation has the advantage of undermining irans image in the eyes of iraqi shiites by blaming iran for the nefarious activities of the discredited elements in the mahdi army
4154476 the allegations are also designed to provide credence for americas narrative that depicts iran as a deceitful untrustworthy and hypocritical power which while professing to support the central government in baghdad trains funds and arms iraqi prime minister nouri enemies
4154477 irans role in iraq is a by product of u s iran relations
4154478 when u s iran relations have stalled irans role in iraq would likely be unconstructive and when u s iran relations are cooperative then irans role in iraq might be cooperative it doesnt necessarily mean that the u s has to pull out from iraq
4154479 the security situation has improved not simply because of the surge but because of a host of other factors including the successful completion of ethnic cleansing in key areas and americas success in buying off former sunni insurgents
4154480 economic conditions the improving performance of the iraqi military the decision on the part of iran to lend greater support to the iraqi central government instead of shiite militias as well as blunders on the part of al qaeda and setbacks suffered by moqtada al sadr

4154485 a police officer could do the same thing with his or her own eyes
4154486 it helps to cut down on the number of police officers who would have to be out tracking particular cars
4154487 while it may be true that police can conduct surveillance of people on a public street without violating their rights tracking a person everywhere they go and keeping a computer record of it for days and days without that person knowing is a completely different type of intrusion

4154559 katzer and kamind admitted that they copied the decoder definition files from the decoderpro software they also admitted that they stripped out the jmri credit information and comment fields the information removed from each copied file includes references to the copyright owner author copyright date and information about the artistic license therefore katzer and kamind violated the artistic license by not including standard versions of the executable files not explaining where to get the standard version and not indicating how the decoder definition files were changed
4154560 katzer concedes for the purposes of this appeal that jacobsen is the owner or assignee of the copyright and that katzer downloaded modified and distributed the decoder definition files however jacobsen has failed to show that katzer has infringed one of jacobsens exclusive copyright rights as a threshold matter jacobsens attempt to use federal copyright law to enforce that terms of the artistic license that require that the jmri group receive credit or attribution in derivative works is misplaced copyright law as it is presently written does not recognize a cause of action for non economic rights
4154561 the jmri project license provides that a user may copy the files verbatim or may otherwise modify the material in any way including as part of a larger possibly commercial software distribution
4154562 the license explicitly gives the users of the material any member of the public the right to use and distribute the material in a more or less customary fashion plus the right to make reasonable accommodations the scope of the nonexclusive license is therefore intentionally broad the condition that the user insert a prominent notice of attribution does not limit the scope of the license rather defendants alleged violation of the conditions of the license may have constituted a breach of the nonexclusive license but does not create liability for copyright infringement where it would not otherwise exist
4154563 traditionally copyright owners sold their copyrighted material in exchange for money the lack of money changing hands in open source licensing should not be presumed to mean that there is no economic consideration however there are substantial benefits including economic benefits to the creation and distribution of copyrighted works under public licenses that range far beyond traditional license royalties for example program creators may generate market share for their programs by providing certain components free of charge similarly a programmer or company may increase its national or international reputation by incubating open source projects improvement to a product can come rapidly and free of charge from an expert not even known to the copyright holder the eleventh circuit has recognized the economic motives inherent in public licenses even where profit is not immediate
4154564 in non technical terms the court has held that free licenses such as the creative commons licenses set conditions rather than covenants on the use of copyrighted work
4154565 when you violate the condition the license disappears meaning youre simply a copyright infringer this is the theory of the general public license and all cc licenses put precisely whether or not they are also contracts they are copyright licenses which expire if you fail to abide by the terms of the license
4154566 although there will be some further proceedings this is a huge step forward for us the appellate judges have ruled that when katzer took jmri files modified them and distributed them as if there were his own he was violating copyright law and we can hold him accountable
4154567 if colin cameron were here this wouldnt have happened he would have found a different way to survive

4154641 the thing we always have problems with in small businesses is cash flow sometimes it is a good month sometimes it is not a good month so many small businesses are very pragmatic and have cost effective advertising strategies
4154642 indonesia is an important market for us in asia and its important for us to help small businesses understand that adwords is a great platform to advertise their businesses online
4154643 google adwords is one of the most cost effective and highly targeted online advertising platforms available today
4154644 theres no minimum spending requirement or time commitment and with the cost per click option youre only charged if people click on your ads this means every dollar of your budget goes toward bringing new prospects to you
4154645 one thing is for sure more and more people are coming online we are lucky because we are not immediately after revenue this is not about revenue generation this is about educating the indonesian market about opportunities
4154646 with a minimum bid of rp 90 per click and where impressions are free google adwords helps small and medium businesses with traditionally small advertising budgets to target and find relevant customers online through our ad network which reaches 78 percent of internet users globally
4154647 weve also found that most indonesians turn to the internet to search for information before making a purchasing decision

4154652 ich fahre nicht so oft und wenn dann sehr langsam
4154653 we see them generally complying and moving back into a position where they can make their exit in an orderly fashion
4154654 in the days and weeks ahead the department of defense will re examine the entire gamut of our military to military relationship with russia and will make changes as necessary and appropriate depending on russian forces
4154655 that certainly is not our desire i think frankly we have been pretty restrained in this and i would say beginning with my remarks at the vercunda conference a year ago february where now prime minister putins speech was regarded by virtually everyone there as very aggressive we have tried not to respond in that manner i think what happens in the days and months to come will determine the future course of u s russian relations
4154656 thanks to safer vehicles aggressive law enforcement and our efforts countless families were spared the devastating news that a loved one was not coming home last year
4154657 you can be sure that were not stopping here the quest is not over until that bottom line number is zero
4154658 as these new statistics show we are making progress but far too many of our friends neighbors and family members are still getting killed or seriously injured
4154659 credit is not bad its bad if you use it badly i encourage people to look at it as a tool that they manage you can get good rates rewards frequent flier miles you use it dont let it use you
4154660 the most important thing to improve your score is to have a credit card an installment loan is a fixed payment and you dont have to manage surprises
4154661 a credit card is self managed and you decide how much you charge each month how close you get to your limit whether you let it grow each month or pay it off
4154662 at 600 to 620 it would mean a higher fee up to around 700 and above that no additional fee
4154663 a 20 000 limit over several cards with just 4 000 charged is better than one card with a 5 000 limit with the same 4 000 charged you want to show youre not charging up to the max
4154664 many inquiries in a short period of time might suggest you are trying to take on large amounts of debt both issues are signs of risk
4154665 as long as its on the credit report whether its open or closed low balance or no balance or old or new if its on the report the score is going to count it when counting that mix or when looking at the ideal number of cards closing it is never going to help your score
4154666 so many people are using credit to live beyond their means
4154667 in an ideal world everybody would pay in full and youd use your credit card for convenience there are times when it is neat to be able to use credit where you can spend more than you pay in one month or at holidays or for emergency but youve got to stop and create a plan to get it paid back it keeps your revolving balance low
4154668 manage your debt so that 28 percent of gross monthly income is your housing payment 38 percent for all payments to creditors

4154672 where there is enough evidence to charge someone with a crime we vigorously prosecute
4154673 but not every wrong or even every violation of the law is a crime in this instance the two joint reports found only violations of the civil service laws
4154674 unfair and quite possibly illegal given their civil service protections to fire them or to reassign them without individual cause
4154675 attorney general says breaking civil service law isnt a crime wha

4154679 its a very seminal period an opportunity to both celebrate 20 years of content and the fact that the source was a leader in chronicling the culture of hip hop
4154680 im on a mission to restore it to the community that gave birth to it and open the door to those that currently enjoy and influence that hip hop culture
4154681 its exciting because we believe that we can do it
4154682 we shared with him what we were trying to do the vision of hip hop and where we thought it needed to go and he thought it was refreshing and clever
4154683 were just going to expand on what the source has always done well
4154684 a core focus but not 80 percent of the book
4154685 i think that what were trying to do is evolve it as hip hop has evolved and become an international force to evolve it without losing its core essence that was the centerpiece of its earliest beginnings and greatness but it has to evolve just like hip hop has to evolve
4154686 it is a force nobody can deny the force or the power of the source but is it the same as it was five years ago no
4154687 it does not deliver with the same punch that it used to
4154688 if they are true to the dna of the publication
4154689 it left off so much of what is the key ingredients of hip hop and lifestyle now which is lifestyle fashion online new media international aspects of how people embrace content
4154690 if anything we want to restore it restore it to greatness and its no 1 spot
4154691 you kind of either just look around and laugh or just like enjoy it
4154692 were in awe its a whirlwind and were happy to be on the ride
4154693 for us having this album finally hit stores and having them sing the songs knowing that they can actually hear them and have it in their possession is the most amazing thing for us were so excited
4154694 they really in the last year kicked into high gear with coming to the shows following the music and continuing to talk about it online
4154695 the online thing has been really big for us the youtube videos the myspace all of that but for us all of them outside make it all possible
4154696 weve been here since monday afternoon at twelve so weve been camping out all night and it was so cold when it hit 3 a m
4154697 we just kept on hanging on cause we love the jonas brothers so much well do anything for them
4154698 maybe one day id write a song and somebody would sing it and then no one would really know that i wrote it
4154699 it would be kind of exciting and i had heard that prince did that and it was just kind of a goal for me
4154700 that is the feeling i have been looking for and it feels very good
4154701 i said to him for todays competition just let it go
4154702 you are out there by yourself if you think about competing with others that is when the mental mistakes can happen because you are not so strong psychologically
4154703 i was in very good shape back then if i couldnt win a gold then i thought i could never get a gold extra training would not have had an effect
4154704 hes been encouraging me saying you didnt win but this does not mean you cannot win in 2008
4154705 its going to be really tough to catch yang wei
4154706 anyone who knows me knows in the all around i once had a failure in the very first apparatus and then did well to catch up i also have done very well for the first five events then failed in the last
4154707 i prepared for any difficulties and expect any difficulties i will never give up
4154708 the market is probably a little bit disenchanted with the fact that theres been no follow through and it certainly feels like we maybe in for a bit of a consolidative pull back type of move now
4154709 there are general concerns about weakening global growth and of course we got more of that today in european gdp for the second quarter
4154710 das ist die androhung einer bernahme die freundlich aussehen soll
4154711 einmal mehr hat swiss life bewiesen dass sie irrational entscheidungen treffen wenn sie in besitz von bargeld sind
4154712 dies war notwendig damit wir auch nach au en unsere linie glaubhaft vertreten k nnen dass es auf bundesebene keine b ndnisse mit der linkspartei geben wird
4154713 bei uns wird diskutiert dass man sich auf bestimmte eckpunkte einigen sollte
4154714 possibly the best written and most intelligent news program ever
4154715 nobody is saying that dangerous drugs should be sold legally to anyone who wants them at whatever price
4154716 but we should learn from other countries that have reduced the criminal penalties that they use for drug users without increasing drug problems
4154717 theres a system in place in portugal whereby anyone caught in possession of less than 10 days supply of any drug cocaine heroin and cannabis are not prosecuted criminally but they are referred to civil panels that can put in place civil penalties but their main aim is to dissuade people from future drug use
4154718 there is no evidence at all that using less of a criminal approach has increased its use
4154719 the proportion of people that have taken illegal drugs in the age group 16 25 is just over half
4154720 drug use has become the normalised activity for young people in this country not all drug users are criminals in other ways
4154721 this argument about sending messages has been often used in drug policies there is no evidence at all that people listen to the messages that drug laws send out
4154722 we have no intention of either decriminalising or legalising currently controlled drugs for recreational purposes drugs are controlled for good reason they are harmful to health
4154723 it is very difficult to make direct comparisons with the drug use and drug policies of different countries or cultures
4154724 the turnout is because of the home theres not much in competition to it that i can see most of the people here are genuine
4154725 have to take the next step in relation to contempt

4154765 i was shocked and saddened to hear about the tragedy in arkansas
4154766 were all grateful for the quick action of law enforcement and quick thinking by chairman gwatneys staff and michelle and i are keeping him and his family in our prayers
4154767 he said he was interested in volunteering but that was obviously a lie
4154768 arkansas has lost a great son and i have lost a great friend there is deep pain in arkansas tonight because of the sheer number of people who knew respected and loved bill gwatney
4154769 our hearts go out to everyone at the democratic headquarters what a tragedy
4154770 this is just a very upsetting troubling and scary thing for our staff as well
4154771 pinning huckabee down on an issue is like nailing jello to the wall
4154772 the senseless shooting at democratic party headquarters in little rock today is a shocking and sobering reminder of just how depraved our world has become all of our thoughts and prayers turn toward bill gwatney and his family today while we await details on what happened and why
4154773 so many chemists went to the wall because of pan

4154775 im not aware of any other case in this country where the government has accepted a claim against it for abuse of public office and paid such a large amount to a private individual
4154776 there will be more and more protests certainly through the olympics and the movement will grow stronger

4154780 limbo one of the largest mobile social communities in the us and gfk technology a leading market search agency have released the latest joint mobile advertising report mar the second quarter report shows that a high percentage of mobile phone users in the us uk and india indicate they are receiving advertising messages through their mobile phone 85 percent in india 51 percent in the uk and 37 percent in the us
4154781 the brands recalled in advertising via this channel were mainly mobile carriers handset manufacturers media brands and digital entertainment companies
4154782 though the us lags behind the uk and india in many mobile phone usage categories it shows strong growth the number of people using mobile phones in the us has grown from 251 million in q4 2007 to over 263 million this quarter up nearly ten percent the us also shows steady increases in the number of people who recall seeing advertising through their mobile phone from 31 percent to 37 percent over the same time period
4154783 mo has the ability to space the floor hes shown himself to be a good shooter

4154785 all these guys are very excited they respect mo as a player and theyre looking forward to playing with him
4154786 i think this is a move to be able to get a talented young 25 year old point guard that can be part of the future
4154787 his most productive days in the nba were just a few short years ago when he had rashard lewis on the other wing
4154788 here you say you have richard jefferson on another wing youre putting luke ridnour in the best possible position to be successful again as he has been in the past
4154789 hes been to oklahoma city hes familiar with the people there hes familiar with the ford center hes played there the fans loved him when he was there his nickname is the cowboy its really apropos to come back

4154804 de iaaf moet daarom actie ondernemen ik ken veel atleten die positief zijn bevonden stopten en vervolgens een comeback maakten als coach wie positief test moet levenslang van coaching worden uitgesloten
4154805 het kan toch niet dat een atleet wordt begeleid door een trainer die geen ervaring heeft iemand die geen verstand heeft van de fysiologie van een lichaam bijvoorbeeld kan moeilijk veel weten over blessures niet als ik ooit coach zou willen worden zou ik eerst opnieuw naar school gaan pas daarna beschik je over voldoende background om je met een atleet bezig te houden

4154831 so i gave him the baltimore sun sports pages even if he just read the pictures and captions
4154832 this woman says to me your son will never be able to focus on anything
4154833 it is appalling that one of australias largest and most profitable companies can engage in this sort of dishonest and unethical business behaviour under our current ir laws
4154834 australian workers urgently need the rest of work choices to be scrapped and to have their rights to collectively bargain restored
4154835 we want to see peoples rights in the workplace respected and that includes of course if they have chosen to join a union having the union able to represent them
4154836 it is the same model we put on the table with unions during negotiations which aims to secure significant incentive based productivity gains over time while offering guaranteed pay increases to our employees and preserving their terms and conditions
4154837 of course we looked at the companys options if union negotiations broke down and they did of course we have contingencies for industrial action because we need to maintain essential telecommunications services to australia
4154838 with a relationship of that kind having been established it seems to be a small step before that same criminal identity is in a position to offer a cash payment to achieve the poor performance of a horse
4154839 a large number of persons associated with the racing industry including bookmakers trainers jockeys commission agents and racetrack identities have come to the attention of police as having improper associations with criminals
4154840 the further i probed particularly about allegations of criminal involvement i was satisfied that the racing industry was affected by a more serious blight than had been suggested by the isolated matter of allanson
4154841 access to an anonymised australian crime commission report convinced me that criminal activity in the industry was rampant
4154842 it would be naive to think that some of these things dont reach across the borders
4154843 if you actually have a look at gordon lewiss report he makes it quite clear that no new investigative body is needed
4154844 he actually makes it clear that the powers we have in place in victoria at the moment are adequate
4154845 in a lot better shape than when much of this information was reported
4154846 these extraordinary individuals were deeply committed to aiding the people of afghanistan especially the children who have seen so much strife
4154847 enemies of the afghan people who do not want the international community to help the poverty hit afghans
4154848 reprehensible that such selfless individuals working for the most vulnerable communities should be deliberately targeted in this way
4154849 things have worked out broadly speaking the way we intended them to
4154850 as well as costs going up businesses were widening their margins so there was a pronounced increase in inflationary pressure the danger was that if that continued it would cause severe difficulties for the economy in the years ahead
4154851 weve asked households to cut back on spending and weve given them the inducement to do so with higher interest rates
4154852 households have responded favourably households have been prudent in cutting back on spending and lifting savings that is why the reserve bank can talk about cutting interest rates
4154853 we cannot wait to see a fall in inflation before we start cutting rates because by then it would be too late
4154854 as far as we can tell there are less than 25 000 households across the whole of australia who are 90 days or more in arrears on their housing loans
4154855 for those 25 000 people it is a lot of pain and a lot of stress but for the country as a whole that is a very low number
4154856 i think were in very good shape and you can see that in the profit results that the banks have announced
4154857 my feeling is that the worst is behind us the write offs the banks have been making in the united states and europe have lessened in recent times the big licks of losses are behind us now and the encouraging thing is those banks have been able to raise so much capital every dollar they have written off theyve been able to raise in new capital

4154870 despite the jump in inflation readings for july we have rising conviction that inflation readings for august and now even september will be more favorable thanks to the sustained trend in retail gasoline and natural gas prices
4154871 the real eye opener was the jump in clothing prices
4154872 one month is hardly a trend but with import prices jumping we may be now seeing apparel adding to inflation rather than restraining it it is also a warning that we could be seeing price increases in other areas as the import cost rises spread through the economy
4154873 the large overall monthly gain was once again attributable to gasoline prices which jumped 4 1 per cent in the month
4154874 some relief may be in the offing on indications that gasoline prices moved lower in august though the annual rate of inflation is likely to remain above 5 5 per cent through the third quarter which will likely keep the fed wary
4154875 since camecos quarterly results vary significantly comparing todays results to our record second quarter last year is not a good indicator of future performance
4154876 we will continue to benefit from our uranium contracting strategy which will provide upside benefit from rising market prices and protection should prices fall
4154877 we have completed the initial data collection and now plan to allow the water in the shaft to return to natural equilibrium over the next couple of weeks we will continue gathering and assessing the information we require to determine the next steps in our remediation plan
4154878 the decline in forecast production is due to a reduction in our expected u s isr production as a result of delays in our ability to put new infrastructure in place such as additional wellfields as well as a decrease in anticipated inkai production due to the shortage of sulphuric acid in kazakhstan

4154954 molten iron raining down like cowpats ice floes at new orleans the weather of 1783 was an extraordinary case of sudden climate change driven by atmospheric gases
4154955 the earth split open along a 16 mile fissure called the laki volcano over the next eight months in a series of vast belches more lava gushed through the fissure than from any volcano in historic times 15 cubic kilometres enough to bury the whole island of manhattan to the top of the rockefeller centre
4154956 for a considerable time past the weather has been very remarkable here a kind of hot fog obscures the atmosphere and gives the sun much of that dull red appearance which the wintry fogs sometimes produce the fog is not peculiar to paris those who are come lately from rome say that it is as thick and hot in italy and that even the top of the alps is covered with it and travellers and letters from spain affirm the fame of that kingdom some people of abilities declare they never remember the like and the timid who think of the recent misfortunes of calabria dream of earthquakes and war revolutions etc happily for the age there are too many enlightened people at present to suffer these things to spread so universally as to the great benefit of the priesthood here they formerly did though it is remarked even now that the churches and saints arc more respectfully attended than usual and that the fear of impending calamities has occasioned one of the literati of the academy of sciences to write the following letter and have it inserted in the journal de paris to the authors of the journal it is known to you gentlemen that for some days past people have been incessantly enquiring what is the occasion of the thick dry fog which almost constantly covers the heavens as this question is particularly put to astronomers 1 think myself obliged to say a few words on the subject more especially since a kind of terror begins to spread in society it is said by some that the disasters in calabria were preceded by such weather and by others that a dangerous comet reigns at present in 1773 i experienced how fast these kind of conjectures which begin amongst the ignorant even in the most enlightened ages proceed from mouth to mouth till they reach the best society and find their way even to the public prints the multitude therefore may easily be supposed to draw strange conclusions when they see the sun of a blood colour shed a melancholy light and cause a most sultry heat this however is nothing more than a very natural effect from a hot sun after a long succession of heavy rain the first impression of heat has necessarily and suddenly rarefied a overabundance of watery particles with which the earth was deeply impregnated and given them as they rose a dimness and rarefaction not usual to common fogs this effect which seems to me very natural is not so very new it is at most not above nineteen years since there was a like example which period too brings the moon in the fame position on the same days and which appears to have some influence on the seasons among the meteorologic observations of the academy for the month of july 1764 1 find the following the beginning of this month was wet and the latter part dry and from the second to the ninth the wind continued in the north the mornings were foggy and the atmosphere in a smoke during the day this you perceive bears a great resemblance to the latter end of our june so that it is not an unheard of or forgotten thing in 1764 they had afterwards storms and hail and nothing worse need be feared in 1783 i have the honour to be etc de la lande de lacad de science

4154960 if i had a pistol handy i would blow out his brains and if not i would give him my purse and call him a scoundrelly assassin
4154961 you would be wrong in both cases if you killed him you would be hanged for you have no right to take the law into your own hands and if you called him an assassin he would tell you that he was no assassin as he attacked you openly and gave you a free choice nay he is generous for he might kill you and take your money as well you might indeed tell him he has an evil trade and he would tell you that you were right and that he would try to avoid the gallows as long as possible he would then thank you and advise you never to drive out of london without being accompanied by a mounted servant as then no robber would dare to attack you we english always carry two purses on our journeys a small one for the robbers and a large one for ourselves
4154962 so odd a mixture looks at eight seemingly diverse characters in austens classic novel pride and prejudice who display autistic traits these characters five in the bennet family and three in the extended family of the fitzwilliams have fundamental difficulties with communication empathy and theory of mind perhaps it is high functioning autism or aspergers syndrome that provides an explanation for some characters awkward behaviour at crowded balls their frequent silences or their tendency to lapse into monologues rather than truly converse with others

4154964 by the end of the great war the editors of the oed were struggling somewhat their inspiring leader sir james murray had died in 1915 still doggedly working on the letter t most of the younger and abler members of staff had been sent away on active service or to do other war work and in june 1918 even charles onions one of the remaining chief editors was summoned to the admiralty as early as 1916 william craigie had noted that the project was in need of someone with expertise in old and middle english fortunately one of his former students was to return to oxford in late 1918 in search of work recovering from the illness which had forced him home from the trenches and with a wife and small child to support he was understandably grateful for the offer of employment on the staff of the oed and his linguistic credentials were well known to craigie who had tutored him in old norse his name was ronald tolkien

4155013 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
4155014 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
4155015 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
4155016 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4155017 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4155018 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4155019 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4155020 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4155021 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4155022 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4155023 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
4155024 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
4155025 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
4155026 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

4155309 washington politicians again covering up true size of federal deficit
4155310 according to cbo the current fiscal year which ends on september 30 will end up with a deficit of 400 billion while this figure is shockingly high the truth is that the actually deficit is a lot higher
4155311 the 400 billion deficit is based on an accounting fraud called the unified budget in which money borrowed from the social security trust fund and which is added to the national debt is counted as income for the annual budget
4155312 this kind of trickery by republicans and democrats would land officers of publicly held companies in prison
4155313 when you take the 186 billion that is being borrowed from social security and add it to the 400 billion deficit that is being acknowledged you get the real deficit of 586 billion
4155314 raiding the social security trust fund to finance the general operations of the federal government is a direct attack on the financial security of senior citizens trying to cover it up through deception is unconscionable
4155315 as for fiscal year 2009 the bush administration projects a deficit of 482 billion but that does not include 36 billion from the housing bill 80 billion in war costs and 227 billion borrowed from the social security trust fund
4155316 while the housing bill passed late and no one really is sure what the wars in iraq and afghanistan will cost it is inexcusable to pretend that the 227 billion being borrowed from social security is an asset rather than a debt that must be repaid
4155317 republican and democratic politicians should keep their hands off of social security surpluses and they should start accounting honestly for the money borrowed from the trust fund
4155318 credit is not bad its bad if you use it badly i encourage people to look at it as a tool that they manage you can get good rates rewards frequent flier miles you use it dont let it use you
4155319 the most important thing to improve your score is to have a credit card an installment loan is a fixed payment and you dont have to manage surprises
4155320 a credit card is self managed and you decide how much you charge each month how close you get to your limit whether you let it grow each month or pay it off
4155321 at 600 to 620 it would mean a higher fee up to around 700 and above that no additional fee
4155322 a 20 000 limit over several cards with just 4 000 charged is better than one card with a 5 000 limit with the same 4 000 charged you want to show youre not charging up to the max
4155323 many inquiries in a short period of time might suggest you are trying to take on large amounts of debt both issues are signs of risk
4155324 as long as its on the credit report whether its open or closed low balance or no balance or old or new if its on the report the score is going to count it when counting that mix or when looking at the ideal number of cards closing it is never going to help your score
4155325 so many people are using credit to live beyond their means
4155326 in an ideal world everybody would pay in full and youd use your credit card for convenience there are times when it is neat to be able to use credit where you can spend more than you pay in one month or at holidays or for emergency but youve got to stop and create a plan to get it paid back it keeps your revolving balance low
4155327 manage your debt so that 28 percent of gross monthly income is your housing payment 38 percent for all payments to creditors

4155380 the funding announced today to the parish of under the gas tax fund agreement is a concrete example of the government of canadas commitment to support a stronger economy a cleaner environment and more prosperous communities in quebec
4155381 as part of the government of canadas 33 billion building canada plan the gas tax fund will provide 11 8 billion nationally from 2007 until 2014 budget 2008 announced that the gas tax fund will be permanent beyond 2013 14 at 2 billion per year this ensures municipalities continue to have access to a reliable source of funds as they get on with building the infrastructure they need

4155387 we actually have more customers carrying more products then at the same period in 2007 although with the current economic situation these increases were not sufficient to offset the decrease in sales we experience with many of our customers the increased strength of the canadian dollar also had a negative impact of more than ca 400 000 on our us sales compared to last year
4155388 a decline in sales combined with a decrease in foreign exchange gains and forward exchange contract gains explain the difference between 2008 and 2007
4155389 furthermore under the credit agreements the company must comply with certain restrictive covenants including the requirement to maintain certain financial ratios at the end of the second quarter of 2008 the company was not in compliance with one of these ratios subsequently and as required by the canadian institute of chartered accountants emerging issues committee abstract eic 59 the company reclassified a long term portion of the term debt amounting to 1 865 000 to current liability even though no accelerated repayment has been demanded by the lender the company is currently discussing amendments to its loan covenants with the lender and certain measures are being implemented to re establish the situation
4155390 of course these are less than satisfactory results for bestar we continue to invest to diversify our product line and in the added value of our products we strongly believe we have chosen the best avenues for continued success which will enable us to maintain our place in both the furniture and components industries

4155425 a recent study we conducted revealed that stores following the aax systems core vehicle recommendations are seeing combined average dealer profits and floor plan savings increases of just over 60 000 annually when they increase their core inventory percentage by as little as 10 percent
4155426 a corner post of our xsellerator customer and dealership management suite has always been to provide dealerships with an integrated business process through the use of technology to drive efficiencies and help them be more competitive in todays challenging environment integration with aax is a natural fit with this philosophy our dealers now have another sophisticated tool that they can employ in their environment and still maintain an integrated and effective process
4155427 we also believe that this is an opportunity for existing aax customers who are interested in improving their entire operation to take a look at xsellerator and see for themselves how aax and xsellerator together help take them to a new level
4155428 we are very pleased to have once again been selected by drs to manufacture the ahas for the new radar systems we have been working extensively with drs over the past year to optimize the design of the aha to make it more cost effective the award of this contract demonstrates the success of those efforts

4155440 building a better learning experience for autozoners will ensure customers continue to get the advice they trust and we feel our new lms will help us create that experience
4155441 i always thought there was some magic in those sessions because the songs seemed to acquire a haunting almost bittersweet quality as we laid down the tracks roberta flack recorded this song several years later but i have always been a fan of bettes original vocal on this version

4155453 calling someone stupid because they live in a red state is counterproductive and just plain wrong we must listen to the folks first then provide real answers as to why they should be voting for democrats
4155454 nach der verletzungsbedingten absage von rene haben wir entschieden dass wir tim wiese beim l nderspiel in n rnberg eine bew hrungschance geben er hat in den vergangenen jahren in der bundesliga und der champions league gute leistungen gezeigt und sich diese berufung verdient
4155455 current drugs given to people with lewy body and parkinsons disease simply treat the symptoms
4155456 this model is the first platform to understand how the brain cell deterioration takes place we will use this model to identify targets for new drugs to slow or prevent the disease
4155457 further research using these models will enable us to find new drug targets people with lewy body disease suffer memory loss visual hallucinations and movement difficulties
4155458 unfortunately research is severely underfunded and much more is needed if we are to defeat this devastating disease
4155459 the formation of lewy bodies is a key event in the development of nerve cell death associated with parkinsons disease
4155460 the study shows how dopamine shapes the two main circuits of the brain that control how we choose to act and what happens in these disease states
4155461 dopamine released by drugs leads to abnormal strengthening of the cortical synapses driving the striatal go circuits while weakening synapses at opposing stop circuits as a result when events associated with drug taking where you took the drug what you were feeling occur there is an uncontrollable drive to go and seek drugs
4155462 all of our actions in a healthy brain are balanced by the urge to do something and the urge to stop
4155463 our work suggests that it is not just the strengthening of the brain circuits helping select actions that is critical to dopamines effects it is the weakening of the connections that enable us to stop as well
4155464 the study illuminates why parkinsons patients have trouble performing everyday tasks like reaching across a table to pick up a glass of water when they are thirsty
4155465 our study suggests that the inability to move in parkinsons disease is not a passive process like a car running out of gas
4155466 rather the car doesnt move because your foot is jammed down on the brake dopamine normally helps you adjust the pressure on the brake and gas pedals it helps you learn that when you see a red light at an intersection you brake and when the green light comes on you take your foot off the brake and depress the gas pedal to go parkinsons disease patients who have lost the neurons that release dopamine have their foot perpetually stuck on the brake
4155467 researchers have long wanted to find a way to move a patients disease into the test tube to develop cells that could be cultured into the many tissues relevant to diseases of the blood the brain and the heart for example
4155468 now we have a way to do just that to derive pluripotent cells from patients with disease which means the cells can make any tissue and can grow forever this enables us to model thousands of conditions using classical cell culture techniques

4155473 if this shoot had gone any longer i would have gone mad
4155474 it was full immersion in this world fortunately the kids kept me sane they knew what was going on and they could talk about it one of the kids parents was even a psychologist so we had some professional guidance through this horror but in the end it all came down to catherine and ellen and whether they would have the strength to see this through
4155475 i have to say ellen page was as committed as you can be to a single project and catherine who is as warm a person as you can imagine gave herself over to gertrude it was incredible to see her change from her role as harper lee in capote which was such a beautiful and delicate dramatic performance to her presence as gertrude she could have played her as such a monster but she finds a way to make her human
4155476 we really bonded we had no egos on set and we leaned on each other to get through it at times i think it was almost harder on catherine than it was on me there were times when i felt like a real jerk
4155477 i think there were moments when we werent that nice
4155478 and given the material and the characters we were playing thats to be expected its stressful and its all consuming and it affects you
4155479 i was in a position where i felt myself judging gertrude i know you hear actors say you cant judge the character youre playing but i judged gertrude and let me tell you even though there arent supposed to be good guys and bad guys in this i have a definite opinion about who the bad guy is
4155480 thats just me as a person as far as the work goes i found myself asking the same questions the audience probably does you know how does something like this happen theres something in us that we clearly dont want to see and i think tommy did a good job teasing out the demons
4155481 i did a lot of research on psychological torture and the stories stick with you
4155482 there are a lot of victims out there and a lot of them never have a chance to be heard i felt i had to make this movie for sylvia likens and the other victims of abuse out there whose stories are never told things never change if people ignore the truth and i think as horrifying as this movie is it s the truth and that really is scary
4155483 i think it raises a red flag indicating that theres a need to determine whether or not these products could cause this problem in people
4155484 and we really dont know that from this study which looked only at mice people arent mice
4155485 i would rather change things even if theyre not broken because it is a sign of progress
4155486 as far as i can tell i believe it definitely is a huge improvement
4155487 im not naive enough to believe that there are going to be no accidents in a childrens product but i guarantee you 90 percent of them are going to be improved with this bill in my opinion
4155488 what about the busy mom whos got the 4 year old grabbing at her pant leg the phones ringing and the in the play yard
4155489 this bill will help to ensure that products americans find on their store shelves are safe and that the regulating agencies have the resources they need to enforce law
4155490 this has become an increasingly difficult and complex job as more imports from more nations are now sold in the united states than ever before although we had some concerns with the bill were pleased that congress included some recommendations from the presidents action plan for import safety
4155491 because of this bizarre crescent shaped hole it fit right over and it would fit right over any little kids neck
4155492 im certainly hoping that at least some of the major manufacturers and retailers have already put into place some of the measures already in the bill
4155493 those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it
4155494 i never imagined that thered eventually be so many copies of that book
4155495 publishers could not openly publish a work by a bourgeois author the climate at the time did not permit it
4155496 if it wasnt black it was white if it wasnt revolutionary then it was counter revolutionary
4155497 the book covers up the appeasement policies of american imperialism it maliciously distorts and smears both stalin himself and soviet foreign policy prior to the invasion by nazi germany the author is a bourgeois journalist his position and outlook are reactionary
4155498 although the authors appraisal of certain issues and individuals is imperfect and his viewpoint is different from ours this is indeed a valuable historical reference work
4155499 one of the most important historical works of our time
4155500 the feeling was like a long buried fossil being exposed once again to the sun
4155501 he greatly helped the people of our country come to recognize socialism the human spirit totalitarianism and political terror from a global cultural and historical perspective

4155510 your task o roman is to rule and bring to men the arts of government to impose upon them the arts of peace to spare those who submit to subdue the arrogant
4155511 our sole goal is to safely and rapidly deliver humanitarian aid to georgia to alleviate human suffering and save lives
4155512 we will continue to support this humanitarian mission until the host nation and the u s state department determine that it is no longer needed
4155513 thank you so much for helping us in this great time of need these supplies will surely save lives

4155515 russia a country with 30 times the population of georgia decided to roll into its much smaller neighbour and tried to roll over it it failed to roll over georgia but it would never have even thought of doing this if georgia were already a member of nato
4155516 what russia has been doing against georgia for the last two days represents an open aggression unprecedented in modern times
4155517 it is a direct challenge for the whole world if russia is not stopped today by the whole world tomorrow russian tanks might reach any european capital i think everyone has understood this by now
4155518 georgia is a microcosm of a world of nations now emerging from old systems
4155519 all of the great things you can do for your prospect
4155520 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4155521 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4155522 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4155523 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4155524 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4155525 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4155526 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

4155538 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
4155539 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
4155540 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems

4155545 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
4155546 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
4155547 im against the lottery but if one of my members won the lottery i wish and i hope he would give 10 to the church we could do a lot of things with that money
4155548 we are in the process now of building a youth center and you would be surprised at the people that can be helped with 600 000
4155549 anything extra is bonus so that would be an extra blessing of offering after that so if i did win lotto sweepstakes i would tithe to my church

4155551 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
4155552 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
4155553 we agreed it would be very good for us and the industry

4155594 in a bit of historical revisionism swift boat veterans for truth founder and unfit for command co author john oneill distorted jerome corsis role in co authoring the book
4155595 simply an editor and not really any sort of co author
4155596 unfit book materials show corsi more than just an editor
4155597 one of the authors of a new anti john kerry book frequently posted comments on a conservative web site describing muslims and catholics as pedophiles and pope john paul ii as senile in chat room entry last year on freerepublic com corsi writes islam is a peaceful religion just as long as the women are beaten the boys buggered and the infidels are killed in another entry he says so this is what the last days of the catholic church are going to look like buggering boys undermines the moral base and the lawyers rip the gold off the vatican altars we may get one more pope when this senile one dies but thats probably about it
4155598 the real reason behind president bushs push for immigration reform says author jerome r
4155599 the late great usa the coming merger with mexico and canada
4155600 any more worthy of being taken seriously than those who think jews rule the world or the truthers who think president bush is responsible for 9 11
4155601 yesterday jerome corsi was prattling on about the north american union again after michael medved deservedly spanked him for spreading conspiracy theories while i dont think corsi is any more worthy of being taken seriously than those who think jews rule the world or the truthers who think president bush is responsible for 9 11 i thought i would respond to him one last time i think thats about the fourth time ive said that now why respond again whats the point well unfortunately a lot of conservatives consider this conspiracy theory to be so preposterous that they believe its beneath them to even bother discussing it and that leaves corsi and his ilk to dominate the debate and since there are a lot of conservatives being taken in by this north american union nonsense somebody has got to step up to the plate
4155602 i guess there are people who believe in the plan for a north american union but there are people who believe in bigfoot
4155603 all his life jerome corsis been told that were running out of oil
4155604 i remember driving with my dad in a 1952 plymouth and listening to him talk about the end of oil
4155605 im at the point where the dinosaur theory seems silly
4155606 you take a pile of cats and you bury them dig them up 10 years later and you dont get oil
4155607 the truth is that there is so much oil around the world that its been easy to find
4155608 were awash in oil theres more oil today in proven reserves than ever before in human history
4155609 after their bitter campaign 2004 experience with the swift boat veterans for truth john kerry and his fellow dems arent waiting to be shot at again yesterday aides to sens kerry hillary clinton joe biden and ted kennedy jumped all over literary mugger jerome corsi co author of the kerry bashing best seller unfit for command they knocked him to the ground and kicked him in the face metaphorically anyway over his next democrattrashing tome atomic iran how the terrorist regime bought the bomb and american politicians the book which nashvilles cumberland house publishing wont release till next month claims democratic pols are being corrupted by iranian money and helping the nuke seeking mullahs in tehran
4155610 though not a veteran himself corsi co authored unfit for command swift boat veterans speak out against john kerry
4155611 lets see exactly why it isnt the case that islam is a worthless dangerous satanic religion wheres the proof to the contrary
4155612 islam is like a virus it affects the mind maybe even better as an analogy it is a cancer that destroys the body it infects
4155613 first lets undermine the us in vietnam then we can go for gay marriage when you get to be pres jfk lite there will be no end to how much of america we can destroy
4155614 just dont let anybody put a tablet with the ten commandments in front of the school where that girl wants to wear a muslim scarf oh no then the rats would complain anti christian anti american just like their presidential candidate jean francois kerrie
4155615 after he married terrahsa didnt john kerry begin practicing judiasm he also has paternal gradparents that were jewish what religion is john kerry
4155616 john f ing commie kerry and commie ted discuss their plan to hand america over to our nations enemies
4155617 forget about democracy just get out the checkbook and put everybody in iraq on the payroll thats all they want pay them first democracy or some b s islamic version of it will follow
4155618 mohammed al mohammed proclaiming guidance from his hate god ned allah kills another dozen women and children by convincing a teenager to blow him her self up for victory in another world
4155619 another mohammed al mohammed islam religion of hate maniac bites the dust
4155620 certainly cant be one of the islam is a religion of peace hijackers
4155621 one more mohammed al mohammed el mohammed mohammed iced great
4155622 car bomb kills egyptian islamist in lebanon camp 3 1 03
4155623 let them build mosques seems about all the germans are worth these days
4155624 islam is like a virus it affects the mind maybe even better as an analogy it is a cancer that destroys the body it infects a throwback medieval anti modern anti science anti knowledge doctrine
4155625 forget it the only thing these islamonazis understand is force time to nuke the temple of the dome and send this
4155626 go for the oil fields set the mad dog lawyers loose lets roll take even the diapers from their heads remember according to the koran islam approves of lying as long as it is to non believers saudis are lying killers who harbor killers
4155627 islam is like a virus it infects the minds of the believers
4155628 good plan raise obl from the dead every time we get ready to ice another islamonazi on to baghdad lets roll
4155629 nuke the islam nazis and lets move on no more muslamo fascists
4155630 islam has declared world war iii against everything non muslim
4155631 when will the liberal media wake up to see that islam has declared a world war against everyting non muslim may allah be damned to the hell muslims wish to create on earth
4155632 may islam join the garbage heap of worthless religions we have grown beyond any believers of hermes out there
4155633 all arab muslims lie the koran endorses lying to infidels namely us none of these names are real abdallah is really mohammad mohammad mohammad readily altered to include atta or haj or whatever else they decide to call themselves for the moment
4155634 gotta love this stupid religion islam makes the nazis look like a sunday stroll in the park islam its gotta be straight from hell just the devil in disguise that seems to about sum it up
4155635 arabs lie islam preaches lying to infidels fingerprints dont lie boo hoo time to demand ids to check into hotels and passport registration for all foreign nationalists who want hotel rooms also id checks and passport registrations for anyone renting an apartment
4155636 lets get rid of all the saudi arabians that would have gone a long way to preventing sept 11
4155637 yet another violent raghead named mohammad whats new islam looks like a cancer a plague a deadly virus no doctor worries about the free speech rights of cancer cells
4155638 yet another little islamic man of hate is there any other kind
4155639 the only thing the islamic world understands is force lets destroy a few of these hate schools and start targeting these mad preachers of hate
4155640 lets see who is it not politically correct to profile
4155641 finally a way to end jihad maybe the whole arab world will blow itself up live by the sword die by the sword seems an ancient formula bye bye jihad
4155642 i repeat muslims cancer cells its hard to tell the difference no doctor worries about the first amendment rights of cancer cells the therapy is to eliminate cancer cells so the body can go on living great to repeat it keeps the thread going let the muslims stop preaching terror and ill revise my view meanwhile muslims cancer cells is an equation that works
4155643 may all these arab maniacs explode and kill themselves next time maybe they will take arab rat with them best solution to the homicide bombers is that they eliminate themselves with as little loss to civilians as possible
4155644 i repeat muslims cancer cells its hard to tell the difference no doctor worries about the first amendment rights of cancer cells the therapy is to eliminate cancer cells so the body can go on living
4155645 muslims cancer cells its hard to tell the difference no doctor worries about the first amendment rights of cancer cells the therapy is to eliminate cancer cells so the body can go on living
4155646 we find there is even uncertainty whether stanley ann and obama senior were ever married in a church
4155647 on feb 2 1961 several months after they met obamas parents got married in maui according to divorce records
4155648 other sources say divorce papers confirm that a civil ceremony was held on maui on february 2 1961 when ann was three months pregnant with obama
4155649 senator obama could claim to be a citizen of kenya as well as of the united states obama can trace his heritage back to his mother who was born in the united states and was an american citizen when he was born and to his father who was born in kenya and was a kenyan citizen when obama was born

4155653 mi ero preparato un discorso ma voglio evitarlo e dirti quello che penso
4155654 quello che mi hai fatto mi ha fatto molto male
4155655 perch non dovresti darmi una seconda possibilit ne hai avute anche te e parecchie da quello che so
4155656 cazzo se solo fosse ancora vivo freddie quante belle canzoni avrebbe potuto ancora fare
4155657 ma tra ventanni dove sar cosa far con chi sar sar solo
4155658 io amo conoscere persone che appartengono ad altre nazionalit come avrete capito
4155659 mi ero ripromessa di non far vedere a nessuno che stessi male e invece ho fallito
4155660 my real age is 16 i dont pay any attention to what everyone says
4155661 never has any media outlet called me to check the athletes ages
4155662 we are a sports department how would we have the ability to do that
4155663 we already explained this very clearly theres no need to discuss this thing again
4155664 im going to give them some awesome music they dont hear every week
4155665 as china becomes a bigger economy america will become the greater because of it
4155666 the people in the lounge will see people going in to the nightclub and the sight lines are so dramatic it is going to provide some amazing energy for the lounge restaurant and nightclub
4155667 the inspiration is from a famous nightclub in paris called les bains douches
4155668 what made it interesting was an actual restaurant with the basement of an actual turn of the century bathhouse thats what inspired lavo and lavo means to bathe in latin so it goes with the concept
4155669 two months ago our partner rich wolf put on a backpack and had a blank checkbook
4155670 he was literally in morocco for two weeks going into little bazaars
4155671 much like the imaging we got from every turkish bathhouse there were these giant domes with different beams of light that come when the sun is over the dome
4155672 it still feels like it hasnt really happened and its all been a bad dream
4155673 theres still a sense of numbness because it was such a special life and the thought of not being able to do anything else with him and create more memories is hard to deal with
4155674 his belly laugh was a sight to behold he had such a beautiful nature
4155675 he never let anything get in his way even at the point when the disease took hold and he was unable to walk talk or eat he never let it upset him
4155676 every couple of seconds he would stop breathing and we worried until he started again
4155677 he took one breath and we waited for another and after about 30 seconds we knew he had passed away
4155678 there was no sign of distress on his face he looked like a little angel
4155679 we made sure there was music in the room and after he passed away i had the opportunity to give him a bath which was very special
4155680 it is important to keep his memory alive but also to help other children who are in need
4155681 hopefully other families that need our help contact us and we make a difference
4155682 ive actually named it the rob effect the fans take a few days to get used to something
4155683 it wasnt until i started writing paranormal romance that i let stephen kings i nfluence start seeping into my thoughts again and i swore that i would not hold anything back when it came to letting the darkness in my voice out
4155684 bella spends much of her time trying to do damage control when her gift causes more trouble than its worth but when a masked superhero comes into her life she may have to admit that bad luck isnt the only luck she has
4155685 lilith saintcrow crosses into young adult but keeps her formula for tough as nails heroines
4155686 the thrall are just the most nastiest vampires you will ever meet and the werewolves are extremely interesting
4155687 tiny needlepoints of pain dragged me up through layers of sleep increasingly insistent the repeated puncturing resisted my best attempts to drop back into the warm and inviting dreams of my soon to occur wedding
4155688 one area where the script excels is building suspense as the novel is narrated by bella we are never able to see outside of her head and therefore we are never able to see danger except from her limited point of view the script takes advantage of this difference and a vague sense of foreboding and danger is set up right from the beginning
4155689 its just very difficult for a vampire to be in love with someone he wants to eat all the time
4155690 right now audiences are hungry for blood the vampire is back
4155691 i can tell you that im an fbi agent who has heard of the urban myth of the dollhouse and im really on the case im really determined maybe slightly obsessed with it
4155692 ruwaidah made the bold decision to take the car keys out of my thobe pocket so she could drive us to the nearest hospital which is only a few minutes away from our home i am proud of my daughter for her compelling decision to break the law to save our lives
4155693 close the lid and a large screw like auger turns and carries the waste to the burn chamber where the propane burner then bakes urine feces and paper into ashes
4155694 the speakers office was very clear in saying that they do not need people in suits
4155695 the political director of the manufacturers association who normally wears a suit and tie attended the republican rally in a faded farmers hat rugby shirt and green pants
4155696 yet the media still finds itself complicit in deceiving the american public
4155697 calibrat ing the exact effect of his words upon an audience
4155698 the first thing hillary clinton intends to do is send me and former president bush and a number of other people around the world to tell them that america is open for business and co operation again
4155699 it seems like his usually sharp political instincts failed him this time
4155700 a los dieciochos a os se adora a los veinte se ama a los treinta se desea a los cuarenta se reflexiona
4155701 people were given the six month permits on the understanding that they would do something to make themselves legal within those six months
4155702 many of them dont even have access to us and other legal organisations
4155703 i can understand with a country like mozambique which is at peace
4155704 this has really caused me to question the integrity of the entire process
4155705 it s a very simple thing i was a stranger and you took me in
4155706 quite frankly theyve done no work in the communities from which these people came
4155707 there has been very little preparation in terms of reintegration and dealing with what caused the problem in the first place
4155708 to be honest our development academy is nowhere near the level of sao paulo and it can be improved
4155709 we have one of the biggest youth development systems in the country but we are not continually producing wits first team players or bafana bafana players
4155710 we will definitely copy sao paulo as much as we can and learn as much as possible their youth structure is very successful and we can only benefit from them we will obviously maintain our identity as a south african team and just take from them what we can apply so its not to say well be copying them one hundred percent
4155711 its impossible to copy a team a hundred percent just look at ajax cape town
4155712 phil gets along so well with the younger players he talks to them guides them and has really matured dale too is very helpful with the new boys and its important to have older players like them in a team
4155713 i believe brian will serve us well he is very skilful and i think we missed a player of his calibre last season the brazilians we have here are quality players we watched them at training and at games and they are enjoying themselves here theyve already asked for contract extensions
4155714 sibusiso is from a championship winning team so he knows what it takes to go all the way
4155715 these times when the state is behind in paying its bills and things are being slashed such as money for historic preservation for the legislators to get a big pay raise was outrageous
4155716 had the senate not had that vote to reject then the pay raise would have went into effect without anyone having to vote for it
4155717 an attempt to access the federal earmarks for highway programs
4155718 it did not take up the issue of a revenue stream like leasing the lottery
4155719 potentially there are projects in my district that would benefit
4155720 but there was no legislation on the table the calendar had no bill listed on it
4155721 the positive votes were the pay raise has been rejected and theres a genuine first step to capture the federal match
4155722 it was just outrageous it the pay raise got that close to passing in times like this
4155723 if it sounds like im a little frustrated i am
4155724 if he sen jones had not allowed the bill to be called it would have moved forward even though the majority of the members of the senate voted to reject it it also shows you how much pressure on members affects the votes
4155725 we were very fortunate to be able to bring enough pressure to have that vote
4155726 first responders were taught then to stay outside and form a perimeter around the scene we know now that it is important that officers go in immediately and try to save lives
4155727 it is not just a response to school violence but violence everywhere
4155728 sometimes we will get a negative response like why does our town need this
4155729 but we train to do it properly and then pray that it does not happen
4155730 they expect us to be reliable and to resolve situations
4155731 we continue to develop new techniques so that the program has adapted to fit our own agency
4155732 i wrote those to be provocative and i said i would not use that kind of politically incorrect language again and i dont believe i have
4155733 its not a material enough error to have mattered because its a very peripheral point
4155734 is ok with the pope as long as it isnt reported by the liberal press
4155735 ragheads are boy bumpers as clearly as they are anti american
4155736 las precipitaciones debieran comenzar desde la zona de temuco al sur y paulatinamente se van a ir desplazando m s al norte llegando al final del d a a la zona central
4155737 por sus esfuerzos para lograr la estabilidad en el mundo
4155738 sus esfuerzos para conseguir la estabilidad en el mundo especialmente en frica as como para alcanzar la paz en darfur y restablecer la normalidad en las relaciones entre sud n y chad
4155739 intensificar la cooperaci n entre sus pa ses para la estabilidad y la seguridad en el mundo considerando que ambos son miembros del consejo de seguridad de la onu
4155740 esperamos concluir pronto las negociaciones para un acuerdo entre ambos gobiernos
4155741 se llegar a una situaci n que permitir la completa normalizaci n de las relaciones con libia
4155742 the position of the russia side is not proceed beyond the peacekeeping zone but we have to respond to provocations
4155743 one can forget about any talk about georgias territorial integrity because i believe it is impossible to persuade south ossetia and abkhazia to agree with the logic that they can be forced back into the georgian state
4155744 we dont want them here what we need is friendship and good relations with the russian people
4155745 we let her stay here and now shes blaming everything on us
4155746 we believe our print exclusive partnership with ruxton will allow a more unified approach to selling the alternative weekly audience to national advertisers and will be the start of a more cooperative relationship selling into the digital space not only with ruxton but within the entire alternative publishing industry
4155747 its inexcusable on the federal and state level that someone could do what was reported they lost their permit reapplied and continued to operate thats just an embarrassment to the whole system
4155748 as the feds sort through this crash well learn what went wrong and look for opportunities to make sure that a tragedy like this never happens again
4155749 such tragedies are becoming all too common and many of these deadly accidents are preventable
4155750 i urge congress to make this a priority after the august recess so the roads will be safer for everyone
4155751 its inexcusable on the federal and state level that someone could do what was reported
4155752 they lost their permit reapplied and continued to operate thats just an embarrassment to the whole system
4155753 they could be figuring out how to respond whether theyre are going to adopt our recommendations or propose an alternative
4155754 you cant simply sit down with a piece of paper and start writing
4155755 its got to be based on research and exploring a number of alternatives to decide what the new standard will be
4155756 my point is the texas legislature could pass all kinds of laws and it wouldnt make any difference to a guy like that
4155757 not to sound flip but bad people are going to do bad things
4155758 if someone is intent on doing something bad they usually dont tell us ahead of time there isnt much the governor could have done to prevent this
4155759 i think it would be a good thing to do
4155760 cool this means we have more time to play a game with gunny today
4155761 is it ok that i added a few of my clothes in with gunnys
4155762 of course it is ok i just thought gunny had worn some extra clothes this week
4155763 you know tiger you would look really grown up and your turning ten too
4155764 your friend is really nice i hope to have a friend like you if i get sick when im old

4155769 why i want mark warner to run for president i fish for largemouth and striped bass i love nhra drag racing and have taken my own car down the track a number of times i believe everyone has a right to own a gun i drive a dodge 1500 hemi pickup with which i tow my boat to the lake and i served in the navy for 9 years if you knew nothing more about me than this many of my democratic friends would consider this a bio of a republican
4155770 calling someone stupid because they live in a red state is counterproductive and just plain wrong we must listen to the folks first then provide real answers as to why they should be voting for democrats

4155787 the little ones quickly realized that their only weapon against reality was their imagination they embarked on a radical experiment to see if they could convince themselves that everything was going to be all right they spent majority of their nights holed up in their studio affectionately named uncle lees there were many songs written and many songs abandoned at times they felt their muse had left the building still afraid of the world outside they adopted a just write and dont tell anyone policy that lasted for more than a year as the experiment grew longer and longer they grew weary that they could no longer follow the path they started on one by one each of the little ones wanted to stray a new barometer needed to be set they came up with uncle lees rule of feet the rule stated that a song was deemed appropriate if and only if each of the little ones feet could shuffle once they adopted this new rule they began to realize what they had right in front of them
4155788 ill be a lot further along than i was last year the more i rest the more i take care of my ankle ill be close to 100 if im not 100 ill probably be 95 96 itll definitely take that

4155790 im not sure why or how but she trained really well leading up to it i guess this will be a big learning experience for her shes someone who when she has something like this you can guarantee shes going to be better next time
4155791 the first 400 felt really good and then i just didnt have it at the end
4155792 this can happen some days your body just doesnt work and my body chose a bad time to not work
4155793 i dont really know for some people its worked out great
4155794 for me i might have benefited from having a little time at home

4155805 does not call for consultation with the senate in the nominations process
4155806 shall nominate and by and with the advice and consent of the senate shall appoint
4155807 there will of course be no exertion of choice on the part of the senate they may defeat one choice of the executive and oblige him to make another but they cannot themselves choose they can only ratify or reject the choice of the president
4155808 het gaat om een ernstig probleem in onze sport dat de grootste aandacht verdient
4155809 de iaaf moet daarom actie ondernemen ik ken veel atleten die positief zijn bevonden stopten en vervolgens een comeback maakten als coach wie positief test moet levenslang van coaching worden uitgesloten
4155810 het kan toch niet dat een atleet wordt begeleid door een trainer die geen ervaring heeft iemand die geen verstand heeft van de fysiologie van een lichaam bijvoorbeeld kan moeilijk veel weten over blessures niet als ik ooit coach zou willen worden zou ik eerst opnieuw naar school gaan pas daarna beschik je over voldoende background om je met een atleet bezig te houden
4155811 ik wil mij niet uitspreken over hoe het gebeurd is liu zige heeft nooit ergens gezwommen en kwam naar de spelen met een tijd van 2 08 08 nu zwemt ze over vier lengten bijna vier seconden sneller nu wil ik rustig zien hoe ze evolueren ze zullen aan wedstrijden moeten deelnemen buiten china onder meer aan de wereldkampioenschappen in rome in 2009

4155818 it puts us in an incredibly tough spot right before primaries right before the general election
4155819 its the hardest thing in the world to say sorry i promised you 10 000 for your playroom at your kindergarten center but i dont have that 10 000 to give you anymore
4155820 yeah but we had to cover the ceiling with tarp otherwise wed wake up covered in bat shit every morning
4155821 hey im just a meathead and i really enjoyed the show
4155822 it takes a daydream nation of millions to hold us back

4155828 adaptive mechanisms for inferring harmful intentions which can account for rapid yet not necessarily accurate judgments from faces
4155829 overall people do a pretty bad job when it comes to judging people based on appearances
4155830 should we continue to rely on making decisions based on appearances or should we actually be taking steps to ignore them
4155831 if people use faces or appearances to draw their impressions of others
4155832 they must be doing that because they think those assumptions are correct if you couldnt get any good information from appearances then a rational person wouldnt use this information to make their decisions
4155833 asking participants to deliberate and make a good judgment not only dramatically increased the response times but also reduced the predictive accuracy of the judgments
4155834 what about that face is making people say it looks trustworthy or untrustworthy
4155835 when you go to extreme lengths to make a face appear trustworthy the face appears as if its smiling and when you go to extreme lengths to make a face appear untrustworthy it appears as if is angry
4155836 there is a tendency in our field to do what is described as the reverse inference you see that a particular brain region is active and from this you make an inference about the persons psychology or emotional state for instance if i see that the amygdala is active i might infer that the person is afraid however if the shape of the curve is u shaped this is not a valid inference to make
4155837 when you see someone and you think i can tell hes smart most people are actually pretty confident in their own judgment but it turns out that youre not really accurate most of the time and if our theory is correct it turns out that among other things your system for detecting emotions is inappropriately overgeneralizing
4155838 our brains are big enough to see into the future and plot long term consequences
4155839 well we like the train and arguing that we should get off is not realistic
4155840 esta vez china es tan grande y crece tan r pido que centra toda nuestra atenci n

4155844 gibbs is the sort of player arsenal will loan out signing a premier league player for the season could be very attractive to a club like ours
4155845 hes an outstanding prospect but the feeling is he is a little too young for what we need

4155847 there have been many songs written on india and the words could therefore get very clich d so i thought why not talk of india in the context of music
4155848 i could not think of any other name but jai hind for this because i wanted to create a product that every indian will relate to this is not a video that belongs to me or the celebrities in it but it belongs to each indian

4155894 i am delighted that avon fire amp rescue service is expanding its resources at yate fire station we are hoping the new arrangements will mean we can spend more time working with community groups and members of the public to highlight fire safety messages the changes will also mean we can be more flexible when offering free home fire safety visits booking appointments at a more convenient time for members of the public
4155895 obviously this means local groups can now use the community safety centre in the evenings which has a free meeting room and information communication technology ict facilities there will also be facilities for the local police community support officers so that they can use the fire station as a base

4156005 thats why we now find we are in a position to cut interest rates
4156006 we cannot wait to see a fall in inflation before we start cutting rates because by then it would be too late
4156007 i would expect like the reserve bank that any reduction in interest rates would be passed on by the banks
4156008 but i can understand why their chief executive officers are being cautious about giving rolled gold guarantees about these things because theyve got other factors that they have to worry about as well
4156009 the banks will carry a very heavy onus to explain any variation from any reduction by the reserve bank in the rates as compared with what they actually do

4156022 we came out strong in the first half and we were pretty pleased with that
4156023 we basically made the decision when we came out of the locker room to play from the word go
4156024 we were behind and that usa goal was a good moment to start the game for real
4156025 the united states is a very strong team and they played some good defense
4156026 the ball was cleared to me and i was just in the right spot at the right time
4156027 we have great respect for the german side as they are one of the best sides in the world we were happy with the way it started to go one up we wanted to push
4156028 its been a tough first three games for but the rest of the tournament is still in front of us
4156029 well take a lot from these games and take what we learn into the final two
4156030 oh i will i have to see theres a plan
4156031 the man in charge of jerseys child abuse investigation has said that his whole inquiry is being obstructed by the very people appointed to bring charges against suspects
4156032 on the island we have a breakdown in the rule of law
4156033 police being wilfully obstructed by the attorney general william bailhache and his agents jack straw must intervene and appoint independent judges to the island
4156034 myllari did not say if he intended to lodge a formal protest over the decision by referee jean marc petoud of switzerland
4156035 there has always been biased judges referees in the olympics
4156036 by the way sune i am pretty sure categorically calling for an entire nation to be destroyed is a crime in sweden under amp 65533 hets mot folkgrupp amp 65533
4156037 hey we need to get nbc some ads lets hold an olympics this year
4156038 fairness from a country that supports its olympic athletes like professional athletes who are competing against men and women who are not only athletes but have to sustain themselves
4156039 its a massive fight and it will be my last
4156040 ive known for a while when i want to go out and as long as i put on a great performance this is my time
4156041 if i can do that then ive achieved everything ive wanted to achieve in my career i would never forgive myself if i came to my last fight and threw it all away complacency is not in my mindset
4156042 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
4156043 there is no doubt in our mind that he knew we were coming to get him
4156044 unfortunately mr fontanez decided not to go peacefully and it turned violent
4156045 my kid was a good kid they didnt have to kill him
4156046 they had him down so whyd they have to shoot him i dont understand
4156047 it makes no sense they could have waited for arraignment to set bail or take him into custody
4156048 all i can say is there was a valid arrest warrant and we made the decision to pick him up
4156049 i cant tell you exactly how that determination was made
4156050 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
4156051 its called the american dream because you have to be asleep to beleive it
4156052 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
4156053 no need to step in the road when you have motorcycle units and patrol cars in the waiting to pull the speeder over unfortunately the cop is dead because he put himself in the middle of the highway infront of a speeding car doing 55 in a 45 had he stepped out into the lane of traffic and gotten hit at 45 instead of the speeders 55mph hed have been just as dead dont they teach you cops like they did us in the military to miminize and mitigate risk
4156054 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
4156055 either support for a virtual project or real partnership with russia on issues that demand collective action
4156056 to begin to repair the damage to its relations with the united states europe and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world russia must keep its word and act to end this crisis
4156057 we know that the russian government controls those servers theoretically if they have not been pwned by somebody else
4156058 while some are speculating about cyber warfare and state sponsorship we have no data to indicate anything of the sort at this time we are seeing some botnets some well known and some not so well known take aim at georgia websites
4156059 compared to the may 2007 estonian attacks these are more intense but have lasted so far for less time this could be due to a number of factors including more sizeable botnets with more bandwidth better bandwidth at the victims changes in our observations or other factors
4156060 i felt tired before the competition but after it i feel relaxed
4156061 i thought a month ago if i would get this medal i would be every emotional
4156062 but im really not because we won the team gold medal
4156063 we have been working hard for eight years for this medal
4156064 but he handled it like a champion and i respect him very much
4156065 i never look at the scoreboard and think thats it
4156066 the chinese team is responsible for a lot of peoples dreams
4156067 this year has not been very good for china theres been a lot of disasters so these olympic games theres a lot of pressure its impossible not to be nervous and its how to cope with the nerves is our job and right now i feel very excited
4156068 after so many years of competition especially in the all around there is no pressure from the outside anymore
4156069 you can think about the what if what if what if
4156070 did in a way spoil the victory ceremony for me
4156071 this will be my last match i wanted to take gold so i consider this olympics a failure
4156072 we are in contact with the wrestling federation to establish the exact facts
4156073 for some time relative calm was maintained in south ossetia
4156074 the war games included a us navy supercarrier battle group an us navy expeditionary carrier battle group a royal navy carrier battle group a french nuclear hunter killer submarine plus a large number of us navy cruisers destroyers and frigates playing the
4156075 a strategic diversion has been created for russia the south ossetia capital has been shelled and a large georgian tank force has been heading towards the border american marines a thousand of them have recently been in georgia training the georgian military forces russia has stated that it will not sit by and allow the georgians to attack south ossetia this could get bad and remember it is just a strategic diversion but one that could have horrific effects
4156076 cases of possible threats by russia directed at georgia with the intention of taking control over the baku ceyhan pipeline
4156077 russia actively tends to isolate the central asian region from direct access to world economy especially to energy supplies if georgia government is destabilized western access to baku caspian sea and further will be limited
4156078 ever since the continents started interacting politically some five hundred years ago eurasia has been the center of world power the key to controlling eurasia says brzezinski is controlling the central asian republics
4156079 brzezinski russias invasion of georgia is reminiscent of stalins attack on finland
4156080 the russians deliberately provoked the fighting in south ossetia and timed it for the olympics this is a long standing russian effort to get rid of president saakashvili

4156126 cases of possible threats by russia directed at georgia with the intention of taking control over the baku ceyhan pipeline
4156127 russia actively tends to isolate the central asian region from direct access to world economy especially to energy supplies if georgia government is destabilized western access to baku caspian sea and further will be limited

4156157 russia deployed its tanks and troops to south ossetia to save the lives of civilians and to reestablish the peace period it has no interest in annexing the former soviet country or in expanding its present borders now that the georgian army has been routed russian president medvedev and prime minister putin have expressed a willingness to settle the dispute through normal diplomatic channels at the united nations neither leader is under any illusions about washingtons involvement in the hostilities they know that georgian president mikail saakashvili is an american stooge who came to power in a cia backed coup the so called rose revolution and would never order a major military operation without explicit instructions from his white house puppetmasters

4156162 its a very seminal period an opportunity to both celebrate 20 years of content and the fact that the source was a leader in chronicling the culture of hip hop
4156163 im on a mission to restore it to the community that gave birth to it and open the door to those that currently enjoy and influence that hip hop culture
4156164 its exciting because we believe that we can do it
4156165 we shared with him what we were trying to do the vision of hip hop and where we thought it needed to go and he thought it was refreshing and clever
4156166 were just going to expand on what the source has always done well
4156167 a core focus but not 80 percent of the book
4156168 i think that what were trying to do is evolve it as hip hop has evolved and become an international force to evolve it without losing its core essence that was the centerpiece of its earliest beginnings and greatness but it has to evolve just like hip hop has to evolve
4156169 it is a force nobody can deny the force or the power of the source but is it the same as it was five years ago no
4156170 it does not deliver with the same punch that it used to
4156171 if they are true to the dna of the publication
4156172 it left off so much of what is the key ingredients of hip hop and lifestyle now which is lifestyle fashion online new media international aspects of how people embrace content

4156181 maybe one day id write a song and somebody would sing it and then no one would really know that i wrote it
4156182 it would be kind of exciting and i had heard that prince did that and it was just kind of a goal for me
4156183 that is the feeling i have been looking for and it feels very good
4156184 i said to him for todays competition just let it go
4156185 you are out there by yourself if you think about competing with others that is when the mental mistakes can happen because you are not so strong psychologically
4156186 i was in very good shape back then if i couldnt win a gold then i thought i could never get a gold extra training would not have had an effect

4156191 a federal judge ruled friday that the university of california is permitted to reject certain christian curricula as inadequate for meeting admission requirements the university of california uc system has decided that high school students who use certain christian textbooks will not be considered to have taken the requisite courses necessary for admission to the university
4156192 the uc argued that these texts were deemed inadequate purely on an objective assessment of their educational content acsi contends that the inclusion of christian material in no way compromised the curriculum
4156193 jennifer monk the plaintiffs lawyer condemned the decision as a threat to the religious freedom of christian education
4156194 it appears that uc is attempting to secularize private religious schools
4156195 science courses from a religious perspective are not approved if it comes from certain publishers or from a religious perspective uc simply denies them
4156196 this case is about the future of private religious education and the right to be able to have your kids learn from a religious perspective
4156197 this issue of the impact that the increasing energy costs have on industry is not going to go away

4156242 thats the programs goal giving people a wide variety of opportunities to go hunting
4156243 one of the things hunters have told us through our surveys is that they use the public hunting program to diversify
4156244 they might have a deer lease where they can hunt deer but they like to hunt ducks too so they use the public hunting program to find places they can hunt waterfowl

4156265 a credit card is self managed and you decide how much you charge each month how close you get to your limit whether you let it grow each month or pay it off
4156266 at 600 to 620 it would mean a higher fee up to around 700 and above that no additional fee
4156267 a 20 000 limit over several cards with just 4 000 charged is better than one card with a 5 000 limit with the same 4 000 charged you want to show youre not charging up to the max
4156268 many inquiries in a short period of time might suggest you are trying to take on large amounts of debt both issues are signs of risk
4156269 as long as its on the credit report whether its open or closed low balance or no balance or old or new if its on the report the score is going to count it when counting that mix or when looking at the ideal number of cards closing it is never going to help your score
4156270 so many people are using credit to live beyond their means
4156271 in an ideal world everybody would pay in full and youd use your credit card for convenience there are times when it is neat to be able to use credit where you can spend more than you pay in one month or at holidays or for emergency but youve got to stop and create a plan to get it paid back it keeps your revolving balance low
4156272 manage your debt so that 28 percent of gross monthly income is your housing payment 38 percent for all payments to creditors

4156274 one of the most powerful pamphlets ever written in australia
4156275 i had hoped there would be some hope at the end of germaine greers essay
4156276 the aboriginal establishment will fall all over me for sexualising the problem
4156277 theyll all fall on me like a tonne of bricks
4156278 if writers are not candid they are not doing their job properly
4156279 but you know we married couples always have these little things we work through
4156280 i dont define myself as a writer so im thrilled and honoured to be in such company
4156281 they cant get over it the rage and its inhuman to ask them to get over it
4156282 i want aboriginal men to take more responsibility to stand up to violence against women and children
4156283 but when it is happening of course government has a responsibility to stop it its not rage thats killing these communities it is the sense of resignation that nothing can change it can change it must change
4156284 we cant minimise how we deal with violence at a personal level it requires accountability and personal responsibility on the part of perpetrators
4156285 in the communities there is still too much denial and looking away
4156286 the prime minister john howard had responded to the call of the indigenous women to come to the aid of them and their children
4156287 once more the white man was being chosen over the dysfunctional black man as the protector of children the defeat of the black man was absolute
4156288 the already persecuted women will be seen as having colluded with the enemy to remove the few strands of self esteem the indigenous man had left
4156289 the main concern i have with what she is saying is that it actually gives a sense of no hope

4156299 its hard to think of an issue these days that doesnt have a science or high tech angle to it
4156300 my real goal is to make the dialogue more based in knowledge and fact because i think that will cool down the rhetoric and help bring opposite sides of the political spectrum together to reach agreement
4156301 there used to be a science advisory committee that was in constant contact with the president and was expected to think through technology and make suggestions
4156302 i doubt that he knew for example that hydrogen is currently made from fossil fuels in a process that emits greenhouse gases or that liquid hydrogen contains only a quarter the energy of gasoline per gallon severely limiting an autos range
4156303 the basics needed to be an informed critical thinking citizen of our country
4156304 a lot of people base their opinions on the equivalent of urban legends stories that are so powerful that you assume they are incontrovertible but which may not actually be true
4156305 people are afraid of radioactivity because it is invisible and unknown
4156306 but that doesnt mean that we cant detect and work with it part of this wariness is that people dont trust the government when it says dont worry well they dont have to trust the government they can actually learn what levels of radioactivity are and what they cause and make their own judgment
4156307 is outside the purview of physics but policy should be based on facts and understanding
4156308 when i teach my class i say i dont care if you are pro or anti nuke youre going to learn about nukes
4156309 many who describe the report even members of the panel when speaking as individuals put spin on their description that is not in the report
4156310 in the end the issues go beyond physics but we need to recognize that many measures we institute in the united states to deal with global warming can be classified as feel good measures or setting the example measures
4156311 we have to ask ourselves which example the developing world will follow our example of reducing carbon emissions or our example of generating enormous wealth
4156312 just in asking the question he gave me a great complement
4156313 science should be nonpartisan and thats how i try teach it
4156314 selection has been a difficult process with a couple of our players unfortunately missing out
4156315 our aim is to be competitive but we do harbour hopes of creating an upset
4156316 im delighted that we have available all six of our current or former county players and we are all determined to show what we can do
4156317 over the past 18 months or so we have faced all the top test playing nations except england so this will be the final piece in that jigsaw
4156318 i wrote those to be provocative and i said i would not use that kind of politically incorrect language again and i dont believe i have
4156319 its not a material enough error to have mattered because its a very peripheral point

4156322 hopefully next year we will see an overall increase as these digital sales continue to grow
4156323 if you project those figures over the next three or four years you can see that there is real cause for optimism
4156324 what were seeing now is some people deciding not to buy an album but to buy four or six tracks from it
4156325 over time well see the ratio of album sales between cd and digital start to change people still prefer to buy albums in a cd format

4156344 when you scale infrastructure historically it was built to be as powerful as the highest performing application needed and everything else would benefit from that
4156345 now were looking at providing several different options of performance we dont have a one size fits all approach
4156346 today an application has so many hooks into an operating system and a platform that maintenance has to be done concurrently and its a very complex time consuming process

4156400 the combination of higher prices and increased gasoline consumption has raised the portion of income consumers allocate to gasoline to 3 8 per cent in the first quarter of 2008 from 2 9 per cent in 2002
4156401 the increase in spending on gasoline since 2002 was offset by the drop in the share of income devoted to purchasing autos from 6 2 per cent to 5 3 per cent the drop for autos entirely reflects lower prices as canadians increased vehicle purchases over the last six years

4156480 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
4156481 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
4156482 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
4156483 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
4156484 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
4156485 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

4156497 thats shocking the academic debate is between some who say that junior enlisted ranks lean slightly republican and some who say its about equal but no one would point to six to one
4156498 that represents a tremendous shift from 2000 when the military vote almost certainly was decisive in florida and elsewhere and leaned heavily towards the republicans
4156499 if on a bad day a guy gets that letter that says his tour has been extended from 12 to 15 months that could spur a quick donation and expression of anger
4156500 donating helps members of the military express their political views privately

4156560 too much privately rented property is in a poor condition and poorly managed the law does not operate as parliament intended
4156561 an increasing number of people are deciding to rent in the current economic climate making it more important than ever that the private
4156562 the recommendations in our report are aimed at benefiting both landlords and tenants by enabling them to use existing legal processes more productively thereby more fully realising the intended impact of housing legislation
4156563 implementation of these reforms would not only improve rental conditions for tenants but also help to build the reputation and professionalism of landlords
4156564 more broadly it would encourage institutional investment in the provision of rental accommodation enhancing the important role of this sector in the wider economy
4156565 if we are going to have a responsible private rented sector that can rid itself of bad landlords then an element of enforced regulation will be required thats the ultimate reality
4156566 a central regulator would ensure that the system worked effectively while genuine professional landlords will always welcome measures that effectively drive out the small minority who give the private rented sector a bad name
4156567 and our commitment to voluntary landlord accreditation schemes goes back to when the rla became the first professional association to work with local authorities for the benefit of landlords members and non members alike and tenants
4156568 so we welcome many of the law commissions proposals especially the rejection of across the board licensing within the private rented sector but for them to work effectively there needs to be some real benefits and incentives for landlords themselves
4156569 we do however detect a worrying inference in favour of institutional investment by corporate landlords which would force out individual landlords and we would fiercely resist that because there is a role for both
4156570 it made me feel a bit sick to my stomach

4156646 congressman pete sessions has been and continues to be a good friend to poker players who want the freedom to play americas greatest card game his dedication to the conservative principles of individual freedom and personal responsibility are unparalleled in the u s congress
4156647 we are however puzzled by the introduction of h r 6663 and by the purpose of this legislation while we agree with several findings in the bill that correctly identify the illegality of sports wagering the ppa remains concerned with the implication h r 6663 asserts in that the unlawful internet gambling enforcement act uigea has made internet poker an unlawful activity that needs special protection from prosecution
4156648 the ppa cannot support this bill in its current form we will however continue to advance other legislative priorities that rep sessions supports such as h r 2610 which recognizes poker as a game of skill and preserves the right of adults to enjoy poker on the internet

4156657 the united states has an opportunity to help increase the supply of oil on the market therefore taking pressure off gasoline for our hard working americans and that ive proposed to the congress that they open up anwr and open up the continental shelf and give this country a chance to help us through this difficult period
4156658 analysis of crude oil production in the arctic national wildlife refuge
4156659 the opening of the anwr 1002 area to oil and natural gas development is projected to increase domestic crude oil production starting in 2018
4156660 this analysis assumes that enactment of the legislation in 2008 would result in first production from the anwr area in 10 years i e 2018
4156661 124 spills with a total volume of roughly 17 700 barrels of total petroleum products
4156662 when katrina a cat 5 hurricane hit the gulf coast not one drop of oil was spilled off of those rigs out in the gulf of mexico
4156663 w e didnt have one drop of oil spilt when we had the biggest hurricane in you know recent history hurricane katrina
4156664 earlier this week on this program though you defended offshore drilling and said quote we withstood hurricanes rita and katrina and did not spill a drop in fact the u s mineral management service said that katrina and rita caused 124 offshore spills for a total of more than 743 000 gallons of oil and refined products spilled so nancy do you want to take back what you said
4156665 right well i actually do i was misinformed and my embarrassment aside the point is still that we had a remarkable performance
4156666 joint study by nasa and the smithsonian institution examining several decades worth of data found that more oil seeps into the ocean naturally than from accidents involving tankers and offshore drilling natural seepage from underwater oil deposits leaks an average of 62 million gallons a year offshore drilling on the other hand accounted for only 15 million gallons the smallest source of oil leaking into the oceans
4156667 almost 40 years later after the santa barbara spill the national academy of sciences says mother nature spills more oil into the environment than exxon shell b p and chevron combined 63 percent of all oil in u s coastal waters comes from natural seepage from cracks in the earth 32 percent from consumers in their boats and runoff from cities 4 percent from oil tankers and just 1 percent from offshore platforms
4156668 comparison of the impacts of seeps and spills based solely on volume would be misleading the evidence is clear that far from being invisible against a background of seeps major spills can have far greater and qualitatively different impacts on the environment than do seeps
4156669 natural seeps and spills differ in that seep rates do not on average exceed the marine environments capacity to digest the oil whereas spills may exceed its capacity major spills overwhelm natures mechanisms for processing the oil in the short term the consequences include severe oiling of shorelines and mortality to organisms that are ill prepared to live in an oil soaked environment
4156670 drilling is underway 60 miles off florida the drilling is being done by china in cooperation with cuba which is drilling closer to south florida than u s companies are
4156671 it is our understanding that although cuba has leased out exploration blocks 60 miles off the coast of southern florida which is closer than american firms are allowed to operate in that area no chinese firm is drilling there
4156672 jorge pinon a senior energy fellow at the university of miami specializing in latin america said cuba has awarded offshore oil leases or concessionary blocs in its offshore waters to six oil companies none of them chinese and soon may announce an agreement with brazils state oil company petrobras
4156673 but no one is currently drilling in any of those concessions
4156674 w eve got china you know joining with cuba theyre drilling 60 miles off our shores of florida

4156683 announced a 12 percent increase in its quarterly dividend on common stock
4156684 the oil companies insist theyre trying to find new oil that might help bring down gas prices but the money they spend on exploration is nothing compared with what they spend on stock buybacks and dividends
4156685 the five biggest international oil companies plowed about 55 percent of the cash they made from their businesses into stock buybacks and dividends last year according to rice universitys james a baker iii institute for public policy
4156686 i n the first quarter of this year exxon conocophillips and chevron were all among the top 10 companies for share buybacks in the s amp p 500
4156687 s tock buybacks are common throughout corporate america not just for big oil they shrink the amount of stock on the open market essentially increasing its value and giving individual shareholders a bigger stake in the company

4156689 only 001 percent of the oil produced has been spilled
4156690 every year oily road runoff from a city of 5 million could contain as much oil as one large tanker spill
4156691 im still not convinced that he actually was born a natural born citizen

4156696 let me make myself clear they spend their entire lives worrying about how people think they look which is why they have to always look perfectly put together and if they dont then it well lets put it this way people like you for example wont know who they really are which is of course miserable so long as they think they look perfect they think they are off the hook from suffering from real life atrocities like well your father for example

4156718 well he isnt here and he isnt in the kitchen and he isnt out in the car i heard noises coming from in here
4156719 i dont know no thats just how it happens them dont you know
4156720 people they fall off the face of the earth never to be seen again and thats that
4156721 oh hello rosalie you are looking especially radiant tonight i lost my pen it was the damndest thing it was a gift from my dear friend davey goodwill would have been a crying shame to have lost it but lo and behold i found it here it is right here in my hand and now
4156722 safely in my pocket care to join in on a little movie watching rosalie
4156723 so young in fact that you still need to be told you shouldnt be bothering adults with your silly games im going to take it upon myself to instruct you right here in front of mr jonathan marvel my boarder to apologize for disturbing his quiet evening with your childish shenanigans you shouldnt take advantage of his kind and generous nature of course he was only being polite and didnt want to offend you by telling you to scram apologize and get upstairs now
4156724 henny penny what a positively savage name for a drink
4156725 a henny penny what a positively savage name for a drink did you think of it yourself professor
4156726 ring around the messy uh oh we made a no no
4156727 i think its a positively blah name for a drink
4156728 the problem with her is that she spends far too much time watching those silly movies
4156729 i dont have a free hand and even if i did i dont want to make the handle sticky besides that its probably too hot to touch from having sat in the sun all day long metal retains heat you know
4156730 is that so well then perhaps you want me to
4156731 open the door for you is that what you want
4156732 unless you want me to stand out here i could you know it doesnt make an egg of a difference to me
4156733 wont you share just a little bit come on just a little just a little closer we dont want make a big mess now do we
4156734 the responsibility for the sound environmental management and product stewardship of end of life products should be shared among the consumer the manufacturer the retailer and state and local government waste management agencies
4156735 we have to get away from fossil fuels and dependence on oil and natural gas

4156737 she told the court and the psychologist that she had heard voices threatening the children and she wanted to protect them she killed them because she believed she was protecting them from these evil powers
4156738 its time to vote the effect of matching message orientation and temporal frame on political persuasion
4156739 imagine taking a vacation to cancun six months from now you are probably thinking about beaches sunsets and other abstract information on the other hand if you were going to cancun tomorrow you would be thinking about taxi cabs and boarding passes concrete concerns making you more likely to process information about speedy check in or the phone number of a taxi
4156740 similarly a voter facing a choice in the distant future is less interested in particular plans and policies and is more persuaded by broad abstract ideas it is only as the election gets closer that voters start paying attention to concrete details of the candidates positions in essence when the choice is far away a voter is more likely to think in abstract terms but as the choice approaches the voter puts more weight on the details
4156741 what this finding implies is that the people who typically decide elections voters in the middle are most susceptible to this type of persuasion political novices tend to be more persuaded by abstract messages when the choice is far off and by concrete messages when the choice is imminent
4156742 the fit of the right message with the right voter at the right time has never been more important to the outcome of a race
4156743 those who dont worry too much about prices and like to spend their money on travel or dinners rather than new cars are generally happier than those who spend a lot on expensive purchases and carry credit card debt
4156744 understanding the demographics and the different influences that play into gambling can help psychologists tailor their interventions for people who get into trouble
4156745 moderate income x gamblers big fish are at the most risk for losing the most money and suffering the most overwhelming financial and psychological consequences the whales can afford to lose money and the jumbo shrimps dont have much money to lose
4156746 this type of time frame helps people see steady progress along the way while not feeling too much pressure this is similar to some of the dieting regimens not too close so you dont see progress but not too far away either so you dont get discouraged
4156747 even though guilt and shame are often interchangeably used each is a distinct emotion
4156748 participants who felt guilty about the impulse buying used proactive coping strategies such as adjusting budgets and planning to reduce impulse buying in the future on the other hand shameful buyers used more avoidant emotion focused strategies such as denial and reframing the incident to be less injurious to the self
4156749 lessons learned from the past research in extreme environments training conditioning and countermeasures for psychological stress are some of the things nasa is in the process of addressing for the upcoming age of exploration
4156750 behavioral health problems can interfere with the success of the mission especially on long duration space flights like missions to the international space station the moon and mars these self guided software tools will provide private and immediate access to treatments even though the patient may be many miles from earth
4156751 for example they emphasized the importance of regular communication regarding work publicity and education all of which provide connection to earth and helped to reduce the perception of isolation
4156752 the closest analogue to mars exploration is the exploration of earth
4156753 both maritime and terrestrial explorers struck off into the unknown often for many years at a time
4156754 we believe that the main function of the tree is to facilitate the flow of water from the ground and into the atmosphere
4156755 to achieve that function the tree is ideally designed to not only maximize the flow of water but in order to be successful in the real world it must also be able to withstand the stresses of the wind it is exquisitely designed to do just that
4156756 the tree is a physical flow architecture that has evolved to meet two main objectives maximum mechanical strength against wind and maximum access for water coming from the ground through the tree and into the atmosphere
4156757 in the larger sense the forest itself is a flow system with the same mechanical properties and functions as the individual tree facilitating the flow of water across the globe
4156758 winds come in many speeds but their ultimate effect is cutting off trunks branches and leaves so whatever is too long or sticks out too much is shaved off
4156759 so the pattern of the tree is the result of the never ending assault by the wind
4156760 if the purpose of a tree was not to transport water it would look like the eiffel tower
4156761 it looks like mr french engineer gustave eiffel without knowing it designed a structure that corresponds with our constructal theory
4156762 these sarcophagi would have been a prominent feature of the landscape as they were carefully placed to be viewed being close to the road and at the time raised above the ground
4156763 they would certainly have had to belong to a wealthy family of a high status in the community perhaps at fort commander level or at senior level in the roman army very few people could have afforded to bury their child in such a grand fashion
4156764 it is very likely that a burial ceremony would have been held at the tombs perhaps attended by many people we know that some families hired professional mourners who would weep and wail and add to the atmosphere of the burial
4156765 for the first time we are starting to understand the layout of the civilian settlement that provided services to the garrison of the fort and we can catch a glimpse of the roman way of life and death on the northern frontier of the empire
4156766 i do not think this is a time to be holding onto foreclosed properties hoping for a better day
4156767 could start to stabilize as early as the first quarter of next year if the government program gains any traction
4156768 research shows that two thirds of patients high blood pressure is not controlled despite the best efforts of their doctors that is terrible
4156769 we are trying to identify the mechanisms through which blood pressure is regulated under normal everyday conditions which is what stress is and take that information back to the clinic to better determine what sort of therapy is going to be most effective at treating your blood pressure or your grandfathers
4156770 this research will give us information that allows us to identify what treatment is going to be effective in what individual by genotype by obesity and other factors what kind of treatment is going to be effective at keeping an individuals blood pressure down or maybe preventing it from ever getting high
4156771 we think there is a defect in their kidneys in the normal mechanisms that allow them to excrete salt
4156772 when blood pressure goes up due to stress their kidneys ought to get rid of more salt so their blood pressure will come down and they dont
4156773 we have animal model data that says the endothelin system normally functions to help your kidneys get rid of salt
4156774 from our point of view angiotensin promotes sodium retention directly and it also increases aldosterone another hormone which promotes sodium retention
4156775 ultimately you want to know how to treat people with this variation
4156776 there is still a need to figure out why some people respond to some therapies and other dont
4156777 that is not our specific question but these studies will help address that we have to identify what is it about different individuals that make them react more to stress makes them retain more salt
4156778 we are arguing in our study that you might want to treat patients differently depending on whether or not they are obese the angiotensin receptor blocker may be more effective in obese individuals who have angiotensin falling out into their bloodstream
4156779 we also found out that endothelin actually is the stimulus for increasing reactive oxygen species
4156780 when we gave the rats a specific type of endothelin blocker that also blocked the increase in oxidative stress blocked the blood pressure increase and improved recovery
4156781 this early life stressor is being mediated through the endothelin pathway
4156782 we took that to mean their blood pressure could also be hyper reactive sure enough that is what we found
4156783 this has a lot of implications for earlier detection of risk increasing environmental exposures and what you can do about it
4156784 if you cant alter the environment that quickly in life you know now where they are headed and maybe you can preempt it pharmacogenetically
4156785 what we are doing is looking at chronic environmental stress in combination with some bad candidate genes that are stress activated
4156786 if you have a tendency to have high blood pressure or if you are obese we can see the inner layer of the carotid getting thicker than normal people your age
4156787 but when we cant do that we want to give physicians ways to determine precisely the cause or causes of your hypertension and optimal ways to target your disease
4156788 first democrats failed on the radio airwaves with air america no one wanted to listen
4156789 conservative radio is a huge threat and political advantage for republicans and we have had to find a way to limit it second it looks like the republicans are going to have someone in the presidential race who has access to media in ways our folks dont want so we want to make sure the gop has no advantages going into 2008
4156790 across gannetts community publishing division about 1 000 positions will be eliminated about 3 of the workforce of the 1 000 positions about 600 employees will be laid off
4156791 the scales automatically recognize which fruit or vegetables are to be weighed and ask the customer to choose between only those icons that are relevant such as tomatoes vine ripened tomatoes and beefsteak tomatoes
4156792 the goods are registered by a camera integrated in the scales an image evaluation algorithm compares the image with stored data and thus automatically recognizes which type of fruit this is
4156793 the new scales are very tolerant to fluctuations in color and brightness the module can be employed under many different kinds of illumination and with different kinds of camera supermarket employees can of course extend the selection of fruit recognized by the scales to make it include new varieties
4156794 ingredients such as bloodroot shark cartilage coral calcium cesium ellagic acid
4156795 lobsters know when their shell is damaged and thats probably the reason when they have shell disease why they molt more quickly
4156796 but ultimately they still come down with the disease and we think the presence of alkyphenols contributes to that
4156797 plastics last a long time but breakdown products last even longer perhaps shell disease is only the tip of the iceberg of a more basic problem of endocrine disrupting chemicals in marine environments
4156798 there are two things that will send masses of people to hearings in montana messing with our rivers or our beer
4156799 this is an impeachment of the dictatorship that sold out pakistans sovereignty violated the constitution repeatedly and gave the people poverty price rise unemployment and backwardness
4156800 should a person who has reduced pakistan to this condition be given safe passage they ask for safe passage after breaking the law and violating the constitution selling out the countrys sovereignty ruining the country and making the people poor
4156801 we became independent only to be imprisoned by military dictatorship and pakistan was ruled by military dictators for 33 years we wanted the country to be ruled by its crores of people but instead it was ruled by a few generals
4156802 today after a long time we have achieved freedom again and this impeachment is not of pervez musharraf it is an impeachment of the dictatorship that destroyed 61 years in pakistans life

4156807 this research may change our view of matter and the universe
4156808 a system this complex could only be designed by bringing together the best minds from the university of toronto and ibm
4156809 this is a tremendous example of public and private collaboration that will benefit the canadian research community for many years to come

4156816 an ap article today on the gaos new report on corporate tax liabilities contains a serious error that undermines the storys thesis
4156817 the ap reported that according to the gao study comparing tax liabilities of corporations from 1998 2005 about 25 percent of the u
4156818 after careful review of the aps story tax foundation economist josh barro found that the ap significantly overstated the number of large corporations not paying corporate taxes
4156819 these facts significantly undercut the thrust of the aps story which is that significant numbers of corporations especially large ones are avoiding tax liability barro stated

4156828 may also have to do with the fact that she and her no 1 show apparently paid a price in popularity for taking such a prominent political stance starting last year

4156844 the fact that increasing numbers of people are feeling the pinch is to be expected but these figures give an interesting picture of how people are actually coping with it at this time
4156845 whats interesting is that 51 of people still feel they are managing easily which may seem a high figure to some considering all the stories in the news at the moment
4156846 but its telling that the figure has fallen so sharply since 2006 which was a relatively good time for the economy
4156847 when the economy gets into trouble the effects can take a while to filter through many people are still managing well following the buoyant economy of 2006 to late 2007
4156848 but as the problems begin to filter through for example to homeowners struggling to sell their homes consumers facing higher food prices and bills etc we may well see more peoples circumstances take a turn for the worse
4156849 consumer confidence can be affected by things like the media portrayal of the economy but a large part of it does come down to personal situations
4156850 even those who have not been terribly affected by the credit crunch will have noticed how quickly the price of food and household costs are rising
4156851 we would advise everyone to keep a close watch on their finances at this time
4156852 a debt adviser will talk you through your situation and help you to decide the best course of action for example if you have a number of debts that you are struggling to balance with your household commitments a debt consolidation loan could help debt consolidation loans work by grouping all your debts together so you only repay one creditor instead of many
4156853 payments can be rescheduled over a longer period of time than the original debts meaning payments are lower which could be a useful way of freeing up extra money for your other living costs but be aware that rescheduling your debt consolidation loan will probably involve paying more in interest in the long run iva individual voluntary arrangement or debt management plan might be more suitable if youre unsure as with any debt solution speak to a debt adviser first
4156854 debt advisers urge care with finances as consumer confidence falls further

4156939 as college students all across the country prepare to return to campus our nations higher education system is set to begin a transformation that will make it more accessible affordable and accountable to consumers
4156940 by putting the interests of students first we have made great progress toward a higher education system that will continue to thrive today and into the future
4156941 i began this process some seven years ago with an effort to cut red tape and update the higher education act to better reflect the challenges and opportunities of the 21st century
4156942 today with enactment of the we have taken important steps toward achieving that goal

4156954 a lot of people cited the cost of games as a major reason for pirating many were kids with no cash and lots of time to play games but many were not i got a lot of peoples life stories and a ton of them were my age even those who didnt cite cost as their main reason almost always mentioned it at some stage a lot of anger was directed at the retail 60 games and console games people in australia were especially annoyed about higher prices there my games were 19 23 but for a lot of people it was claimed this was far too high people talked a lot about impulse buying games if they were much cheaper
4156955 people dont like drm we knew that but the extent to which drm is turning away people who have no other complaints is possibly misunderstood if you wanted to change one thing to get more pirates to buy games scrapping drm is it these gamers are the low hanging fruit of this whole debate
4156956 i only used drm for one game democracy 2 and its trivial its a one time only internet code lookup for the full version ive read enough otherwise honest people complain about drm to see that its probably hurting more than it helps i had planned on using the same system for kudos 2 but ive changed my mind on that i have also removed it from democracy 2 today i now use no drm at all
4156957 ive gone from being demoralized by pirates to actually inspired by them and im working harder than ever before on making my games fun and polished
4156958 bishops lost the one good lead he had on cable and now he has to start from scratch
4156959 how do you chase a guy who could be literally anywhere and any when in the timestream hell most of us have trouble finding matching socks but bishop comes up with something kind of cool this issue shows you what hes up to
4156960 bishops time jumping all over the place but its not a random search
4156961 theres a specific method to bishops madness meanwhile cables not exactly kicking back and relaxing either he knows bishop is not going to stop looking for him and the baby so hes taking some countermeasures which will mean all kinds of trouble for bishop
4156962 theyre like those little guys from spy vs spy only with time machines and automatic weapons
4156963 cables knowledge of the future is 20 centuries deep while bishops is only about 80 years comparatively the lifespan of a mayfly so yeah while bishops future may have kind of sucked cable seems to have a longer view in mind
4156964 before the end of the year youre really going to see things from bishops point of view and it will explain just that
4156965 bishop isnt your typical antagonist twirling his goatee well if he still had one waiting for his evil plans to hatch
4156966 in fact hes having a miserable time of coming easy for this poor guy as youll see in this issue despite the fact that hes an incredibly tough smart resourceful mutant preview art by
4156967 also dont forget bishop may be right he could be the hero despite what everyone thinks which makes him all the more compelling to me
4156968 some preview art from 7 has shown cable with a ring on his finger and in bed next to a gorgeous woman
4156969 clearly hes never listened to his fathers warnings about redheads

4157006 e dumalaw lang kasi rin siya dito ipinakilala ko siya sa mga department heads pero ako teka muna ang dami ko pang dapat gawin dito sa batangas im not entertaining it
4157007 ang sweet naman niya thank you naman kay bong pero ah he can plan his political career he can plan it if he really wants to run then go ahead wala naman siyang dapat i worry sa akin
4157008 thank you bong thank you naman pero you do your thing you dont have to worry about me i appreciate it pero wala because ang concentration ko ngayon talaga focused sa batangas wala ka namang magagawa ng dalawang taon lang e alam mo ang ibig kong sabihin three years ang term mo as a governor pero on the third yan naman hindi ka na napapakinabangan dahil nag uumpisa na ulit ng kampanyahan yan
4157009 so far so good awa naman ng panginoon maganda yung koleksyon buo yung maganda ang aming local revenues collection solid ang programa ko wala pa akong isang taon nalibot ko na ang buong batangas lahat ng 34 na bayan
4157010 ah so far im getting the full cooperation of my sangguniang panglalawigan yan ang pinaka mahirap kasi e pag hindi mo kasama ang iyong sangguniang panglalawigan mahihirapan ka being the executive kasi lahat yan dadaan sa sanggunian mo e
4157011 ah i think diyan medyo nahihirapan si ano si father eddie panlilio am i right
4157012 but im very thankful even yung mga mayor na hindi ko naging kasama noon theyre been very very supportive
4157013 wala namang pagkakataon na walang bumatikos sa akin maski nung mayor pa ako dito pinagbibintangan ako ng jueteng jueteng god knows unang first month ko pa lang dito sa lahat ng buong bayan nagpalabas na ako ng sulat saying na i am not encouraging any form of gambling including jueteng
4157014 and then may mga lumalabas diyan na may share daw ako may kotse
4157015 but ako lang mapapatunayan ko sa inyo im not encouraging it walang sugal na pupuwede sa akin pero i cannot do this alone ayaw ninyo bantayan ninyo e diyos ko paano ko mababantayan tulungan ninyo ako
4157016 kasi ganito yan wala silang masasabi sa mga programa ko na pinapatupad e humahanap talaga sila ng lahat ng butas na pupuwede nilang ibato sa akin meron bang namintas sa mga programa ko
4157017 but again ang point ko dito kung puro jueteng ang iisipin ko sa buhay ko dito ay wala akong magagawa sa constituents ko hindi lang jueteng ang problema ng lalawigan napakaraming dapat pang gawin hindi ba
4157018 kung yun ang iko concentrate ko dahil tintira ninyo ako diyan e teka muna excuse me hindi lang jueteng ang problemna mas maraming gutom dito at uunahin ko yun at uunahin ko na masiguro na maganda ang kinabukasan sa edukasyon ng mga bata kaya ngayon ibato ninyo nang ibato gawin ninyo
4157019 pinapaliwanag lang sa kanila kasi sinasabi nila si ralph ang si ralph ginawa yun for the country e
4157020 napaka negative na niya tinanong ko nga siya nagsisisi ka ba dahil sa vat issue sabi niya no no regrets kung mangyayari ulit yun sa atin at alam ko yan ang makaka save sa bansa natin ganun pa rin ang desisyon kong gagawin kahit hindi nila ako iboto yun ang sinabi niya i respect that
4157021 kung nagpunta kayo dito nung first six months ko makikita ninyo sa blackboard siya lahat ang gumawa bakit ito ang dapat magkano ang budget dito nasa blackboard para alam ko kung saan ako pupunta without ralph din paano ko gagawin lahat yan
4157022 e unang una hindi naman ako politiko pinag aralan ko yes pero ang expertise hindi ko alam kung saan ko kukunin yun kaya ngayon napakadali naman sa akin dito sa batangas ah hindi pa dumarating yung krisis natin alam na namin kaya nakaka prepare kami
4157023 ah wala akong ano wala akong political plan pero kung halimbawang tatakbo ako ulit for another term parang gugustuhin ko pa rin na tapusin yung mga programa
4157024 oo i dont mind kahit nine years pa basta ma implement lahat ng programa ko makita nila ang pagbabago ah alam na dito napayagan na ako at ibig kong sabihin walang ibang pinakamaganda kasi kundi yung continuity ng programa e
4157025 ah kasi yung mga programa hindi mo matatapos ng isa dalawang taon ang mangyayari niyan puro umpisa kasi kapag may pumasok na naman na iba papalitan na naman niya lahat yun ang nakakahirap sa ating pilipino kapag may nakita kang magandang programa which i did also in lipa noon ang ganda nung lipa city public college imagine mo kay mayor ruben umali yun hindi ko siya tinanggal ginandahan ko pa yung lipa city public college di ba
4157026 so ngayon ang usapan namin nina malou at least basta nakita ko na ang programa ko ongoing after one year and then smooth na pupuwede ako and nag meeting na ako sa kanila
4157027 meron dito pero meron din sa new york nabasa ko nga yung write up kay john lloyd na touch naman ako nung nabalitang hindi matutuloy
4157028 sabi niya intindihin naman natin si ate vi kasi bagong upo lang siya which is true kasi siyempre akala niya baka tinanggihan ko hindi kasi maganda yung movie maganda talaga yung movie
4157029 meron akong anak na bading pero wala na yung maraming maraming bading isa lang tapos nagkaroon ng relasyon kay john lloyd pero later on mamamatay yung anak ko kaming dalawa ang mag eengkwentro ngayon dahil galit ako sa kanya
4157030 hindi pero in fairness kay shawie hindi lang naman ito ang huli naming usapan nung birthday ni ate cristy fermin
4157031 gusto ko yung ano e gusto ko yung ano pelikulang ano yung mag friendship na nag suicide sa huli
4157032 pero hindi naman kailangang hindi naman natin gagayahin yung ending pero yung tema ng character puwede yun
4157033 kung ako yun ang ideya ko ng movie naming dalawa pero hindi ko alam kay shawie kung ano ang gusto niya but si shawie sabi niya ate vi kahit extra lang ako kahit na ano matuloy lang ang movie natin together alam mo naman si shawie

4157046 the potential for alarmism is high and therefore this paper invites the highest level of scrutiny which it does not in my view sufficiently bear to warrant publication
4157047 studies that include only liquidated funds such as the one by kaplan and schoar have a
4157048 place eight cones three feet apart in a line and then do three sets of each of the following exercises weave through them at a sprint weave through them while high stepping jump over them with your feet together and weave through them while facing sideways
4157049 lie on your back on a decline bench holding a weight plate against your chest with both hands then lift your upper body off the bench about 6 inches holding this position press the weight plate straight up from your chest as if youre doing a bench press lower the weight but not your torso and repeat do 12 presses rest 1 minute and repeat once or twice
4157050 in the up position of the exercise raise your thighs in front of you until theyre parallel to the floor and bend your knees 90 degrees hold your legs that way for the entire movement instead of crossing them behind you this redistributes your weight so that your torso leans forward as you lower your body placing more of the stress on your chest instead of your shoulders
4157051 the best way to bolster balance is with an overhead squat stand with your feet shoulder width apart and grasp a length of pvc pipe with a grip thats slightly wider than shoulder width hold it eight to 12 inches above your head keeping your chest out torso erect and heels on the ground press the pipe upward as you squat down as far as you can go without arching your back and then rise up do three sets of five to 10 reps start doing it with a barbell when the pvc pipe becomes easy
4157052 when you hit a wall dont train harder or attempt to force muscle growth by piling on more weight reduce your load by 10 to 20 pounds in other words if you want to bust out of a rut undertrain for a week or two
4157053 most guys do body weight exercises incorrectly they focus on reps when they should really be concentrating on time rather than shoot for say three sets of 10 push ups do as many as you can in 30 seconds employ the same strategy with pull ups dips and single leg squats resting for 30 seconds between each set

4157055 i think that our job here at nsb kings bay is very important because this is a very large base and with the dogs we can assist in providing the best all around security of the commands and their staffs
4157056 in my opinion it is very critical to have these dogs here because of what they can do that we cant their noses are a hundred times better than humans and they can do the job twice as fast
4157057 the idea is to leave one handler with one dog during their tour at kings bay
4157058 with ias that come up for iraq or afghanistan sometimes we have to switch handlers with others dogs to help the mission
4157059 if not for the ias the goal is to keep handlers with they dogs for the entire tour so they can continue to grow and bond with one another in order to achieve our goals it would be very difficult to have to keep training a new dog every few months because the dogs will tend to lose that bond with their original handler
4157060 each of the dogs have their own personality just like the handlers have theirs which sometimes do not mix well together but the kennel master is responsible for assigning the dogs with their appropriate handlers and as it turns out they have done a great job
4157061 just like all good sailors dogs want to retire whether it be because of physical reasons or age
4157062 yossi has been a great dog but has had some hip problems that have hindered him so if we could have found someone to take him on board it would be great fortunately it was his handler kinyon which makes it even better because the dog gets to continue his life where we know he will be taken care of very well anytime you can get that marriage between handler and dog it is a good thing

4157068 democrats in congress seem too busy trying to embarrass and humiliate the lame duck administration of george bush rather than defending the right of our soldiers to participate in our democracy why the democratic obstructionism perhaps maybe possibly it has something to do with the belief backed up by studies that military personnel tend to vote republican by large percentages democrats only advocate and promote the expansion of voting when it helps their party not our soldiers and not america

4157076 one of the greatest piece of economic wisdom is to know what you do not know
4157077 each mutual fund you invest in should have its own benchmark even if it is an index fund and your portfolio should be an appropriate fixed mix of those benchmarks the benchmarks should all be capitalization weighted indexes that represent the investable universe in that asset class

4157101 the future of digital multicast channels is to stay local
4157102 many stations with major network agreements have limitations on their ability to present local programming
4157103 the challenge stations have is to find content that will attract viewers and one of the most obvious places to look is at content thats worked on their flagship stations
4157104 if you think about the ad inventory that can get moved that way stations could see an 8 to 10 bump to their bottom line
4157105 these channels require a financial and an emotional commitment and people need to get those digital tvs when they do theyll be surprised at how much is out there already

4157158 its really about these crazy killer fish who are going to eat all these drunk kids and drunk bikini girls for me its the ultimate guilty pleasure movie

4157162 its a piranha movie there is absolutely nothing from those movies
4157163 it really pushed me to make this movie it gives the immersion factor more than anything else and it also gives that entertaining aspect
4157164 thats the way were going to get people back in the screening room and stop downloading movies is 3 d were going to make the movie experience such a ride that you wouldnt even want to download the movie

4157189 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
4157190 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
4157191 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
4157192 some seventy years ago a traveller in the australian bush riding up at nightfall to a solitary cabin in the district between the murray and murrumbidgee rivers would have found the owner sitting alone at a rough and frugal dinner in complete evening dress

4157203 the whole thing was going to be determined at this sadc summit

4157206 there is disagreement on one element over which morgan tsvangirai had asked for time to reflect

4157209 the loss in value due to foreign exchange for the cyclone nargis international humanitarian aid during the last three months has been about 1 56 million dollars
4157210 we are not getting the full value of dollars donated for emergency relief and donors are extremely worried and keen to see that this issue is resolved
4157211 the russians have started to withdraw the georgian police and special forces are taking control
4157212 the united states of america stands with the democratically elected government of georgia insists that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia be respected
4157213 to begin to repair the damage to its relations with the united states europe and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world russia must keep its word and act to end this crisis
4157214 we still have diplomatic relations with georgia we have millions of georgian nationals who are russian citizens and living happily in russia
4157215 but we wont directly talk to saakashvili we wont do that we offered him peace but not friendship
4157216 the united states of america stands strongly as the president of france just said for the territorial integrity of georgia
4157217 i would consider that to be bluster from the foreign minister of russia
4157218 we are very concerned about these reports it is a serious situation
4157219 credit is not bad its bad if you use it badly i encourage people to look at it as a tool that they manage you can get good rates rewards frequent flier miles you use it dont let it use you
4157220 the most important thing to improve your score is to have a credit card an installment loan is a fixed payment and you dont have to manage surprises
4157221 a credit card is self managed and you decide how much you charge each month how close you get to your limit whether you let it grow each month or pay it off
4157222 at 600 to 620 it would mean a higher fee up to around 700 and above that no additional fee
4157223 a 20 000 limit over several cards with just 4 000 charged is better than one card with a 5 000 limit with the same 4 000 charged you want to show youre not charging up to the max
4157224 many inquiries in a short period of time might suggest you are trying to take on large amounts of debt both issues are signs of risk
4157225 as long as its on the credit report whether its open or closed low balance or no balance or old or new if its on the report the score is going to count it when counting that mix or when looking at the ideal number of cards closing it is never going to help your score
4157226 so many people are using credit to live beyond their means
4157227 in an ideal world everybody would pay in full and youd use your credit card for convenience there are times when it is neat to be able to use credit where you can spend more than you pay in one month or at holidays or for emergency but youve got to stop and create a plan to get it paid back it keeps your revolving balance low
4157228 manage your debt so that 28 percent of gross monthly income is your housing payment 38 percent for all payments to creditors

4157230 there are times like its one of those cities i might catch some flack for saying this but you know theyre front runners when youre doing good theyre on your side when youre doing bad theyre completely against you
4157231 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
4157232 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
4157233 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
4157234 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
4157235 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
4157236 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
4157237 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
4157238 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
4157239 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
4157240 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
4157241 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
4157242 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
4157243 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
4157244 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
4157245 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
4157246 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
4157247 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
4157248 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
4157249 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
4157250 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
4157251 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
4157252 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
4157253 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
4157254 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
4157255 i didnt know who bucky covington was or that he had anything to do with american idol but i was jamming with him i really liked him a lot

4157264 as painful as it is we have a responsibility to keep our commitment to the international community to advance international peace and cooperation and advance the cause of african brotherhood and good neighbourliness
4157265 the fact that at lancaster house the terms of reference processes and funding including uk and u s assistance for agrarian reform were verbal and not written means that this fundamental issue was not taken seriously the british and their u s colleagues acted in bad faith
4157266 as regards the question of compensation for farmers whose land or properties were expropriated we believe that the international community must contribute funds for this purpose in particular the uk and usa in other terms he seems to subscribe to grand criminal larceny and uncompensated deprival and as conducted by zanu pf state enabled thieves
4157267 the uk government will work with a future administration that upholds the rule of law respects democratic principles and promotes sound economic policies
4157268 all title deeds of the farmers have been canceled with the british government having sole responsibility to compensate the evicted farmers

4157300 scotland has played a pivotal role in the development of the competition and i really believe we havent scratched the surface of what we can achieve its very exciting
4157301 we have been able to establish fantastic international partners all over the world and i think with the people and global family we have created we can build an amazing means of moving forward

4157332 critics point to the construction of 50 000 homes for jews in east jerusalem in the past four decades tight restrictions on building permits for palestinians in the eastern section and a zigzag barrier that israel is building to block off the west bank which has sliced off several of the citys arab districts with 60 000 people
4157333 maintaining a jewish majority in jerusalem is a key government objective but denied it has been pursued at the expense of the citys arabs
4157334 we believe in a jewish majority in jerusalem as such
4157335 as the city of jerusalem has grown from 265 000 to 750 000 over the past four decades the percentage of jews has shrunk steadily from74 to 66 percent mainly because iof the arabs higher birth rate and jewish migration from the city

4157340 the combination of higher prices and increased gasoline consumption has raised the portion of income consumers allocate to gasoline to 3 8 per cent in the first quarter of 2008 from 2 9 per cent in 2002
4157341 the increase in spending on gasoline since 2002 was offset by the drop in the share of income devoted to purchasing autos from 6 2 per cent to 5 3 per cent the drop for autos entirely reflects lower prices as canadians increased vehicle purchases over the last six years

4157365 most competitors overdraft charging structures are highly complicated and difficult for customers to understand the benefit of the new barclays structure is that a customer knows exactly what payments are going to go through what they are going to get charged and when
4157366 i dont think they are making the system any easier for consumers as the personal reserve isnt as clear as barclays make out indeed it has had to set up a video blog just to help explain it to customers the truth of the matter is that if overdraft charges were lower banks wouldnt need to resort to confusing reserves and buffer zones to try and make the charges more palatable

4157402 this substantial increase in revenues offers the iraqi government the potential to better finance its own security and finance needs
4157403 the iraqi government now has tens of billions of dollars at its disposal to fund large scale reconstruction projects it is inexcusable for u s taxpayers to continue to foot the bill for projects the iraqis are fully capable of funding themselves
4157404 we should not be paying for iraqi projects while iraqi oil revenues continue to pile up in the bank including outrageous profits from 4 a gallon gas prices in the u s
4157405 despite iraq earning billions of dollars in oil revenue in the past five years u s taxpayer money has been the overwhelming source of iraq reconstruction funds
4157406 it is time for the sovereign government of iraq using its revenues expenditures and surpluses to fully assume the responsibility to provide essential services and improve the quality of life for the iraqi people
4157407 to assume were going to pay for it all is just wrong
4157408 nonetheless the pace of spending has been held back by various factors including deficiencies in capacity and security

4157434 when youre in the position i am sometimes its tough to see whos really with you it takes going through stuff like that to know who your real friends are now i know
4157435 yeah it was disappointing to lose 4 1 and it still hurts
4157436 but you gotta know that youve taken steps forward individually and as a team and build off that i came to the realization last summer that if youre not in shape and you have to just rely on talent alone youre not gonna get it done so im building off what i did last summer and taking it to the next level this summer
4157437 ive just started getting in the ring and shadow boxing with my coach i havent done any real sparring yet because im still learning form and technique in that sense its a lot different from street fighting and theres no one hitting you back
4157438 as he has gotten older hes come to understand that in order to maintain his edge he has to continuously to work harder to grow
4157439 he understands that he has to maintain that edge this is a league where theres always a young guy ready to take your place once he realized that you can only go so far on talent alone he became very serious working out became a 24 hour commitment an all consuming process
4157440 i mean wed go head to head in drills or one on one and he just gets after it every time
4157441 and you look at what hes added to his game and its unbelievable people dont realize how well he can handle the ball hes 6 9 and im 6 1 and it was like his handle was as good as mine
4157442 hes worked a lot on his dribble efficiency seeing angles and getting to the basket quicker and harder hes one of the fastest ive ever seen at taking something straight from a drill and incorporating it right into a game situation thats the sign of a great one
4157443 i think by me and lebron coming out at the same time it helped both of us
4157444 because every time you hear his name you hear my name you hear my name you hear his name it was good timing for both of us
4157445 that comparison to lebron is gonna be with me forever and im ok with that now
4157446 there arent many guys out there with their own irl teams it was just something that was different and that no one else was really doing its an up and coming thing that im excited to be a part of
4157447 when i found myself getting used to it i realized i had to separate myself from lebron
4157448 wtf no melo i dont get why my man cant get love all he does is win and put up numbers sounds like you guys have bought into the media stuff about him since he has been in the league he has taken a back seat to lebron who has yet to make the playoffs now he has to sit back while chris bosh who hasnt made the playoffs either gets all this love all melo did was win an ncaa title as a freshman make the playoffs every year in the toughest conference and up his numbers without all the hype
4157449 damn melo you just made those kids year thats all theyre gonna talk about for like the next four months

4157520 simply put three of the uks largest isps virgin media bt and talktalk have decided to sell your private browsing history to an advertising broker
4157521 yes the entire content of every web page you visit gets sent to phorm in real time as you click a personal profile is created allowing phorm to send you targeted advertising
4157522 naturally the isps are not too keen on telling their users this theyd much rather feed us all platitudes about how itll help combat phishing and how the targeted adverts will be so much better than the random ones we see today

4157534 i would rather have an officer and everyone in the courtroom than the chaos outside

4157536 i thought you got to be kidding me theyre pulling me over on my lawnmower no way i just could not believe it
4157537 if its used for a mode of transportation they can be charged
4157538 you cant go out there with the motoring public just because of the size of the mower and its not designed for any type of highway travel it travels at such a slow speed
4157539 he did mention the bicycle but i still didnt think my lawnmower was illegal you dont have to register it you dont need insurance on it i wasnt going to endanger anybody going to work
4157540 then again how did they know i was driving my lawnmower back and forth to work unless they were watching me
4157541 if she drove that lawnmower across the field to get from her house to the farm thatd be fine she was clearly told by the judge that shes not to operate motor vehicles on the highway
4157542 im not going to lie to you man your legs are real bad
4157543 the ioc does disapprove of any attempts to hinder a journalist who is going about doing his job seemingly within the rules and regulations
4157544 this we hope has been addressed we dont want to see this happening again
4157545 i think im swimming faster than i was in sydney and athens and ive just got to get up and do it
4157546 the depth is amazing so who knows what can happen when all those people come together and have a one off race
4157547 i just want to go out there for those 40 something girls and show that age is just a number
4157548 it was a sort of emptiness you climb the mountain and there is nothing at the top
4157549 when you work so hard to achieve something and you get it at the end there is a feeling of emptiness but then life goes on
4157550 i have won honour for all archers in china and i believe the future will be brighter
4157551 i dreamed i could win a gold medal every day i was well prepared it was a hard journey but i finally made it

4157553 this is an administrative issue and we would not like to go through the media
4157554 from our side we have not sold any olympic footage rights to anybody because we wanted to have the exclusive rights in the country for the subscribers
4157555 some broadcasters have approached dd for the footage but the request was turned down
4157556 im think he still hasnt found a good chemistry with yao this isnt easy but today much better
4157557 i cant understand this whos discussing this youre discussing this
4157558 supposed to be funny or something but never offensive in any way
4157559 im sorry if anybody thought or took it the wrong way and thought that it was offensive
4157560 its kind of a place where guys can relax and socialize

4157566 what happens in the days and months to come will determine the course of future us russia relations
4157567 my view is that the russians and i would say principally prime minister putin are interested in reasserting russias great power and super power status
4157568 i want to first of all express my condolences to the families of these murdered humanitarian workers
4157569 this is obviously an outrage a terribly brutal act which i think should remind everybody of the brutality of the taliban and the danger that everybody there faces
4157570 this was a despicable senseless and cowardly attack on people who were working to improve the lives of some of the most disadvantaged people in afghanistan
4157571 i join the international community in condemning this brutal act
4157572 we are absolutely outraged by this cowardly attack against humanitarian workers people who were in a marked humanitarian vehicle
4157573 i was always a little bit nervous of early phone calls whenever jacquie was in afghanistan
4157574 i wanted people to understand how important her work was
4157575 i woke up this morning thinking that if there were enough women like jacquie in afghanistan the taliban would be laughed out of their village
4157576 she saw that there was so much need and she had so much drive to try and make the world a better place
4157577 we urge the government to restore the original cabinet order rather than adopt a do nothing policy
4157578 it is with a deep sense of disappointment that i am writing to you with regard to the issue
4157579 the recent events have shown that the people in jammu are now determined to assert in order to claim their fair share in the matter of both governance and development of the region

4157581 we were pleased with the waca reaction that the new playing dates offer local fans including corporate groups wanting to entertain at the cricket good dates for a pre christmas test match

4157638 yes maam i remember being very young walking into my living room only to see my brother reading a dictionary honestly i thought the entire idea of reading a dictionary was stupid at the time but then he started using terms that i didnt understand and all of his friends thought that being a well spoken person was cool so i started learning as many huge words as i could find but then one day all of the didlake brothers were sitting in front of a television screen watching something when a commercial for the infinite j 30 came on we were all amazed at how the guy actually accented his t at the end of thirty it blew us away so we all started challenging ourselves to speak with fluency and accuracy

4157658 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4157659 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4157660 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4157661 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

4157665 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
4157666 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
4157667 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
4157668 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
4157669 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
4157670 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
4157671 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
4157672 not only do we support it but we will guarantee them both in the caucasus and throughout the world
4157673 la mayor a no va a misa ni son practicantes pero se declaran cat licas es posible que su conducta se deba a que es peor y ser a m s cuestionada por su familia y religi n que ellas queden embarazadas
4157674 las ni as con m s de 17 a os tienden a sentirse m s grandes y eso de alguna forma hace que relajen su cuidado de embarazarse y para las chicas que no tienen expectativas claras respecto a su futuro pareciera que el embarazo no es un tema tan fundamental como que en el fondo les da un poco lo mismo
4157675 porque tras el t rmino de un pololeo dejan de tomar sus pastillas y no son lo suficientemente previsoras en retomarlas al reanudar actividad sexual con otra pareja

4157681 despite kants legacy in aesthetics being huge vast and incalculably influential
4157682 tsk tsk so late in the evening she sits alone at a table having grub like this
4157683 and what a grim tale it is the dark knight is as brooding as it can get it would seem that frank millers comic book caper is not so much american but propels itself towards european morbidity
4157684 bruce waynes trusted lieutenants distance themselves from him leaving him lonely and with no kindred spirits his girlfriend rachel dawes if left bereft of any promise of love she dies with batman failing to deliver on love and hope and his fleeting kiss holds no promise or passion this is the story of two swashbuckling men who dont save the girl or get her heck they dont even get to read her last letter no wonder the one man who is tipped to win an oscar for the film is the joker and alas that too posthumously
4157685 despite batmans sexual caprices in the past with wicked creatures like cat woman there has been enough debate whether batmans relationship with the lad robin is healthy at all going by dc comics in the dark knight returns the comic book throws open new questions batman is portrayed as a middle aged social misfit alcoholic depressed unmarried and lonely and comes to battle once again in his saviour form his companion is a 13 year old robin who is actually a girl carrie kelley
4157686 super heroes and comic book crusaders are not quite what they started out to be these days the 1950s were hailed as the golden era of american comics but since the last century the heros moral authority has been questioned and he lacks the basest of needs to get laid superheroes lack a social life cant hold women down victimize their women and seem incapable of sharing affection and tenderness weighed down by the virtues of their crusades
4157687 of course superheroes did have sex especially some of them from dc comics golden age for their offspring even formed second generation of super heroes but not the kind of enduring romance fantastic sex as in adult graphic novels

4157691 what of the top three money spinning machines of the comic book world superman spiderman and batman
4157692 the man of steel had possibilities with wonder woman who checked him out as a super kinetic possibility for fathering her children there were indications in one of the earlier series that doing the horizontal mambo made superman lose his super powers
4157693 hes a tortured boy looking for love but weighed down by responsibility of growing up too soon interestingly spidey comic books had featured peter parker with a girlfriend she was his high school sweetheart gwen stacy later killed by the green goblin then came mary jane watson who eventually married him according to the comic strip but its a marriage beset with anguish her worry about the dangers he faces a loss of their child and finally with some complicated deals with mephisto the god of evil her marriage remains annulled with spiderman who returns to live with aunt may
4157694 maybe because his super strength will wipe his women off the superheros load remains unblown

4157702 onze relatie strandde kort nadat we in 2006 remigreerden vanuit bonaire na een pauze van twee jaar hebben we elkaar weer gevonden sinds valentijnsdag dit jaar vormen we weer cht een gezin
4157703 ik heb deze tijd gebruikt om helemaal tot mezelf gekomen ik ontdekte dat weglopen voor jezelf en een ander de schuld geven van je eigen tekortkomingen je niet verder brengen met deze persoonlijke groei kwam er ook weer ruimte voor mijn liefde voor frans n mijn liefde voor het acteren vanaf begin september ben ik te zien in de film panman rhythm of the palms
4157704 frans en ik leefden vanaf het begin van onze relatie in de hoogste versnelling ik geloof dat we na onze eerste nacht samen meteen samenwoonden
4157705 zeven maanden later was ik zwanger bovendien woonden we nooit langer dan n jaar op dezelfde plek het was een vreselijk onrustige tijd
4157706 maar de horeca daar was niet wat we ervan verwachtten na elf maanden keerden we terug naar nederland
4157707 als stel kregen we het moeilijk en een paar maanden na onze remigratie gingen frans en ik uit elkaar al dat rennen en vliegen had zich gewroken we waren elkaar onderweg kwijtgeraakt
4157708 ik ontdekte dat ik vluchtgedrag vertoonde ging moeilijke situaties liever uit de weg ook ging ik inzien dat een ander de schuld geven je niet verder brengt de neiging om mijn leven drastisch om te gooien zit gewoon in mij
4157709 frans is de meest pure en meest manlijke man die ik ken we zijn allebei tot onszelf gekomen en daarom doen we nu alles over maar dan wel in de eerste versnelling

4157792 we asked very specific questions regarding the comfort level of passengers on flights within north america we found that the lumbar support or lack of it and the headrests on airplane seats make it very difficult for back and neck pain sufferers to enjoy flying

4157861 a womans right to choose a safe and legal abortion
4157862 the democratic platform committee really reached out to moderate religious leaders from evangelical and catholic religious communities the resulting language on abortion is a real step forward that provides some sorely needed common ground around reducing the need for abortion
4157863 the new language around this is a significant shift for the democratic party
4157864 they still want abortions on demand and they want taxpayers to pay for abortions
4157865 the democratic party also strongly supports a womans decision to have a child by ensuring access to and availability of programs for pre and post natal health care parenting skills income support and caring adoption programs
4157866 we strongly support family planning and adoption incentives abortion should be safe legal and rare

4157887 der vfl ist mir ans herz gewachsen aber ich habe im hinblick auf meine funktionen als vizepr sident des dosb und vorstandsmitglied der deutschen krebshilfe eine entscheidung treffen m ssen
4157888 oh yeah i liked the mighty mighty bosstones in middle school too
4157889 credit is not bad its bad if you use it badly i encourage people to look at it as a tool that they manage you can get good rates rewards frequent flier miles you use it dont let it use you
4157890 the most important thing to improve your score is to have a credit card an installment loan is a fixed payment and you dont have to manage surprises
4157891 a credit card is self managed and you decide how much you charge each month how close you get to your limit whether you let it grow each month or pay it off
4157892 at 600 to 620 it would mean a higher fee up to around 700 and above that no additional fee
4157893 a 20 000 limit over several cards with just 4 000 charged is better than one card with a 5 000 limit with the same 4 000 charged you want to show youre not charging up to the max
4157894 many inquiries in a short period of time might suggest you are trying to take on large amounts of debt both issues are signs of risk
4157895 as long as its on the credit report whether its open or closed low balance or no balance or old or new if its on the report the score is going to count it when counting that mix or when looking at the ideal number of cards closing it is never going to help your score
4157896 so many people are using credit to live beyond their means
4157897 in an ideal world everybody would pay in full and youd use your credit card for convenience there are times when it is neat to be able to use credit where you can spend more than you pay in one month or at holidays or for emergency but youve got to stop and create a plan to get it paid back it keeps your revolving balance low
4157898 manage your debt so that 28 percent of gross monthly income is your housing payment 38 percent for all payments to creditors
4157899 the whole thing was going to be determined at this sadc summit
4157900 we were all scheduled to go and meet with the troika the sadc organ on politics and defence were not going anymore
4157901 i cant say that they would have avoided anything in the past we would certainly have hoped so
4157902 there was anecdotal evidence that there were increasing incidents with school boards and jurisdictions and even outside of school boards
4157903 increasing incidences where numbers of people were being transported in vans without the safety they would have expected in a school bus
4157904 theyre trying to say if youre going to use a vehicle for the purpose of moving kids to sport outings it has to meet the same standards as a school bus
4157905 in a collision it provides greater protection to the occupants
4157906 i think it will be better you will have more adapted vehicles with trained people that will be better

4157915 we dont want them here what we need is friendship and good relations with the russian people

4157919 pulses senior reporter steve nowottny was impressed by the local walk in centre luxurious accessible friendly all the things you want the nhs to be there was only one thing wrong no one could help him with his problem at pulse i spend a lot of time writing about primary care but as a young fit and touch wood generally healthy journalist its not every day i get to see it at the sharp end for the past three weeks though i ve been suffering from a low level cough and yesterday i finally caved in and decided to seek help the thing was i didn t want to go to my gp after two years of covering extended hours polyclinics and the rise of the commuter patient i probably should have known better but i didn t want to have to make an appointment i didn t want to wait and i didn t want to have to stay at home so i went to the walk in centre it turns out theres an nhs walk in centre just a ten minute bus ride from pulse towers in central london its a little hard to find tucked away in a shopping arcade behind a railway station but the sign in the window promised they could deal with coughs and once inside it was a thing of a beauty luxurious padded brown leather seats friendly receptionists and best of all just two patients ahead of me in the queue i sat and waited my turn it took about ten minutes and a nurse came to get me she was very professional she took my blood pressure she took a detailed history she listened to my chest but she was also very candid i didnt appear to have anything serious but she couldnt be sure and wasnt qualified to say my cough shouldnt have lasted as long as it had this i knew already there was a small a very small chance it could be something serious tb was even mentioned i could try some over the counter treatments she said and reeled off a couple of names but my best bet she told me and this was before we even started was to go and see my gp i rather enjoyed my trip to the walk in centre as one of those young professional patients gordon brown wants so badly to help and private companies are advised to target i couldnt help thinking it was everything the nhs should be i was able to turn up and be seen straight away it was easily accessible and centrally located it was beautifully decorated i left feeling decidedly warm and fuzzy about walk in centres lord darzi and the health service in general theres was just one niggling thing the only thing it couldnt do was help me with my cough or tell me for sure it was not something to worry about tomorrow im calling my gp
4157920 someone over here is being healed of cancer please stand up
4157921 three things make this case an exceptionally excellent example of divine healing 1 medical evidence of the case includes biopsy proof of the malignant nature of the tumor the slides were obtained from hollywood community hospital and reviewed by the head pathologist at long beach community hospital who confirmed the diagnosis of malignant astrocytoma or glioma class ii 2 when the healing occurred marie rosenberger was down to 101 pounds and was expected to die

4157926 two weeks later the girl woke up and she is now back in school these are not kooks they only spoke to me because their minister asked them to the stories i have are not all religious and they are from all different religions it is very vast and serious people like to dismiss it as the fringe but there is a real mainstream thing
4157927 but as they get to talking they discover that they all have one thing in common every one of them believes they have experienced a miracle at some time in their lives and were forever changed by it
4157928 i took 600 amps of 575 volts it takes 0 15 amps to kill you

4157931 the night before the scheduled shunt surgery a doctor arrived in elizabeths hospital room and removed so much thick infected fluid from her brain that he asked to postpone the operation for a few days
4157932 we now know it was one of those lesser miracles that presage a greater miracle
4157933 a month after the first operation the same surgeons made a last ditch effort to remove the rest of the tumor
4157934 naturalistic healing process not clealry understood amazing things just happen
4157935 so many chemists went to the wall because of pan

4157944 the rise in the standard of living in countries like romania serbia and ukraine has led to a phenomenal rise in coffee consumption
4157945 we expect our market share to gain by one or two percentage points each year

4157954 athletes and businesses have one thing in common we cannot win every single game
4157955 politicians fear that they will lose control with e government and this is coming in the way of successful implementation of e government projects in india
4157956 both the central and state governments have followed a silo approach to e government some implementation has taken place but it has tended to be piecemeal and disjointed thereby having little impact
4157957 the biggest challenge before e government is not technology but change management
4157958 even when oil was at 140 a barrel consumer spending was slowing but not stopping

4157966 a principios del 2000 empezamos a ver grandes cambios clientes que ped an 50 tamales en el d a mientras que por la noche llamaban y solicitaban 2 mil para el d a siguiente
4157967 yo empec a trabajar a los nueve a os de chico odiaba la tamaler a porque en la escuela me hac an burla por ser hijo de una tamalera y eso me molestaba pero lo que empez como empresa familiar hoy es una industria cuenta con dos restaurantes y tres reas de producci n donde se tiene la capacidad de almacenar 150 mil tamales
4157968 contratamos a un ingeniero en alimentos quien nos asesor para que tenga una vida de anaquel m s larga y tras estar refrigerado mantenga la misma consistencia y textura eso se logr con productos naturales y as aplicamos tecnolog a a los alimentos sin cambiar la saz n ya que para las fiestas importantes donde por excelencia el tamal es la opci n lo congelamos y refrigeramos para tener el abasto requerido

4157983 our new tru saver bundle puts pressure on big mobile carriers to change their outlandishly expensive pricing models
4157984 were bringing a world of change to the market just as alternative providers revolutionized pricing in wire line long distance calling truphone is revolutionizing international calling for mobile phone users because we carry the calls over available wi fi networks and the internet and roaming charges are out entirely in short truphone is bringing the first step of equal access to the mobile phone for consumers and business users this means savings and cost control that they never saw before
4157985 whether theyre calling back to the u s and canada from business trips or from foreign holidays tru saver calls can be made at the same 1 5 cents per minute from anywhere in the world
4157986 since truphone uses both wi fi and gsm networks based on whichever is available many users will actually reduce their carrier billed mobile minutes while increasing the total amount of minutes they actually spend talking thanks to truphones lower rates for calls that terminate on a wi fi connected truphone mobile phone
4157987 if the border patrol doesnt get you the chicken and burgers will go vegan

4157992 dear emmanuel i am writing on behalf of myself a loyal arsenal supporter and the other loyal arsenal supporters named at the end of this letter we would very much appreciate it if you could take the time to read this letter and reply in person we have been very disappointed by you and your agents behaviour this summer we appreciate that you had a good season for us last year but you are under contract to arsenal and should have shown more respect to your contract you could have gone about gaining a pay rise in a more respectful and professional manner by speaking directly to the club and not by leaking quotes and stories to the media we are happy to forgive and forget your behaviour on one condition that condition being that you issue a formal apology to the club your fellow arsenal players and the fans for your behaviour this summer if you do not apologise then i will not jeer or boo you however i will not be able to support with the same passion that i once did having observed your behaviour this summer yours sincerely

4157996 he was so proud to be a paratrooper as we his parents and family were
4157997 who will monitor the slaughter there should be a humane group present if this method is used sharpshooters have been known to miss will the killing be done in the streets what about passersby and homeless people
4157998 our additional concern with lethal injection is that unskilled people should not attempt it
4157999 this is acceptable to us provided ebb is willing to pay tracs a stipend for every rabbit turned over to our group we feel that it is not right for the company to pocket 54 k for the year for capturing the rabbits when in fact we would pay for sterilization pen building and maintenance
4158000 we are willing to negotiate with ebb and hopefully they will offer to pay for the service of caring for the caught rabbits these are rabbits that ebb will not have to deal with
4158001 certainly in the process of all the re zoning that council was undertaking we were trying to be mindful of what the intent of the original covenant upheld the covenant which sets out three distinct parts the land must never be sold must be used for municipal purposes and must not to be used for commercial or industrial purposes
4158002 the goal of this and previous councils is to preserve continuous public access to okanagan lake from city park to knox mountain park
4158003 you can put municipal buildings on it but you cant put commercial or industrial buildings on the land when we tried to remove the covenant the save the simpson society covenant tried to put a stop to it and thats why it ended up in the courts it has implications for future changes in zoning and use of the land if this ruling overrides the caveat that no commercial activity is allowed on the property than what implications will this have for stuart park for instance an example would be could a hotdog vendor for example not set up shop in that park
4158004 the first one is live trapping followed by providing the live animals to rabbit rescue groups or to wildlife shelters the second one is live trapping followed by lethal injection which is akin to putting an animal down in a veterinary facility the third one is the use of an air rifle and the euthanized animals would be provided to wildlife shelters food its a high powered air rifle that i guess is similar to a regular one except for the fact it doesnt make the same noise
4158005 we agree with some of the groups that we would like to try to preserve as many of the animals as we can but we feel there are too many to rescue them all and have them spayed or neutered we understand that tracs has rescued up to 250 animals which is great
4158006 thats a major concern because they can cause major damage in the agricultural community thats already happened at one farm where theyve attacked the young apple trees
4158007 we are working as quickly and as safely as we can to get the unit working but first we need to investigate just what happened we are doing that at this time and as soon as we figure it out and repair whatever needs to be repaired well get that unit producing gas again
4158008 we have dedicated people working to contact alternative suppliers to get more product from elsewhere were stretching out traditional supply boundaries to get more gas in from other areas both in canada and offshore in short we know this stuff is important to people and were doing our best to minimize the situation
4158009 es algo bastante extraordinario es la primera vez que un predicador convoca a los dos supuestos candidatos est n ambos peleando por dicho voto
4158010 we are advising the public that cambois beach is closed until further notice
4158011 this is due to a pollution incident on the beach between cambois and north blyth where an oily substance has been found
4158012 the environment agency are currently investigating this incident and as a precautionary measure we are closing public access to the beach
4158013 at the moment we are unsure whether this substance has washed in from the sea or has originated from land

4158021 the immensity of the homeless student population shocked all of us
4158022 after all just a few years ago we had one of the highest income levels in the state
4158023 i think weve come to a time in this region in this county where we are saying that whats happening is not acceptable

4158026 una campa a publicitaria previa a los juegos ol mpicos de beijing
4158027 tal y como afortunadamente ha entendido la inmensa mayor a del p blico espa ol e internacional y ha corroborado la embajada de la rep blica popular china en espa a el nico significado de dicho gesto es de cari o simpat a y reconocimiento que es lo que siente esta federaci n por el pueblo chino y su pa s
4158028 la feb mantiene una ya larga relaci n con el baloncesto de la rep blica popular china con cuyo desarrollo est comprometida lo que se refleja tanto en la estrecha colaboraci n en la formaci n de rbitros jugadores y entrenadores como en la regular visita

4158030 adem s de las relaciones deportivas la feb ha sido una de las primeras federaciones del mundo en mantener tambi n relaciones comerciales con instituciones y empresas chinas como la firma de ropa deportiva li ning cuyo contrato suscrito con la feb es el m s antiguo de sus acuerdos
4158031 la feb considera que esta pol mica del todo gratuita se ha generado desde la mala fe por parte de unos medios que han querido da ar la imagen no s lo de la propia feb sino tambi n de nuestro pa s y nuestro deporte por lo que se reserva las acciones legales pertinentes para salvaguardarla

4158033 the difference is the amount of control you can get when you use the tiller as distinct from using the rudder pedals
4158034 this is what i would put in the context of yet another flat battery or flat tyre its not in the same context as the hole in the aeroplane or the grounding of the aircraft
4158035 its an issue of incompetence and cover up and i think they are two matters that will impact on how voters perceive the government
4158036 i think the people deserve to have access to that information prior to going to vote
4158037 there is absolutely no way i am trying or will be involved in any process to cover anything up
4158038 the national offshore petroleum safety authority is investigating and inquiring into all of the issues related to the varanus island gas explosion whether or not the safety inspections were adequate whether or not the reporting was accurate
4158039 let the inquiry take its course then we can make some judgments and determinations about whether or not we need to do things differently
4158040 what this document says is that at best lloyds conducted a desk top review of operational practices in relation to the pipeline
4158041 nothing about a substantive thorough technical assessment of the standards and the fitness for duty of those two pipelines but mr ripper was waving this around as if it is a golden panacea to excuse government incompetence
4158042 i am surprised by the lloyds statement because it seems to contradict our own report
4158043 the reports recommendations are quite clear and what i did in my press conference was quote from the report that no impediment to continued safe operations or compliance with pipeline licence 12 requirements was identified
4158044 the lloyds register group stands by its technical report and the subsequent official statement pertaining to its duties involved in that report
4158045 in the interest of not escalating what has become a very public debate before all the facts are known we believe it is in the best interest of all parties to wait for the findings of the ongoing inquiry into the varanus island incident before making further comments
4158046 im continuing to have a very happy life you move on
4158047 im very proud of the fact that my government left the country in a stronger prouder and more prosperous state than it had been in 1996
4158048 pelosi is committed to her global warming fanaticism to the point where she has said that shes just trying to save the planet

4158059 they the house republicans have this thing that says drill offshore in the protected areas
4158060 we can do that we can have a vote on that
4158061 local families and businesses are struggling to stay afloat with skyrocketing fuel prices that affect every part of our daily lives we must embrace new independent solutions from both republicans and democrats that will bring immediate relief and invest in long term answers to end our energy crisis once and for all i have consistently supported bipartisan calls to increase drilling and production on existing open lands and voted just last week to expand domestic drilling in alaska increasing supply and bringing prices at the pump down
4158062 he has all the qualities of a dog except loyalty
4158063 all other things being equal the simplest solution is the best
4158064 lets not talk about that and just hope it continues
4158065 they did have some good at bats made me work and put the bat on the ball
4158066 i was just trying to make pitches when i needed to
4158067 we were behind 4 0 by the second inning both games
4158068 its frustrating to play so poorly today we just didnt do anything good
4158069 they are the olympic champions so even when we had match point we couldnt take anything for granted
4158070 i was nervous at first but got more confidence as the game went on
4158071 there is a lot of pressure on me here to get a medal
4158072 i was a little nervous but its the olympics and everyone has to deal with that
4158073 i didnt play my best today and she took advantage
4158074 i really think he is the most qualified democrat in the race for president
4158075 his track record is exceptional hes done a fine job as governor and was re elected with around 70 percent of the vote
4158076 if a democrat carries new mexico colorado and nevada we dont need ohio or florida to win richardson is very popular throughout the southwest and stands the best chance of being able to do that
4158077 i was disappointed to hear about the presidents threat to veto the washington dc appropriations bill because of the domestic partner registry
4158078 it is particularly sad that the president would choose to issue this threat during pride month which should be a celebration of glbt americans contributions to our nation as well as a celebration of the strides our nation has made towards full equality
4158079 we were the unlikeliest lot and that is precisely why god has chosen us
4158080 we were the unlikeliest lot and that is precisely why god has chosen us
4158081 we are seeing growing demand for reliable cost effective in building cellular solutions across canada as our customers increase their reliance on wireless voice and data networks
4158082 adcs solutions will allow us to enhance cellular coverage in large enterprise buildings and public venues and will also give us the ability to provide multi carrier solutions as these are requirements our current offerings do not address
4158083 adc is recognized as a global leader in providing network infrastructure products and services to the service provider community and they are a natural fit for crossovers growing cellular business
4158084 our new fusion system supports all major canadian carrier frequencies and is being deployed to support the 2010 winter olympics in vancouver
4158085 this new partnership with crossover distribution will help accelerate our market growth for this system and other adc solutions in canada
4158086 we need to think of ways to bring wireless fidelity applications to the developing world so as to make use of unlicensed radio spectrum to deliver cheap and fast internet access

4158092 hago un llamado a los delegados de la convenci n del domingo a que entiendan que nuestro norte debe ser proteger a nuestro candidato a gobernador luis fortu o y al partido de cualquier controversia yo tengo que proteger a nuestro candidato a base de mi experiencia
4158093 volver a a presentar esa medida en el pr ximo cuatrienio de salir electo
4158094 lo traer a si recibiera un mandato y tuviera el aval y el consenso del caucus de la mayor a en el senado y la c mara
4158095 la plataforma del partido para conseguir y atraer votos es la biblia de la asamblea legislativa
4158096 la inclusi n de la resoluci n 99 en la plataforma no es el foro adecuado para atender este asunto siempre he cre do que los compromisos de gobierno que se incluyen en las plataformas de los partidos pol ticos son aquellos por consenso propuestas que nos unen no que nos dividen
4158097 el matrimonio es entre un hombre y una mujer a m no me ense aron que un hombre se pod a casar con un hombre ni una mujer con una mujer y yo tengo primos y primas homosexuales y qu tiene eso de malo pero para m casarse es entre un hombre y una mujer y yo quiero garantizarles eso a mis hijos y elevar ese mensaje a la sociedad puertorrique a a la constituci n
4158098 yo no s ustedes pero yo no s cual es la posici n de luis fortu o sobre la resoluci n 99 porque ha tenido como 99 posiciones diferentes la posici n nuestra ha sido clara desde el principio y est recogida en el programa de gobierno del partido popular sin ninguna controversia
4158099 la propuesta para una enmienda constitucional solo sirve para dividir el pa s y crear discrimen
4158100 nos reafirmamos adem s en que el matrimonio es entre un hombre y una mujer no obstante rechazamos en rgicamente el intento de elevar este asunto a rango constitucional toda vez que nuestra constituci n hist ricamente ha actuado para conceder y ampliar derechos no limitarlos la propuesta para una enmienda constitucional sobre este tema solo sirve para dividir al pa s y fomentar el discrimen

4158108 its not confidence in knowing how great i am and one day ill reach the top but its a confidence in knowing its exactly what i want to do
4158109 i was the type of person who followed the rules especially when i was growing up when i started getting into music and songwriting i saw that theres no right or wrong with music theres no correct or incorrect answer
4158110 when you sit down to write a song you can do whatever you want with it every kid has their little creative outlets they do to get away from all the parental guidance and that stuff music and songwriting were my things
4158111 it was a really bad imitation of madonna but it kind of got me going

4158116 well at least you still have a choice im stuck with mine
4158117 each person who makes the choice to go and see tropic thunder helps promote the idea that hurting others for the sake of a laugh is okay i humbly submit that the world is cruel enough the damage caused by tropic thunder will last much longer than the movies 90 minute viewing time

4158136 oh well youre checking out early and theres no one around to inspect the place so well mail it to you

4158138 margarita why would you hang up on me the last time i checked i was your cutomer and its generally not a good idea to be rude to your customers all i asked you was why you didnt explain the policy when i checked in what if i was counting on that 100 for gas to get back

4158143 cant say that tomorrow now can you so tell me why is it too much trouble to have someone verify the condition of this place now and return my 100 to me in cash as i gave it to you
4158144 because im busy and theres no one to do it
4158145 why are you here then if youre too busy to inspect it how did you manage to squeeze in a few minutes to stop by how long could it take is the a c on no are there dishes in the sink no im about to vacuum so whats the problem

4158233 we have not in fact decided to pull out of afghanistan
4158234 we have temporarily and indefinitely suspended operations there foremost out of respect and sheer grief for the families and also obviously to protect the security of our remaining staff and to reassess what we might be able to do going forward
4158235 our staff currently are safe as safe as they can be and we are talking to communities government officials others on how we might be able to go forward but we have made no decisions now
4158236 right now we offer our deepest condolences truly i dont have words to express our grief at the loss to these families
4158237 they do need security and unfortunately its a fact of life and those that arent providing security for their workers theyre paying the price now

4158256 adolescents and teens often hold seemingly irreconcilable ideas about having sex confounding the abstinence only sex education message supported by over a billion dollars of federal funding

4158265 its something thats totally unique and is for the whole family
4158266 highlights our own neighbours and how active they are in supporting really good things
4158267 it celebrates the doers of the community it shows orl ans how vibrant we are
4158268 were thinking five 10 years ahead what will we actually need as a community
4158269 im still thrilled about having this groups energy and enthusiasm
4158270 the summer sizzler is building that community spirit its a great way to meet your neighbours
4158271 hes going to bring a level of coaching that we maybe havent had here
4158272 last year vince had the youngest team in the ohl and he took them to the playoffs so were looking for him to repeat that here and get us into the playoffs
4158273 we have to establish an identity for the team and basically that is hard work paying attention to detail and accountability
4158274 establish that from the beginning and it doesnt matter if that is junior
4158275 twenty years ago they could have 4 000 or 5 000 people at an event like that but not today
4158276 when she said square dancing like a typical man i said im not going to do square dancing but we went down and tried it and we havent missed more than two or three nights since and now were the presidents of the club
4158277 its not ol hee haw type country and western music and i think thats what people think square dancing is all about
4158278 the choreographed music they use now could be anything it can be modern stuff jazz our caller has a real variety of stuff that he calls
4158279 its a matter of getting people out to try it and break the stigma of square dancing because for too many square dancing is well pretty square
4158280 hes always doing something to always help the team and guys like that are very important on the team
4158281 they keep the spirit up for every one but they also show the ones that do play a lot that you have to work and be part of the team thats where mike is fantastic
4158282 hes played a number of positions third second hes pitched its not just while hes playing but while hes on the bench rallying the kids warming up the catcher and its also the way he carries himself off the field
4158283 i always try to give myself the most opportunities possible
4158284 i want to prove you dont need singing lessons to know how to sing
4158285 i was watching canadian idol and thought i could do that with our kids
4158286 the confidence i see from the audition to the showcase is just night and day they look like pros
4158287 i dont really know what the competition is like but going from the judges comments i hope i have a good chance of winning it
4158288 trying to compete against really tough competition will be the biggest challenge im just looking towards getting into the top 10 if i was to win i think it would be pretty incredible
4158289 for years weve been trying to get economic development in orl ans and now were seeing it
4158290 its becoming a place to live work and play and be educated this is another piece of the puzzle
4158291 we have to make sure the land is well developed in a way that fits in with the existing community
4158292 there may be more people walking and riding their bikes down to the island i dont think its a real problem
4158293 it showcases petrie island as not only a beach but that it can be used for many other things for too long the focus has been only on the beach
4158294 its difficult at the tactical level to know each and every engagement in each town
4158295 to punish georgia for daring to try to integrate with the west
4158296 the united states of america stands strongly as the president of france just said for the territorial integrity of georgia
4158297 i would consider that to be bluster from the foreign minister of russia
4158298 we are very concerned about these reports it is a serious situation
4158299 looks like it is part human and part ape like
4158300 they showed me the body they took me to the area where they found it it took a day and a half to get there i got to be honest when i first saw it i hated to see it in that state it was in i wanted to capture one so the world could see it walking i guess this is the next best thing for the time being
4158301 well release the dna analysis and well have the body right next to the two boys then you can see its real that its not all bull t

4158306 with all that is going on it is plainly evident that both the great good and the terrible evil found in the world today are the sweet and the bitter fruits of the rearing of yesterdays children the evils of the world will continue to escalate unless there is an underlying acknowledgement even a strong and fervent conviction that the family is an instrument of the almighty
4158307 as fringe as you could get as politically incorrect as you could get
4158308 we went through a long path of negotiations until we reached this agreement

4158310 would be very happy to meet the nobel peace prize laureate
4158311 contacts are under way between my cabinet and the office of the dalai lamas representative to find the best moment

4158313 chinas position on the tibetan issue is consistent and clear
4158314 we hope france will pay attention to chinas concerns and carefully handle the related important and sensitive issue
4158315 france should make efforts with china to avoid any disturbances that could arise and ensure the healthy and stable development of sino french relations
4158316 very strong reinforcement of the military and police presence across historic tibet
4158317 i have no proof so i cant make an affirmation
4158318 in the days and weeks ahead the department of defense will re examine the entire gamut of our military to military relationship with russia and will make changes as necessary and appropriate depending on russian forces
4158319 that certainly is not our desire i think frankly we have been pretty restrained in this and i would say beginning with my remarks at the vercunda conference a year ago february where now prime minister putins speech was regarded by virtually everyone there as very aggressive we have tried not to respond in that manner i think what happens in the days and months to come will determine the future course of u s russian relations
4158320 i would consider that to be bluster from the foreign minister of russia
4158321 anymore is an interesting add i have never been one to believe that you form national security policy on the basis of trust
4158322 spent 45 years working very hard to avoid a military confrontation with russia i see no reason to change that approach today

4158325 a lot of people are scratching their heads trying to figure out why they bought their suvs
4158326 we both share in the idea that the more of these cars that are on the road the better
4158327 no 2 is making emissions better and using less gas
4158328 we are targeting pickups suvs and vans thats the really big market
4158329 if you start with a gas guzzler that gets 12 miles per gallon or a school bus that gets 7 miles per gallon and increase that the impact is far bigger
4158330 no matter how it turns out i think weve had an effect on automakers
4158331 the feeling is just like we had with personal computers in the 1970s we knew it was gonna change the world and in this case it has to

4158347 having the 1 hybrid played at all four majors is a tremendous accomplishment for our company and reinforces our position as the leader in hybrid design and performance
4158348 our success in the hybrid category has resonated not only with an increasing number of tour pros asking to play our clubs each week but also with the average golfer as he or she shops for new equipment having the 1 hybrid played on tour is something were very proud of and we hope to continue building upon the momentum

4158418 that about forty years ago certain persons went up to laputa either upon business or diversion and after five months continuance came back with a very little smattering in mathematics but full of volatile spirits acquired in that airy region that these persons upon their return began to dislike the management of every thing below and fell into schemes of putting all arts sciences languages and mechanics upon a new foot to this end they procured a royal patent for erecting an academy of projectors in lagado and the humour prevailed so strongly among the people that there is not a town of any consequence in the kingdom without such an academy in these colleges the professors contrive new rules and methods of agriculture and building and new instruments and tools for all trades and manufactures whereby as they undertake one man shall do the work of ten a palace may be built in a week of materials so durable as to last for ever without repairing and increase a hundred fold more than they do at present with innumerable other happy proposals the only inconvenience is that none of these projects are yet brought to perfection and in the mean time the whole country lies miserably waste the houses in ruins and the people without food or clothes by all which instead of being discouraged they are fifty times more violently bent upon prosecuting their schemes driven equally on by hope and despair that as for himself being not of an enterprising spirit he was content to go on in the old forms to live in the houses his ancestors had built and act as they did in every part of life without innovation that some few other persons of quality and gentry had done the same but were looked on with an eye of contempt and ill will as enemies to art ignorant and ill men preferring their own ease and sloth before the general improvement of their country

4158431 the american psychological association apa recently removed an old statement about abortion and mental health from its web site a statement that declared abortion to be largely benign they have convened a task force on the subject and will issue a new statement in 2008
4158432 there is no credible evidence that a single elective abortion of an unwanted pregnancy in and of itself causes mental health problems for adult women according to a draft report released tuesday by a task force of the american psychological association
4158433 the task force observed that many of the studies published during the period reviewed suffered from serious methodological problems thus it focused most closely on those found to be most methodologically sound to arrive at its conclusions inconsistencies in findings reported by published studies were judged to reflect differences in study quality and failures to control for potentially confounding factors

4158445 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here

4158488 he says now he would make them permanent its a different john mccain
4158489 until i voted for sen obama i had never voted for a democrat so i think my republican credentials are sincere
4158490 but the change that he so gracefully articulating is more renewal than departure
4158491 barack obama believes you cant have a strong economy when you have a weak middle class and speakers like senator bob casey jr of pennsylvania and governor deval patrick of massachusetts will share how obamas policies have been directly shaped by the people he has met as he traveled the country
4158492 its not that big a stretch for barack obama to win north carolina this year
4158493 this is a battleground and were going to win it
4158494 i think the 11th congressional district is winnable by sen obama
4158495 ive said all along this has got to be resolved

4158512 is the listserv culture driving away those more experienced lawyers
4158513 there is a misperception in the industry that bayer interpolation of raw files has to be done through the cpu
4158514 using the cpu is problematic because it overloads one system and the result is poor performance image quality is compromised because you have to use a less demanding algorithm we solve that by distributing the work evenly the cpu handles the loading decoding and playback while the massively parallel gpu does the real time image rendering our approach provides 4k playback rivaling the image quality of offline algorithms
4158515 we get the most out of the gpu by optimizing every individual pixel shader for performance
4158516 files are approximately one third the size of an equivalent rgb file and yet they give you more image to work with because they represent the actual sensor data

4158523 using color symmetry already saves us time and guesswork because we know the imagery we are seeing across our shot creation and rendering pipeline is correct
4158524 we also know any film or created look we need to deal with will be properly used and viewed version 2 0 only increases our confidence in being able to work according to accepted industry standards for color with film as well as evolving non film digital acquisition and delivery methods
4158525 many potential workflows exist right now from film based motion picture delivery to all digital game engine delivery
4158526 people are finding that they need to manage color across multiple creative toolsets facilities and pipelines color symmetry 2 0 is about introducing features that let users quickly bring their applications and pipelines up to the industry standards for color data exchange and allow them to access common color tools for manipulating imagery regardless of whether the imagery originated digitally or on film or whether it will be mastered digitally or on film
4158527 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4158528 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4158529 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4158530 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4158531 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4158532 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

4158548 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
4158549 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
4158550 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
4158551 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

4158589 doktor julia kasi surat mc kat budiey tiga hari boleh
4158590 la querida nonita de la mirada dulce que ha visto nacer y mirar rboles
4158591 youre a wild man just do a google on elman authement youll see
4158592 a shark with a bit of blood in its nostrils
4158593 i think its disgusting and i dont think its proportionate
4158594 ive seen players squirted with capsicum spray on page 35
4158595 melbourne has been a strong club for four or five years i hope he can make it 12 from 13 he must enjoy playing against them
4158596 its more coincidence than anything but i think youd rather have him in your team than out of it with that stat
4158597 he usually lifts for big occasions and a lot of teams have lifted to play us
4158598 weve been minor premiers or premiers of late he probably gets his teams up for those games youd be disappointed with anything less
4158599 hes played plenty of tests and plenty of origins and quite a few grand finals hes a big game player
4158600 they compress up pretty tight and try to bash you about
4158601 last week was very physical and i think its going to be very similar this week
4158602 i think its the biggest lock against the smallest lock
4158603 it doesnt worry him how big they are hes not fazed by it
4158604 he plays the same week in week out no matter who hes playing
4158605 she can work here in melbourne theres my football side of things and being close to family
4158606 for me the main priority is to play regularly and enjoy doing what im doing
4158607 its a lifestyle decision as much as a football decision but why not play great football in the best country in the world
4158608 i really thoroughly enjoyed my time there fc national apart from the political side of things with contractual issues
4158609 when you want a transfer they will use anything against you they used the focus on the world cup
4158610 the club said would you rather go to the world cup and sign an extension with your current club or focus on the future and look to a new club
4158611 i chose the latter and i didnt think i wouldnt play for almost 11 months
4158612 i went for the football and poland and romania gave me the opportunity with the socceroos
4158613 i played regularly in romania and poland at stages and enjoyed my career there
4158614 bucharest and krakow were the most beautiful cities ive seen
4158615 i like to keep my feet on the ground learn from my coaches and the players around me
4158616 for decades we havent given our children an adequate education
4158617 weve got to get people as outraged about the fact that for decades we havent given children an adequate education in our state
4158618 and when they get the same fervor and outrage over that that they have over this silly day of missed school maybe well make a change
4158619 illinois has got a 600 billion economy 600 billion the cost of the tax increase needed to fix our problems would be about 6 billion thats one percent of our economy
4158620 ive got more than 1 200 items and its anything that i find a bit peculiar rather than something that would have been successful or other people would collect i dont collect sewing machines or typewriters
4158621 its things that perhaps nobody else would be bothered with but in some way helped normal people with their lives like the self pouring teapot or the dynamo torch
4158622 a lot of the items could still be produced today even the self pouring teapot
4158623 why would you want to do that why not just blow on it and it displaces half your coffee
4158624 britain was a phenomenal nation of inventors but things have changed
4158625 nowadays its got to be manufactured abroad and the system of selling has become quite difficult i think 1851 to 1951 was the golden age
4158626 inventors are all quite vulnerable and naive at the beginning we really need advice so its great to have somewhere to go
4158627 you have to be pretty determined and it helps if you have some basic skills
4158628 im here to nurture inventors and point them in the right direction you never know whats coming through the door
4158629 were a different breed from the victorians we have to be more commercially viable
4158630 youve got to go through a process and its not always easy
4158631 theres always a positive on the back of a negative you have to be optimistic to do what we do
4158632 no he didnt ive improved only in the last year
4158633 it really affected my performance because the rain made my gun slippery and i missed several targets
4158634 there was a desire on both sides to find a conclusion to this issue
4158635 this is a very important agreement this turns a new page in our relationship
4158636 this agreement signed today is designed to resolve the last major historical issue that has stood in the way of a more normal relationship between our two countries
4158637 under this agreement each countrys citizens can receive fair compensation for past incidents when fulfilled the agreement will permit libya and the us to develop their relations
4158638 the important role libya is playing internationally and expressed his hope that cooperation between the two countries would continue

4158640 these women were in afghanistan trying to help the afghan people and have now given their lives as a result of a senseless pointless and cowardly act
4158641 they were travelling in white toyota land cruisers that were clearly marked as irc vehicles as humanitarian vehicles
4158642 their policy was never to travel with weapons in the car so there wouldnt be any doubt that theyre a peaceful humanitarian organisation
4158643 the uk government utterly condemns these attacks on innocent civilians
4158644 modern pakistan women are symptomatic of the progress the new nation is struggling to make here led by zeenat haroon young members of the sind province womens national guard meet to practice the use of the bamboo lathi in self defense but most pakistan women still prefer the old custom even to the veiled face
4158645 last week as the tragic division between pakistan and india increased and as the 72 year old jinnah grew sicker it became apparent that pakistan not only might lose its battle for survival but might also lose its leader
4158646 when pakistan suddenly received its freedom last aug 15 proud and energetic patriots boasted that they had created a nation with more land than france and more people than germany granting these comparisons pakistan still lacks most of the attributes of a modern state
4158647 labor of the approximately 70 million pakistanis more than 80 are farmers a very few are wealthy landlords and the rest are shopkeepers and artisans nearly all of pakistans financial and professional men were among the approximately four million hindus who fled to india from india pakistan got about siz million impoverished moslem peasants who for the most part left their agricultural implements behind pakistan has huge transient camps fll of landless farmers and an almost complete lack of skilled technicians or businessmen
4158648 transportation in all the 370 000 square miles of pakistan there are only 7 260 miles of railway and only 9 575 miles of paved roads there are an estimated 53 000 miles of dirt roads and trails pakistan has had difficulty in getting enough coal to keep the railways running and even then has had to pay about three times teh normal price per ton in september alone the country lost more than 10 million on railway operations
4158649 finances pakistans financial troubles are compounded out of her political trade and industrial failures at the time of the division hindu businessmen took out all the gold bullion jewels and other liquid assets they could carry with them with normal trade cut off by the rioting and use of railroads for refugees pakistans income probably will not exceed 450 million rupees for the current year against almost certain expenditures of 800 million officials talk hopefully of foreign investment or loans but in pakistans present condition the risks are not very attractive
4158650 whats wrong with you your english has been terrible the last few days its like you have your head in the clouds or have a fuzzy mind
4158651 why would i spend 500 on a netbook when i could get a full notebook
4158652 we have discussed this proposal in the permanent council and there is no decision yet but i can say that there is no objection in principle on this
4158653 we can hold talks with the osce the eu and our friends from the un only on the number of observers
4158654 the observers will be working not on the territory of south ossetia but on the territory of georgia
4158655 only russian peacekeepers will be in south ossetia and abkhazia
4158656 there will be no georgian peacekeepers on the territory of south ossetia
4158657 you cant get elected after stabbing your husband with a steak knife
4158658 gays must come out for conscription then the ban would be lifted
4158659 now do you believe we need a draft were in a new kind of war time for a new kind of draft
4158660 one reason more young people dont serve now is the fear that while theyre wearing the uniform their peers will be out having fun and getting a leg up in their careers if everyone were required to serve no one would feel like a sucker
4158661 extensions of military service work now as in the recent movie of that name
4158662 draft registration congress the supreme court the separation of powers
4158663 those were the days my friend i thought they would never end
4158664 it seems appropriate that marty meehans bill bill on major issues
4158665 reasonable gt the problem alex is that the person you responded to is one of those
4158666 it is a diplomatic move it is important that the conflict be settled along the lines proposed by russia now
4158667 the problem exists objectively and will inevitably have to be tackled europe recognized this much by giving a go ahead yesterday and wont be able to pretend there is no such problem at all
4158668 there were several critical issues on medvedevs plan which russia insisted on including georgias pullout a commitment to refrain from using force and no mention of georgias territorial integrity
4158669 south ossetia has been an independent state even though unrecognized for the past 15 years and exercised jurisdiction on its own territory
4158670 it should be allowed to decide whether or not it will be part of georgia as tbilisi demands and its decision should be taken into account
4158671 international talks on the future status of south ossetia and abkhazia and ways to provide their security
4158672 the victory over georgia has been handed down to nicolas sarkozy on a platter although he has already overhauled the points concerning conflict settlement which is sure to have the most devastating effect on russias geopolitical interests in the south caucasus
4158673 the russian leadership acted half heartedly russia failed to break georgias military machine and by agreeing to a ceasefire heavily compromised its punishment of the aggressor something so sternly demanded by russias defense ministry recently
4158674 the crew of the tu 22 that was shot down over georgia were sent to their death
4158675 the short lived act of georgian aggression has brought to light all the painful defects in the training and battle management of our troops as well as in decision making in a military period
4158676 when guns in this case georgian multiple rockets scream and roar it is truly bad form to wait for instructions from higher ups it is necessary to strike immediately at enemy bases and firing positions it is the abc of warfare
4158677 the ev ebitda indicator was 7 3 against the regular 8 7 in the developed markets this is not a public company therefore a 16 discount
4158678 u s business is more public therefore transactions with ill reputed countries cannot but arouse ill feelings
4158679 fridman has had talks with bp ceo tony hayward who offered to fire dudley in exchange for vekselbergs and tnk bp executive director german khans resignation
4158680 fridmans stake is greater than renovas so he could try and influence vekselbergs resignation

4158802 this will be a major blow to the chances of being named attorney general or appointed to another cabinet position assuming obama gets elected in november and chooses edwards over someone who has been directly involved in politics during the past four years

4158807 studies of mouse skin cancer have contributed little to our understanding of human skin cancer

4158810 this is not the case so while the research is interesting i dont think any conclusions should be drawn from it at this stage and it should not put people off using skin creams if they wish to do so
4158811 the white population is older and very much centred around the ageing baby boomers who are well past their high fertility years
4158812 the future of america is epitomised by the young people today they are basically the melting pot we are going to see in the future

4158814 heels should have a broad base and be no higher than 4cm if worn for long stretches no higher than 2cm
4158815 we were surprised how many times we found employers dress codes did not permit the wearing of comfortable footwear
4158816 heels may look glamorous on the catwalks and on hollywood stars but theyre not appropriate day today work wear these dress codes apart from being blatantly sexist can lead to health problems
4158817 feet bear the brunt of working life and instead of worrying about what staff look like employers should focus on the effect the wrong shoes and prolonged standing can have
4158818 ive worked hard all my life and now im having to start again
4158819 he hit this house like a missile ive been diagnosed with post traumatic stress now because of the shock
4158820 you made a deliberate decision to go out and drink with friends that evening
4158821 my young client is both deeply ashamed and very concerned at the damage he caused by this accident

4158823 he is obviously very sorry for what he has done he is deeply mortified
4158824 creating a world without poverty social business and the future of capitalism
4158825 we ran a similar operation last year and most of the offenders we caught blew between 05 per cent and 1 per cent so for the majority of people its not a deliberate act

4158827 if we can let them know that we will be out in force then they cant say they werent warned
4158828 the new blanket conditions will mean that loading zones in the area bounded by mair st to dana st and dawson st to humffray st will have a standing time of 15 minutes monday to saturday between 8am and 5 30pm
4158829 this will take a lot of pressure off parking in the heart of the city by opening up many more spaces for people in non commercial vehicles looking for a parking spot in the central business area in the evening or at night
4158830 im sure a lot of people working in those venues will sleep a lot easier

4158861 the behaviour of many councillors last night makes it extremely clear why ballarat residents should be looking for new faces to determine the strategic vision of this city
4158862 the intention of these laws is not to gag informative discussion within the council chambers but to provide avenues for efficiency at council meetings
4158863 residents of ballarat elected these councillors to work as a united body with a strategic vision and a positive energetic approach we did not elect them to parade their own personal agendas
4158864 i look forward to a healthy mature debate at the next council meeting ballarat deserves this
4158865 to me what seems to happen is that its at the discretion of the mayor as to who he lets say what
4158866 i think its rather rude and i can understand where cr fletcher was coming from with the way he took it because it was not really appropriate
4158867 the whole thing is starting to get a bit out of hand
4158868 however in my opinion i believe if it has been normal accepted practice to allow comment on agenda items in the past it seems unfair to impose a change without prior notification to all players
4158869 i have never texted or emailed senator obama and ill offer a million dollars to anyone who could prove otherwise in fact ive only talked to the senator once in the last year and a half on the phone ive spent more time with senator mccain he did my tv show then i have with senator obama i would hope that my friend john mccain would join me in condemning this kind of politics although i support senator obama i would never be dumb enough to offer policy advice to either candidate they seem to be doing fine without me
4158870 roll back government and corporate encroachment on individual freedom by allowing information to flow past the barriers erected by totalitarian or authoritarian governments and around the gatekeepers of the mainstream media
4158871 just as a trusted computing system will load neither programs nor data files without a validated certificate whose signature matches their contents neither will the secure internet transfer any document in any standard protocol without such a certificate accompanying it
4158872 a documents certificate its imprimatur identifies the person individual or legal entity responsible for its publication provides a signature which permits verifying its contents have not been corrupted or subsequently modified and identifies the document registry which granted the imprimatur and which on demand will validate it and confirm that it has not been revoked
4158873 more than any innovation in the last century the internet empowers individuals to spontaneously teach learn explore communicate form communities and collaborate measured relatively this individual empowerment comes at the expense of the power of governments and large commercial enterprises thereby reversing a trend toward concentration of power more than a century old which has acted to reduce free citizens and productive individuals to mere subjects and consumers

4158884 i thought collage great way to talk about systems of power and pop culture we were using the media to talk about the media

4158887 we think crysis warhead is going to offer a tremendous experience to a wide range of gamers fans of crysis are going to enjoy more of the open ended gameplay cutting edge visuals and huge epic battles from the first game while also finally finding out what kind of havoc psycho was wreaking on the other side of the island
4158888 we also obtained information from an office of nuclear energy site not visited
4158889 landfills are the largest source of anthropogenic methane emissions in the u s and the impact of landfill emissions in the short term is grossly underestimated methane is 72 times more potent than co2 over a 20 year time frame
4158890 the portion of methane captured over a landfills lifetime may be as low as 20 of total methane emitted
4158891 existing incinerators should be retired and no new incinerators or landfills should be constructed
4158892 wasting directly impacts climate change because it is directly linked to resource extraction transportation processing and manufacturing
4158893 the provision of such liquidity support undermines the efficient pricing of risk by providing ex post insurance for risky behavior that encourages excessive risk taking and sows the seeds of a future financial crisis

4158904 it was considered an all out imperative by the administration to keep troop levels low particularly in the beginning of the war and one way that was done was to shift money and manpower to contractors but that has exposed the military to greater risks from contractor waste and abuse
4158905 it is a shocking number but i still dont think it is the full cost
4158906 i dont think there have been any credible cost numbers for the iraq war there was so much money spent at the beginning of the war and nobody knows where it went
4158907 these new numbers point to the overall question when do you cross the line in terms of turning over too much of the public mission of defense to private firms
4158908 there are some things that are appropriate for private companies to do but others things that are not but we dont seem to have had a strategy for determining which was appropriate and which wasnt we have just handed over functions to contractors in a very haphazard way
4158909 the truman committee held 60 hearings on waste fraud and abuse
4158910 its unfathomable to me that we dont have a bipartisan investigative committee on contracting in iraq

4158922 each year as many as 50 infants are placed on the waiting list for cardiac transplantation but die while waiting owing to the lack of a suitable donor heart
4158923 adding an additional two three or five minutes or even 75 seconds does add some additional injury it could be 10 per cent
4158924 the six month survival rate was 100 per cent for the 3 transplant recipients and 84 per cent for 17 control infants who received transplants procured through standard organ donation
4158925 as a result of their investigational protocol three babies are now alive had the procedures not been performed it is virtually certain that all six babies would be dead

4159109 we feel deeply for the south ossetian people and the relatives of our peacekeepers who died at the hands of the georgian aggressors
4159110 i dont know a single case when the political leaders of a state were brought to responsibility while they were still in power
4159111 despite the severe blow to our nation south ossetians will and striving for independence remains unchanged
4159112 we will seek independence in strict compliance with international law
4159113 as to our independence as to our progress toward this goal no force will make us stop the goal has been set and we will advance toward this goal together

4159118 no mention was made about what happened on august 8 when western leaders fell silent while tskhinvali was shelled and bombed
4159119 the western political elite only got excited when russia made the decision not to abandon its peacekeepers and to prevent ethnic cleansing sending reinforcements to carry out an operation to force georgia to accept peace
4159120 there was also no mention of our efforts in recent years to broker a ceasefire deal between tskhinvali and tbilisi

4159123 this is not true we have not been engaged in any military action for two days only conducting reconnaissance

4159128 they the u s of course had to hang saddam hussein for destroying several shiite villages
4159129 but the current georgian rulers who in one hour simply wiped ten ossetian villages from the face of the earth who used tanks to knock down children and the elderly and who burnt civilians alive they georgian leaders are players who of course have to be protected

4159169 a direct registry modification to achieve a security result is not my idea of a good time

4159410 this agreement signed today is designed to resolve the last major historical issue that has stood in the way of a more normal relationship between our two countries
4159411 under this agreement each countrys citizens can receive fair compensation for past incidents when fulfilled the agreement will permit libya and the us to develop their relations
4159412 the important role libya is playing internationally and expressed his hope that cooperation between the two countries would continue
4159413 it has to be part of something that says we want to bring immediate relief to the public and not just a hoax
4159414 just because a bill comes to the floor with offshore and energy in the title doesnt mean its a good offshore drilling bill
4159415 speaker pelosi is only going to schedule a vote on an offshore energy bill if she believes it would be politically perilous not to and even then its not going to have much energy in it
4159416 and ill bet you when members come back from their districts youll find more movement taking place
4159417 its nonsensical that its safe to drill off the coast of texas and louisiana and mississippi and yes california but its not safe to drill anywhere else the average hardworking american doesnt understand that
4159418 always concerned about the push for more drilling off our coasts from the oil industry and its supporters
4159419 a huge erosion of support for the moratorium among democrats
4159420 you vote in a div 3 government instead of a div 1 government the whole economy will subside within three four years
4159421 they say oh lets have different parties change and be in charge of government is it that simple
4159422 if ever the pap goes corrupt weak its finished you will have to look for a new team and a new party that will be very difficult
4159423 we know that singapore wants an opposition to check the pap well find a way to have more voices inside the assembly but not at the risk of voting in a div 2 or 3 government
4159424 i dont see why a suburban homeowner would like it around their house

4159427 in the preceding days he worked his regularly scheduled shifts without incident
4159428 he said he was interested in volunteering but that was obviously a lie
4159429 they introduced themselves and at that time he pulled out a handgun and shot chairman gwatney several times
4159430 not only a strong chairman of arkansas democratic party but also a cherished friend and confidante
4159431 michelle and i are heartbroken to hear about the tragic loss of chairman bill gwatney were praying for his family and friends and all who worked with him and loved him
4159432 it makes you wonder what got into somebody to do something so horrible
4159433 bill gwatney was our friend our partys leader and so many times our partys conscience
4159434 our state and our party are better for all that bill gwatney has done
4159435 arkansas has lost a great son and i have lost a great friend
4159436 there is deep pain in arkansas tonight because of the sheer number of people who knew respected and loved bill gwatney
4159437 he was an admirable arkansan and gave so much to this state and his party
4159438 profoundly saddened by the senseless loss of chairman bill gwatney
4159439 we we will decide in subsequent days as whether degree of provocation and whe who was right and who was wrong
4159440 you are more capable than you realize meet the challenge with hope in your heart you have everything you need to cross the finish line
4159441 we know how to change behavior and attitudes that is what we do
4159442 we know what messages will work and what will not
4159443 people know outside is going to feel much better for them but underpredict how happy theyre going to feel after being outside in nature even 15 minutes
4159444 the people inside overestimate their happiness about being inside its this error in judgment people have about how happy they are in a different environment that may explain why people dont spend more time in nature
4159445 rather than changing their ways to protect the environment the results of this study suggest that these people may give up on their efforts to protect the environment
4159446 i think most people recognize we face a severe environmental crisis but its hard to deal with that head on because most people feel helpless to do anything about it
4159447 if we look at the nature of the problem it is so big its hard to know what any individual can do in their own life to make a difference
4159448 the tendency when people are confronted with an overwhelming problem is to run away from it so psychologists are very experienced in dealing with that
4159449 one of the first things you think of is turning off lights when you leave a room or changing the thermostat settings in the house they dont think first of caulking windows or upgrading your furnace
4159450 more insulation in the attic and tight windows make more difference than changing the thermostat setting having a more fuel efficient car makes more difference than any amount youre likely to decrease driving
4159451 people showed strong approval for other students who recycled you would hope to see people disapprove of people who dont recycle but they didnt disapprove
4159452 we are recognizing that environmental problems have a tremendous impact on many aspects of our lives but we need a lot more work
4159453 we cant afford to let this increased environmental concern become just another fashionable trend
4159454 there is no place in california where frogs are still thriving

4159494 the incentives are right certification tests would provide all employers with valuable trustworthy information about job applicants they would benefit young people who cannot or do not want to attend a traditional four year college they would be welcomed by the growing post secondary online educational industry which cannot offer the halo effect of a ba from a traditional college but can realistically promise their students good training for a certification test as good as they are likely to get at a traditional college for a lot less money and in a lot less time certification tests would disadvantage just one set of people students who have gotten into well known traditional schools but who are coasting through their years in college and would score poorly on a certification test disadvantaging them is an outcome devoutly to be wished

4159706 the interference in determining the destiny of iraq will be harmful especially for the americans themselves they must not demand from iraq more than is required let the iraqi people choose how to live and what government they want
4159707 there is an iranian stance regarding this issue i confirmed this is an iraqi issue that is based on the iraqi national interest which aims to protect the sovereignty of iraq

4159721 creo que los datos no tienen mucha base las finanzas est n bastante bien
4159722 no digo que no haya problemas hay atrasos en pagos a proveedores pero eso estuvo siempre
4159723 el que el gobierno haya colocado deuda al 15 5 por ciento en venezuela es un factor clave adem s se advierten retrasos en los pagos a proveedores contratistas y a beneficiarios de subsidios
4159724 a esto se suma la ca da en los precios internacionales de los productos agr colas que va a afectar la recaudaci n por retenciones y la observaci n de que no se toman medidas de fondo para reducir el crecimiento del gasto p blico no hay un curso de acci n para un sinceramiento del sistema de precios ni para la atenuaci n de exigencia de subsidios
4159725 resulta dif cil imaginar c mo se van a enfrentar los vencimientos de la deuda del resto del a o y de 2009
4159726 no me gusta hablar de default creo que el uso de la palabra acent a el riesgo de que efectivamente suceda prefiero hablar de que es importante tomar medidas correctivas lo antes posible
4159727 es cierto que la argentina ingres en una etapa nueva despu s de la fase de crecimiento f cil que se dio entre 2002 y 2007 dominada por el comportamiento deficiente y limitado de la inversi n la desaceleraci n del crecimiento y las menores condiciones de holgura fiscal adem s hay signos evidentes de debilitamiento en la recaudaci n y un aumento del gasto asociado con la inflaci n
4159728 esto sin duda plantea problemas nuevos sobre todo para los pagos a futuro pero decir que la argentina est en riesgo de default es una exageraci n
4159729 estos informes buscan posicionamientos pol ticos frente al debilitamiento de la argentina buscan orientar una salida ortodoxa y recesiva de la crisis
4159730 hace a os que no tenemos cr dito externo por la quita a los tenedores de bonos los hold outs el irresuelto default con el club de paris y la estafa a los bonistas cuyos t tulos est n atados a la inflaci n

4159756 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4159757 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4159758 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

4159782 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
4159783 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
4159784 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
4159785 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

4159803 i think a lot of people not just social conservatives but a lot of the republicans i know are not necessarily comfortable with romney
4159804 but it has nothing to do with religion it has everything to do with inconsistencies in positions hes held and thats it
4159805 i think mccain has to have a running mate that clearly connects with social conservatives in the party
4159806 that is where he is lacking so if he picks a pro choice running mate i dont see how he can win this race
4159807 im not going to say people will stay home but there is a core of voters whose level of enthusiasm influences people further from the core
4159808 so if mccain picks a pro choice running mate the strength of turnout on election day is not going to be there for him
