2820014 dominar el ingl s y el espa ol es como salir de una peque a familia para ser parte de una familia hemisf rica

2820028 russia must affirm that its aim is not to change the democratically elected government of georgia and that it accepts that territorial integrity and sovereignty of georgia
2820029 to bring up publicly the idea of president mikheil saakashvili stepping down may be an interesting signal
2820030 sometimes there are democratic leaders who do things which create great problems for their country
2820031 sometimes those leaders need to contemplate how useful they have become to their people
2820032 we are not aware of that and i think we probably would be if it were true
2820033 even if the pipe is out of action for a week or two weeks its very unlikely that this would have much effect on global oil supplies
2820034 the task of the russian forces at present is to ensure control of south ossetia the pipelines would be in danger only if the war escalated
2820035 if russia started an economic blockade then it might target the pipelines
2820036 attempts to take control of that pipeline would be extreme
2820037 the conflict is going to cause people to think twice about investing in the oil industry in the caspian region if its in the middle of a war zone

2820045 assuming clinton wins tonight its a smart tactical decision on her part to try and get as much media mileage as she can out of todays meaningless beauty contest

2820123 hopefully i can get some rest tonight manage to eat enough tomorrow and see what happens i have prepared for this and really want to go faster

2820127 but we the legal team told the three boys that we would not approach the constitutional court without a proper and legally acceptable constitutional issue
2820128 advocate jaap cilliers and i identified one such possibility over the weekend but well decide about it today monday
2820129 if its not a viable option ill advise the guys to report to the police to serve their sentence
2820130 the body of a chinese man was found lying on a bed in the rear bedroom of the property and the body of a chinese woman was found lying on a bed in the front bedroom
2820131 police including senior crime officers pathologists and other specialists are now working to establish the circumstances surrounding the deaths and are conducting forensic examinations
2820132 is the goal of the russian federation to change the leadership of georgia
2820133 sometimes those leaders need to contemplate how useful they have become to their people
2820134 lets state clearly that we are ready to put an end to the war that we will withdraw from south ossetia that we will sign an agreement on non use of force
2820135 we must condemn russias military assault on the sovereign state of georgia including the targeting of civilians and the campaign of terror against the georgian population
2820136 since russia is impeding georgian forces from withdrawing rejecting a ceasefire and continuing to carry out military attacks against civilian centres its claims of a humanitarian purpose clearly are not credible
2820137 it is obvious that as world champions our biggest strengths are in the lineout and in the scrum
2820138 and it is precisely here where the opposition will try and neutralise us the all blacks use tactics which are illegal and as far as i know if it is illegal then it is not allowed
2820139 i have a letter from the irb which prohibits me from talking to the referee
2820140 we have picked up three things that they do which are illegal in the lineouts it starts with their flanker coming through the lineout illegally to stop any ball thrown down to the scrumhalf
2820141 they also do their best to play the lineout jumpers in the air and jump across the line and then thirdly they manage to close the gap to half a metre between the two sets of players
2820142 no era el rival m s c modo para esta competencia
2820143 gabor estuvo como primero del r nking durante buena parte del a o pero luego se lesion y perdi muchas competencias que lo hicieron bajar hasta el puesto 16 lo que hizo que nos top ramos con l tan temprano
2820144 en una ol mpicos uno tiene que estar preparado para enfrentar a los mejores y ganarle a cualquier rival gabor es uno de los mejores del mundo y hab a que vencerlo
2820145 cuando l tomo la ventaja me sent un poco apabullado esos dos puntos que recib luego de estar empatados fue lo que determin el resultado adverso
2820146 t cnicamente es un equipo muy superior por lo que no podemos enfrentarlos de t a t los lances por equipo son muy t cticos y tenemos que utilizar el coraz n y las garras para defender nuestra bandera
2820147 lo importante son los seis puntos obtenidos en dos partidos y la clasificaci n a los cuartos de final
2820148 creo que hoy por momentos jugamos a un ritmo muy lento sin sorpresa y eso nos complic pero nos clasificamos ahora queremos ser los primeros del grupo
2820149 si bien no jugamos como esper bamos y podemos hacerlo ganar es importante y ya logramos dos victorias
2820150 todos los equipos nos van a jugar igual con mucha gente atr s y si nuestro juego es lento vamos a colaborar con ellos tenemos que jugar m s r pido para no favorecer al rival
2820151 absoluta necesidad de una retirada completa de todos los grupos armados georgianos de la zona de conflicto para regresar a la situaci n anterior
2820152 nuestro inter s es cesar los enfrentamientos y si es verdad que han tenido lugar solicito que se verifiquen
2820153 estamos dispuestos a imponer el orden y a ir m s all si los georgianos se resisten
2820154 hasta ahora la situaci n est as confirmamos la retirada de las fuerzas georgianas de tsjinvali
2820155 es esencial que las agencias humanitarias lleguen a los afectados y los desplazados y que los que se encuentren atrapados en las zonas de conflicto reciban el permiso necesario para acceder a un lugar seguro tan r pido como sea posible
2820156 presentar una resoluci n que deja claro que las acciones rusas en georgia son inaceptables para la comunidad internacional

2820160 people know everything that there is to know about schools in new york
2820161 unfortunately in this country we dont have that kind of information about schooling
2820162 what we are better off identifying is the kind of extra value that education offers so that we measure the progress people are making not the raw results
2820163 all information other than those things of course that are subject to privacy provisions should be made open and accountable to parents to the broader community
2820164 everything is pretty well fine other than the fact he has stitches

2820170 and who knew our own iowahawk comes from a dynasty of cowtippers
2820171 i told him this was my last 400 im and he said well it has to be a record then
2820172 we wont do that again during the meet but for the first race i wanted to make sure he was ready
2820173 the russian side brought in facts about the presence of georgian forces in certain neighborhoods of tskhinvali
2820174 georgia expresses its readiness to immediately start negotiations with the russian federation on ceasefire and termination of hostilities
2820175 the president believes that there now exists a real chance of quickly finding a way out of the crisis
2820176 we dont want the conflict to spread in a region which is extremely volatile and dangerous
2820177 returned fire as a result of which one of the georgian boats launching the attack sank
2820178 it turns out they hit both military and civilian airports
2820179 we will offer a resolution today that makes clear that the russian actions in georgia are unacceptable to the international community and we condemn this military assault
2820180 well see whats in there then well know what to do
2820181 i left that woman seven times and seven times i returned

2820185 its a main thoroughfare for us to get to houses west of the station and depending on where the call comes in at we take it all the time so youre going to see a little delay but not a big delay
2820186 but then thats what the whole investigation is looking at and from the reading ive been doing asbestos exposure can take many years to come through

2820200 i would say your trucks and suvs are off probably 30 percent and on the other side your cars are probably up just that much
2820201 we are putting peoples name on a list but there will be none available until probably october
2820202 our sales on the focus have probably nearly tripled compared to a year ago
2820203 i loved the geo metro it got 50 miles per gallon 45 with the air on
2820204 they could have had these trucks getting 25 miles per gallon by now but they just havent im sure they will soon though
2820205 every single one of them were looking to get better gas mileage
2820206 ive dropped the price but it doesnt seem to matter
2820207 were able to buy suvs cheaper because of gas prices
2820208 i bought a 2005 chevy trail blazer listed at 12 000 kelleys book for 6 000 on wholesale and i can sell it for 8 496 customers can buy for under what it retails for
2820209 all four guys that are returning from april have been excellent
2820210 theyre not just good hockey players theyre good kids too
2820211 i was quite excited to be invited to the camp and to make the team just to be here and play for your country its an amazing experience
2820212 in north america you really go to the net hard and coaches preach that from a young age
2820213 crashing the net going to the net staying in on rebounds
2820214 here any type of contact with a goaltender as slight as it may be results in a penalty its just a little bit different mindset
2820215 we caused lots of disruption and weve really highlighted the folly of going ahead with this new power station
2820216 the atmosphere in the camp is very celebratory but well only claim victory once we know weve definitely scuppered e ons plans to build a new coal fired power station at kingsnorth
2820217 all the gold that leaves our village is headed to mali to this one man
2820218 he has the means to take it out we dont
2820219 for a long time hes worked with the white people
2820220 we dont live in the bush so we have nothing to do with child labor
2820221 i can assure you that what he declares is only a fraction of what is going out
2820222 if i am wrong you can cut off my head and put it on a platter
2820223 i buy some grams some kilos from here and there
2820224 service or even accept gold from a mine where children work
2820225 it comes from africa and it arrives in the swiss banks thats all you need to know
2820226 there is a desire to deal with this but the question is how
2820227 home depot can track every 2 by 4 to its forest of origin
2820228 you can track every bag of coffee every diamond to a specific diamond field but for gold theres nothing
2820229 if i have one wish its that i might someday have a little bit of money
2820230 sometimes i dream that one day ill own something made of gold
2820231 sometimes we dont need another chance to express how we feel or to ask someone to understand our situation sometimes we just need a firm kick in the pants an unsmiling expectation that if we mean all these wonderful things we talk about and sing about then lets see something to prove it

2820233 its a nice atmosphere i think to display art when you have all the blooming flowers around
2820234 i signed up a couple weeks before the storms to be a volunteer and i really didnt get out here to do anything
2820235 then i got the e mail that said we got a lot of damage we need as much help as we can get so it seemed like a good time to start it was a baptism by fire
2820236 after the storm it looked like there wasnt going to be much hope for the garden because everything was pretty much destroyed
2820237 honestly its come back a lot and thats probably the result of everyones work

2820254 we truly are a bunch of intolerant people who want to be heard but dont have the strength to hear we want to have an opinion but dont believe anyone else is entitled to one
2820255 i used to look forward to pitting my wits against people who i didnt necessarily agree with but who could argue a point on its merit
2820256 sure they didnt like me and wouldnt trust me further than they could throw me but they had the maturity and self confidence to listen

2820270 all through the painful twists and turns indian policy towards afghanistan was steeped in pragmatism and remained largely pakistan centric but things seem to be changing the horizons appear to have vastly expanded according to pakistani writer ahmed rashid

2820299 it felt great to get my first nfl sack even if it was in preseason
2820300 he had 14 sacks one year at washington state he has some natural rush ability
2820301 we told him when we signed him if harvey signs hed be gone in one day hes done a nice job taking advantage of the opportunity
2820302 we would have to achieve a truce and we would have to deal with the same parties as before
2820303 stay there two years and destroy the hamas regime down to the last office and the last operative
2820304 you israel control another people against their will and the palestinian people when they compare the two will choose hamas and not those who talk
2820305 we have spoken about him in regard to him prior to september
2820306 weve had a lot of discussions and we just want to do the right thing as we perceive them to be the right things his performance to this point has been spectacular moving him up to triple a we just wanted to see him get involved a little bit we have several different scenarios that weve kind of created mentally well see how it all plays out were prepared to do a couple of different things as we see fit
2820307 thats a possibility weve discussed a variety of different ideas about him we havent talked specifically about it but weve talked among ourselves among minor league staff members front office people everybodys been included in the conversation
2820308 we felt like he was ready for a new challenge and now hell get a chance to face hitters with a lot of major league experience that will only help him as he continues his rapid ascent through the minor leagues

2820314 where is the blockade there is no blockade it has been invented by the separatists who after having been caught on the wrong foot are seeking to guilt trip the amarnath shrine sangharsh samiti into calling off the jammu agitation which is just and has been completely peaceful
2820315 the shrine board act clearly lays down that it will be the responsibility of the body to provide these facilities to the pilgrims and the government should ensure that it carries out the brief without any hindrance

2820323 if you skip one meal the day beforehand in order to drop two or three pounds thats one thing but when someone tries to drop tremendous amounts of weight 10 pounds or more were concerned while they may not have an eating disorder in the strict sense they certainly have disordered eating
2820324 in 1997 three healthy college age men all died because they were trying to make weight for the wrestling team using similar rapid weight loss regimens based on dehydration wrestlers put on nonpermeable clothing and exercise hard and then dont rehydrate themselves this is dangerous
2820325 altering these entrenched behaviors will require a unified effort by coaches administrators parents and wrestlers throughout the sport
2820326 wrestlers have a short term goal to make their weight
2820327 they may not eat for a day but we all skip meals once in awhile teenage kids get hungry they make weight they eat right afterward that isnt necessarily binge eating
2820328 every wrestler must be examined by a physician and the physician determines the weight class that wrestler will compete at these issues have already been addressed
2820329 today wrestlers weigh in hours before or the day before the match they should have to weigh in just beforehand if someone had to wrestle in a dehydrated state weak as a kitten they wouldnt like it
2820330 i knew it what do you want to name her

2820340 true enough even if life seems prosaic definite possibilities come our way sometimes when we least expect it and it is up to us to make the most out of these possibilities and decide to live our lives the way we want to live them and not be bound by what is practical convenient and
2820341 i have been used to agreeing with people rituals and

2820344 it would be pink on the outside pink carpets pink furniture pink jammies the men on her staff would be cool with be shirtless chippendale types with names like leon
2820345 instead of a bowling alley in the basement of the white house paris would have a pilates studio and oh yeah shed have foam parties in the oval office for the white house staff and old girlfriends from boarding school
2820346 she would answer all questions while walking and posing for a wall of photographers and theyd be yelling out paris look here
2820347 the first half of every conference would be about what shes wearing paris would realize that as president she would have to tone it down a little shed lean toward prada
2820348 what would happen is rihanna would step off the plane in fishnet stockings music would blare and whole countries would melt at the sight of her
2820349 it would be like bush at the crawford ranch she would be in l a more than she would in washington d c

2820352 the military institution says it is ok to kill and use the most horrible weapons and that killing the enemy is heroic
2820353 i respect dick for having humanity over his military obligations
2820354 the regular people and the government wanted to surrender but the military people didnt want to surrender
2820355 i believe it is the stubbornness of the military people that caused the bombing of japan
2820356 our stance would not change with sanctions or the threat of sanctions
2820357 it is important that our country is ready to insist on its rights under any conditions
2820358 we havent fully recovered from a natural disaster and now were again being battered by a man made calamity
2820359 all peaceful avenues have been exhausted to resolve the conflict
2820360 we are now compelled to resort to the application of proportionate and justifiable force so that peace and order may be restored in north cotabato
2820361 there is a weapons shortage and a shortage of volunteers
2820362 if they continue killing people they wont win any seats in the next election
2820363 weve been seeing a change in the position of politicians
2820364 we want to change the views of ordinary people who are against the sadr movement
2820365 i expect it will be a successful political shift for the sadr movement and a change from guns to culture
2820366 the problem is that these terrorist groups are not motivated by only one or two reasons
2820367 there are groups that say they are from the mahdi army but they are not and theyve destroyed what mahdi army has built
2820368 if sadr cant control the special groups how can he expect to disarm them his call to disarm them will disappear with the wind
2820369 my views developed in the course of time but i have always believed in what i did and never acted against it
2820370 the soviet government had let the genie out of the bottle and however hard they tried later they couldnt put it back in
2820371 russia can neither be grasped by the mind nor measured by any common yardstick no attitude to her other than one of blind faith is admissible
2820372 broke russias back the red terror unleashed by its leaders their willingness to drown russia in blood is the first and foremost proof of it
2820373 the bitter russian experience which i have been studying and describing all my life will be for us a lesson that keeps us from new disastrous breakdowns
2820374 since the burmese military has ignored the call of the internal national community to begin an inclusive political process and unilaterally imposed a constitution designed to consolidate military rule it is imperative to review the international approach towards burma
2820375 a full blown castigation of the burmese generals could have caused considerable discomfort for bangkok which has just assumed the chair of asean which includes burma
2820376 a large trend is being crystallized among the palestinian national authority pna in ramallah to call for settling the situation with the gaza strip by force
2820377 to give the last chance for the egyptian government and the arab league to convince hamas to immediately end its coup and engage in the dialogue
2820378 but the door for dialogue will not be open forever and the leadership only gave one month time for the efforts
2820379 will be a dangerous thing if it was officially made
2820380 it will boost the internal split and separate gaza from the west bank
2820381 fatah elements who dominate the plos executive committee have a plan to prevent any attempt of approach between hamas and fatah
2820382 children wonder what their new classmates are going to be like or if theyre going to like their new teacher its a completely new experience for children starting school for the first time it can seem quite scary for a young child

2820385 he takes huge amounts of money from oil companies that are profiting in the former soviet union and many parts of the world
2820386 this has been one of the failures of the bush administration failing to build a strong relationship a mutually beneficial relationship with russia so wed have the kind of influence to persuade them to stop some of these very very dangerous efforts within their territory

2820412 we took him out a little early the other night
2820413 he was getting stiffer and stiffer as the game progressed it was getting hard to get loose he was still throwing great
2820414 were trying to not have this thing get to the point where it did last year
2820415 everything is pretty well fine other than the fact he has stitches
2820416 he was in good spirits last night when i spoke with him and hes anxious to get back
2820417 too bad i cant get on it it would sink

2820420 mobile cameras are a nice idea because you always have them with you but the thing about them is that the picture quality can look almost as grainy as the apollo 15 mission i dont think anyone would entrust their lifes memories to a cell phone camera
2820421 the fact that you have a phone with you all the time is a very powerful thing take for example the london tube bombing people on the scene were able to take pictures so they have a security application also
2820422 the unique challenge posed by the mobile phone camera is that everything must be really really small and really cheap you cant go charging say us 200 for the camera part of the mobile handset there is definitely a unique set of challenges
2820423 we have been focusing on making an entire camera for between us 1 and us 2 sure its not your nikon professional but it is a very cheap and small 3mm camera with a lot of applications including in the medical field

2820427 he was in good spirits last night when i spoke with him and hes anxious to get back
2820428 its striking how many states have taken on poverty as a top policy priority
2820429 no one even used the word poverty in the past it was all about helping working families
2820430 these new state and local efforts are important because they reflect a greater level of engagement and commitment by legislators and governors
2820431 states are also putting pressure on the federal government to do more
2820432 a lot of initiatives dont produce good results the political support is there now but if you want an impact on poverty you need a 10 year program
2820433 were bringing people together at the table so the efforts arent just haphazard by individual entities but collaborative and holistic in their approach
2820434 when we showed lawmakers how much poverty and extreme poverty was in their districts it really did change their minds they understood the urgency of taking action
2820435 i want to be judged not by the number of people we provide but by the results we provide by the end of the year

2820449 ese reconocimiento de poder vetar no es lo mismo a la hora de construir
2820450 en misiones hemos visto claramente que esa construcci n que se hizo para el si y el no no necesariamente sirvi para decir este es nuestro candidato a gobernador o a intendente
2820451 la idea es tratar de comprenderlo como fruto de las transformaciones culturales y sociales en la argentina y no como la imposici n de alguien que viene de afuera o que les saca a otros
2820452 nadie dir a que los radicales les sacan votos a los peronistas o viceversa dir n en un momento hist rico que la oferta radical peronista o socialista concita m s adhesi n que otra y lo mismo pasa con las adhesiones religiosas
2820453 saber en profundidad sobre las religiones en el pa s es muy importante porque tiene impacto en lo pol tico y lo social ya que si una instituci n religiosa dice nosotros somos el 100 por 100 se adjudica derechos beneficios y privilegios y en la historia de la argentina esto lo hizo la iglesia cat lica diciendo somos la naci n la totalidad y tenemos que tener ventajas respecto con el resto de los credos
2820454 hoy ha cambiado mucho en la argentina y es importante tanto en misiones como en el resto del pa s ver el crecimiento que ha tenido el evangelismo y dentro del evangelismo los grupos pentecostales

2820463 people know everything that there is to know about schools in new york
2820464 unfortunately in this country we dont have that kind of information about schooling
2820465 what we are better off identifying is the kind of extra value that education offers so that we measure the progress people are making not the raw results
2820466 all information other than those things of course that are subject to privacy provisions should be made open and accountable to parents to the broader community

2820489 one of the two candidates challenging sheldon silver unseats him though its a little unlikely the new york times new procedures require that inspectors be able to see what they are inspecting
2820490 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2820491 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2820492 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2820493 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2820494 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2820495 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2820496 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2820497 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2820498 and hong kong is one of the most exciting places on earth

2820500 consciousness is among other things a spontaneous exercise in creativity
2820501 puede que el acto no haya estado bien la manera de hacerlo no estuvo bien
2820502 the voter registration officials simply take the word of the registrant with no follow up
2820503 some states that require some backup documentation merely ask for a utility bill or a drivers license neither of which prove citizenship in other words legal or illegal aliens can easily register to vote in local and national elections
2820504 while the news media perpetuated the assertion that bush and the gop stole the election it could very well have been illegal aliens voting in florida that made the outcome so close
2820505 bush may have beaten gore by more votes if illegals were excluded since immigrants tend to vote for democrats or gore could have won decisively had there been prior screening before people were allowed into the voting booths
2820506 there was absolutely no mention in the mainstream media regarding suspected voter fraud by illegal or legal aliens it was much easier for the agenda driven newspeople to accuse republicans of stealing the election
2820507 florida is not unique thousands of non citizens are registered to vote in some states and tens if not hundreds of thousands in total may be present on the voter rolls nationwide these numbers are significant local elections are often decided by only a handful of votes and even national elections have likely been within the margin of the number of non citizens illegally registered to vote
2820508 there is no reliable method to determine the number of non citizens registered or actually voting because most laws to ensure that only citizens vote are ignored are inadequate or are systematically undermined by government officials those who ignore the implications of non citizen registration and voting either are willfully blind to the problem or may actually favor this form of illegal voting
2820509 americans would be shocked to discover that hundreds of thousands of general election voters are illegal aliens green card immigrants and criminals whove murdered raped and robbed us citizens and guess which political party benefits the most from their votes the one thats pushing for amnesty and a bag full of free goodies
2820510 to keep non citizens from diluting citizens votes immigration and election officials must cooperate far more effectively than they have to date and state and federal officials must increase their efforts to enforce the laws against non citizen voting that are already on the books
2820511 while the liberal media and the liberal establishment ignore what is a huge scandal american voters are having their rights violated when an illegal aliens or felon or other person prohibited by law to vote their votes cancels out those of american citizens
2820512 liberals want illegal aliens and felons to vote they benefit from such rampant fraud
2820513 i called my partners and said i think i just met a future president of the united states
2820514 i went from being a senator a young senator to being considered for vice president running for president being a vice presidential candidate and becoming a national public figure
2820515 all of which fed a self focus an egotism a narcissism that leads you to believe that you can do whatever you want youre invincible and there will be no consequences
2820516 he could have been a force in american politics for a very long time
2820517 the fact that he had not spent his life in politics was his greatest asset people at the time were saying he didnt have enough experience and hadnt been tested actually hed been tested in ways other people had not
2820518 if youre an incumbent one of your nightmares is a fresh face coming out of the woodwork with the resources to be competitive
2820519 has shown a remarkable disrespect for his office for the moral dimensions of leadership for his friends for his wife for his precious daughter
2820520 i suspect the first thing he thought about is im going to protect myself politically he was worried about his family finding out he was worried about the rest of the staff finding out he was worried about the press finding out
2820521 consistent moderation placed edwards among the center right of senate democrats
2820522 he climbed onto the slab at the funeral home laid there and hugged his body and promised that hed do all he could to make life better for people to live up to wades ideals of service
2820523 as he told me later edwards had recounted the exact story to him almost in the exact same words a year or two before and with the same preface that hed never shared the memory with anyone else
2820524 he wanted to be vice president and said what he had to
2820525 the thing that would surprise me is if he doesnt continue to serve in some way hes been underestimated many times
2820526 im not sure i had a political career for the future anyway
2820527 im not sure that politics was what i wanted to spend my life doing
2820528 i dont know whats possible and whats gone i dont think anythings ended i see no end my lord and my wife have forgiven me so im going to move on
2820529 hey im changing so i can get votes in texas or arizona
2820530 barr conceivably could be to john mccain what ralph nader was to al gore in 2000 ruinous
2820531 you have in ralph naders candidacy a genuine arab american who has a lot of notoriety and publicity it would be detrimental to obamas candidacy
2820532 obama cannot take the peace vote for granted there are peace candidates running from across the political spectrum
2820533 on the right are bob barr and chuck baldwin on the left are cynthia mckinney and ralph nader he needs to earn the vote of americans opposed to further war
2820534 employees here dont know where hell get the ethanol there are only gas pumps here
2820535 its like magical thinking with no one bothering to scratch the surface
2820536 full on pander mode flailing around looking for anything that has traction in polls
2820537 saying that we can drill our way out of it this idea that every little bit helps is denying reality
2820538 it may not be good politics but its not fair to the electorate to let them think that a few little tweaks are going to fix the problem
2820539 if we want to enable the technologies of tomorrow like plug in electric cars we need electricity to plug into
2820540 state capitalism with direct intervention in a large sector of the economy
2820541 if wall street sees 4 8 plants built with important federal support over the next seven years on cost and on schedule i think youre going to see robust support from the financial sector
2820542 thats just not a feasible or responsible thing to say
2820543 if were going to cut down on greenhouse gases we have to find a way to sequester them and emissions in general
2820544 i have been an oil man my whole life but this is one emergency we cannot drill our way out of
2820545 on this issue i think that americans are ahead of the candidates of both parties
2820546 our energy economy is undergoing a transformation and were just in the early stages
2820547 its the first big unequivocal test about what this possible president really thinks
2820548 youve got to be sure that you get the right person the person has got to be of presidential stature has got to be someone you can be comfortable with work with and help you as president compatibility is very crucial
2820549 the chemistry between us had been correct but not warm
2820550 you dont want it to be a reason for people to question your judgment
2820551 tensions and hostilities between georgians and ossetians are in no way justification for russian troops crossing an internationally recognized border
2820552 russia to immediately and unconditionally withdraw its forces from the territory of georgia
2820553 the consequences for euro atlantic stability and security are grave
2820554 talks among all sides and said the united states the u n security council and other parties should try to help bring about a peaceful resolution
2820555 its both sides fault both have been somewhat provocative with each other

2820557 want to continue flying in your private jet and air conditioning your 16 000 square foot mansion and not worry about hurting the environment then send us your money and well offset the damage youre doing by planting trees
2820558 there are good muslims and bad muslims that i have to admit just like there are good and bad jews
2820559 no this was their place first they could take the hot weather and some of them went far in this world theyre not lazy
2820560 i know hes smart i dont think hes a dummy like bush
2820561 im fine i have to go for blood work again they keep me waiting for an hour im all sunburned like a berry i get in the water and i forget to get out i get in conversations
2820562 john and i will tell you there were interesting races four years ago and eight years ago but in many ways this is one of the most interesting races in all of american history we have a chance to lift our country to a new way of thinking this can be a transformative election but make no mistake its close closer than it should be
2820563 mccain has promised and reaffirmed his commitment to continue the same policies weve had these past eight years for another four
2820564 we cannot do that barack obama has lifted our spirits and led us to believe yes we can solve the global climate crisis address the other issues we have to take on and has said we can come together and create a new century with bright hope
2820565 you want some advice make iraq the 51st state and lets get the hell out of there
2820566 these are not normal times the relationship between the planet and ourselves has been irrevocably and dramatically altered were a bull in a china shop today as the sun sets we will have put another 70 million tons of global warming pollution into the atmosphere
2820567 just so you all know we did set a record
2820568 ive been involved in fundraising a long time and to have two incredible men who were nominees and both should have been president and also the fact i got a nobel prize winner and an academy award winner this is too much even for me
2820569 he promised america it would be a campaign of respect of ideas not insults and the american people wanted a better campaign and he gives you paris hilton and britney spears
2820570 if he cant keep his word about the campaign and he cant keep his word about the issues that are really important to the american people and he makes the wrong judgments about how to protect america then his candidacy is in fact dangerous in terms of americas security and you cant trust it and you cant trust him thats what this is about
2820571 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet
2820572 carbon tax alone wont solve climate change but we cant solve climate change without carbon pricing
2820573 areas where the sun shines and the wind blows to the cities in the east and west that need the electricity
2820574 alberta and saskatchewan for example have some of the best wind and solar resources and could benefit from better interconnections with b c and manitoba respectively
2820575 without transmission and without storage a utility cannot put more than a few new percentage points into the system
2820576 nuclear power is not renewable power its mined out of the earth and its toxic
2820577 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
2820578 its certainly technically and technologically doable and this is the sad thing it may not be politically doable
2820579 i just want to see an understanding that gore was right about the first inconvenient truth global warming but we have to recognize the second inconvenient truth which is that we dont have the means to do it right now
2820580 the price mccain paid for his partys nomination has been to reverse himself on position after position
2820581 that doesnt meet my definition of a maverick you cant be a maverick when politically its important for you but not a maverick when it doesnt work for you
2820582 weve been through two very tough elections at the national level and its very easy to lose confidence
2820583 theres frustration there because theyre watching these childish ad campaigns and they know exactly how to answer it but theyre powerless to do so
2820584 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
2820585 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
2820586 we have to free ourselves from the domination of the big oil companies that have the ability to manipulate the price
2820587 the global warming climate change issue is so important that people on both sides of the issue including policymakers should be fully informed before policy is actually formulated tragically thats not happening in the global warming issue
2820588 many things we thought we knew about the climate system just a few years ago are now proving to be uncertain or quite mistaken
2820589 its become quite news worthy to go out and tell people that we are about to have an apocalyptic climate change and the moment you make that announcement its easy to go around the world and find things to support that viewpoint
2820590 the ipcc is a political organization setup by the un to provide evidence to support the framework convention on climate change its entirely political they made up what they were going to do beforehand and choose whatever science they ipcc could find to support their theory
2820591 this cuts at the heart of national sovereignty of the u s we would be saying that we would allow an international body to come in and dictate to our industries our businesses our people what they can do and what they cant do the use of what energy the sources of energy the cost of energy etc
2820592 carbon dioxide gas co2 lags behind temperature changes in history by 800 years co2 doesnt cause temperature change
2820593 based on the evidence of ice core studies at the polar ice caps it shows that co2 follows temperature not the opposite so the fundamental assumption of the whole theory of climate change by human intervention of co2 emissions causing temperature changes is wrong
2820594 human intervention accounts for a small fraction of co2 of the atmospheric gases in the atmosphere that water vapor accounts for about 97 of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere co2 accounts for 1 9 therefore man is responsible for less than 3 of all greenhouse effect in the atmosphere globally
2820595 0 55f 0 30c cooler than the 1971 2000 average
2820596 my concern is that we may be moving away from an irrational lack of concern about climate change to an equally irrational panic about it
2820597 the problem is that in this panic we are going to spend our money unwisely we will take actions that are counterproductive and we will fail to do many of those things that will benefit the environment and ourselves for example right now the clearest threat to many species is habitat destruction take the orangutans for instance one of those charismatic species that people are often fascinated by and concerned about they are endangered because of deforestation in our fear of global warming it would be sad if we fail to find funds to purchase those forests before they are destroyed and thus let this species go extinct at the heart of the matter is how much faith we decide to put in science even how much faith scientists put in science our times have benefited from clear thinking science based rationality i hope this prevails as we try to deal with our changing climate
2820598 co founder of ipcc al gore is trying to be a climate change profiteer essentially he wants to make a fortune by creating a new market for a product that he is attempting to create by legislative fiat if he succeeds and carbon emissions trading comes to the united states al gore will be uniquely positioned to cash in hes made sure of that
2820599 gore himself is chairman and founder of a private equity firm called generation investment management gim he says the london based firm invests money from institutions and wealthy investors in companies that are becoming environmentally friendly to use green parlance gim appears to have considerable influence over major carbon credit trading firms the u s based chicago climate exchange ccx and the u k based carbon neutral company cnc ccx appears to be the only firm in the u s that claims to trade carbon credits as a politician gore speaks warmly of transparency but as gim chairman gore has not been forthcoming little is known about his shadowy firms finances where it gets funding and what projects it supports
2820600 al gores carbon crusade the money and connections behind it
2820601 the consensus in kyoto as outlined in the ipcc report will bind america to reduce energy consumption by 25 which will have a devastating effect on the american standard of living and the u s economy it will continue to drive more industries out of america for a more global economy
2820602 senator lieberman supports both democrats and republicans and he gave to the committee as a senior member of the caucus
2820603 our dependence on foreign oil means that we are buying from our enemies
2820604 how bout some friends and a few a holes that better
2820605 the american people know something is wrong as far as energy is concerned
2820606 i hope he grabs that part of middle america that we failed to reach
2820607 i want him to make more money in wind than he did in oil
2820608 it was my first experience in the takeover field expansion by acquisition
2820609 people had splashed water all over the counters thrown paper towels on the floor and boone pickens couldnt stand to see his investment in disarray so without a word he started picking up the paper towels and wiping down the counters himself
2820610 i think the rest of us were so embarrassed we started to clean up quietly around him
2820611 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
2820612 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
2820613 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
2820614 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
2820615 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
2820616 the cake went all over me that was the end of my suit
2820617 i always wondered whether sometime a political protester would hit me with a pie in the face i never thought a friendly birthday cake would attack me from the rear
2820618 id like to hear the governor and legislative leaders tell the voters where the shortfall is coming from and unless i hear that im not sure we ought to take a gamble
2820619 education funding is very important part of our economy has to be based on attracting and keeping good paying jobs and we cant do that without a well educated work force
2820620 both obama and mccain need to make their running mate choices very carefully because after all the influence that cheney and gore developed people are going to analyze their choices very carefully
2820621 we will never go back to the days when the vice presidency held little influence the national government is involved in too many things for a president not to have a strong partner standing at his side
2820622 even selecting himself as the running mate something that has never been done in history
2820623 theres something healthy in the vice presidency becoming a separate entity
2820624 in the next month one man either the democratic presidential nominee or the republican presidential nominee will choose the next vice president of the united states
2820625 their choice will be ratified by their party conventions and we the people will accept it but the idea that one person will select somebody who has a one in three chance of becoming president of the united states is to my mind very problematic
2820626 presidential candidates usually get vetted for a couple of years but the vice president just gets picked by one guy
2820627 its kind of weird process if you stop and think about it
2820628 it ought to be a more competitive process at the early stages
2820629 maybe people should run for vice president i dont know but we should be talking about it because the process now is fundamentally unhealthy it is not democratic for one man or woman to be able to pick the next president of the united states
2820630 an anonymous secondhand quotation from sen barack obama at a closed house democratic caucus meeting on july 29 caused an uproar among partisans it is an excellent example of how the pernicious use of unnamed sources so pervasive in washington can backfire on journalists and sources
2820631 this is the moment that the world is waiting for i have become a symbol of the possibility of america returning to our best traditions
2820632 in response to what one of the house members prefaced the question by
2820633 said i wish i could take credit for that but i cant because its not about me its about america its about the people of germany and the people of europe looking for a new hope new relationships as we go forward in the world so he expressly said that its not about me
2820634 lots of people are reading the quote about obama being a symbol and getting it wrong his entire point of that riff was that the campaign is not about him
2820635 the post left out the important first half of the sentence which was something along the lines of it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all
2820636 it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all its about america i have just become a symbol
2820637 anonymous quotes should be used sparingly this one wasnt worth it if you werent there be careful about judging the context
2820638 i have become the symbol of america returning to our best traditions
2820639 it scared me to see how the mainstream media were propping up george bush while faithfully reporting every stupid lie that the bush campaign made up about al gore
2820640 ill use every talent i possess and all my energy to try to bring back tolerance decency and generosity to the country i love
2820641 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
2820642 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view
2820643 we are pleased to note ofcom has vindicated the ipccs claim against channel 4 in spirit and in substance
2820644 it is entirely appropriate people should bear a cost if only of unpopularity and criticism for speaking freely however the cost should be reasonable and not disproportionate there should not be in the words of a famous supreme court decision a chilling effect on free speech
2820645 despite all the talk about sexism in the presidential campaign the majority of women voters laid the blame for hillarys loss squarely on her and her strategists shoulders they largely reject gender as a cause of her demise
2820646 sitting next to someone on a senate committee has sparked more than a few deep friendships
2820647 obviously my name was linked to it but other than that theres nothing that can be said
2820648 he was a governor who tried to not ruffle feathers
2820649 as a debater i felt like i was in the twilight zone show you want to reach over and slit the arm to see if theres flesh and blood or just wires
2820650 one of my big accomplishments was at one point in the debate he started to sweat
2820651 is it boring to win five times as a democrat in a state thats overwhelmingly republican
2820652 obviously the people of indiana think theres something exciting about him
2820653 well im voting for barack obama hell help with global warming
2820654 it would take as long as 15 years that is until 2023 to go from starting a pilot plant to proving the technology will work
2820655 we have to store radioactive waste for 250 000 years
2820656 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
2820657 the un secretary general has not uttered a word meaning that he respects our laws and justice system why should a lesser mortal from the us say that malaysia is not up to their standards
2820658 why should gore and the us president give their evaluation of a country does he not know the meaning of the udhr universal declaration of human rights and the un charter respect for the internal affairs of a country
2820659 but if they have any substantive legal problem that they would like to highlight internationally they are welcome to discuss it with us but in a manner that is judicious careful and respectful
2820660 this will give the true picture so there will be no misconceptions that can hurt malaysias image
2820661 any judgment or directive by a court or the legal department should be upheld foreign countries should understand the malaysian legal system and that we do uphold the rule of law
2820662 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
2820663 i think he should concentrate on his environmental pursuits instead of interfering anyway he has gore d us before
2820664 various departments are engaged in this exercise the home minister will be annexing certain documents and i believe the home ministry will also be producing certain reports to augment the submission
2820665 it is a scary story made more scary by the fact that most people in america dont understand what the problems are
2820666 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
2820667 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
2820668 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
2820669 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
2820670 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
2820671 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
2820672 we have regular exchanges with malaysian diplomats in washington on a number of subjects including with the malaysian charge daffaires yesterday
2820673 anwar ibrahims case was one of the topics of conversation
2820674 we take note of the many serious questions raised within malaysia including by the malaysian bar council concerning this case
2820675 for the second time gore is goring us repeating the 1998 goring
2820676 we hope he will stop goring as it is about time he re examines the goring process within himself and his country
2820677 there is no way other countries should look down on us in the administration of our own laws our criminal procedure code and the penal code emanate from the common law
2820678 therefore there is no reason whatsoever for any other power in the world to criticise us in administering justice and the rule of law
2820679 this boat is going to be the toyota prius of the houseboat business
2820680 it is the most eco friendly houseboat anywhere in the country
2820681 gore will consume a lot more fuel driving to and from the lake than he will ever use cruising on this houseboat
2820682 climate confusion how global warming hysteria leads to bad science pandering politicians and misguided policies that hurt the poor
2820683 we are a debt relief agency amp have proudly helped people file for bankruptcy for over 30 yrs
2820684 the larger theme is how environmentalism seems to harm the poorest people in the poorest places on the planet
2820685 its looking at how the hysteria around global warming will affect people on low or fixed incomes it asks is there a disease and is the cure worse than the disease the science isnt settled global warming was invented five or 10 years ago
2820686 the film al gore and hollywood dont want you to see
2820687 i dont think it would be a bad thing for this earth to warm up
2820688 greenpeaces claims are based on science and the science is very clear the latest report from the uns leading scientists says that climate change is happening human activity is causing it and its a huge threat to our species
2820689 but we can prevent the worst if we act immediately to slash emissions and kickstart an energy revolution with a massive expansion of renewables and improvements in energy efficiency
2820690 despise ryanair because it used to be that we with our own sort whereas i see ryanair as making ireland wealthy they see it as a negative for ireland
2820691 obama telling us not to drive suvs and al gore saying that you cant use air conditioning
2820692 we have to live with our feet very much rooted in reality
2820693 were pursuing renewables as well but you cant simply take away half of your energy base
2820694 to be sure reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years will require us to overcome many obstacles
2820695 it would be difficult for north carolina to meet a 10 percent renewable portfolio standard with only new north carolina renewable supply resources by 2021
2820696 bridging the worlds of environmentalism finance technology and politics together mr gore is ideally suited to speak to this audience of innovators striving to integrate green building practices and leading edge technology into the 21st century in a way that is both smart and sustainable
2820697 move quickly and boldly to shake off complacency throw aside old habits and rise clear eyed and alert to the necessity of big changes
2820698 to commit to producing 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
2820699 to be sure reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years will require us to overcome many obstacles
2820700 to those who say the costs are still too high i ask them to consider whether the costs of oil and coal will ever stop increasing if we keep relying on quickly depleting energy sources to feed a rapidly growing demand all around the world
2820701 reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years
2820702 provide funding and global business building expertise to a range of businesses both public and private and to entrepreneurs
2820703 an oil and gas exploration and production e amp p company
2820704 has already dug 100 wells around the world and is in the processing of raising additional capital
2820705 it would be ironic to say the least if kleiners first green jackpot turns out to be a company that actually drills for oil
2820706 designs microbes that when injected into oil wells increase oil production and decrease use of water
2820707 al gores carbon crusade the money and connections behind it
2820708 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
2820709 if a person is too safe and conservative hes not likely to come up with great ideas
2820710 pick your failure apart as if you were a commentator at a golf tournament
2820711 being fired teaches you that your workplace doesnt define you as much as you thought it did
2820712 dont be too blas too self blaming or too defensive
2820713 my expectations about my previous job were off and i also lacked some of the resources i needed
2820714 we tend to overreact to failures and ignore the successful aspects of these experiences
2820715 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
2820716 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
2820717 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
2820718 a thirst for oil comes back to haunt a nation of gas guzzlers
2820719 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
2820720 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
2820721 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
2820722 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
2820723 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
2820724 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
2820725 wait a second if youve gotten to the point where youre sheepish about us doing well i cant vote for you
2820726 hey jimmy were only guys we show up at 11 30 we tell the jokes thats what pretty boys do all night
2820727 oh yeah but hes not as good as al gore if only al gore had won did i tell you how much i like al gore
2820728 its no good running a pig farm badly for 30 years while saying really i was meant to be a ballet dancer by then pigs will be your style
2820729 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
2820730 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
2820731 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment
2820732 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations
2820733 our country needs a new energy policy that reinvests in america and it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy
2820734 could easily be described as hell so hot so deadly that only a handful of the teeming billions now alive will survive
2820735 with an almighty crash the ice split right between my feet and a 300 tonne block broke off fortunately i fell on to the main part of the chunk but now it started turning round so i ended up in the water i began swimming around the chunk hoping to find a point of access to the ice there was none i was not afraid of being so close to drowning but of deserting inge and our two kids and i was furious at having agreed to do the job without proper surveillance
2820736 the benefits of strong and early action far outweigh the economic costs of not acting
2820737 a degree of warming that would surely yield dangerous climate impacts
2820738 sea level changes of several metres per century occur in the palaeoclimate record in response to forcings slower and weaker than the present human made forcing this indicates that the ice may disintegrate and melt faster than previously assumed and that the warming may be delayed less by the ice than assumed
2820739 if humanity wishes to preserve a planet similar to that on which civilisation developed and to which life on earth is adapted palaeoclimate evidence and ongoing climate change suggest that co2 will need to be reduced from its current 385ppm to at most 350ppm
2820740 low cost solar power geothermal energy some non intrusive climatic engineering or genetically engineered carbon eating trees
2820741 that about 8 of the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is absorbed by vegetation and returned to the atmosphere every year
2820742 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
2820743 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that
2820744 theyre more active in the warm months during the winter the freeze often will kill them
2820745 youll actually see evidence like black dirt on their skin and thats the flea feces the dogs are usually really scratching and itching and licking where the fleas are cats will be scratching their necks and heads
2820746 most of the better ones are available though your veterinarian there are a few good ones over the counter there are topical products you can put on once a month and they really are effective
2820747 theres really three places you need to treat them one is on your pet another one is the environment the other one would be outside if theyre spending a lot of time outside
2820748 when temperatures start to climb people want to get out into the woods and get away be a little cooler
2820749 naturally a remote area enables them to do things that normally they wouldnt consider to be right if they were closer to civilized areas
2820750 inhibitions start to go not only with property but also with the alcohol limit
2820751 as the summer wears on the potential fire danger is worse
2820752 youre not making good decisions youre not putting out your campfire youre lighting one in a place where there are already ordinances against it because its too dry the wind picks up and youve got a real potential problem
2820753 its a big problem and its not just law enforcements problem
2820754 well break it up make citations take away alcohol whatever it takes to resolve the problem
2820755 i urge your colleagues to take even bolder steps toward solving the climate crisis
2820756 we have an historic opportunity to shift to a clean energy economy and in the process create new sustainable jobs to support the development and deployment of these new technologies
2820757 im afraid right now that we are more concerned about the business climate than the earths climate
2820758 until we realize they are not mutually exclusive we wont be able to address these issues
2820759 but it should be clear to anyone who has been watching the session that weve already
2820760 under governor patrick massachusetts joined the regional greenhouse gas initiative and became the first state in the nation to require greenhouse gas analysis and mitigation in major real estate projects
2820761 comprehensive energy legislation the oceans management bill and pending biofuels legislation all put massachusetts into a leadership position nationally we support the creation of an economy wide cap as the next step in reducing greenhouse gas emissions but many details remain to be worked out with the legislature
2820762 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
2820763 the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
2820764 this is an investment that will pay itself back many times over
2820765 its an expensive investment but not compared to the rising cost of continuing to invest in fossil fuels
2820766 for decades al gore has challenged the skeptics in washington on climate change and awakened the conscience of a nation to the urgency of this threat i strongly agree with vice president gore that we cannot drill our way to energy independence but must fast track investments in renewable sources of energy like solar power wind power and advanced biofuels and those are the investments i will make as president its a strategy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and cannot be outsourced and one that will leave our children a world that is cleaner and safer
2820767 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
2820768 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
2820769 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
2820770 we have been drilling for more oil and the prices have gone up
2820771 a lot more oil has been found a lot more has been produced
2820772 the exploding demand for oil especially in places like china is overwhelming the rate of new discoveries by so much that oil prices are almost certain to continue upward over time no matter what the oil companies promise
2820773 john mccain enters the offshore drilling debate with voters favor
2820774 wants the government to act to address the immediate price consequences and to act now for achieving energy independence in the medium and long term
2820775 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
2820776 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
2820777 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
2820778 produce every kilowatt of electricity through wind sun and other earth friendly energy sources within 10 years this goal is achievable affordable and transformative
2820779 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
2820780 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
2820781 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
2820782 i am now here spreading the word about the climate project and what we can do in india and elsewhere to help
2820783 we are expected to give 10 inconvenient truth presentations within a year
2820784 the reason why the global warming message is a success is that ordinary people are involved in it who are spreading the word
2820785 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of that has got to change
2820786 gore backed his case for renewable electricity with logical case studies
2820787 windmills should be installed in every uninhabited windy place in this country
2820788 in 1970 the u s imported 24 percent of its oil by 1990 it was 42 percent and today its almost 70 percent we import 70 percent of our oil at a cost of us 700 billion a year four times the annual cost of the iraq war ive been an oil man all my life but this is one emergency we cant drill our way out of but if we create a new renewable energy network we can break our addiction to foreign oil
2820789 when president john f kennedy challenged our nation to land a man on the moon and bring him back safely in 10 years many people doubted we could accomplish that goal
2820790 but eight years and two months later neil armstrong and buzz aldrin walked on the surface of the moon
2820791 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now
2820792 we want to jump on this bandwagon we have to
2820793 there is strong disagreement with many of the legal analytical economic science and policy interpretations
2820794 is a deeply flawed and unsuitable vehicle for reducing greenhouse gas emissions
2820795 will not only harm the us economy but will fail to provide an effective response to the global challenge of climate change as the president observed in april decisions with such far reaching impact should not be left to unelected regulators and judges
2820796 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
2820797 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront the issue as president next year
2820798 when you connect the dots it turns out that the real solutions to the climate crisis are the very same measures needed to renew our economy and escape the trap of ever rising energy prices
2820799 because the sun doesnt shine and the wind doesnt blow all the time
2820800 the country is not going to be able to go cold turkey
2820801 we have a hundred years of infrastructure with trillions of dollars of investment that is not simply going to be made obsolete
2820802 i have never seen an opportunity for the country like the one thats emerging now
2820803 at the least the have a lot of hatred of anybody who is enjoying life
2820804 i see theyve got the hoary old beat up on single parents
2820805 ive got one view on that whatever we do with single parents we have got to be guided by what is in the best interest of the children and its not always in the best interest of every child that mum is at work all day
2820806 and the truth is most people on the dpb are not there for very long
2820807 im all in favour of supporting single parents to get into work but in the final analysis we have to be guided by what is in the best interest of the children in a particular family
2820808 theyve got a lot of things going on in their lives and to tell a single parent they have a work obligation can be too tough
2820809 hearing the news was tragic stunning words cant describe it
2820810 how can i help thats all we were thinking we talked about how the best thing we could do was try to play volleyball
2820811 it meant a tremendous amount to myself and the guys when we heard from him
2820812 he talked about trying to move on he just told us it will be difficult but together well be much stronger
2820813 we wanted to have a moment of silence where we could gather our thoughts before starting this journey
2820814 it was a moment of silence to honor the bachman family
2820815 the one thing weve always talked about is that this is about a team its not about individual people
2820816 the thing that came across as hugh was talking to us is you know what ive got this happening right now but we came here with a goal in mind and weve invested all this time in it and we need to go out there and try to complete what we started
2820817 it means going out there and playing better every match than we did the previous match
2820818 we really felt the loss as one of our own
2820819 maybe thats why it hurt so much it just felt so close
2820820 the best way we can honor them at this juncture is to go out and compete every day and play hard every day and enjoy and love the game of volleyball and it is a game
2820821 we should be playing it and enjoying it and loving it as they would
2820822 were totally aware that we may see him and we may not
2820823 thats completely all right with us he has other priorities
2820824 ive played in many big games but the energy tonight was different
2820825 i think they knew that history was being made tonight
2820826 obviously it was a proud moment for their country as it is for ours you could feel the electricity
2820827 the excitement of it the anxiousness of it the anticipation was just crazy
2820828 im kind of glad its out of the way now this game was just over the top
2820829 he basically came up to us and said im here to support you our country supports you and so go out there and kick some butt
2820830 so i think that it will be good for us
2820831 you just had to smile because you couldnt write it any better
2820832 principally we show that air pollution as measured by particulate matter in smoke or pm10 does affect the health of boys who have problems with asthma although the health impact isnt great there were small decreases in lung function during very high pollution days for boys with asthma
2820833 the majority of students on the other hand who didnt have respiratory problems were not affected however all students coughed slightly more on high pollution nights
2820834 this is the first time that this urine test has been used to detect exposure to wood smoke pollution in new zealand
2820835 another important result which contradicts an urban myth is that you cannot escape the health effects of air pollution by going inside and slamming the door indoors is just as polluted as outdoors
2820836 our tests show there is very little difference in the concentrations of pm10 pm2 5 and pm1 particulates between indoors and outdoors contrary to many peoples belief
2820837 essentially pollution reaches peoples lungs even if they stay inside on high pollution days there is no escape from wood smoke pollution particularly in older wooden houses during winter temperature inversions in christchurch or anywhere else
2820838 they were really enthusiastic and supportive which made the project much easier to co ordinate

2820853 fizemos um grande primeiro tempo mas o que eu temia aconteceu o time sentiu novamente o cansa o no final tivemos sorte teve o lance da bola na trave em um ataque do cruzeiro mas isso faz parte
2820854 ele j havia me pedido para n o jogar o outro jogo e eu acho isso normal desrespeito jogar com a cabe a a rea

2820870 your dad was cleaning out his cage and left him outside so he could get some fresh air and eat some grass it was a wire cage while he went inside to watch some tv then the neighbor came over and asked if we had a pig in our backyard because something was squealing really loud no we no have pig your dad said thinking about it he ran to the backyard and saw that sniffles got his back leg caught in the cage he couldnt get it out so he was screaming so i guess it sounded like a pig your dad couldnt help him so the only way to help was to snap the leg off
2820871 daddy we found a duck at mt trashmore and it was really cute so we took it but then it died can we still keep it
2820872 who are the next big things in rock or alternate music
2820873 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
2820874 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
2820875 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
2820876 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
2820877 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
2820878 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
2820879 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
2820880 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
2820881 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
2820882 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
2820883 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
2820884 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
2820885 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
2820886 i kissed a girl and i liked it the taste of her cherry chapstick
2820887 tell me which one to kill or i kill em both and then i kill you

2820910 diets low in saturated fat and cholesterol that include 25 grams of soy protein a day may reduce the risk of heart disease
2820911 studies showing the dark side of soy date back 100 years
2820912 the 1999 fda approved health claim pleased big business despite massive evidence showing risks associated with soy and against the protest of the fdas own top scientists soy is a 4 billion u s industry thats taken these health claims to the bank
2820913 there is important information on the cancer protective values of soy
2820914 as with any food it can have benefits in one system and detriments in another an individual who is sensitive to it may have an adverse response to soy and not all soy is alike
2820915 soy is not a food that is native to north america or europe and you have issues when you move food from one part of the world to another
2820916 we fare better when we eat according to our ethnicity soy is a viable food but we need to look at how its used
2820917 the soy industry has come a long way from when hippies were boiling up the beans
2820918 many soy products should be beneficial to cardiovascular and overall health because of their high content of polyunsaturated fats fiber vitamins and minerals and low content of saturated fat
2820919 chips and soda are vegetarian why do i feel sick

2820922 is equivalent to the total amount consumed in sweden population 9 million over an average five day period
2820923 its important to remember that its our own insatiable demand for those cheap products that pushes manufacturers into using slapdash practices and that its people living and working downstream or downwind from the foreign factories who could well be paying the highest price of all
2820924 well long ago the best was 1 1 2 trichlor but that crap was banned as it causes cancer
2820925 well we used this stuff for years it got banned because of those damned treehuggers

2820985 at our recent house show in georgia i did indeed dislocate my right shoulder after taking shelton benjamins finisher
2820986 i basically landed with my arm stretched across my body my body weight his body weight and the force that he applied in delivering the maneuver caused my shoulder to pop right out of the socket
2820987 im going to tell you right now it was honestly the most painful thing that i have ever endured in my life up to this point aside from watching a great khali promo i was able to get some relief in the locker room after being held down by two people while a doctor pulled twisted and popped it back into place the pain immediately went from a 10 to 1 and i was so relieved that i actually started laughing
2820988 i have a torn labrum which basically is a muscle in the shoulder joint that holds everything in place
2820989 i also have some damage in the rotator cuff muscles but its from the accumulative effects of being in the ring for ten years
2820990 we had to let two people go from your department today which means youll be taking on their workload

2820996 wwe and hall of famer ric flair have mutually agreed to contractually part ways
2820997 wwe and i parted on the best of terms this gives me the chance to pursue new opportunities corporate speaking engagements product sponsorships autograph shows for my loyal fans who made me what i am today and film and television roles my agent and i are very excited about what the future holds
2820998 i just cant leave the money on the table anymore
2820999 im 59 years old and ive never stood on own two feet without wrestling i need to find out if i can vince cant prop me up forever
2821000 everythings worked out great its awesome the offers ive gotten have been amazing my phone wont stop ringing
2821001 after handling his bookings for the past year and learning the wrestling industry im beginning to think the gillespie agency has a unique perspective
2821002 here we are a bunch of women booking the greatest most popular wrestler of all time we handle the multitude of tasks negotiate deals research the quality of the offer time out the appearances juggle his calendar we organize prioritize and make it all work organizing is just something most women are born with the ability to do after all we know that women rule the households right
2821003 ric respects our hard work and appreciates all the late nights we spend trying to keep opportunities rolling in
2821004 on the flip side we work so hard because we are in awe of his amazing ability to relate to everyone he has an incredible fan base and it would be easy to take that for granted but who knows the teenager who sends fan mail to ric now might be the marketing executive who hires him for his staffs motivational session 10 years from now
2821005 i want everybody in the world to know that i love and respect the wwe theyve helped me through so much of my life and have made me a better person they recognized me and my family at wrestlemania and have propped me up and helped me as long as they can
2821006 we are also very grateful for the time we had working closely with the wwe
2821007 the training that they provided us over the past year has given us insight into how the industry works and allows us to hit the ground running now
2821008 when i last spoke to ric in person we were in charlotte for smackdown and i spent several hours with naitch that lasted well into the middle of the evening early morning he had several family members with him and ric seemed really to be having fun rics schedule with the wwe had been somewhat ambitious in rics view as ric was one the road as much or more than he had been with his wrestling schedule in his later career nonetheless ric said he was having a great time as a goodwill ambassador for the wwe when we spoke
2821009 since the memorable hall of fame wrestlemania retirement weekend that really sent ric off in style flairs popularity is arguably at an all time high there is no doubt that ric can stay very busy over the next several months and earn significant money in the process
2821010 on a personal level and after knowing ric for parts of three decades i would submit that ric needs business structure in his life and hopefully his management team can provide that all important element it would be like my pals zz top handling all phases of their business including the financial end tax planning travel scheduling etc and still be expected to be on and perform as is expected of them secondly i hope that ric doesnt succumb to a big money offer to actually wrestle anyone who would pitch that idea doesnt have rics best interests at heart
2821011 i started this agency with nothing 25 years ago and the business has had ups and downs financially through the years but we always survived and i think thats because of a sound foundation of ethical business practices we arent in this to exploit ric we are here for the long haul and our goal is to carry ric from famous wrestler to famous celebrity
2821012 in may i wrote in my blog finally about how happy i was for ric that he could retire on a grand stage like wrestlemania with the love support and respect from the people around him
2821013 if ric asked for his release from wwe in order to pursue a career as a public corporate speaker i wish him the best ric is great in front of a crowd and if charm and charisma were publicly traded commodities on the new york stock exchange ric would be a walking fortune 500 company
2821014 but if ric is being driven by his sense of self and is contemplating a return to the ring as a result i fear that the special moment that was rics retirement and in many respects his legacy will be diluted forever in the process
2821015 ric sees that there is an immediate opportunity to brand himself to not only the wrestling community in a variety of ways but perhaps also to the corporate world as a spokesman the opportunities are apparently abundant at least for the time being for ric to use his reinvigorated name identity to his advantage and accumulate potentially a significant amount of money by essentially using the striking while the iron is hot theory
2821016 period end of story that also means not even as a tag team partner to his son reid who apparently has aspirations on becoming a pro wrestler i would rather see the young reid get an education before embarking on a challenging career in the wrestling business but thats just my story and will continue to stick with it
2821017 ric loves the social scene in any form and loves being the nature boy as much as any wrestler i have ever known has loved living their perceived tv persona
2821018 i have never been sure where the nature boy persona ends and richard fliehr begins and ive known ric for 25 years and have enjoyed every moment of it even though some all nighters with the naitch might have taken a year or two off my life or at least my liver lets hope not
2821019 rics approach to life is just like his approach to wrestling this guy goes all out
2821020 hes a 24 7 force of positive energy to be reckoned with
2821021 freddie prinze jr s passion energy and creativity make him an excellent fit for wwe
2821022 a behind the scenes role contributing to wwes weekly television and pay per view programs
2821023 i think hes probably just as qualified as everybody else up there that knows nothing about the art form of the business
2821024 i cant say much until after my contract expires which is sept 1 but at this point there is a good chance through mutual agreement that i will not be renewing the contract creatively the announcing job wasnt working out too well
2821025 the following is for entertainment purposes only the author thats me neither endorses nor encourages any actuall threats or acts of violence against anyperson or their property at anytime or for any purpose this is just me excersising my 1st amandment rights in expressing my displeasure with a certain punkassbitchpussyboy

2821038 we came to the olympics with high hopes and expectations
2821039 i believe we were able to achieve this medal because of the people around us who helped us
2821040 i definitely have to say it is an honor to be the lead

2821043 the pullbacks come as the marketers grapple with rising commodity costs big price increases rising private label sales and consumers whove been spending less unilever executives last week described the u s market as essentially flat a study by pricewaterhousecoopers for the grocery manufacturers of america showed the percentage of package goods players whose north american sales were shrinking as a share of their total rose to 41 in the fourth quarter from only 6 in the first quarter of last year

2821048 we are ready to enter into dialogue with the dutch politicians especially with geert wilders to explain to them the understandings of islam and the koran regarding violence
2821049 following threats to our staff of a very serious nature and some ill informed reports from certain corners of the british media that could directly lead to the harm of some of our staff liveleak com has been left with no other choice but to remove fitna from our servers this is a sad day for freedom of speech on the net but we have to place the safety and well being of our staff above all else we would like to thank the thousands of people from all backgrounds and religions who gave us their support they realised liveleak com is a vehicle for many opinions and not just for the support of one perhaps there is still hope that this situation may produce a discussion that could benefit and educate all of us as to how we can accept one anothers culture we stood for what we believe in the ability to be heard but in the end the price was too high
2821050 i believe we have been too tolerant of the intolerant we should learn to become intolerant of the intolerant
2821051 this film equates islam with violence and we reject this interpretation
2821052 the vast majority of muslims reject extremism and violence in fact the victims are often also muslims
2821053 the government is heartened by the initial restrained reactions of dutch muslim organizations
2821054 the dutch government stands for a society in which freedom and respect go hand in hand let us solve problems by working together
2821055 there is no justification for hate speech or incitement to violence the right of free expression is not at stake here
2821056 i acknowledge the efforts of the dutch government to stop the broadcast of this film and appeal for calm to those understandably offended by it freedom must always be accompanied by social responsibility
2821057 it is islamic violence which threatens holland and all of europe
2821058 as the intention of this conspiracy is to defame the holy quran ahmadiyya delegation clearly explained to the ambassador that any one who do such acts should fear for the punishment of god who guarantees for the protection of this holy scripture who is the one revealed this holy book to his holy prophet
2821059 hit your children women are deficient throw homosexuals off the mountains marry a pre pubescent child as did mohammed dismantle british democracy take over the country
2821060 well it is part of his own country and nothing to worry about
2821061 to say that religious hatred and violence is limited to islam is so completely untrue as to be rediculous
2821062 dont you think your video will simply be fanning the flames
2821063 however im not sure that propaganda of this type and lets not forget that it is propoganda the juxtaposition of koran text and the images could equally be used by jihadists to justify their atrocities is the best way of tackling this problem
2821064 well it is part of his own country and nothing to worry about
2821065 its when we turn to mr wilders that the differences creep in im sorry but i dont think he is just telling it as it is hes doing it in such a graphic black and white way as is the hallmark of propaganda that the end result is to arouse hatred against the perpetrators of these wicked deeds the jihadists do the same thing when they use pictures of children killed in an american airstrike to arouse hatred against the west fair enough you might respond surely these terrorists and fundamentalists deserve such hatred yes they do but human nature being what it is that kind of hatred inevitably spills over to encompass muslims as a whole who then become the scapegoats for every social ill as a jew i am particularly sensitive to the scapegoating process
2821066 these people hide behind a genuine religious belief to hide their political ideology
2821067 does a moderate muslim cringe in the same way when he or she hears rants against the infidel the jews or the west coming from their community religious or academic leaders
2821068 too many people are saying nice things about you why do you hand out sweets or something and where are all the flamers

2821071 we want to see a bill of rights that would set the bar for the universal standards to which everyone is entitled and fills the gaps in the protection of more vulnerable people such as the elderly children or people with learning disabilities
2821072 it should not be some sort of charter for correct behaviour that would see rights as a reward for fulfilling social responsibilities rather it should be aspirational setting out a shared vision for the future of our society

2821332 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2821333 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2821334 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems

2821336 we at abc were working on this story and if we had had any proof and any verifiable facts we certainly would have gone with the story

2821341 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us

2821344 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2821345 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2821346 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2821347 well these kinds of hypotheticals are very difficult hindsight is 20 20
2821348 but i think that what i am absolutely convinced of is at that time we had to change the political debate because the view of the bush administration was one that i just disagreed with and one that i continue to disagree which is to look narrowly at iraq and not focus on these broader issues

2821417 the number one issue in the errors that occur is bad communication
2821418 the scissors didnt cut to his liking he was trying to cut suture material he said they were dull he tossed them across the room one of the nurses had to dodge the scissors
2821419 these incidents happen because the or environment is so high stress

2821430 airlines everywhere are struggling with the current price of oil but the solution to their problems should not lie in an anti competitive agreement which will inevitably lead to less competition and higher fares
2821431 ba and aa will argue that their alliance is now acceptable because the competitive environment has changed with the open skies accord on uk us routes this is a complete red herring open skies which is only a temporary accord as it may be unwound in 2010 has not significantly increased competition on uk london us routes
2821432 neither is the current economic slowdown a justification for waiving through any application the job of the regulators is to assess the long term impact of the alliance on competition not to provide special protection from the immediate challenges of the economic cycle with which every other airline has to deal with
2821433 ba aa would have a combination of high frequencies and a transatlantic network that could not be replicated by any other airline alliance and which would make it impossible for other carriers to compete for time sensitive corporate or business travelers
2821434 we now have a similar situation at new york airports with government imposed restrictions the heathrow new york jfk route is by far the most important transatlantic market accounting for over 25 of the total heathrow us market

2821460 i was doing blood draws in arizona at the time

2821471 absolutely theres a lot of truth to what the president said and in terms of wall street there was too much leverage in the system and more leverage than was appropriate and more than people recognized because the leverage came into the system in the form of highly complex structured products which were difficult to understand

2821551 minority women were also less likely to know about relative survival rates even when researchers considered factors such as the surgeons experience the type of hospital and whether patients reported talking to their surgeon about treatment options
2821552 these factors traditionally associated with quality care were not associated with informed decision making or with our knowledge measures surgeon volume or treatment setting did not affect whether women had good knowledge of their treatment options after they had been through the process nor did it really mediate the racial and ethnic differences we found
2821553 worldwide the rate of hiv infection is rising faster among women than men and the link between aids rates and violence against women is becoming even clearer said health advocates and officials gathered here this week for the xvii international aids conference
2821554 the u n general assembly is set to vote in september on the creation of a unified womens agency to streamline its fragmented approach to womens issues and programs many activists say the new agency would strengthen the world bodys response to issues affecting women including violence and aids
2821555 criminalization is a poor tool for regulating h i v infection and transmission
2821556 there is no public health rationale for invoking criminal law sanctions against those who unintentionally transmit h i v or expose others to it
2821557 se ha visto un sentimiento del pueblo boliviano hacia la democracia y un sentimiento de profundizar este proceso de cambio

2821566 anonymous quotes should be used sparingly this one wasnt worth it if you werent there be careful about judging the context
2821567 n either post national political reporter jonathan weisman nor milbank called the source
2821568 house democratic aides got up thursday morning and decided that the quotes looked bad while not challenging the quotations themselves they said that the quotes were out of context this is interesting because our source who was among the people complaining about the quotes yesterday sent us the quotes in writing in an email wednesday night evidently no recording was made so well probably never know the exact wording
2821569 my colleague jonathan weisman and i believe the quote was correct as written and that this supposed context is a recreation after the fact by democratic aides who were worried about how the quote looked perhaps obama didnt mean for it to come out that way but theres every reason to believe it did
2821570 house leadership aides pushed back against interpretations of this comment as self aggrandizing saying that when the presumptive democratic nominee said i have become a symbol of the possibility of america he was actually trying to deflect attention from himself
2821571 i cant say whether the first rendition was more accurate than the second i can say those providing the second rendition had good reason to supply context that would nullify the first i can also say i trust the suppliers of both renditions
2821572 an understanding going back years that he is giving me privileged information from closed meetings it is by definition on background with someone you interact with constantly there just arent the formalities of sourcing on every conversation and e mail
2821573 unimpeachable when he gives you a quote you can take it to the bank you dont need to go around verifying it with others

2821600 a gente tem de inverter a rela o n o apesar de suas cren as religiosas e m sticas que o newton consegue dar o pulo do gato nos trabalhos sobre a gravidade justamente devido a elas
2821601 os pr prios estudos b blicos de newton j denotam uma sensibilidade mais cr tica e moderna uma tentativa de estudar as profecias de forma quase matem tica usando cronologias detalhadas
2821602 a gente costuma deixar ci ncia e religi o bem separadas mas o fato que os manuscritos de newton que chegam a 4 000 p ginas abordam principalmente esses estudos m sticos e esot ricos
2821603 com a morte dele a universidade de cambridge e a royal society principal sociedade cient fica do reino unido da qual ele fazia parte que tinham um modelo para o que deveria ser o trabalho cient fico privilegiaram parte da obra dele e deixaram o resto vir a p blico de forma meio aleat ria

2821605 no hebraico b blico existe a palavra makom que significa lugar mas com a evolu o do pensamento rabin co ela passa a designar a pr pria divindade o newton cita essa palavra em seus escritos e parece ter usado o conceito para explicar como a gravidade atuava dist ncia como a gravidade do sol pode atrair a terra por exemplo como se entre o sol e a terra houvesse um makom que deus o qual est em todos os lugares

2821629 this is a parish that does exactly what the holy father tells us to do celebrating the mass reverently in the old and new forms the bishop is determined to squash it and to destroy me because he doesnt want me moving to another parish and doing the same thing
2821630 the bishop believes your ministry to be divisive is uncertain that ordinary pastoral care of parishioners is taking place and does not have confidence that you will celebrate the ordinary form of the mass with a generous heart for the vast majority of parishioners who expect sunday and weekday masses to be in english and at an altar facing the people

2821675 the goal is to have fun and force back the enemy as best you can
2821676 it is a water fight there was a food and water fight between two districts of berlin last year but we have limited the weapons to water water does not make such a mess
2821677 people should be able to spray water on each other if it is done in a playful manner but if it gets out of hand and they use things other than water pistols then we will naturally put a stop to it
2821678 i wasnt able to see the warning signs my mum did she said he didnt seem like a good kid and i shouldnt be around him as he would bring me down i didnt listen to her i thought like any teenager that she just didnt want me to have a boyfriend

2821684 sending someone to prison is partly about public security and partly about punishment people are coming to understand that child prisoners should have a chance to prove they no longer pose a risk and on punishment then surely having a person spend more of their life in a prison cell than they had lived as children on the outside has to be sufficient even for the most unforgiving of people

2821688 if you ask most people to describe who lives in their neighborhood its not leave it to beaver

2821690 for our town this has been a more recent phenomenon than for other towns
2821691 i just want them to bring in a family of people we can get used to instead of different faces every week
2821692 were just trying to enhance the public health and safety and maintain the integrity of our zoning laws
2821693 the more people you have in a dwelling the more potential there is for problems in case of an emergency
2821694 i dont know what the answer is to combat the problem
2821695 just try to keep the pressure on landlords fines are the only recourse we really have
2821696 its been an issue for 10 to 15 years maybe even longer
2821697 but it used to be a very isolated type of situation now its becoming more and more frequent
2821698 people who own these types of homes see the potential to make a quick buck they rent these houses out charge a per room rate and wind up recovering income far in excess of what their mortgage payments are
2821699 we look for certain items such as keyed locked doors mattresses or personal belongings that let you know something isnt being used as just a typical basement

2821701 as the economy falters its harder to make ends meet so people decide to rent a room
2821702 its a change of use from the building code point of view
2821703 theyve vacated their certificate of occupancy so we tell the people to leave and declare the building unsafe
2821704 there were 20 people living in one house and about 15 in the other

2821707 but i do feel sympathetic to the people who are working 90 hours a week to make that 250
2821708 it happens and you just have to be proactive or youre going to have a tragedy on your hands
2821709 i look at it like i have a moral obligation to protect these people
2821710 ever since the fire there have been concerned citizens calling in
2821711 were chipping away at it but its an everyday event
2821712 it gets us into the house to make sure its code compliant and has exits
2821713 its a lot of investigative work that housing inspectors have to do before they get in front of a judge
2821714 people use aliases or say someone is a cousin or brother visiting from another country and theyre only staying temporarily you name it we get it
2821715 the decision to go after someone will inevitably raise questions of race and ethnicity
2821716 why are you going after these hispanics or these koreans
2821717 people wouldnt be doubling up if there werent an affordability problem
2821718 if you ask most people to describe who lives in their neighborhood its not leave it to beaver

2821731 a sales tax free weekend will be welcomed more than ever in this tough economy especially with the high prices of food and fuel
2821732 it is certainly worth it when you consider the positive impact on retail sales and consumer confidence

2821734 there are a lot of families out there struggling to make ends meet and theyre having to stretch their dollars
2821735 while the 5 percent or so savings doesnt sound like a lot that could be a make or break

2821830 is it wrong that i piss people off for fun
2821831 fuck the mom i dont give a shit about the mom and her so called
2821832 keep ur opinion to yourself if i was pro choice i wouldnt be pushing my beliefs on you
2821833 i think you sir are an idiot women have a right to chose what they do with their bodies raped women do not need a living reminder that their life was ruined because some asshole forced himself on them therapy can only fix so much and its not even promised to work women are people and have rights over what grows inside of them because its not even a living creature until near the second trimester until then its a flesh bulbous parasitic life form clinging to its host to survive
2821834 stfu i wouldnt care what you would say if you were pro choice anyway some people think women should have a choice to kill a baby i dont have a choice to kill anyone and theres no difference between the two
2821835 youre not hearing me whore its not the womans body its the childs and dont give me that its not living bullshit it doesnt matter if its alive yet or not its killing the baby and you fucking know it
2821836 bullshit and dont you ever call me a whore again its not killing a baby the damn thing isnt even a baby until its fucking born until then it goes from zygote to embryo to fetus and at zygote and early embryo state its a fucking parasitic egg cell and for your information it is a womans choice its not your body its not even the fertilized cells body its the womans body by the way its not killing a baby to me its parasitic extermination
2821837 wow lady you have no heart i think you where a failed abortion and if the mom doesnt want the kid give it to the dad if the dad dont want it give it up for adoption but seriously what did the baby do to you it has a right to live
2821838 i agree abortion is murder even if you were raped so its a child even at the first stage gosh it is true that women have rights and they have a choise what grows inside them but it isnt right my uncle offered my aunt an abortion for free at the age of 17 and she said no i want this child and now me and her kid are cousins and we are good friends so abortion is murder it could be the next great american in ther or something a fricken president or something
2821839 if it aint killing to you you need to be locked up in an institution for the criminally insane and yes you are a whore because only a murdering whore would do something as sick as have an abortion what would you feel like if you were aborted knowing that your mother didnt think you were good enough to live and thanks for the unneccesary lesson in gestation it doesnt matter how far along the mother is it is still killing the baby and you are a sick fuck to say that an unborn child is a parasite
2821840 personaly i wouldnt have an abortion but i think its alittle bitchy for you to be saying things like that when your a dude its like me sayin everytime you jack off you kill a baby you know what that sperm could have been a kid just like an egg and until you can have a kid shut the fuck up and stop being an ass and trying to tell us what to do
2821841 i have a heart and as for me being a failed abortion actually im the product of a boozer abusive born again christian mother who forgot to take her birth control pills if you must know as for what i said it still stands its not a baby until its born its no even alive technically until later embryo and fetus stages as for the dad thing if he wants the child than compromise but its coming out of her body and she has to give birth to it i dont know if you know this but heaving a child and going through child birth physically and genetically alters a womans body greatly even though the father takes it the impact is still left on the woman
2821842 can you see the face still think abortion at the embryo phase is ok
2821843 if you think abortions are okay ask yourself this simple question what would jesus do do you honestly think he or god would be okay with abortions
2821844 i dont believe in god and regarding the picture i see a face but i also see a face on the animals i eat for dinner having a face has nothing to do with being alive thats only part of the complex scheme of life
2821845 sesection and guys wouldnt jack off if they had a girl to fuck they wouldnt jack off
2821846 so are you telling me that since i was raped by my cousins husband and i just found out i was pregnant yesterday and i want to get an abortion because i am only 15 that i am wrong and a whore i dont like abortions either but what am i supposed to do i cant put the baby up for adoption because than ill go insane waiting for the day when he or she decides to come look for its mother and father there will only be a mom who will have to tell there child i was raped i cant tell you who your father is so your telling me since i dont want to be reminded everyday that i was raped they i should keep it i cant without my life being ruined i cant i am only 15 this is the only choice i have abortion is the only thing i can do
2821847 cesarean section still fucks up a womans body on a hormonal level as for guys jacking off its not my problem if they cant get a girl
2821848 animals and people are not the same no matter what scientists say scientists are only smart because other people say they are and agree with whatever the fuck a scientist says as for you not believing in god and being raised by an abusive mother that explains why youre fucked up do you have any idea how bleak your perseption of things are you are a miserable pissed off person anyone can tell that from what youve posted thus far and you simply gotta have faith in god to straighten up your life i used to be an atheist till i found my faith and i truly am healed
2821849 to the girl that was raped you have my sympathy you really do but that child didnt do anything wrong you can give it up for adoption you can leave it at a hospital anonymously but dont kill it if you havent already you need to report the rape then you need to get help and support from your friends and family and you need therapy as for when the child comes looking for you you need to pray to god for strength and the answers that you seek like that one guy said that child could be the one to cure aids or something
2821850 i think it should be our own choice if you dont wanna do it then dont okay we should all be able to make our own decisions
2821851 it is our choice plus the doctors have a cut off point for abortionsbefore its a real human so its not murder u wouldnt know shit its not like its easy for women to get an abortion but sometimes they have to they may not be ready they wont be a ble to look after the kid and then it will be taken away and will most likely be tramatized and if its a rape child the mother could possibly hate it and the child would grow up knowing that how is that good for the children u can say all this so easily because u will never be in this position
2821852 wow i agree with the guys abortion is wrong no matter what the choice if you dont believe in god theres nothing we can do but to the guy im sorry to say this but youre not supposed to judge people no matter what their religion race or beliefs basically treat everyone as the same person if you want to hear my opinion add me or im me xxflirtyxlexixx i agree completely with you if abortion is so right then killing a newborn baby should be too its still a fucking living human not a parasite
2821853 then give it up for adoption didnt you read what i posted earlier look if you aint ready to have a child you aint ready to have sex youre only ready after marriage and if youre raped i dont see how killing a baby is going to make you feel any better about getting raped im pretty sure you would only feel worse with the guilt of murder
2821854 you know why they only let you get an abortion at the beginning of the pregnancy because its not alive yet it is not a human those are the fucking facts not opinions
2821855 stfu cunt people like you piss me off you dont even count as a person our country may allow atheists but we are still one nation under god just because you had a fucked up childhood or whaver your problem is is no excuse to be the bitter hateful blaspheming piece of shit that you are you cant possibly support killing a baby without being lower than dog shit on someones shoe wether its legally alive or not you know that its killing the baby you whore wtf is the matter with you did your mom not hug you enough did kids make fun of you have you never had a single friend in your life you have got to be a complete psycho to support the murder of children fuck you
2821856 shut the fuck up you catholic bastard so your saying that when a 12 year old girl get knocked up she needs to throw away her diploma b4 she even gets it abortions are the write thing to do if you have aids and get pregnant the kid gets aids and will die so then they suffer and std you get the kid will get when its in the womb homeless people have kids and they are brought up just like their parents abortions are the womans choice not some fucking churches god is fake get a life nd besides if you agree with this person you should be locked in an institituion because you were brainwashed by church
2821857 im not the one thats brainwashed you motherfucker i used to be an atheist until i found god youre the one thats brainwashed by people with fucked up lives people become atheists because they have no faith in god when you face your judgement youre going to whine your ass off before god begging him to spare your worthless faithless ass you can save yourself by having faith but if not youre going to remember all the times you blew off people trying to help you save yourself and realize what a dumbass you are now again save yourself or burn in hell its your choice douche always has been
2821858 definataly my friends say they would definataly have an abortion if they got pregnant but seriously if you got pregnant and were raped then thats your fault and your decision but having an abortion thats stupid cuss it was your fault in the first place i told my friends there really stupid for that and im sure if i got pregnant i would want to cuss i would be so scared but i would never do it you should add me tho d
2821859 i hope everyone who doesnt have time for god now isnt surprised when theyre in line on judgement day and god doesnt have time to save you from hell or for those of you who say we are brainwashed my mom is full on atheist her passwords any where she can put the words say anitchrist or something i didnt grow up in a big christian enviroment i grew up with my mom who btw is a fucking cunt but she use to be a big christian all i did was start readin the bible one day then i started going to church i got to church maybe once every two months im not brainwashed i just know their is a god who created your ass and i cant believe how ungrateful people are if abortion is so right your moms shoulda aborted u thick headed jerks
2821860 i think you all just failed to realize that insulting someone only demeans and belittles any type of argument

2821867 even if the pipe is out of action for a week or two weeks its very unlikely that this would have much effect on global oil supplies
2821868 the task of the russian forces at present is to ensure control of south ossetia the pipelines would be in danger only if the war escalated
2821869 if russia started an economic blockade then it might target the pipelines
2821870 attempts to take control of that pipeline would be extreme

2821883 felt good some at bats a little tardy on other ones
2821884 hopefully its going to be best for him because he was having a problem with range of motion of his shoulder
2821885 hes playing and not really being himself as far as swinging the bat maybe this will give him a chance to get some more range of motion and maybe get the old scotty back here
2821886 the rehab is pretty intense digging pretty deep into the shoulder and the capsule trying to loosen up some tissue
2821887 when doing that and trying to play and swing a baseball bat at the same time were kind of counteracting what were doing if we give it time to cool down a little bit and get in there and dig and get after that without having to swing the bat and undo it thats hopefully going to help it recover a little better
2821888 im just going to try and take it easy on him for a while so we dont lose him again
2821889 i wont be stealing any bases but aside from that ill be all right
2821890 maybe it will change here or there but thats where i want him to hit

2821957 4 august 2008 an extract from his harvard address in june 2008
2821958 it was granted me to carry away from my prison years on my bent back which nearly broke beneath its load this essential experience how a human being becomes evil and how good in the intoxication of youthful successes i had felt myself to be infallible and i was therefore cruel in the surfeit of power i was a murderer and an oppressor in my most evil moments i was convinced that i was doing good and i was well supplied with systematic arguments and it was only when i lay there on rotting prison straw that i sensed within myself the first stirrings of good gradually it was disclosed to me that the line separating good and evil passes not through states nor between classes nor between political parties either but right through every human heart and through all human hearts this line shifts inside us it oscillates with the years and even within hearts overwhelmed by evil one small bridgehead of good is retained and even in the best of all hearts there remains an uprooted small corner of evil since then i have come to understand the truth of all the religions of the world they struggle with the evil inside a human being inside every human being it is impossible to expel evil from the world in its entirety but it is possible to constrict it within each person and since that time i have come to understand the falsehood of all the revolutions in history they destroy only those carriers of evil contemporary with them and also fail out of haste to discriminate the carriers of good as well and they then take to themselves as their heritage the actual evil itself magnified still more
2821959 the line separating good and evil is drawn through the human heart
2821960 attempting to destroy the government of the republic of turkey
2821961 inciting others to stage the 2006 council of state shooting and a hand grenade attack at the cumhuriyet newspapers istanbul office
2821962 the system the media the state bureaucracy and the political culture of the country all fuel a schizophrenic and paranoid mindset it is that mindset that has created ergenekon
2821963 the only role for nuclear weapons is to be abolished
2821964 i dont care if he had twenty lovers and spent his life carousing but he did one thing right under him shanghai pulled itself forward and he was the only one to think about how to cover pensions in your country you can retire and know youve got something weve got nothing here he knew the only way to make any money was to put all the citys funds into property he was right its shot up in value but of course the central government hate this sort of independence i say if we ever get a half decent pension when we grow old itll be down to chen not those apes in beijing
2821965 as far as i know its all still there he hardly needs it now he never touched a penny of it
2821966 the conflict over power in iraq from a military to a political struggle
2821967 weekly standard 28 july 2008 the military knot in addition to his weekly opendemocracy column paul rogers writes an international security monthly briefing for the oxford research group for details click the pattern of incidents in the first half of 2008 suggested that the violence across most of iraq was indeed abating raising hopes of a definite turning of the page towards peace and security iraqi army units were also taking a larger role in operations albeit they were still dependent on us air power logistics and combat support this makes the sudden and unexpected escalation of violence represented by the bombings and subsequent violence in baghdad and kirkuk on 27 july 2008 all the more shattering shia pilgrims and kurdish protestors respectively killed at least fifty five people and wounded about 240 they were almost certainly perpetrated by sunni militants and seem designed as was the bombing of the al askari mosque in samarra in february 2006 which opened the most ferociously sectarian phase of the war to incite a vigorous counter reaction from iraqs burning season
2821968 25 october 2007 two recent developments confirm this the us armys proposal to build new power plants costing 184 million at five main bases in iraq and the us air force training programme for long term support of us troops on the ground

2821970 its a big event skateboarders of all ages and levels come to compete
2821971 you wouldnt believe all of the types of tricks you can see at a competition like this one
2821972 we created this competition to bring together members of the community while also doing it for a good cause
2821973 the money will go toward the charities and next years competition
2821974 part of my routine included grinding the quarter pipe and doing a back 180
2821975 i love skateboarding in front of big crowds of people
2821976 during competitions i just want to do the biggest and best tricks im able to do within the time period thats allowed
2821977 the competition was a great way for skateboarders to get out there and show off their tricks and abilities
2821978 we cant wait to see how many people show up for next years event
2821979 from the time he was 3 he started to fish with my grandfather at this lake
2821980 within hours after we got the news we knew we wanted to do something
2821981 its just a fun thing to get the kids outside its all catch and release
2821982 he was the best man at my wedding he was the person that kept the peace but we always had a good time he would have given the shirt off his back for any one of his guys
2821983 he loved kids he used to brag about my kids like they were his own
2821984 fishing hunting he was just a great kid all around
2821985 but the education no one can ever take that away from you
2821986 if i wasnt doing the right things in the classroom then i wouldnt be able to compete
2821987 when i ran the races and beat the other kids i thought ooh i like this
2821988 reading and learning and education has not stopped for me since kindergarten
2821989 if youre passionate about something and you love to do it share it with others
2821990 it is going to be a festive setting for athletic events
2821991 this belongs to the community and we want to make sure they can touch and feel all of it
2821992 were just getting started on the actual field work taking pictures and taking notes of information supplied on the grave sites but there was a lot of preplanning involved and lot of paperwork to go through
2821993 its been a year in the works as there were many documents and records on the families to go through
2821994 thats a lot more than most people would have thought
2821995 brock is a great kid and this is going to be a great service to the people of the community especially those interested in family histories and lineage
2821996 those helicopters all had air or first class mail on them so it had to be delivered faster than what the trains could do
2821997 that was your most expensive mail and people paid extra for it
2821998 that helicopter had other drops other than in wheeler park but im not positive about that
2821999 my memory is not one of my stronger things these days
2822000 you strapped a bag on your shoulder and you took off
2822001 near the tail end of my time there you could drive your car to certain spots deliver the mail and then go back to your car
2822002 we keep on bumping into it when we talk about development in certain corners of town or in the comprehensive plan or when something is proposed
2822003 there might be a perception that is different from reality
2822004 people want to see the same thing across from their house
2822005 whats the use of 300 a month housing if you cant afford 4 a gallon gas to get to work
2822006 and you are going to have to dump 100 000 into it
2822007 a lot of this will be about rental for some people their money would be better spent raising their families than paying a mortgage but that concept is foreign to us
2822008 this walk means that dads efforts and his vision are being recognized and that means everything
2822009 he chaired the riverfront committee and he was the energy behind multiyear projects
2822010 he asked me to go to a kiwanis meeting with him i felt that anyone he was involved with had to be ok he was such a great guy
2822011 the whole idea is to mix it together like gumbo in a pot and see what happens
2822012 its unique its a way to see elgin in a different light
2822013 were hoping for a positive response people have to be down here to make it a reality
2822014 its a wonderful idea ive been in a lot of businesses in downtown elgin theres a great variety
2822015 each of us have our own style and performances you can actually pack a lot into 10 minutes of theater we really think elgin has the best of the urban like chicago and suburban environment its a hidden gem
2822016 its got such dedicated fans it has to be a wonderful trail
2822017 we didnt buy our house because of the prairie path but we have come to know what a joy it was to have it nearby
2822018 we have seen all sorts of activities on the prairie path it gets a lot of use all of it positive
2822019 its been very rewarding to see how important the prairie path has become because trails werent really a big deal when we got started
2822020 but nowadays its extremely important in this age of air pollution and congestion and getting people around
2822021 just the other day i was riding and i had to stop because a fawn was nursing in the middle of the trail where else are you going to see that and if i run out of water or an energy bar ill ride through a town a few miles later its just great
2822022 may watts spoke at my garden club shortly after the letter was published and she was getting a little famous from it
2822023 we consider the publication of the letter the birth of the prairie path thats when everyone started working on it anyway
2822024 word on the prairie path maybe thats how they find us
2822025 we dont have really big signs so id say the prairie path helps a lot
2822026 thats one of the long term visions if you will of the forest preserve to provide the linkage to the forest preserves and connectivity to the communities as well
2822027 right now you can go from a forest preserve in elmhurst to one in warrenville without ever going on roads and the prairie path serves as that link
2822028 they couldnt take it away now its too big a part of the city its that way for a lot of people
2822029 sweetened dried cranberries roasted cashews and creamy caramel drenched in milk chocolate and garnished with a cranberry
2822030 just everywhere out here laid out on the ground they are bloody
2822031 we thought it would be better for him to get on the bus because its a far drive
2822032 now he keeps saying that he should have driven himself
2822033 russia has show itself capable of crossing every line in this conflict
2822034 we are willing to do cease fire immediately providing the other side stops to shoot and to bomb
2822035 only if georgia withdraws all armed forces from the conflict zone and immediately signs a non aggression pact with south ossetia
2822036 these are people who dont know how to do what they need to do and are not getting the message
2822037 what were hoping is their friends or family or caregiver or a neighbor does have access and is checking it for them
2822038 the irs also set up an 800 number to walk people through the process
2822039 the doom and gloom stories are getting old for everybody
2822040 which is kind of contrary to what you hear in the marketplace
2822041 we are centrally located in the county and we have very high traffic volumes and shopper volumes
2822042 with the demographics we have it works well for them to locate in our community
2822043 i couldnt go anywhere and get what i wanted to eat
2822044 when the chain can also layer in excitement through new or limited time offerings they help create an environment where consumers want to come back
2822045 need to bring new strategies and tactics to the table
2822046 theyre making room for new concepts and people want new concepts
2822047 when we started this whole journey the economy wasnt where it is now
2822048 we want it to be a healthy alternative some place wed like to go
2822049 our party is proud that we have put 18 million cracks in the highest glass ceiling
2822050 from milk toast internationalist to brave mccain like warrior in under 24 hours
2822051 the desire to rule is the mother of all heresy
2822052 do you not hear all this evidence that is brought against you
2822053 when i was naked ye clothed me when i was ill ye came to my help and when i was in prison ye visited me
2822054 that which ye do to the least of my brethren ye do also to me
2822055 outrages upon personal dignity in particular humiliating and degrading treatment
2822056 if any man therefore sets aside even the least of the laws demands and teaches others to do the same he will have the lowest place in the kingdom of heaven
2822057 when he was seated there crowds flocked to him bringing with them the lame blind dumb and crippled and many other sufferers and he healed them and they gave praise to the god of israel
2822058 they the chief priests put him in chains and led him away to hand him over to pilate the roman governor
2822059 how blest are those who show mercy mercy shall be shown to them
2822060 this is the first time ive been proud of my country

2822080 the rappers have gone in and created a lot of hit music based upon my influence
2822081 i knew nothing about the business or trends and things like that
2822082 i think it was a matter of timing i didnt know what was unfolding
2822083 a person that speaks his mind hes sensitive enough to care for children hes wise enough to not be put into the whack category like everybody else in town and he l o o o o ves the ladies
2822084 there is a place in this world for satire but there is a time when satire ends and intolerance and bigotry towards religious beliefs of others begins

2822086 pendant les vacances les ministres sont plus que jamais pri s de

2822093 de operatie is de ultieme preventieve maatregel de kanker zit tot zover in n borst maar haar doktoren willen absoluut voorkomen dat de kanker zich verspreidt naar haar andere borst christina kiest ervoor dan maar beide borsten te laten afzetten
2822094 dokters wilden ook n borst wegnemen maar konden haar dan niet beloven dat de andere borst kankervrij zou blijven in haar familie komt kanker veel voor haar moeder vocht twee keer tegen borstkanker en dus neemt christina geen enkel risico
2822095 ze wilde gewoon van die band af de tape is met cash afgerekend zonder papierwerk de naam die de man opgaf was waarschijnlijk nep hij wilde de band puur voor zijn eigen plezier kopen
2822096 de mysterieuze brunette op de foto is de vrouw van n van de bandleden wat een ophef om niets ze hebben keihard gewerkt de afgelopen tijd en nemen nu even rust niks aan de hand dus
2822097 ik ga ervoor zorgen dat de rest van de wereld n t zo blij is met de geboorte van mijn zoon
2822098 ik heb de placenta bewaard en ik ben van plan om het onder de grond te stoppen in een boomgaard
2822099 ik ben een keer bij een aboriginalstam geweest in australi alle placentas van de stam kwamen onder de placentaboom terecht de boom zag er groot gezond en sterk uit prachtig
2822100 90 en nu wil hij daar nog een vervolg aan breien
2822101 ik mag misschien hebberig klinken maar 50 jaar na je eerste hit opnieuw een hit scoren zou fantastisch zijn ik heb een goed nummer hopelijk heb ik nog genoeg fans
2822102 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
2822103 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
2822104 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
2822105 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
2822106 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
2822107 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
2822108 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
2822109 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
2822110 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
2822111 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
2822112 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
2822113 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
2822114 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
2822115 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
2822116 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
2822117 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
2822118 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
2822119 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
2822120 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
2822121 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
2822122 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
2822123 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
2822124 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
2822125 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
2822126 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
2822127 who are open to doing something on the production side
2822128 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
2822129 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
2822130 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
2822131 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
2822132 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
2822133 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
2822134 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
2822135 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
2822136 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
2822137 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
2822138 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
2822139 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
2822140 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
2822141 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
2822142 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
2822143 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
2822144 the 100 best english language novels from 1923 to the present
2822145 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
2822146 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
2822147 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
2822148 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
2822149 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
2822150 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
2822151 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
2822152 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
2822153 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
2822154 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
2822155 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
2822156 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
2822157 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
2822158 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
2822159 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
2822160 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
2822161 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
2822162 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
2822163 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
2822164 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
2822165 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
2822166 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
2822167 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
2822168 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
2822169 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
2822170 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
2822171 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
2822172 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
2822173 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
2822174 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
2822175 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
2822176 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
2822177 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
2822178 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
2822179 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
2822180 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
2822181 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
2822182 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
2822183 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
2822184 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
2822185 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
2822186 your name is ramesh prasad correct in english r stands for ramesh and p for prasad
2822187 we caused lots of disruption and weve really highlighted the folly of going ahead with this new power station
2822188 the atmosphere in the camp is very celebratory but well only claim victory once we know weve definitely scuppered e ons plans to build a new coal fired power station at kingsnorth
2822189 als we ons op die manier gedragen en in onszelf geloven dan zijn we allemaal koningen dat heeft niets te maken met arrogantie
2822190 we moeten er met zn allen voor zorgen dat honden en katten op een veilige manier seks met elkaar hebben er worden jaarlijks miljoenen dieren opgevangen in asielen maar er is niet genoeg ruimte
2822191 la timidezza mi ha aiutato a diventare fotografo ho scoperto al liceo che la macchina fotografica ti fa entrare in situazioni alle quali non appartieni veramente
2822192 la mia prima foto di un cane che venne pubblicata fu scattata nel 1946 non rammento le circostanze o quello che avevo in testa probabilmente nulla di speciale
2822193 se le mie fotografie possono aiutare qualcuno a vedere le cose in un certo modo probabilmente a guardare le cose serie con leggerezza tutto serio niente serio
2822194 la gente ha ragione a non voler farsi fotografare non piacerebbe nemmeno a me che qualcuno mi puntasse una macchina fotografica in faccia io cerco di essere veloce cos i soggetti non se ne accorgono non che mi senta in colpa o che abbia la sensazione di usare le persone contro la loro volont ma sto un po male al pensiero di contrariare qualcuno e ancor pi se vengo picchiato
2822195 ho sempre la macchina fotografica con me e queste sono le mie fotografie una sorta di diario
2822196 se le mie fotografie possono aiutare qualcuno a vedere le cose in un certo modo probabilmente a guardare le cose serie con leggerezza tutto serio niente serio

2822227 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2822228 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2822229 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2822230 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2822231 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2822232 were certainly disappointed for requan but we know that hell do everything in his power to return to the field
2822233 well now turn to clifford harris for senior leadership at running back and see who among the younger players will step forward and take advantage of this opportunity
2822234 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2822235 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2822236 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2822237 bij coveren is het een uitdaging er iets eigens van te maken
2822238 ik zie samples niet als diefstal het betekent juist dat er nog steeds behoefte is aan mijn muziek de rapjongens mogen mijn muziek gebruiken zolang ze het maar niet hebben over bitches
2822239 ik moest wel acteren omdat ik werd afgewezen door de muziekindustrie ik paste niet in de richting waarin de muziek zich ontwikkelde wij de zangers uit de jaren zeventig zoals barry white en bobby womack werden genegeerd ik besloot met muziek op te houden en te wachten tot de tijd er weer rijp voor was platenmaatschappijen richtten zich op hiphop mede omdat het zo goedkoop is om te produceren een drummachine een sampler en een synthesizer meer heb je niet nodig maar uiteindelijk cre er je een probleem want hoeveel kun je sampelen op het laatst moet je samples gaan sampelen en dat is belachelijk daarom is er nu weer behoefte aan live muziek
2822240 we waren specialisten in het uitdrukken van gevoelens in twee neenhalve minuut alles kon aanleiding zijn voor een nummer strips reclame het maakte niet uit als sam amp dave s avonds naar de studio kwamen gingen david porter en ik s middags bij elkaar zitten om wat nummers te schrijven de volgende dag was de plaat klaar
2822241 zelf ben ik een luie tekstschrijver ik zorgde hoofdzakelijk voor de muziek
2822242 maar dat wil niet zeggen dat coveren niet creatief is het is een uitdaging om er iets eigens van te maken je moet het tot je nemen uit elkaar halen en weer op een andere manier in elkaar zetten zodat het iets van jezelf wordt dat is de aantrekkelijke en moeilijke kant van covers
2822243 als ik in phoenix aankom wordt ze wakker staat ze op en vindt ze mijn briefje
2822244 het succes van hot buttered soul kwam onverwacht in het voorjaar van 1969 bracht stax volt 26 lps uit daarvan produceerde ik er een flink aantal en als beloning mocht ik een eigen plaat maken helemaal zoals ik het zelf wilde ik ging de studio in met de gedachte dat het niets uitmaakte of de plaat een commercieel succes werd of niet want er waren nog altijd die 26 andere platen ik wilde een creatieve verklaring afleggen ik wilde laten horen hoe het volgens mij moest twee neenhalve minuut waren genoeg voor sam amp dave maar niet voor mij wat ik wilde zeggen kon onmogelijk binnen drie minuten worden uitgedrukt ik wilde al zo lang werken met veel violen ik ben altijd een liefhebber van klassieke muziek geweest
2822245 ik kon soulsville weer opnieuw opnemen omdat er niets is veranderd sterker nog het is er erger geworden drugs en werkloosheid kenden we al maar nu zijn daar nog de drive by shootings bij gekomen
2822246 him hath god exalted with his right hand to be a prince and a saviour for to give repentance to israel and forgiveness of sins

2822253 prima di dire che la scelta di non avere figli sia solo una questione di egoismo bisogna guardare alle altre motivazioni
2822254 certo molti dei dink che vedo intorno a me hanno privilegiato la carriera rispetto alla vita privata ma c anche altro ad esempio il terrore di mettere al mondo bambini in un mondo peggiore un terrore che non mai stato vero come adesso
2822255 in pi abbiamo fatto un esame di coscienza e abbiamo ammesso una nostra inadeguatezza al ruolo di genitore almeno per ora perch assumersi questa responsabilit col rischio di sbagliare non c bisogno di fare figli quando uno sa di non avere il tipo di situazione domestica o lavorativa nella quale un bambino pu crescere di fronte a questa consapevolezza rinviare anche una questione di saggezza
2822256 ci sono persone come te a forma di isola ma quando si incontrano nulla le unisce come per le isole di un arcipelago non le puoi avvicinare luna allaltra e ricavarci qualcosa non sono le tessere di un mosaico non si combinano ognuna sta per conto suo
2822257 abbiamo amato nelle nostre donne anche le figlie che non abbiamo avuto
2822258 he looked poised for a young guy and mike has to be happy with his quarterback coming out and looking fairly sharp
2822259 i thought matt passed the test in terms of poise and execution
2822260 i thought for the first time in an nfl game he was very impressive
2822261 i thought it was important for me to get out there tonight and compete against a team we know is going to be very successful
2822262 i thought it was a good start i still have a long way to go and im glad that one is under my belt
2822263 thats a lot of fun to get in there against some of their starters and get some work
2822264 i settled down and did some good things and some bad things but got more comfortable as i went along
2822265 i dont have any doubt not just because i was here i know thats a good football team and i thought our guys stood in there and went toe to toe with them in the first half thats a positive
2822266 follow my example as i follow the example of christ
2822267 howbeit for this cause i obtained mercy that in me first jesus christ might shew forth all longsuffering for a pattern to them which should hereafter believe on him to life everlasting
2822268 they seem to have gone beyond the logical stopping point
2822269 there will probably be guerilla warfare all over the country
2822270 but the russians are not letting them withdraw they are pursuing them and people are seeing this
2822271 this is not about military objectives this is about a political objective removing a thorn in their side
2822272 at midnight last night we got from the russians that they would welcome a call from saakashvili
2822273 he has asked to talk with putin and he has asked to talk to medvedev

2822276 its not the size that counts its how u use it
2822277 it was a dark grey object and it was flying parallel to the ground
2822278 i dont want to get as i said last night prematurely stressed about it
2822279 but if it does happen then i will take due time to make sure that whatever decision that i come up with is what i think is the best decision for territorians and for the territory
2822280 the calcasieu has been hit or miss the last month or so and continues on this trend
2822281 these conditions will push much of the fish population to the north end of the lake
2822282 a few people did catch good fish but most came back scratching their heads wondering where the fish went
2822283 gaffers as well we also got lucky and caught a few wahoo these past few trips the wahoo have been under debris but a few guys are also catching wahoo n the deeper side of the edge typically the full moon in august can produce a great wahoo bite on the edge especially early in the morning i havent done any night swordfishing but we did a couple of daytime trips this past week the current has been going very hard which makes it hard to drop a bait to the bottom but somehow we have managed to hit bottom and hold and were rewarded with a swordfish on both trips the first trip we had some local guys that wanted to hone in on their daytime tactics the day started tough with some tackle issues but after we sorted it out we ended up catching a 150 pound swordfish our next daytime trip i had some very good clients from up north that have fished with me for years they have caught swordfish at night with me but wanted to try the daytime swording this time the current was just as strong but on our first drop we caught 74
2822284 there was massive bombing of gori all evening and now we are getting reports of an imminent attack by russian tanks

2822298 se ha visto un sentimiento del pueblo boliviano hacia la democracia y un sentimiento de profundizar este proceso de cambio

2822318 too bad i cant get on it it would sink
2822319 if the sell off is based on the premise that demand is contracting not only in the us but in europe and the developing world as well then i think theres a level of economic activity that would mean it should be higher than this
2822320 despite weak global cues last week till we closed for trading domestic markets have performed positively i think this is a sign of consolidation but in order to move ahead of the current level markets should remain in the positive side for the first few days of the next week
2822321 the most important factor responsible for the markets to perform in the positive note has been softening of crude oil prices even gold prices have fallen below 870 which was considered as support thus giving negative returns for the week
2822322 all our systems are ready the sebi will come to examine our system soon it will happen by august end or in september
2822323 hey snap out of it fuck them when was the last time one of them was right and you were wrong
2822324 a court in the hague has granted a request by former mp ayaan hirsi ali for witnesses to be heard in support of her claim that the dutch state is responsible for paying for her security in the us the netherlands stopped paying for hirsi alis bodyguards last year when she moved to the us permanently hirsi ali an outspoken critic of islam now works for a conservative us think tank the preliminary hearing which could result in a full court case in which hirsi ali challenges the dutch state to continue to pay for her security in the us is expected to be held in on two consecutive days in the autumn
2822325 a community debate over religious freedom surfaced in western pennsylvania last week when dutch feminist author ayaan hirsi ali a somali refugee who has lived under the threat of death for denouncing her muslim upbringing made an appearance at the university of pittsburgh at johnstown
2822326 she has been identified as one who has defamed the faith if you come into the faith you must abide by the laws and when you decide to defame it deliberately the sentence is death
2822327 after 200 years two centuries she still stands strong and true on the granite ridge and her glow has held steady no matter what storm and shes still a beacon still a magnet for all who must have freedom for all the pilgrims from all the lost places who are hurtling through the darkness toward home

2822330 i went on for quite some time didnt i p
2822331 now that burst v ms has moved out of the courts i thought that i might add a little to what you know about this case back about two years ago when the judge told ms to cough up the rest of the emails that was supposed to have floated around between ms execs that discussed the burst relationship the team that i was on corporate tape backups was asked to gather all together all of the tapes that were used during that time even though there was a corporate policy in place that any pst was to be excluded from backup capture the effort failed not only did the backup exec software fail to filter out those pst files but some of the involved blue badges microsoft employees intentionally disguised their mail files so that they would not be recognized and included in the nightly backups this last effort was even prohibited by policy from the vp level as i was the one tasked to gather the tapes together from arcus iron mountain i know exactly how many tapes were recalled for the involved servers they filled several 240 tape trunks and were stored in the building 11 tape vault
2822332 several months after all of the tapes were gathered ms legal started asking for restores of any pst files captured the tapes mysteriously went missing
2822333 calvin keaton the blue badge who managed the team made the appropriate loud noises about the loss to hp services although i never saw any public disclosure about it just glad i never had to depose for the issue cant imagine that it would have done my career any good

2822340 ik heb er wel over gehoord in dat programma van van
2822341 is het niet dat programma van uitgelekte lectuur op zaterdag met suzann smidshamer
2822342 of van die kleine hijgerige kabouter met die bril je weet wel die ook aan wielrennen deed en tussen dertigduizend boeken woont vul ik aan
2822343 die hebben ze toen weg geschopt bij de tros omdat ie gewoon te oud was en steeds maar over russische literatuur zat te zeuren
2822344 ja nogal logisch hij zat maar te zeuren en te hijgen en dan ging ie van die rare dingen zeggen zoals over suzan smit dat ze een gezicht als een kwekkeboom kroket had
2822345 wel een beetje veemd ik heb nog nooit een gezicht als een kwekkeboom kroket gezien wel een gezicht als een saxofoon uit een comic strip dat had die vrselijke luns

2822359 dar ber dass hier eine vern nftige regelung absolut notwendig ist sind sich arbeitgeber und arbeitnehmer der branche einig die bundeskanzlerin sollte also ihren widerstand aufgeben und hier f r klare verh ltnisse sorgen
2822360 ein signal f r die entlastung der arbeitnehmerinnen und arbeitnehmer mit kleinen und mittleren einkommen
2822361 die menschen die jeden tag hart arbeiten und unseren wohlstand erwirtschaften m ssen st rker am aufschwung teilhaben
2822362 au erdem sollte die kanzlerin die spd vorsorglich daran erinnern dass wir die senkung des beitrags zur arbeitslosenversicherung auf 3 0 prozent fest vereinbart haben
2822363 als entlastungssignal bei den energiepreisen halten wir eine absenkung der mehrwertsteuer auf den erm igten satz von sieben prozent f r geboten wenn das aus europarechtlichen gr nden nicht geht sollte die so genannte ko steuer entsprechend gesenkt werden

2822383 for whether we be beside ourselves it is to god or whether we be sober it is for your cause
2822384 now the spirit speaketh expressly that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith giving heed to seducing spirits and doctrines of devils speaking lies in hypocrisy having their conscience seared with a hot iron
2822385 he didnt come to make bad men good he came to make dead men live
2822386 to us which are saved it is the power of god
2822387 he therefore that ministereth to you the spirit and worketh miracles among you doeth he it by the works of the law or by the hearing of faith
2822388 truly the signs of an apostle were wrought among you in all patience in signs and wonders and mighty deeds
2822389 and these signs shall follow them that believe in my name shall they cast out devils they shall speak with new tongues
2822390 the 8th of june the anointing of the king of glory falls jesus said i am coming in person the king is coming in person i sense so strongly that there will be a personal divine visitation of the lamb of god the lord jesus christ at the revival tomorrow night
2822391 for tomorrow the king of glory sets fot upon the stage in divine personal one to one visitation
2822392 behold i am against them that prophesy false dreams saith the lord and do tell them and cause my people to err by their lies and by their lightness yet i sent them not nor commanded them therefore they shall not profit this people at all saith the lord
2822393 open up the heavens and let the angels come down with fire
2822394 let no man beguile you of your reward in a voluntary humility and worshipping of angels intruding into those things which he hath not seen vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind
2822395 for such are false apostles deceitful workers transforming themselves into the apostles of christ and no marvel for satan himself is transformed into an angel of light therefore it is no great thing if his ministers also be transformed as the ministers of righteousness whose end shall be according to their works
2822396 beloved believe not every spirit but try the spirits whether they are of god because many false prophets are gone out into the world
2822397 and be not drunk with wine wherein is excess but be filled with the spirit
2822398 and at midnight paul and silas prayed and sang praises unto god and the prisoners heard them
2822399 for these are not drunken as ye suppose seeing it is but the third hour of the day
2822400 over the past six years the salary gaps between legislators
2822401 it grated on my democratic ears because legislators should not be thought of principally as senior managers
2822402 we do think there are many witnesses because at that time around 7 p m there were a lot of people in the park or in the surroundings of the park
2822403 there were also people who were part of the altercation and many people playing sports or just sitting in the park
2822404 were talking about the death of a man its a major investigation
2822405 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection
2822406 we had one that we used in a sting for school zones
2822407 hopefully well have the new one by the time school starts again
2822408 sembra che alla marvel abbiano gi un regista e un protagonista
2822409 ci che j j riuscito a creare e a cui noi abbiamo preso parte stata lautentica nascita di questi personaggi non soltanto il loro percorso individuale e come si sono incontrati ma anche e soprattutto come le interrelazioni nel gruppo si sono forgiate e saldate e come tutto questo si poi trasferito nel mitico viaggio quinquennale
2822410 hanno infuso in tutti i personaggi una grande umanit pertanto non troverete in questo film solo lazione e i grandi effetti speciali che tutti si aspettano da un blockbuster ma anche parecchi elementi di un film di personaggi che una delle cose pi difficili da fare
2822411 zach grande la gente sar letteralmente rapita dalla sua interpretazione lui karl urban che interpreta mccoy n d a e il resto del cast sono riusciti a catturare lessenza dei propri personaggi
2822412 gli ho scritto una lettera prima di iniziare le riprese giusto per presentarmi e dire ciao visto che non lo conoscevo per niente lui mi ha risposto stato molto gentile e carino e questo stato lunico contatto che ho avuto con lui per mio padre durante linizio della lavorazione del film ha avuto occasione di fare affari con mr shatner per cui posso dire che il contatto stato multigenerazionale
2822413 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
2822414 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
2822415 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
2822416 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
2822417 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
2822418 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
2822419 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
2822420 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
2822421 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
2822422 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
2822423 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
2822424 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
2822425 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
2822426 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
2822427 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
2822428 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
2822429 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
2822430 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
2822431 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
2822432 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
2822433 came from a time when i had less control over my temper
2822434 the main reason people struggle financially is because they spent years in school but learned nothing about money the result is people learn to work for money but never learn to have money work for them
2822435 hey let me tell you i worked years to achieve artistic excellence
2822436 and then all of a sudden i get involved in this stupid crazy insane cartoon and now im hotter than ive ever been i love it i love it
2822437 i second that olivier d you got a sexy name too
2822438 this guy is really one of the most beautiful men ive ever seen

2822441 by asking the iraqis to take responsibility for their future and to invest in their own country
2822442 let me be clear we are well over five years into a war in a country that had nothing to do with the 9 11 attacks
2822443 our country has spent nearly a trillion dollars in iraq even as our schools are underfunded our roads and bridges are crumbling and the cost of everything from groceries to a gallon of gas is soaring
2822444 rip mean place stupid mcdonalds buying them out i think

2822447 the classic nfs games were awesome you drive a log an outhouse or a freakin t rex by using cheats in nfs2 d
2822448 the old nfs games were awesome i dont care about customising cheap crappy cars into boyracer cars i want to drive my mclaren f1 down a winding road at 300kph i think the last of the good nfs games was highstakes i think the new nfs looks pretty stink i have played other racing games that have tried to fit a story into it they were not too hot
2822449 have to agree with you woz in regards to the original nfs awesome game
2822450 hell i watched their program back in the day it was sooo bad yet the chicks were hot

2822453 they could go to the bathroom they could get a sandwich or whatever
2822454 the rappers have gone in and created a lot of hit music based upon my influence
2822455 i knew nothing about the business or trends and things like that
2822456 i think it was a matter of timing i didnt know what was unfolding
2822457 a person that speaks his mind hes sensitive enough to care for children hes wise enough to not be put into the whack category like everybody else in town and he l o o o o ves the ladies
2822458 there is a place in this world for satire but there is a time when satire ends and intolerance and bigotry towards religious beliefs of others begins
2822459 has no problem and hes cashed plenty of checks with our show making fun of christians

2822470 should a smack as part of good parental correction be a criminal offence in new zealand
2822471 i am not normally one to get involved in politics or public demonstrations but when i realised how the anti smacking bill would directly affect the way i was raising my children i just knew that i had to do something and i discovered very early on that i wasnt the only one who felt this way many of the parents i talked to thought the bill was ludicrous so ludicrous they felt that there wasnt even a need for a petition surely our politicians werent that blind
2822472 as you know i do not support a ban on smacking i am opposed to that because i think it defies human nature no one wants to see a stressed and harassed parent who in exasperation lightly smacks a child dragged before the court
2822473 the government was intruding yet again into the lives of parents and as a mum i was really concerned about the impact that this type of bill would have on my family to remove and undermine a parents authority in their own home is a treacherous area for the state to wade into
2822474 all this has come about because you invited me to join your forum 2 years ago and look where i am now
2822475 you are the duke of new york you are a number 1
2822476 one of the most important lessons of the wars in iraq and afghanistan is that military success is not sufficient to win
2822477 it simply does not have the built in domestic constituency of defense programs
2822478 as an example the f 22 aircraft is produced by companies in 44 states thats 88 senators
2822479 in your opinion once the identity of the terrorists is known should the american government launch a military attack on the country or countries where the terrorist are based or should the american government seek to extradite the terrorists to stand trial

2822481 the new iphone survived our lab scratch and drop test however the iphone 3g appeared extremely sensitive to water the basic light rain test killed our first iphone 3g lcd screen while rapidly discharging the battery until the device became totally overheated a second iphone 3g suffered a dead speaker after being exposed to the standardized light moisture test used to check all the cell phones we review a third unit showed severely weakened speaker sound along with a major malfunction of several touch buttons one explanation for these kinds of serious issues appears to be the simple fact that the back of the iphone 3g nowadays is no longer made of metal but cheap plastic with several wide gaps in the cover
2822482 im convinced the capes humidity would kill it too claudia check the first million iphone 3g sales figures
2822483 we get those daily when we step outside our front doors

2822485 finally a genuine rockstar is born from the womb of american idol
2822486 baseline dopamine levels were 50 percent lower and stimulated dopamine release was significantly attenuated in the brain reward systems of obesity prone rats compared with obesity resistant rats defects in brain dopamine synthesis and release were evident in rats immediately after birth
2822487 previous research has demonstrated that food intake leads to an increase in the release of dopamine in the circuits that mediate the pleasurable aspects of eating
2822488 also chronic food deprivation resulting in decreased body weight leads to decreased dopamine levels therefore increased food intake may represent a compensatory attempt to restore baseline dopamine levels
2822489 these findings have important implications in our understanding of the obesity epidemic the notion that decreased dopamine signaling leads to increased feeding is compatible with the finding from human studies that obese individuals have reduced central dopamine receptors
2822490 we also measured regulators of dopamine synthesis and release in midbrain dopamine pathways
2822491 our molecular analysis suggests that the central dopamine deficits are most likely caused by reduced expression of the genes encoding two proteins one that is involved in dopamine synthesis and another that is a transporter responsible for packaging dopamine into vesicles from which it is later released upon stimulation
2822492 obesity has so far been approached mostly as a metabolic rather than as an addictive disorder and obesity research has primarily focused on brain systems that regulate body weight through the maintenance of energy balance the current study challenges this approach by focusing on brain pathways implicated in pleasure and reward these pathways could override energy balance and induce hyperphagia and obesity by altering the reward value of food particularly palatable high energy food very early in life
2822493 now we know why so many people stay addicted to food it fuels the mid brain pleasure machinery we eat not only for nourishment but also for pleasure this study provides the molecular link between eating and mental health
2822494 the volcano is undergoing an episode of increased activity probably related to magma movement and though no major eruption is indicated steam and ash explosions may occur in the following days

2822514 the adult female requested that the child go with her to her home to collect the surfboard the child refused to comply and the woman left in a car driven by a man

2822521 turcii n general au nevoie de un lider pentru pentru a fi ordona i altfel sunt haotici hasan sa este liderul din teren al galatei alearg enorm i dribleaz bine
2822522 galata nu mai sperie pe nimeni i e mult sub steaua sunt convins c ai no tri vor merge mai departe
2822523 why wont america and nato help us if they wont help us now why did we help them in iraq
2822524 they told us to come out i dont know why but some of our guys are still out there in the fields
2822525 i want to go back if we lose south ossetia now it wont be for ever because we will never surrender our land
2822526 there is a lot of panic many people have left and i am thinking of joining them my bags are already packed
2822527 we are afraid that the russians will come here and kill us people would not go if we had a strong army but they dont believe in our army any more
2822528 i have left everything i dont even have another shirt if the russians stay then i can never return were afraid of what the russians can do
2822529 the russians will be here tomorrow they want to show us and the world how powerful they are tomorrow it will be ukraine and nobody in the west is doing anything to stop them why were our soldiers in kosovo and iraq if we dont get any help from the west now

2822532 it feels to me like a real song of the moment here and now in the summer of 2008 its a bit controversial and makes people think its always a bit of a shock to hear that you have a no 1 record but i always felt that the blend of the song and the artist was so strong that we stood a good chance of having a hit

2822534 my friend patrick struys and i we were getting really discouraged a lot of our friends were giving up on fine art because it was so hard to get a show at a gallery we found a loft that had been empty on front street for a couple years we bargained with the owners to let us take it over for a couple months to put on a show the exhibit went really well it was clear to us that there was a need for a not for profit downtown gallery we saved enough money to begin renting 586 college street as a permanent venue
2822535 art is exciting and art is fun i feel like a lot of the art openings you go to are stuffy theyre about walking around and talking under your breath about the work to your friend our shows are like a party everybody is talking drinking and have a good time the whole idea is that we create an immersive experience live music is really important to us
2822536 im not going to say that toronto has some signature art thing going on but there are exciting things happening like extermination music nights if you want to do something big in the arts you really have to do it yourself you can write a grant and wait for it to come through but in between theyll be a lot of people actually doing it and i think thats more important

2822992 theres a stomach virus going around and every girl on my hall has been inflicted with the terror
2822993 youre like a reality t v show i want to turn the channel and walk away but for some strange reason i cant
2822994 i own too many nice ties not to go to the spring banquet

2823003 i dont sleep with him any more john hes older than me hes older than you
2823004 i cant explain the honor of having two quotes on your profile it gives one the sense that they are going to be somebody wow
2823005 can i suck some of your blood so that i can be a pirate
2823006 if i was bored and had a lot of spare time i would count how many pictures of lauren duncan i had on my computer
2823007 i dont feel comfortable with you saying that and wearing those shorts
2823008 hey lance was telling me about this job at the hospital they charge you nine dollars an hour
2823009 do you think they slimmed your dad down for that picture
2823010 mommy you didnt look so good when you first met daddy
2823011 its the decisions you make when you have no time to make them that defines who you are
2823012 i knew nothing about the business or trends and things like that i think it was a matter of timing i didnt know what was unfolding
2823013 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
2823014 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
2823015 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
2823016 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
2823017 m rg ritescu a plecat de la dinamo din cauza lui rednic
2823018 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
2823019 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
2823020 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
2823021 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
2823022 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
2823023 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
2823024 the creators of the schoolhouse planner have generously offered to give away one copy of this fantastic planner

2823026 this statement is a lie just like georgian president mikheil saakashvilis statement on the impossibility of using military force in conflict zones
2823027 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
2823028 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
2823029 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
2823030 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
2823031 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
2823032 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
2823033 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
2823034 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
2823035 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
2823036 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
2823037 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
2823038 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
2823039 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
2823040 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
2823041 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
2823042 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
2823043 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
2823044 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
2823045 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
2823046 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
2823047 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
2823048 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
2823049 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
2823050 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
2823051 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
2823052 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
2823053 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
2823054 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
2823055 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
2823056 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
2823057 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
2823058 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
2823059 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
2823060 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
2823061 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
2823062 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
2823063 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
2823064 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
2823065 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
2823066 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
2823067 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
2823068 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
2823069 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
2823070 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
2823071 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
2823072 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
2823073 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
2823074 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
2823075 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
2823076 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
2823077 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
2823078 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
2823079 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
2823080 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent

2823083 i think manufacturers who make money should do all they can to make their products safe
2823084 this is just one step it ought to be banned for everything
2823085 many common everyday products could disappear from grocery stores all across california
2823086 we should definitely take steps to limit our exposure to the substance
2823087 anything we can do to reduce bisphenol a could potentially have big payoffs to protecting human health

2823093 we had a meeting yesterday with the gaffer and ally mccoist
2823094 it is the last bit of the play that we need to put the ball into the net

2823096 youre blessed when you feel youve lost what is most dear to you only then can you be embraced by the one most dear to you
2823097 i love them but i dont want to spend time with them
2823098 love takes no account of the evil done to it
2823099 an oral or written description of particular events or situations narrative
2823100 love doesnt use past mistakes as a reason to cut off your friendship with them
2823101 love doesnt use past mistakes as a way to predict their future actions and mistakes
2823102 lord how many times shall i forgive my brother when he sins against me up to seven times
2823103 i tell you not seven times but seventy seven times
2823104 therefore the kingdom of heaven is like a king who wanted to settle accounts with his servants
2823105 but when that servant went out he found one of his fellow servants who owed him a hundred denarii
2823106 his fellow servant fell to his knees and begged him be patient with me and i will pay you back
2823107 this is how my heavenly father will treat each of you unless you forgive your brother from your heart

2823129 well this really is a tragedy of the worst sort my pocket watch its missing
2823130 this will not do i must find it or ill never be on time or late or even here now and then please help me find it
2823131 which way this always happens to me why do i have to make decisions im just a kid decisions are for grownups
2823132 which way that depends on where you are going do you follow well you shouldnt because we cant lead
2823133 im looking for the rabbit he said his watch is missing do you know which way he went
2823134 paths run two ways one goes here the other goes there this is where they meet so does it really matter but if it helps the rabbit took the conservative route hope that helps
2823135 yes he came by for tea but its not tea time or is it it was a minute ago or yesterday or maybe its tomorrow without the watch i just dont know he headed that way across the sea of green at least right now its green sometimes brown maybe rarely white seas change colors at different times of the year you know thats why the parts of a year are called the seasons
2823136 because before you are done youll go around the bend
2823137 its more important to find the cheshire cats grin you know without it he just is not himself and he rather prefers not to be anyone else keep on going when it looks like you are heading back from where you came just in the other direction get it it goes round and round look for a spot the on the right to take your rest have a seat and rest your feet stare off into the forest in front of you a lazy one might stand or should i say lean in your way you will know it when you see it or maybe not if youre too stoned thats where the grin is
2823138 thanks much my friend i owe you one this has been a great adventure for you but its getting late and you must head home soon ill see you again
2823139 no one else here can tell time so how can you know its late
2823140 because ive got a dandy watch ill let you see it sometimes but that will be later
2823141 go outside and stand on the mountain before the lord the lord will be passing by
2823142 lord if it is you command me to come to you on the water

2823179 un p jaro que viv a resignado en un rbol podrido en medio del pantano se hab a acostumbrado a estar ah com a gus anos del fango y se hallaba siempre sucio por el pestilente lodo sus alas estaban inutilizadas por el peso de la mugre hasta que cierto d a un gran ventarr n destruy su guarida el rbol podrido fue tragado por el cieno y el se dio cuenta de que iba a morir en un deseo repentino de salvarse comenz a aletear con fuerza para emprender el vuelo le cost mucho trabajo porque hab a olvidado como volar pero enfrento el dolor del entumecimiento hasta que logr levantarse y cruzar el ancho cielo llegando finalmente a un bosque f rtil y hermoso

2823188 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2823189 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2823190 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2823191 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2823192 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2823193 2k5 is the best game ever and everyone knows it
2823194 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2823195 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2823196 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

2823201 digo que sartre dec a que la vida siempre nos enfrenta a m ltiples condicionantes que quien los niega es un idiota y quien transforma sus condicionantes en determinantes es un cobarde y muchas veces nos movemos en ese campo entre la idiotez y la cobard a intentando algo diferente qui n sabe el grupo sea un buen lugar para encontrar otro lugar desterritorializarse para perderse atravesar las crisis como peligro y oportunidad de cambio

2823211 georgia expresses its readiness to immediately start negotiations with the russian federation on a ceasefire and termination of hostilities
2823212 they were on a mass scale and were directed against individuals
2823213 but there is tons of prep work that has to be done to pull it off thats what takes the most time
2823214 i brought my referee shirt just in case i have to fill in
2823215 i get a chuckle every time i hear the radio ads for the event
2823216 but i wouldnt miss this for anything basketball is definitely a big draw its fun to watch i find myself coaching from the sidelines it gives me a lot of ideas for the season
2823217 the boys and girls club used to be the southside community center which hosted a block party when i was growing up in madison
2823218 they stopped doing the block party around 1999 there wasnt a party for two years until i decided to take it over and bring it back
2823219 the more positive activities like this that we can have at penn park the better
2823220 the police department supports this activity normally we charge the organizers of an event a fee for providing crowd control but were trying to make sure there are activities in the park and that people feel safe and secure
2823221 this is a multicultural event with something for all ages its a good time
2823222 its good for the community people tell me we need to do something like this at warner park and at elver park too
2823223 i grew up in monona and my brother was a big basketball player i remember him getting a team out here
2823224 i think its an awesome event i love basketball this is a great event for the neighborhood and community
2823225 i work for centro hispano for fiesta hispana and the association for africa fest i dont care what culture or ethic group it is people learn they take a little bit away from the experience
2823226 an event like this makes a big impact on the kids it gets them learning about everybody else its a great community event
2823227 im just here enjoying seeing somebody else work and experience the atmosphere
2823228 i know johnny winston jr and a lot of other people who are volunteering their time we all go to each others events to support each other but this is an impressive event
2823229 we like to play ball even me and im a wrestler i like to play ball and get out here and have some fun
2823230 but the main reason im here is for the barbecue
2823231 it gives me cold shivers to remember munchkin couldnt sit up properly or stand shed fall over on her side
2823232 i get tearful just remembering the gratitude in her eyes
2823233 he tenido que abrir las puertas de mi empresa hasta l mites insospechados
2823234 el que no lo tenga en el futuro se quedar fuera del mercado
2823235 veo muy positiva cualquier ampliaci n y mejora de la infraestructura portuaria pero tambi n hay que invertir m s en seguridad privada
2823236 el conflicto con el campo afect a las perspectivas y eso impact en menores decisiones de inversi n y dificultades financieras
2823237 uno de los principales or genes de divisas para argentina son las exportaciones agr colas que tienen precios excepcionales
2823238 ya no lo va a seguir haciendo a tasas chinas a tasas muy elevadas porque hay una desaceleraci n violenta
2823239 enfri ndola de la peor manera por el menor consumo de los que cobran salarios en pesos
2823240 se crecer menos este a o y mucho menos en 2009
2823241 el principal problema de la econom a argentina es la inflaci n y que el gobierno no la reconozca
2823242 el gobierno crea en un organismo estatal que manipula los datos
2823243 la gente trata de cubrirse aumentando los precios el salario subi un 24 en 12 meses pero en esa cifra est impl cita la inflaci n
2823244 esta inflaci n vino por un fuerte incremento de la demanda una oferta estrecha y por los oligopolios que existen
2823245 en argentina estar amos c modos con un 10 de inflaci n aunque ya el 18 ser a aceptable porque el crecimiento genera presiones inflacionarias en la medida en que el gobierno reconozca la inflaci n y dise e un plan contra ella el problema ser a manejable
2823246 veo que el gobierno tras la crisis del campo ha sufrido una ca da muy fuerte en su imagen de ahora y hasta las elecciones legislativas de medio turno de 2009 tratar de recuperarla con m s gasto con subidas de jubilaciones y salarios lo que tendr consecuencias para 2009 porque caer en forma importante el super vit fiscal adem s desaparecer el super vit de cuenta corriente porque crecen las importaciones y los precios de las materias primas no ser n tan favorables
2823247 pero el choque financiero ha complicado much simo el panorama por la dependencia que hay de recursos del exterior
2823248 en 2007 la banca espa ola capt 90 000 millones en dep sitos pero dio 240 000 millones en cr ditos
2823249 la espada de damocles de la econom a espa ola
2823250 el par n de los mercados financieros no ha ayudado a pa ses que basaron su crecimiento en el sector inmobiliario como espa a reino unido irlanda o estados unidos que son los que tienen m s problemas ahora
2823251 estamos en el ecuador de la crisis financiera todav a hay mucha incertidumbre
2823252 esto es un cambio de ciclo cuando la crisis acabe la econom a espa ola ser otra

2823255 the treadmill was running but he was unresponsive lying on the floor

2823262 has no problem and hes cashed plenty of checks with our show making fun of christians
2823263 thats served in a can but tastes like it came from a bottle

2823265 zu diesem ergebnis haben nicht zuletzt gro vertr ge mit mehr als 10 000 quadratmetern b rofl che beigetragen die im vergleich zum vorjahreszeitraum wieder sp rbar an bedeutung gewonnen haben
2823266 die perspektiven f r die zweite jahresh lfte sind positiv
2823267 alles deutet auf einen im zweiten halbjahr weiter anziehenden fl chenumsatz hin so zeichnen sich einige gro abschl sse konkret ab und die nachfrage bei den mittleren fl chengr en ist lebhaft f r das gesamtjahr erwarten wir ein ergebnis das ber dem vorjahresresultat von 629 000 quadratmetern liegen d rfte gleichzeitig gehen wir davon aus dass sich der leerstandsabbau vor allem bei den modernen fl chen fortsetzen wird

2823270 transaktionen ber 10 000 m b rofl che vereinigen in den ersten sechs monaten des jahres rund 75 700 m vermietungsleistung auf sich das sind rund 29 des gesamtvolumens

2823272 das angebot an hochwertigen fl chen wird zusehends geringer erst ab 2009 wird es hier zu einer wesentlichen angebotsausweitung mit neuen fl chen zum beispiel im opernturm und palaisquartier kommen gleichzeitig bleibt der so genannte sockelleerstand aus fl chen einfachen standards in peripheren lagen thema

2823276 the palestinian leadership has been working on establishing a palestinian state within the 67 borders

2823278 we took him out a little early the other night
2823279 he was getting stiffer and stiffer as the game progressed it was getting hard to get loose he was still throwing great

2823281 please be advised that the city council has authorized the exercise of all lawful means to protect the interests of the city including but not limited to seeking judicial relief
2823282 we hired an independent consultant and they determined through their analysis there is no overriding impact
2823283 thats why we hire them thats why we did the process
2823284 the potential traffic impacts resulting from the districts proposed reduction in busing have not been adequately evaluated
2823285 the measure m standards for determining the significance of impacts are not as stringent as the citys
2823286 if the community wants a quality of life that involves busing and the school cant afford it that community should find a way to support that
2823287 its not necessarily the school that is responsible the small change in traffic that pushes you over the threshold could be the result of the city not doing its part
2823288 the palestinian leadership has been working on establishing a palestinian state within the 67 borders

2823313 this whole article is worth reading rich in irony and good for more than a couple laughs but heres the money quote from russias un representative vitaly churkin to us ambassador to the united nations zalmay khalilzad
2823314 churkin reacted angrily at the suggestion that russia was guilty of terrorizing georgians this statement ambassador is completely unacceptable particularly from the lips of the permanent representative of a country whose actions we are aware of including with regard to the civilian populations in iraq and afghanistan and serbia
2823315 isnt it interesting to note how the media has done a virtual 180 on china after just a couple days of olympics coverage leading up the to the olympics the mainstream media coverage was mostly negative china is polluted abuses civil rights and is run by communist stuck in the past
2823316 i think this is due to the fact that the mainstream media gets its story from the government

2823374 it is especially painful as for many years i was prima ballerina of the bolshoi ballet one of russias greatest glories
2823375 it feels like everybody is looking at us at what is going on but they are not making a strong decision
2823376 i think we expect more strong decisions from the west but i dont think russia will listen they dont listen to any international law because of their power at this moment
2823377 it is an occupation we didnt start this it was started by russian hands
2823378 i definitely think that he can play for a team right now because he has those type of skills and he has the body weight to match that physicality of the nba
2823379 hes a great high school player hes strong athletic can handle the ball can shoot the ball exceptionally well i definitely think that he has an all around game
2823380 theyre all being aggressive with the basketball i dont think that hes not being a team player because ive seen him pass the ball you have scorers and you have passers hes definitely one that can score the basketball
2823381 i dont see the kid on a day to day basis so i dont really konw what he needs to work on just his ability to make moves in the lane on multiple guys without getting ripped or losing the basketball is real impressive to me him being able to finish with both hands and being able to dribble with both hands
2823382 my rule is that you should be able to sing them
2823383 thats why i dont like jimmy page i love led zeppelin but i wouldnt ever want to emulate his guitar playing because you cant sing his solos theyre way too coked out
2823384 there are blues punk bands like the oblivions stuff like that which is a big foundation and teengenerate people doing obscure punk sound from wherever it can go from soul music pop music british invasion it all comes out
2823385 so when theres a blueprint that you can work with and the foundation is there and youre let loose to do whatever you want within probably the most artistically freeing thing i can think of if you do something that takes a left turn that makes it original then good for you but its painstaking to try to be original its tedious and its no fun
2823386 if i could get away just saying words words words words words i would
2823387 there was a time when pop music didnt mean anything to me
2823388 ive been getting recognized by people i dont know which is weird the mustache helps
2823389 but its gotta go soon once it becomes a thing then it goes
2823390 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2823391 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2823392 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2823393 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2823394 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2823395 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2823396 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2823397 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2823553 refers to obamas march 2008 vote for a non binding budget resolution that would have set general revenue and spending targets for congressional tax writing and appropriations committees the resolution does not contain a specific provision to raise tax rates but rather assumes that most of the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts expire as scheduled in 2011 it also bears no relation to obamas proposed economic plan in fact obama has stated repeatedly that his plan would increase taxes only for those making more than 250 000 per year
2823554 the most comprehensive nonpartisan analysis of obamas tax proposal available is the tax policy centers comparison of mccains and obamas economic plans that analysis mostly supports obamas claim that his plan wont raise taxes though it says that families earning between 169 480 and 237 040 would see an average tax increase of 486 under obamas plan all those earning less than 169 480 would see tax cuts in fact that hypothetical taxpayer with the 32 000 in taxable income would get a 502 tax cut under obamas plan mccains plan by contrast would leave that persons taxes unchanged
2823555 as we have described before budget resolutions basically set targets for appropriations committees to use they are more like guidelines than actual rules and like many budget resolutions this one passed on a party line vote with just one democrat and two republicans crossing party lines
2823556 budget resolutions merely set targets for tax writing and appropriations committees and dont alter the tax code directly

2823627 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2823628 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2823629 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2823630 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2823631 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2823632 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2823633 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2823634 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2823639 you cant agree with me because you dont like me i know you tried to sabatoge my promotion because of the conversation you had with delilah
2823640 you shall not be afraid of the terrors of the night nor of the arrow the evil plots and slanders of the wicked that flies by day nor of the pestilence that stalks in darkness nor of the destruction and sudden death that surprise and lay waste at noonday
2823641 because you have made the lord your refuge and the most high your dwelling place
2823642 do not therefore fling away your fearless confidence for it carries a great and glorious compensation of reward
2823643 for i know whom i have believed and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which ive committed unto him against that day
2823644 for this reason we also from the day we heard of it have not ceased to pray and make special request for you asking that you may be filled with the full deep and clear knowledge of his will in all spiritual wisdom in comprehensive insight into the ways and purposes of god and in understanding and discernment of spiritual things that you may walk live and conduct yourselves in a manner worthy of the lord fully pleasing to him and desiring to please him in all things bearing fruit in every good work and steadily growing and increasing in and by the knowledge of god with fuller deeper and clearer insight acquaintance and recognition we pray that you may be invigorated and strengthened with all power according to the might of his glory to exercise every kind of endurance and patience perseverance and forbearance with joy giving thanks to the father

2823648 hopefully its going to be best for him because he was having a problem with range of motion of his shoulder
2823649 hes playing and not really being himself as far as swinging the bat maybe this will give him a chance to get some more range of motion and maybe get the old scotty back here
2823650 the rehab is pretty intense digging pretty deep into the shoulder and the capsule trying to loosen up some tissue
2823651 when doing that and trying to play and swing a baseball bat at the same time were kind of counteracting what were doing if we give it time to cool down a little bit and get in there and dig and get after that without having to swing the bat and undo it thats hopefully going to help it recover a little better
2823652 im just going to try and take it easy on him for a while so we dont lose him again
2823653 i wont be stealing any bases but aside from that ill be all right
2823654 maybe it will change here or there but thats where i want him to hit
2823655 he was in that spot before he got hurt and well just put him back in there
2823656 i cant believe we dont win a race in three or four weeks and were in a slump

2823823 paul pleads for us to make the most of our time immediately after he pleads for us to walk wisely rather than foolishly outside of purposeful disobedience of gods word the most spiritually foolish thing a christian can do is to waste time and opportunity to fritter away his life in trivia and in half hearted service to the lord
2823824 the great sixteenth century reformer philipp melanchthon kept a record of every wasted moment and took his list to god in confession at the end of each day it is small wonder that god used him in such great ways
2823825 the proper sense of urgency however drives the wise believer to want more than ever to understand what the will of the lord is because he knows that only in the lords will and power can anything good and lasting be accomplished

2823906 in diesem land in stadien wie diesen soll demn chst die jugend der welt um medaillen ringen um siege h pfen um gold springen und vor allem das fr hlich sein
2823907 ja aber sicher nicht in einem stadion in dem zuvor menschen hingerichtet wurden
2823908 am 19 juni hielten die beh rden von peking im stadion von shijingshan unter den augen von 10 000 zuschauern die erste gro veranstaltung ab um drogen verbrecher zu bestrafen 14 kriminelle schuldig der abscheulichsten verbrechen wurden zum hinrichtungsplatz geleitet und erschossen
2823909 dass dieses stadion jetzt zum olympia komplex geh rt ist der beleg daf r es doch einen zusammenhang zwischen sport und menschenrechten gibt
2823910 bocog hat dem ioc zugesichert dass sportstadien f r solche zwecke nicht benutzt w rden das ioc kann nicht rechtfertigen was in der vergangenheit passiert sein mag das ioc glaubt fest daran dass die todesstrafe in sportstadien keinen platz hat
2823911 es l uft bei uns einfach nicht rund das war in den testspielen auch so spielerisch ist das noch nicht doll ich hoffe das spiel bei den preu en war f r alle ein wachr ttler
2823912 wenn ich viermal einen fehlpass spiele muss ich dann halt mal statt des t dlichen passes die einfachen dinge versuchen und vor allem m ssen wir ber 90 minuten unser potenzial abrufen
2823913 jeder muss sich steigern und strecken in m nster fehlten uns aber auch noch spieler wie freier dabrowski und epall die sonst fest eingeplant sind aber ich bin berzeugt dass wir beim ksc einen anderen vfl sehen werden
2823914 w re nochmal was passiert w re sofort der abbruch erfolgt
2823915 ich wollte sie zur besinnung bringen ich war ja selbst polizeibeamter da darf einem in so einer situation nicht unwohl sein
2823916 die halle chaoten konnten 120 meter durchs stadion laufen und provozieren zudem verstehe ich nicht dass keine polizei im leeren block zwischen den fans war
2823917 ich will nicht ausschlie en dass es eine geldstrafe f r uns gibt
2823918 er hat mich an der schulter gehalten ich wollte mich nur losreissen eine nat rliche bewegung nicht mit faust oder ellenbogen keine absicht das hat vielleicht ungl cklich ausgesehen aber ich glaube nicht dass da vom dfb noch was kommt der schiri stand doch 10 meter daneben
2823919 ich wollte es besonders gut machen und war wohl etwas berdreht
2823920 zu 70 prozent nehme ich den feldverweis auf meine kappe obwohl ich nat rlich nicht wollte dass bajram meine ansage so konsequent umsetzt

2823922 ich trage das immer noch mit mir rum dass ich das nicht realisieren konnte
2823923 das tut immer noch verdammt weh aus welchen gr nden auch immer denn dass die wahl damals auf mich fiel war eine riesen auszeichnung ich war und bin ein teil des dfb
2823924 wir werden einen mittelfeldplatz erreichen mit dem auftakt im pokal sind wir auf einem guten weg in wolfsburg wollen wir gleich das erste ausrufezeichen setzen ich bin felsenfest davon berzeugt dass wir die bundesliga erhalten
2823925 mit dem aufstieg hat nicht jeder spieler lebenslang einen stammplatz michael meier verdient f r seine arbeit eine auszeichnung wir gehen gut ger stet in die saison ich bin sicher dass spieler wie mit antar mondragon mohamad oder auch broich sich in der bundesliga durchsetzen werden
2823926 toleranz und multi kulturelles zeichnen k ln aus wir setzen das image der stadt um brigens bei uns gibt es nur drei spieler die kein deutsch verstehen petit geromel und mondragon mit ihm rede ich englisch
2823927 jeder stein wurde umgedreht was wir in der kurzen zeit aufgebaut haben macht uns schon stolz die resonanz in k ln und in ganz deutschland gibt uns recht wir wollen uns daf r mit guten leistungen bedanken
2823928 ich hatte das gef hl meine aufgabe ist mit dem aufstieg erf llt aber es kam mir so vor als sei der fc eine baustelle die noch nicht fertig ist dann haben wir uns mit den gremien zusammengesetzt um dem klub gemeinsam zu helfen dabei ist es nie um irgendwelche forderungen gegangen
2823929 das ist doch alles normalit t ich war in der t rkei in der champions league und nicht im interplanetarischem system nummer 247 ich war immer vor ort jetzt bin ich wieder in der bundesliga ich freue mich drauf und will mitgestalten den deutschen fu ball wieder auf h heres niveau zu bringen
2823930 ich war immer einer der visionen hatte visionen schaffen fakten f r meine methoden wurde ich anfangs bel chelt sogar bek mpft erst hinterher kommt die anerkennung heute sehe ich gott sei dank bei vielen trainern dass sie etwas neues ausprobieren j rgen klinsmann hat beim dfb damit angefangen lasst die buddhas doch mal auf die bayern spieler wirken ich habe gro en respekt vor jedem der neue wege gehen will lieber trends setzen als trends nachlaufen das ist meine maxime

2823935 lately i havent had much peace im always troubled and very upset
2823936 how come all the jewish babies were killed because of jesus by king herod
2823937 but why wouldnt all the other people turn over this jesus so their children wouldnt be killed
2823938 pray also for me that whenever i open my mouth words may be given me so that i will fearlessly make known the mystery of the gospel
2823939 an intelligent man is always open to new ideas in fact he looks for them
2823940 if others have this right of support from you shouldnt we have it all the more but we did not use this right on the contrary we put up with anything rather than hinder the gospel of christ
2823941 please god we are about to lose our sanity we need something to hang onto if this goes on much longer well destroy ourselves before we go home
2823942 listen to all that the people are saying to you it is not you they have rejected but they have rejected me as their king 8 as they have done from the day i brought them up out of egypt until this day forsaking me and serving other gods so they are doing to you
2823943 this is what the king who will reign over you will do he will take your sons and make them serve with his chariots and horses and they will run in front of his chariots 12 some he will assign to be commanders of thousands and commanders of fifties and others to plow his ground and reap his harvest and still others to make weapons of war and equipment for his chariots 13 he will take your daughters to be perfumers and cooks and bakers 14 he will take the best of your fields and vineyards and olive groves and give them to his attendants 15 he will take a tenth of your grain and of your vintage and give it to his officials and attendants 16 your menservants and maidservants and the best of your cattle b and donkeys he will take for his own use 17 he will take a tenth of your flocks and you yourselves will become his slaves 18 when that day comes you will cry out for relief from the king you have chosen and the lord will not answer you in that day
2823944 we want a king over us 20 then we will be like all the other nations with a king to lead us and to go out before us and fight our battles
2823945 is my dependency on a plan like israels plea for a king
2823946 i never demanded the food allotted to the governor because the demands were heavy on these people
2823947 but out of reverence for god i did not act like that instead i devoted myself to the work on this wall all my men were assembled there for the work we did not acquire any land
2823948 ich habe mein ding gemacht den rest h tten die anderen machen m ssen
2823949 hanka war sehr fr h weg so dass ich am ende sehr viel arbeit hatte
2823950 hanka muss die arbeit machen bei den anderen kommt nichts heraus der verband muss sich was einfallen lassen
2823951 ich wei nicht was das f r mich f r konsequenzen hat
2823952 da muss man sich fast bei den leuten zuhause entschuldigen dass sie zugeschaut haben das war kein hochleistungssport
2823953 ein gewinner ist der k nig ein verlierer ein bandit
2823954 die botschaft war einfach es gibt keine m chtigere nation als die chinesen
2823955 man hat uns mitgeteilt dass alle seine erfolge bedeutungslos w rden wenn er kein gold gewinnt
2823956 ich finde es normal geschlagen zu werden denn das motiviert mich das n chste mal mehr zu tun
2823957 der freiflug war ein fehler ich habe daraus aber sofort meine konsequenzen gezogen ich werde nie mehr einen freiflug nehmen
2823958 eine obergrenze die ich mir selbst gesetzt und eisern eingehalten habe
2823959 wir sollten noch einmal dar ber nachdenken ob wir uns den luxus eines vorzeitigen kernkraftausstiegs wirklich leisten k nnen
2823960 ganz ehrlich ich war ein bisschen m de nach dem harten training aber die frische kommt jetzt wichtig ist mir vor allem dass mit dem r cken alles wieder okay ist ich bin gl cklich ber die beiden tore und unser weiterkommen im pokal nach der schweren leidenszeit geht mir das herz wieder auf
2823961 eigentlich war ich zum saisonende gegen rostock noch gar nicht so weit das linke bein war damals ganz schwach gebaut also die muskulatur dort kaum da ich hatte schwierigkeiten jetzt habe ich wieder den richtigen impuls beim schie en
2823962 ich habe viel vor mit energie im pokal wollen wir jetzt was rei en der kampf gegen den abstieg wird hart genug und ganz fest w nsche ich mir dass ich mich niemals wieder so schwer verletzte die zeit war hart aber jetzt kann ich wieder die richtigen impulse setzen
2823963 f r den auftakt war das schon eine prima leistung ich habe einige wertvolle erkenntnisse bekommen
2823964 da hat vieles schon geklappt die neuen spieler haben gezeigt dass sie verst rkungen sein k nnen
2823965 classic hits station in the truest sense not that stations have to fit a clear format category to be successful
2823966 das war perfekt wir haben die jungs ein wenig berstrapaziert aber ich habe es lieber wenn zu diesem zeitpunkt alle etwas m de sind
2823967 jean marc pelletier und tobi g ttner im tor spielte gestern 30 minuten d red haben mich beeindruckt
2823968 aber unsere top 6 st rmer haben noch nicht ihr spiel gefunden
2823969 keiner stirbt als jungfrau das schicksal fi t euch alle
2823970 der fahrer verlor auf der nassen fahrbahn die kontrolle und raste in den gegenverkehr laut zeugen war er viel zu schnell unterwegs
2823971 unsere mannschaft war gerade beim aufw rmprogramm pl tzlich setzte regen ein der himmel wurde innerhalb von minuten dunkel aber kein einziger donnerschlag k ndigte ein gewitter an
2823972 eine druckwelle warf uns auf den boden es war als ob ich einen m chtigen hammerschlag auf den kopf bekam dann durchzuckte ein stromschlag meine komplette linke k rperh lfte ich zitterte am ganzen k rper dachte jetzt ist alles aus meine kameraden fielen um wie dominosteine und blieben teilweise bewusstlos liegen
2823973 die rzte sagen es ist ein wunder dass keiner von uns get tet wurde
2823974 jeder anfang ist schwer aber jetzt haben wir den ersten sieg und k nnen das abhaken
2823975 es macht schon spa dem jungen zuzuschauen jeff kann den unterschied ausmachen

2823995 iran the gulf cooperation council gcc members and any country in the world have the right to peaceful nuclear energy as long as they meet the controls and safeguards of the international atomic energy agency iaea
2823996 our friends in iran have to know that failure to respond positively to the international demands will serve neither their interest nor those of their friends in the gulf region
2823997 even as i hope for some measure of peace and comfort to the bereaved families i must also hope that we as a nation draw some measure of wisdom from this tragedy certain immediate lessons are clear and we must act upon those lessons decisively we need to step up security at our airports we must reexamine the effectiveness of our intelligence networks and we must be resolute in identifying the perpetrators of these heinous acts and dismantling their organizations of destruction we must also engage however in the more difficult task of understanding the sources of such madness the essence of this tragedy it seems to me derives from a fundamental absence of empathy on the part of the attackers an inability to imagine or connect with the humanity and suffering of others such a failure of empathy such numbness to the pain of a child or the desperation of a parent is not innate nor history tells us is it unique to a particular culture religion or ethnicity it may find expression in a particular brand of violence and may be channeled by particular demagogues or fanatics most often though it grows out of a climate of poverty and ignorance helplessness and despair we will have to make sure despite our rage that any u s military action takes into account the lives of innocent civilians abroad we will have to be unwavering in opposing bigotry or discrimination directed against neighbors and friends of middle eastern descent finally we will have to devote far more attention to the monumental task of raising the hopes and prospects of embittered children across the globe children not just in the middle east but also in africa asia latin america eastern europe and within our own shores
2823998 this isnt the first time this has happened and it doesnt surprise me anymore
2823999 politics takes precedence over sport with the iranians and the olympic spirit is as far from them as east is far from west
2824000 my heart goes out to the iranian athletes in the athens olympics one of their sportsmen who was a gold medal favorite had to pull out because he was drawn against an israeli
2824001 theres no place for this kind of behavior in the olympic movement and its a shame it continues

2824007 todos los rituales y costumbres son in tiles sin recordar al se or en meditaci n
2824008 un hombre espiritualmente ciego no puede quitar la suciedad de la mente ni siquiera con ba os frecuentes y la mortificaci n del yoga
2824009 observancia de acciones de las seis escuelas de filosof a darshanas los vedas samrti leyendo los sastras el yoga y la peregrinaci n es in til y esto puede empujarlo a uno al infierno si l no se envuelve con el amor de dios en su coraz n
2824010 tanto el tantra como el kundalini yoga son consideradas t cnicas peligrosas por ejemplo swami prabhavananda advierte acerca de los peligrosos efectos f sicos que pueden resultar de los ejercicios de respiraci n del kundalini yoga a menos que se hagan correctamente hay una buena posibilidad de da ar el cerebro y las personas que practican este tipo de respiraci n sin una supervisi n adecuada pueden sufrir una enfermedad que ninguna ciencia o m dico conocidos pueden curar
2824011 el gur explica este secreto sin el amor de dios nosotros no podemos ser libres del miedo y el ciclo de miseria contin a la peregrinaci n ayunando las m s grandes caridades o el yoga ellos son todos in tiles si nosotros nos olvidamos de alabar a dios en cualquier cosa que nosotros hacemos y si nosotros no acudimos para s lo confiar en l por todos los resultados una alma rara deja ambos el orgullo el amor de ego y la co dependencia de la familia el amor de otros y entonces s lo medita en gobind nanak dice que tal humano es lo que ellos llaman libre del nacimiento y muerte mientras todav a viven entre nosotros
2824012 medite en l de quien la luz infinitamente poderosa penetra el mundo entero
2824013 mis estimados amigos del santo cuando usted alaba a dios h galo con una alarma y uno apunt a la mente
2824014 meditando en l como el solo objetivo y pensamiento incluso por un fragmento de un segundo ha liberado a los humanos del lazo de la muerte
2824015 todos los rituales y costumbres son in tiles sin recordar al se or en meditaci n
2824016 if the world were to draw any lessons from what i did there would never be any wars
2824017 we live in the 21st century after all we shouldnt really stoop so low to wage wars against each other
2824018 politicians should straighten out the situation today and if they dont well have to get involved
2824019 when it comes to sports we will always remain friends and nothing will effect our friendship even in such a scary event as shooting
2824020 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2824021 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2824022 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2824023 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2824024 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2824025 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2824026 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2824027 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2824028 holy crap i am bleeding oh my gosh oh my gosh oh my gosh

2824031 mi gran sue o es que haya una gran unidad del pueblo boliviano
2824032 han sido incontables las voces en estos dos meses solicitando que se pare esta locura porque no solo no resuelve ninguno de los problemas de fondo sino que al contrario los profundiza no amerita su costo desde ning n punto de vista y probablemente el d a siguiente ser m s complicado para el presidente y para el pa s en general
2824033 no hay se al alguna de que la relaci n de balance entre fuerzas pol ticas y sociales se modifique sustantivamente porque incluso si el gobierno logra un avance de su votaci n su objetivo principal su proyecto de constituci n igual se ver a trabado o su aplicaci n ser a inviable
2824034 se dice que morales obtendr a un 54 o hasta 55 por ciento pero ese 55 por ciento no es nacional existen altas posibilidades de que el presidente sea revocado en entre dos y cinco departamentos hoy sin ser revocado el presidente no puede ni siquiera aterrizar en algunos puntos del pa s
2824035 we have to do with what he left behind and do we must for his poems are the oxygen mask that failed him but gets us through our days the poet is dead words weep like us they know what they have lost like us they have been orphaned adrift in a world that has only politicians the poet is dead but his poems stay we will know them better now we will pour over them and squeeze every word the way we squeeze an olive to get out of it its last drop of goodness the poet is dead and with him my dream that one day i will hear him live for more of my blog posts on mahmoud darwish click on the label below mahmoud darwish
2824036 only darwish can translate into words the contradictions within all palestinian minds he writes what we can not express in words

2824044 i believe that the international community is not looking to destabilise mauritania
2824045 when it has all the information it will turn in a positive direction
2824046 justice exists in mauritania and there is also a parliament which could be called on to judge them if necessary
2824047 i telephoned him abdallahi personally to explain to him the gravity of his decree and suggest he postpone it to avoid the worst
2824048 the changes of august 6 the day of the coup are the logical and indisputable result of president sidi ould cheikh abdallahis behaviour to stall the republics institutions
2824049 for two and half months the military has started to step on the presidents turf
2824050 we want to prevent mauritania from falling into a vicious cycle where the crisis deepens and the international community is led to take measures that would be unfortunate for the lives and the future of the mauritanian people

2824056 there is a lot of foreign buying in london the russians and saudis have been famously active but so far india has been relatively untapped there are a lot of people in the industry looking over our shoulders to see how we do
2824057 we are not panicking we are looking at new markets

2824059 the united states has long expressed concerns about government financial support for the launch of commercial aircraft and has pursued this issue with the europeans in the wto washington will take a very careful look at the support announced by canada quebec and the uk to ensure they do not distort the market for commercial airliners or contravene wto rules
2824060 the us government is making inquiries about the nature and terms of the money being provided to bombardier if as seems likely it is deemed launch aid the us could take the matter to the wto
2824061 government support for aircraft manufacturing can be expected to attract some international scrutiny federal participation in this project is consistent with canadas wto obligations
2824062 some will settle very soon perhaps in the next couple of weeks
2824063 over time these would yield 11 million a year to the london economy everyone is trying to tell their story here we need to use this as an opportunity for 2012

2824074 you have one incredible year two moderate years one poor year and one disaster you still have to have the keepers youve got to have everything else running i cant think of a single person making money out of grouse moors
2824075 its the large more commercial shoots which rely on customers from the city or the construction industry that may have problems if the credit crunch continues into next year
2824076 grouse shooting is in finite supply it really is the finest shooting in the world
2824077 grouse is going to be full as ever you may see people asking for smaller days for pheasant and partridge
2824078 grouse are no different than growing wheat you grow the harvest you take the harvest and you eat it
2824079 wild game is the pi ce de r sistance woodpigeon and grouse for their natural ability in taking avoidance tactics at the slightest hint of man
2824080 nothing can prepare you for 90mph driven grouse barrel rolling in a gale of wind while your two rather pathetic shots go wide of the mark and all in gods own country

2824106 no no definitely there has to be a very clear timeline
2824107 if thaksin really doesnt come back the conflict in our country will lessen which implies that our prolonged political trouble will come to an end soon
2824108 if there are no reasons given or the reasons are not good enough the court will consider that they have the intention of fleeing and they will face arrest warrants
2824109 until now there have been no reports that thaksin and khunying potjaman will report to the court or that they will lodge a request to go overseas
2824110 his return will go according to schedule mr thaksin confirmed that he will come back to fight all the cases in thailand he has never thought of seeking asylum as has been rumoured
2824111 actually the defendants testimonies have no bearing on the trial the defendants have denied the allegations all along it depends on the evidence

2824137 hopefully its going to be best for him because he was having a problem with range of motion of his shoulder
2824138 hes playing and not really being himself as far as swinging the bat maybe this will give him a chance to get some more range of motion and maybe get the old scotty back here
2824139 the rehab is pretty intense digging pretty deep into the shoulder and the capsule trying to loosen up some tissue
2824140 when doing that and trying to play and swing a baseball bat at the same time were kind of counteracting what were doing if we give it time to cool down a little bit and get in there and dig and get after that without having to swing the bat and undo it thats hopefully going to help it recover a little better
2824141 im just going to try and take it easy on him for a while so we dont lose him again
2824142 i wont be stealing any bases but aside from that ill be all right
2824143 maybe it will change here or there but thats where i want him to hit

2824151 weve been violated we cant live our lives we cant sit we cant sleep at night
2824152 this is just an example among thousands of other cases

2824156 i have one question for mr karzai if this was your little girl what would you do
2824157 these criminals are never brought to justice because police and government authorities are either involved or they cant handle the crimes
2824158 with criminals and warlords in the political scene we cannot expect justice to be served
2824159 in many cases of violence against children there is a sense of impunity people continue to violate childrens rights without any sense of feeling that they will be held accountable
2824160 i cant think of any country in the world in which children suffer more than in afghanistan
2824161 in all our meetings with children it takes a lot of time to make them smile that to me shows that there is not happiness in their hearts
2824162 on what basis must reporters be volunteers if they write for blogs but not if say they write for the media relations department are they really reporters then

2824172 weve been reassured that everythings all safe and our security guy seems pretty on to it so i feel fine ive got a couple of friends on the outside my mum and dad and my girlfriend and they say theyre all safe and well so no worries
2824173 well get information around to all the team this morning reassuring them that in our view and the view of security arrangements for the games it is an isolated incident not an orchestrated campaign
2824174 well be trying to calm that concern but if i was a parent at home clearly you would have some concern
2824175 we have a very good programme and security chief barry taylor is managing that well
2824176 we have a very rigid checkout system and we know where athletes are at all time and the fact that theyve gone out in groups
2824177 that was tragic and our thoughts go out to the american team and obviously the connection to the coach of the volleyball team but certainly the advice weve had is it was a one off random incident and there is no raising of concerns around our activity around the city
2824178 we wont change at all we just need to be mindful but we certainly havent changed our pattern of operation
2824179 this is a large city of 15 million people and in any large city there will be incidents taking place that you never hear about
2824180 im sure the chinese are disappointed they are wonderful hosts they go out of their way to ensure their visitors are well looked after protected and secure
2824181 theyll be devastated this has happened but i dont think we should let it detract from what is a fabulous games its tragic but i dont think we should presume this is going to be the start of things going downhill
2824182 weve been reassured everything is still safe and i feel fine about that
2824183 ive got a couple of friends on the outside and mum dad and my girlfriend are here and they say theyre all safe and well so no worries
2824184 beijing is a safe city but unfortunately we are not immune to violent acts
2824185 as a team there is nothing more important to us than supporting mrs bachman in her struggle and supporting hugh and elisabeth in their grief
2824186 we are absolutely devastated by what has occurred for their loss and for everything they are going through
2824187 hugh has been in touch with the team throughout this tragedy and were extremely proud of the strength he and elisabeth are displaying they know were here for them in every way possible
2824188 i wanted to finally make it clear that rabbits are not cowards
2824189 i have a feeling its going to be broken right now
2824190 but if not well it was great to have it for a little bit

2824219 sheriff van and police cruiser firebombed august 6th 2008 coast salish territories vancouver kanada in plain daylight in the afternoon of august 6th we firebombed two vehicles belonging to the police one was a sheriff van parked in front of the courthouse on main st located south of powell st the other was a police cruiser parked on the south east corner of main and hastings st it was empty because the pigs were in the middle of conducting an arrest that afternoons gossip in the downtown east side was one of sheer happiness found in the shared appreciation of seeing a sheriff van burn in front of the courthouse doors what bliss must have been felt by the people locked inside awaiting their trials in that despicable house of injustice those who live in the downtown east side struggle together daily to survive beneath the booming development which continues to exclude them to an existence of poverty and prison along with the police and private security the courts sheriffs and judges continue to enforce the orderly and lawful circulation of commodities and money with limitless social control their complicity is present in the example of development police repression and prison they should expect no less than burning vehicles and creative expressions of our contempt we hope this act will spark communication and create new relationships of collaboration in struggle our choices move beyond run hide and prison there are endless possibilities to be found in the conspiracy of attack we chose to act between the days of august 1st 7th because of the call for solidarity by 500 prisoners in german prisons and around europe who are on hunger strike our love is sent to the comrades who continue to refuse the life of passivity and silence inside and outside the walls of prison for the freedom of amadeu casellas ramon gabriel pombo da silva marcos comenish jose fernandez delgado freedom for all prisoners may our willingness to revolt spread our crimes of passion through their quiet cities and into the solitude of prison we are bound to annihilate their prison world

2824229 the frustrating part of the web is that you see your tactics fail right away
2824230 the trap sprint all day and run out of energy before the marathon even starts
2824231 did you put your home directory in its own partition or on another drive

2824239 rob had wanted me to continue to support the team after he passed away
2824240 i never imagined before i had surgery for testicular cancer that i could ride 100 miles in a day on a bicycle but soon afterward i knew i had to do this
2824241 as i rode i thought of so many family and friends whose lives have been affected or ended by cancer now as i finally crossed the finish line rode through the cancer survivor lane and was handed a rose succeeding in this physical challenge made me feel so alive and so grateful i feel and accept the obligation of the cured to help others who are struggling and i am so proud to be part of this fantastic caring community of survivors
2824242 before my cancer diagnosis in 2003 id seen other people do races like this and i thought thats great
2824243 but it never occurred to me that i could actually do it
2824244 once you get used to sitting on the saddle you just do it longer
2824245 its great exercise and its a great way to fight cancer
2824246 the pmc offers an opportunity to fight back and make a difference in the battle against this devastating disease
2824247 its a great experience and its a lot of fun
2824248 the more you see other people doing it you realize you can do it too you dont see that until something triggers it though
2824249 after i had my cancer diagnosis i realized that nearly everyone i knew had been affected by it

2824253 een vrouw in tokio boekte voortdurend grote bestellingen toen heb ik haar eens geskyped om te vragen waarvoor ze dat deed en of ze niet in mijn handschoenen online wilde handelen op een japanse site dat leek haar een goed idee en zo was er ineens een japanse country manager
2824254 voor de nederlander is dit niets die begrijpen weinig van elegante handschoenen om te verwennen en te verleiden wel zijn ze heel gevoelig voor modegrapjes zoals mn autohandschoentjes met cow print het begon destijds ook direct met bestellingen uit het buitenland de verenigde staten japan

2824256 elk design gaat als prototype naar de producent die zelf ook een prototype maakt en dat terug stuurt voor controle door de ervaring gaat da nu bijna in n keer goed
2824257 itali is in de leermode natuurlijk productieland nummer 1 in de wereld en ik moest er toch heen voor vakantie
2824258 de italianen zijn het goedkoopst maar de kwaliteit is niet altijd even goed daar sta ik ook van te kijken ze zijn een beetje arrogant en je moet goed controleren wat je binnen krijgt bij de tsjechen zie je duitse invloed ze werken gr ndlich precies volgens de opdracht wel was het contact leggen moeilijk want op internet presenteerden de ateliers zich vooral in het tjechisch de chinees vond ik wel gewoon online door te zoeken de chinezen leveren het beste werk af momenteel ze houden zich exact aan het ontwerp en productierichtlijnen
2824259 ik ben erg goed in onderhandelen bij de nieuwe website heb ik net zo lang gesoebat over de kosten van het back end tot er voldoende budget overbleef voor hoogwaardig concept en design van
2824260 ik heb een logistiekhoek waar ik de handschoenen v r t inpakken zelf olie en poeder en van een bijsluitertje voorzie en daarna breng ik ze zelf naar het postkantoor hier net om de hoek
2824261 ik schrijf bijdragen voor nieuwsbrieven en blogs over mode voor niets in ruil voor een linkje ook zijn er contacten met stilisten die de handschoenen voor shows willen gebruiken om bijvoorbeeld bij een saaie jeans toch een heftig effect te krijgen daar ben ik heel slim en vrijgevig in het is een goede reclame zo verspreidt de boodschap zich het best
2824262 als de andere talen straks live gaan ga ik de internationale adwords inkoop en analyse trouwens wel professionaliseren met hulp van het amsterdamse bureau leylines
2824263 jonge meisjes en vrouwen die iets bijzonder willen dragen in de talrijke kleuren die we bieden of hun partners die iets cadeau willen doen krijgen we het meest ik kan me ook niet geheel aan de indruk onttrekken dat een groeiend aantal mannelijke bestellers van bijvoorbeeld de lange leren opera gloves zich meer laten leiden door fetisjistisch of ander zinnelijk genot dan door louter elegantie
2824264 ik wil nu schaalvergroting tot stand brengen met een netwerk van country managers die hun eigen deel van de website in hun eigen taal kunnen beheren

2824273 oh my proud wound my homeland is not a briefcase and i am not a traveler i am the lover and the land is my beloved the archeologist is busy with stone analysis he is looking for his eyes in the burial of myths to prove that i am a passerby in the path without eyes not a letter in the sojourn of civilization and i plant my trees slowly and about my love i sing
2824274 absolutely theres a lot of truth to what the president said and in terms of wall street there was too much leverage in the system and more leverage than was appropriate and more than people recognized because the leverage came into the system in the form of highly complex structured products which were difficult to understand
2824275 there is no question about it wall street got drunk
2824276 thats one reason i asked you to turn off your tv cameras
2824277 the question is how long will it take to sober up and not try to do all these fancy financial instruments
2824278 we have of course one priority getting through this period with as little damage as little negative impact as possible on the economy but the second part is to take steps to reduce the likelihood of these sorts of things happening in the future
2824279 i will do everything i can to make for a smooth transition to work closely with my successor in treasury to do everything i can to help out but im focused on getting everything done i can get done between now and january 19th
2824280 we sized that program to say how could we do something that will be meaningful this year but not so big that it would jeopardize some of our long term priorities and our fiscal priorities and balancing the budget so again my view would be lets see how this program works in the third quarter

2824348 this plan will guarantee access for traditional owners to the site formalise how the 20 hectare site will be managed in the future and ensure ongoing protection of the cultural heritage on the site
2824349 a search of the aboriginal cultural heritage database shows the piastre fish traps are one of just 20 recorded inland fish trap sites
2824350 that makes this site one of tremendous cultural heritage significance which will now be protected for future generations of queenslanders
2824351 there are some people with minor injuries so far and there is at least one person unaccounted for
2824352 it was just a tremendous explosion and blew all the windows out of the house just blew the house up and i just managed to get out of there in time
2824353 the continued fall in crude oil and commodity prices has knocked the wind out of the aussies sails
2824354 if they the rba give the sense theyre prepared to cut interest rates in the near term then downward pressure on the dollar accelerates
2824355 i want to win a gold medal at the olympics
2824356 its a very special car for customers who want to take the bespoke experience to a higher level every car will be entirely individual
2824357 this luxury case is yet another step we are taking to help the noreve brand become one of the most unique and recognized case manufacturers in the world
2824358 we look forward to working with additional types of precious stones in our future designs
2824359 its a big event skateboarders of all ages and levels come to compete
2824360 you wouldnt believe all of the types of tricks you can see at a competition like this one
2824361 we created this competition to bring together members of the community while also doing it for a good cause
2824362 the money will go toward the charities and next years competition
2824363 part of my routine included grinding the quarter pipe and doing a back 180
2824364 i love skateboarding in front of big crowds of people
2824365 during competitions i just want to do the biggest and best tricks im able to do within the time period thats allowed
2824366 the competition was a great way for skateboarders to get out there and show off their tricks and abilities
2824367 we cant wait to see how many people show up for next years event
2824368 were just getting started on the actual field work taking pictures and taking notes of information supplied on the grave sites but there was a lot of preplanning involved and lot of paperwork to go through
2824369 its been a year in the works as there were many documents and records on the families to go through
2824370 thats a lot more than most people would have thought
2824371 brock is a great kid and this is going to be a great service to the people of the community especially those interested in family histories and lineage
2824372 those helicopters all had air or first class mail on them so it had to be delivered faster than what the trains could do
2824373 that was your most expensive mail and people paid extra for it
2824374 that helicopter had other drops other than in wheeler park but im not positive about that
2824375 my memory is not one of my stronger things these days
2824376 you strapped a bag on your shoulder and you took off
2824377 near the tail end of my time there you could drive your car to certain spots deliver the mail and then go back to your car
2824378 but the education no one can ever take that away from you
2824379 if i wasnt doing the right things in the classroom then i wouldnt be able to compete
2824380 when i ran the races and beat the other kids i thought ooh i like this
2824381 reading and learning and education has not stopped for me since kindergarten
2824382 if youre passionate about something and you love to do it share it with others
2824383 russia has show itself capable of crossing every line in this conflict
2824384 we are willing to do cease fire immediately providing the other side stops to shoot and to bomb
2824385 only if georgia withdraws all armed forces from the conflict zone and immediately signs a non aggression pact with south ossetia
2824386 this walk means that dads efforts and his vision are being recognized and that means everything
2824387 he chaired the riverfront committee and he was the energy behind multiyear projects
2824388 he asked me to go to a kiwanis meeting with him i felt that anyone he was involved with had to be ok he was such a great guy
2824389 chelsea was into art as soon as she could hold a pencil or a crayon
2824390 we students all have a theme and mine is wasteful greed
2824391 my watercolor is about deforestation which really moves me i wanted to show the beauty of trees they grow for hundreds of years and we cant just cut them down we cant completely stop deforestation but we should be conscious of it and try to preserve what we have left
2824392 we wanted to recognize very talented students in the area
2824393 and we wanted to put them in with practicing artists high school students do it for themselves their work is very honest and if the subject is a littler edgy thats ok
2824394 from the time he was 3 he started to fish with my grandfather at this lake
2824395 within hours after we got the news we knew we wanted to do something
2824396 its just a fun thing to get the kids outside its all catch and release
2824397 he was the best man at my wedding he was the person that kept the peace but we always had a good time he would have given the shirt off his back for any one of his guys
2824398 he loved kids he used to brag about my kids like they were his own
2824399 fishing hunting he was just a great kid all around
2824400 we keep on bumping into it when we talk about development in certain corners of town or in the comprehensive plan or when something is proposed
2824401 there might be a perception that is different from reality
2824402 people want to see the same thing across from their house
2824403 whats the use of 300 a month housing if you cant afford 4 a gallon gas to get to work
2824404 and you are going to have to dump 100 000 into it
2824405 a lot of this will be about rental for some people their money would be better spent raising their families than paying a mortgage but that concept is foreign to us
2824406 the whole idea is to mix it together like gumbo in a pot and see what happens
2824407 its unique its a way to see elgin in a different light
2824408 were hoping for a positive response people have to be down here to make it a reality
2824409 its a wonderful idea ive been in a lot of businesses in downtown elgin theres a great variety
2824410 each of us have our own style and performances you can actually pack a lot into 10 minutes of theater we really think elgin has the best of the urban like chicago and suburban environment its a hidden gem
2824411 these are people who dont know how to do what they need to do and are not getting the message
2824412 what were hoping is their friends or family or caregiver or a neighbor does have access and is checking it for them
2824413 the irs also set up an 800 number to walk people through the process
2824414 it is going to be a festive setting for athletic events
2824415 this belongs to the community and we want to make sure they can touch and feel all of it
2824416 its got such dedicated fans it has to be a wonderful trail
2824417 we didnt buy our house because of the prairie path but we have come to know what a joy it was to have it nearby
2824418 we have seen all sorts of activities on the prairie path it gets a lot of use all of it positive
2824419 its been very rewarding to see how important the prairie path has become because trails werent really a big deal when we got started
2824420 but nowadays its extremely important in this age of air pollution and congestion and getting people around
2824421 just the other day i was riding and i had to stop because a fawn was nursing in the middle of the trail where else are you going to see that and if i run out of water or an energy bar ill ride through a town a few miles later its just great
2824422 may watts spoke at my garden club shortly after the letter was published and she was getting a little famous from it
2824423 we consider the publication of the letter the birth of the prairie path thats when everyone started working on it anyway
2824424 word on the prairie path maybe thats how they find us
2824425 we dont have really big signs so id say the prairie path helps a lot
2824426 thats one of the long term visions if you will of the forest preserve to provide the linkage to the forest preserves and connectivity to the communities as well
2824427 right now you can go from a forest preserve in elmhurst to one in warrenville without ever going on roads and the prairie path serves as that link
2824428 they couldnt take it away now its too big a part of the city its that way for a lot of people
2824429 just everywhere out here laid out on the ground they are bloody
2824430 we thought it would be better for him to get on the bus because its a far drive
2824431 now he keeps saying that he should have driven himself
2824432 the doom and gloom stories are getting old for everybody
2824433 which is kind of contrary to what you hear in the marketplace
2824434 we are centrally located in the county and we have very high traffic volumes and shopper volumes
2824435 with the demographics we have it works well for them to locate in our community
2824436 i couldnt go anywhere and get what i wanted to eat
2824437 when the chain can also layer in excitement through new or limited time offerings they help create an environment where consumers want to come back
2824438 need to bring new strategies and tactics to the table
2824439 theyre making room for new concepts and people want new concepts
2824440 when we started this whole journey the economy wasnt where it is now
2824441 we want it to be a healthy alternative some place wed like to go
2824442 there used to be lots of petty stealing but its much better now and the gipsies who were camped around here have gone thank god
2824443 before things change you have to have a dead body
2824444 but it wont be so bad if we get into a new era of discipline
2824445 all our problems come from foreigners getting drunk smashing windows and stealing
2824446 mussolini had his positive side the streets were safe in his day
2824447 send them to the country or send them somewhere they are dirty and there are lots of problems with burglary and thieving they make toxic smoke
2824448 i dont like the police outside our camp or the military presence on our streets
2824449 there is some petty crime committed by gipsies because our people are poor but we are not all criminals
2824450 the leftists arent able to understand this fear of crime because they have an ideological prejudice against law and order
2824451 these things were done in the fascist days when gipsies were killed or sent to concentration camps
2824452 the politicians should remember that we are human not garbage
2824453 portray obama as having a limited connection to basic american values and culture
2824454 i lament the loss of a ferociously funny and hard core family man my thoughts are with his wife rhonda and their family bernie mac you are already missed
2824455 one of the best and funniest comedians to ever live but that was the second best thing he did bernie was one of the greatest friends a person could have
2824456 losing him is like losing 12 people because he absolutely filled up any room he was in im gonna miss the mac man
2824457 he was also an attentive husband a great father and loving grandfather
2824458 i feel blessed to have shared years of friendship with bernie mac and im honored to have finally co starred with him in what i consider to be his finest cinematic acting achievement
2824459 a brother a friend and one of the comic masters of our time sharing the marquee with him during the phenomenon of the kings of comedy tour bonded us like family and created a unique moment in comic history marking some of the most meaningful memorable and fun times of our lives
2824460 his comedic approach was his own brand and will definitely stand the test of time the level of his talent always inspired me and other comedians to bring their a game i promise you that you never wanted to be the guy who had to follow bernies set
2824461 bernie mac was the personification of the word real he kept it real
2824462 that kind of genuine spirit that he carried all time cannot be easily duplicated but i will do my very best to try
2824463 the soulsville foundation which operates the stax museum of american soul music stax music academy and the soulsville charter school is so deeply saddened by the passing of isaac hayes that we are in state of shock

2824476 mobile navigation caught on in europe in 2003 and the us followed in 2006 it is now asia pacifics turn
2824477 even after our maps were available on yahoo it was difficult to prove that good maps existed and indians will actually want to pay for navigation
2824478 it is like selling shoes on an island where everyone is used to being barefoot if you are able to sell the concept you have a huge untapped market
2824479 we have seen a very good start for personal navigation devices since we introduced them with high end cars in december last year after security system it is the best selling electronic gadget in high end cars
2824480 you can compare it to cameras most of us still pack a digital camera on our holiday even though we are carrying our cellphones equipped with a camera
2824481 to begin with we are restricted to giving driving instructions later when operators join in we could combine navigation features with location based services to come up with ads according to the area you are currently in
2824482 the non therapeutic use of genes genetic elements and or cells that have the capacity to enhance athletic performance
2824483 one of the concerns in india is the cost of owning and maintaining combat fighters over their lifetime the f a 18e f super hornet offers a very attractive life cycle cost dynamic since the fighter wont need a scheduled visit to a maintenance depot until it has clocked a minimum of 6 000 hours of flying time
2824484 we are a multi divisional multi location company with strong individual databases for each department and more than 80 of our data was stored on multiple database servers
2824485 we recently acquired uniflex cables and formed a joint venture jv with chematek each acquisition or jv resulted in new databases becoming part of the it system
2824486 we used to spend most of our technically productive time in identifying particular components of data that are vital at a given point of time
2824487 the entire implementation comes pre connected and ready to use so at the deployment location the time taken to get it up and running is negligible after deploying the eva cataloguing sorting storing as well as retrieval has become swift and smooth
2824488 it gives us a unified view of our storage infrastructure and can scale up without any performance issues
2824489 immediately after installing them we have experienced an increase in the performance of our systems

2824501 help comfort and hope after losing your baby in pregnancy or the first year
2824502 if you use the potential of this phase and consciously grant yourself time for this intense process youll come out of this terrible experience as a transformed more mature perhaps more spiritual person closer to your true nature
2824503 holy cow how strong do i have to be ive already lived and survived and grown because of my fair share of bs even before losing my baby i was strong and spiritual and transformed i already was a survivor of enough other sh arrrghhh

2824513 i thought it would have been a great nod to our western heritage and we could talk about western values as we move forward
2824514 were really stuck with the idea that we want to look progressive and modern and cosmopolitan but we also want to play up our romantic past
2824515 in 1908 denver was trying to have it both ways
2824516 i think thats part of our civic psychology its deep in our civic dna
2824517 were trying to show off the kind of flavor of what the west has to offer
2824518 the fact is our economy now is extremely diversified resilient and contemporary
2824519 people assume an international cosmopolitan image is at variance with the notion of being a cow town
2824520 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2824521 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2824522 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2824523 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2824524 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2824525 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2824526 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2824527 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2824528 la labor del banco central deber contribuir a estabilizar las expectativas inflacionarias de 2009 aunque los mercados financieros locales empiezan a digerir la idea de que una inflaci n de 4 0 por ciento en ese a o no es una mala noticia
2824529 ello es un alivio confirmando que las mayores presiones inflacionarias son de corto plazo

2824532 sesungguhnya allah dan malaikat malaikat nya bershalawat untuk nabi hai orang orang yang beriman bershalawatlah kamu untuk nabi dan ucapkanlah salam penghormatan kepadanya
2824533 shalawat allah adalah pujian nya terhadap nabi shallallaahu alaihi wa salam di sisi para malaikat sedangkan shalawatnya malaikat berupa doa
2824534 shalawat dari rabb adalah rahmat nya dan shalawat malaikat adalah permohonan ampun
2824535 shalawat dari allah bermakna rahmat dan ampunan sedang shalawat dari malaikat serta orang mukmin makna nya adalah doa
2824536 barang siapa bershalawat terhadapku sekali maka allah akan bershalawat kepadanya sepuluh kali
2824537 barang siapa bershalawat atasku satu kali maka allah akan bershalawat kepadanya sepuluh kali shalawat menghapus darinya sepuluh keburukan dan mengangkatnya sebanyak sepuluh derajat
2824538 apabila kamu mendengarkan muadzin maka ucapkanlah seperti apa yang ia ucapkan kemudian bershalawatlah kepadaku karena barang siapa yang bershalawat atasku sekali saja maka allah akan bershalawat kepadanya sepuluh kali kemudian mintakanlah untukku al wasilah sesungguhnya ia adalah kedudukan di surga yang tidak layak kecuali hanya untuk seorang hamba dari hamba hamba allah dan aku berharap agar hamba tersebut adalah aku barang siapa yang meminta kepada allah al wasilah untukku maka berhak atasnya syafaat
2824539 perbanyaklah shalawat atasku pada hari jumat karena ia disaksikan dan para malaikat pun menyaksikan dan sungguh tidaklah seseorang bershalawat atasku kecuali akan diperlihatkan kepadaku shalawatnya hingga ia selesai darinya
2824540 termasuk hari hari kalian yang utama adalah hari jumat pada hari itu adam diciptakan dan diwafatkan pada hari itu ditiup sangkakala dan terjadi suara keras yang mematikan maka perbanyak lah shalawat atasku pada hari itu sesungguhnya shalawat kalian diperlihatkan kepadaku
2824541 perbanyaklah shalawat kepadaku pada hari jumat karena shalawat dari umatku diperlihatkan pada tiap tiap hari jumat barang siapa yang lebih banyak shalawatnya kepadaku maka ia lebih dekat kedudukannya dariku
2824542 sungguh merugi seseorang yang disebutkan diriku disisinya namun tidak bershalawat atasku
2824543 barang siapa melupakan meninggalkan shalawat terhadapku maka akan tersalah dari jalan surga
2824544 orang bakhil adalah orang yang diriku disebut di sisinya namun tidak bersha lawat kepadaku
2824545 wahai rasulullah sungguh aku akan memperbanyak shalawat atasmu maka seberapa banyak kujadikan doaku untuk bershalawat kepadamu
2824546 terserah kamu dan jika engkau menambah maka itu lebih baik bagimu
2824547 terserah kamu dan jika kamu menambah maka itu lebih baik bagimu
2824548 terserah kamu dan jika kamu menambahnya maka itu lebih baik bagimu
2824549 kini telah cukup keinginan dan kesungguhanmu dan allah mengampuni dosa dosamu
2824550 saya mendengar rasulullah shallallaahu alaihi wa salam berkhutbah dan bersabda
2824551 barang siapa yang bershalawat kepadaku sekali maka malaikat senantiasa bershalawat kepadanya selagi ia masih bershalawat kepadaku maka seorang hamba boleh menyedikitkan atau memperbanyaknya
2824552 setiap doa terhalang sehingga diucapkan shala wat atas muhammad dan keluarga muhammad
2824553 sesungguhnya doa terhenti di antara langit dan bumi ia tidak naik sama sekali sehingga disam paikan shalawat kepada nabimu shallallaahu alaihi wa salam
2824554 sesungguhnya allah menyukai orang orang yang berperang di jalan nya dalam barisan yang teratur seakan akan mereka seperti suatu bangunan yang tersusun kokoh
2824555 kebenaran yang tidak terorganisir akan dikalahkan oleh kebathilan yang terorganisir
2824556 namun demikian allah pula lah yang mempunyai kehendak atas hamba nya
2824557 hidup ini patut kita hayati bagaimana kita mau menang kalau kita tidak berjuang lebih dulu
2824558 kita dapat menjadi manusia sepenuhnya tanpa berhenti menjadi wanita sepenuhnya
2824559 dengan ini aku mengharap dengan sangat agar anda menjadi saksi bahwa kafilah ini dengan semua muatannya berikut kendaraan dan perlengkapannya ku persembahkan di jalan allah azza wajalla
2824560 sungguh kulihat diriku seandainya aku mengangkat batu niscaya kutemukan di bawahnya emas dan perak
2824561 moga moga allah memberkati anda isteri dan harts anda tunjukkanlah letaknya pasar agar aku dapat berniaga
2824562 harta abdurrahman bin auf halal lagi bersih dan memakan harta itu membawa selamat dan berkat
2824563 seluruh penduduk madinah berserikat dengan abdurrahman bin auf pada hartanya sepertiga dipinjamkannya kepada mereka sepertiga lagi dipergunakannya untuk membayar hutang hutang mereka dan sepertiga sisanya diberikan dan dibagi bagikannya kepada mereka
2824564 mushab bin umeir telah gugur sebagai syahid ia seorang yang jauh lebih baik daripadaku ia hanya mendapat kafan sehelai burdah jika ditutupkan ke kepalanya maka kelihatan kakinya dan jika ditutupkan kedua kakinya terbuka kepalanya demikian pula hamzah yang jauh lebih baik daripadaku ia pun gugur sebagai syahid dan di saat akan dikuburkan hanya terdapat baginya sehelai selendang telah dihamparkan bagi kami dunia seluas luasnya dan telah diberikan pula kepada kami hasil sebanyak banyaknya sungguh kami khawatir kalau kalau telah didahdukan pahala kebaikan kami
2824565 rasulullah saw telah wafat dan tak pernah beliau berikut ahli rumahnya sampai kenyang makan roti gandum apa harapan kita apabila dipanjangkan usia tetapi tidak menambah kebaikan bagi kita
2824566 seandainya seorang asing yang belum pernah mengenalnya kebetulan melihatnya sedang duduk duduk bersama pelayan pelayannya niscaya ia tak akan sanggup membedakannya dari antara mereka
2824567 demi allah daripada aku menerima jabatan tersebut lebih balk ambil pisau lain taruh ke atas leherku kemudian kalian tusukkan sampai tembus ke sebelah
2824568 aku pernah mendengar rasulullah saw bersabda bahwa anda adalah orang yang dipercaya oleh penduduk langit dan dipercaya pula oleh penduduk bumi
2824569 sesungguhnya aku khawatir dipisahkan dari shahabat shahabatku karena kekayaanku yang melimpah ruah
2824570 the good news is that we are seeing stability across it positions as a whole with no further significant drops since the beginning of the year in fact an increase in networking positions is a positive sign that infrastructure projects are still going ahead
2824571 having some sense of job stability was often at the forefront of an employees job hunting criteria so these results perhaps indicate a change of values
2824572 crucial to community growth and maintenance and must be tuned continuously
2824573 our basic mobile strategy is making sure all of our products work on mobile devices so its a step in that direction
2824574 the service builds on the google languages application programming interface which we made public around a year ago so the only bit we built specially was the iphone interface its a tool anyone could build but we built it to integrate with the other google products for the iphone
2824575 we spent most of last night working on a fix for a worm which was targeting people on facebook and placing messages on walls urging users to view a video that pretends to be hosted on a google or youtube web site
2824576 less than 002 percent of people on facebook have been affected all of whom we notified and suggested steps to remove the malware
2824577 if we get a report of a bug or a hole from a user a security researcher a reporter blogger or anyone we check it out and fix it as quickly as possible
2824578 in fact we appreciate it when help comes our way from the many security experts and organizations out there
2824579 coreflood has managed to stay under the radar pretty effectively since 2004 with very few details available online about its activity in that time
2824580 explanation of what problems were identified and give the applicant a chance to respond to that
2824581 vendors need to name their products theres no question about that and theres unfortunately product specific taxonomy but broad terms like cloud computing those are canvasses that we should all be able to paint our piece of the mural on
2824582 the application was to protect the use of the term cloud computing as it relates specifically to our offering
2824583 at the time when we announced our solution it was not quite as pervasive a term we sought to protect our intellectual property and we certainly respect the intellectual property of other people and would not infringe on that of others
2824584 design of computer hardware for use in data centers and mega scale computing environments for others
2824585 consulting services for data centers and mega scale computing environments in the fields of design selection implementation customization and use of computer hardware and software systems for others
2824586 if you have a federal registration it gives you some legal presumptions and benefits you dont have otherwise
2824587 youre presumed the nationwide exclusive owner of the goods that you have marks registered for
2824588 were an enabler for the cloud computing businesses so wed have a hard time talking about the space were in and the specific product we deliver
2824589 rather than thinking about what a customer needs marketers have to think long and hard about the words they use what a waste of time
2824590 this commitment allows us to meet the needs of a wide range of users from open source enthusiasts to demanding enterprise clients
2824591 its been a long haul and were all eager to get the lhc research program under way
2824592 has to be accurate to within a fraction of a nanosecond
2824593 mobile satellite services have the tremendous advantage of being able to cover most of the eus territory thereby reaching millions of eu citizens across borders
2824594 they represent an unprecedented opportunity for all europeans to access new communication services and this not only in metropolitan areas but also in rural and less populated regions however these satellite services depend on substantial investment and therefore need simple and swift procedures as well as long term legal certainty
2824595 i expect intense competition among operators offering satellite based communication services reaching consumers from the north of sweden to the south of spain
2824596 this could pave the way for first satellite launches already in the course of 2009
2824597 if your company did not specifically or directly notify affected consumers of the opportunity to opt out please explain why this was not done
2824598 yahoo has a long history of providing clear notice to our users via our privacy policy and is always exploring additional avenues for enhanced notice
2824599 consumers have and continue to respond strongly to internet products and services that are customized to their interests
2824600 yahoo strongly believes that consumers want choice when customizing their online experience and they have also demonstrated a strong preference for advertising that is more personally relevant to them
2824601 bloggers or families who want to occasionally post content are generally subsidized by the advertising business model through free or reduced cost hosting and also through the ability to have text graphical and even video ads appear on the site
2824602 this ability to make money while sharing views increases the number of viewpoints that can be taken in public debates and surely enriches our public conversation as a nation and as a global society
2824603 no one is saying that there cant be targeted marketing
2824604 but individual users should have the right to decide what information can be collected and how it can be used for online targeting
2824605 till we do that we cant deliver the pumps to our customers
2824606 i believe its the first time that a land holder has voluntarily given up land around 20 hectares of land to preserve a cultural heritage site had it fenced off and allow access by traditional owners
2824607 today we had a rs 10 000 crore auction there is another rs 6 000 crore auction in the middle of the month and even if we assume market stabilisation scheme mss auctions of rs 15 000 crore through the auctions outflows only add up to rs 31 000 crore
2824608 would i be comfortable saying this to the persons face
2824609 sch n ist das ja aber wer braucht das und wie soll das durch die ems durch
2824610 who do you think was the most admirable of the american founding fathers and why
2824611 the management called the meeting to convince the lecturers not to strike
2824612 the meeting is hot i doubt whether muasa will bend towards the side of the luboobis
2824613 he has told a lie the president gave us the money and we cleared the debts thats why they gave us back the land titles
2824614 hon nandala mafabi is a young man who went to parliament under the movement government there was no parliament before when you see somebody fighting the movement there must be something wrong with that person
2824615 when somebody does not want all these things then what does he want
2824616 i did not want to talk about hon nandala mafabi but he was the one who started telling lies in broad day light
2824617 if you had not voted the nrm in 1996 2001 and in 2006 i dont know what uganda would look like
2824618 running a country is like cooking you have to have enough cooking stones the movement has ever since had three cooking stones that have made the country stable for the last 22 years
2824619 i have been in government for the last 22 years the government has bituminised arua road tirinyi and rukungiri roads but i have not bituminised the road to rwakitura and i am not poor at all there is wealth in dust so i do not want this politics of diverting our people
2824620 we do think there are many witnesses because at that time around 7 p m there were a lot of people in the park or in the surroundings of the park
2824621 there were also people who were part of the altercation and many people playing sports or just sitting in the park
2824622 were talking about the death of a man its a major investigation
2824623 those who have had the honour of knowing master cpl roberts describe him as the embodiment of a brother in the truest sense of the world
2824624 truth honour and loyalty were not mere words to josh but the unspoken creed which he lived his life by
2824625 sadly the sun has set on the life of another true canadian son dear friend and soldier let us never forget his sacrifice
2824626 josh was a soldier he had always wanted to be a soldier and he loved what he did
2824627 he felt strongly in what he was doing and the family is hopeful canadians will understand and appreciate the sacrifice josh has made for all canadians and the sacrifice of all families of military personnel serving in afghanistan
2824628 hes the kind of guy we would describe as a soldiers soldier and i know thats a coined phrase but in actual fact he was one of those real guys
2824629 always carrying his share and more and always looking out for his buddies and comrades any which way quite often they may not have realized it but he was looking after them one way or another
2824630 they certainly took their unwanted tvs computers and monitors to the recycling centres
2824631 what were asking is for people to think because if theyre still good then we can reformat them and recondition them
2824632 we are very supportive of the electronics products stewardship canada program were glad that theyre doing this we just want people to think of reusing them first
2824633 the implementation of policies to allow qualified men and women to serve openly regardless of sexual orientation
2824634 it wasnt impacted by anything it was just in the course of him performing some operations that he went down
2824635 i dont know of any pre existing medical conditions that could have contributed to this tragic accident
2824636 im sure that all of our all of our guys are having a rough time with it

2824680 in the great metropolis of the young australian nation those young people were a sign of authentic joy sometimes noisy but always peaceful and positive
2824681 despite their large number they did not cause disorder or any damage to have fun they did not need to engage in raucous or violent acts nor rely on alcohol and drugs
2824682 how can one not contrast them to their peers who searching for false escapism consume degrading experiences that sometimes result in tragedy
2824683 in this way the spirit does not rest the heart does not experience joy but in fact ends up being more exhausted and sad than before

2824708 jesus is instructed to watch israels house and not leave the place while the master goes away on a tour to collect clothes to be dyed but no sooner has israel left the house than jesus runs out with the boys terian says
2824709 the most amazing part of the story of the nine year old jesus playing a form of cricket with the boys at the sea shore is that he would go on playing the game on water over the sea waves
2824710 he jesus would take the boys to the seashore and carrying the playing ball and the club he would go over the waves of the sea as though he was playing on a frozen surface hitting the playing ball

2824725 they seem to have gone beyond the logical stopping point
2824726 there will probably be guerilla warfare all over the country
2824727 but the russians are not letting them withdraw they are pursuing them and people are seeing this
2824728 this is not about military objectives this is about a political objective removing a thorn in their side
2824729 at midnight last night we got from the russians that they would welcome a call from saakashvili

2824742 what we have to do is withdraw our money i thought all along we should be loaning them money we could have insisted at the outset on grants not gifts as long as were prepared to stay there theyre not going to defend themselves as long as were using our money theyre not going to use theirs
2824743 i think we should have drilled in anwar a long time ago
2824744 it doesnt sound good to me im suspect of it
2824745 the right wing doesnt like me so im sure ill have an opponent each way

2824748 i think its going to be a great opportunity to buy chinese shares because the long term growth will be there china is going to grow probably three times as fast as the global average
2824749 in the short term there are a lot of headwinds
2824750 i dont think china should go back to the 11 to 12 percent rate thats overheated
2824751 this slowdown should help china to sustain growth for the longer term
2824752 a slowdown in the u s and especially a global slowdown will hit china
2824753 growth hasnt fallen off a cliff its holding up reasonably well but moderating thats true in corporate earnings as well as the macro economy
2824754 does an increase in the inflation rate cause government officials to clamp down on the kinds of reforms that have so benefited chinas economy

2824770 truth is strangebedfellows was neither it was typical and it was partisan and it will not have the intended impact

2824777 in north america you really go to the net hard and coaches preach that from a young age
2824778 crashing the net going to the net staying in on rebounds
2824779 here any type of contact with a goaltender as slight as it may be results in a penalty its just a little bit different mindset
2824780 we reopened up the entire eighteen holes on the thirtieth wednesday the thirtieth just in time to get our biggest tournament of the year our member guest in and that was a huge success
2824781 without them this place would have been closed for weeks

2824789 we won an espy we won a bcs bowl from a mid major conference and the things we did i am still just processing
2824790 we went from being nobodies to being recognized in airports and people asking us for autographs it was something that as a kid i could never have imagined it was a dream i lived
2824791 it was the first time that i felt a school wanted me as much as i wanted them
2824792 its almost a blessing that these schools passed on me even though its not the ideal way i wouldve liked it to happen its the best thing that could have happened to me
2824793 my parents taught me to be a sponge of those around you and i took in from all the running backs
2824794 i learned as much as i could from those guys and then it came to a point where they needed one person who had all the ability and that was me because i was able to sit back and learn from all these guys who had done it for four or five years
2824795 after that game i think the one thing we really learned about ian was that he was a lot faster than we thought
2824796 he was able to run away from some guys who we thought were really good players on oregon states defense and he just pulled away from them
2824797 he may not have the best 40 yard dash but on the field hes going to run away from guys and that is the type of player you need so his success wasnt a surprise
2824798 we put on the backburner anything negative said about us
2824799 we just said play our game and dont let the game be bigger than what it is
2824800 but i always believe we deserve to be where we are the feeling around the whole team was that we worked hard weve earned this and this is where we deserve to be
2824801 i was just hoping not to trip or fall down at the one yard line and be that guy who lost the game
2824802 i believe i have a lot to offer and a very good chance at making it to the next level
2824803 i know i have to go out and produce for another year but i feel like if i go out and have another stellar year it will only help my chances to make it to the next level which is definitely a dream of mine and something i really want to do
2824804 i think its a shame that character is so rare to find
2824805 i always see so much negative stuff and its so sad that people say youre one of the good guys when i grew up there was nothing but good guys but i am glad i followed that trend
2824806 hes a great running back hes real patient and waits for the holes to open up i think his game will translate well because hes a good back and hell prove himself at the nfl level
2824807 its one of the things that was never in my mind until this summer
2824808 i am so excited because i will be able to graduate and be done and i am just excited for all the options and opportunities in front of me i just want to hit it running and give my best effort for everything laid in front of me including the nfl
2824809 yes this is what im supposed to be doing with my life

2824857 some of the isps decided to nullroute so we changed ip so it works for them now some other decided to block the domain name so we added

2824860 historically typewriters have been an issue because their parts can be turned into weapons
2824861 is very heavy and could be used as a club
2824862 its disappointing that the department of corrections could not have found a middle ground that protected inmate safety while allowing some access to typewriters
2824863 inmate restrictions should be linked to actual and demonstrable safety risks especially when they affect a fundamental right such as access to the court system
2824864 the ban on typewriters was implemented for safety and security
2824865 and is in no way intended to affect inmate litigation

2824881 sejak kecil saya sudah diajarkan untuk memberi persepuluhan bagi saya ini sudah menjadi disiplin yang ditanamkan begitu kuat oleh keluarga saya ingin bersaksi bahwa saat ini beberapa orang terkaya di solo bertanya pada pada pak obaja pendeta gereja keluarga allah di solo ayah dari pak jo proyek gereja begitu besar dari mana uangnya dari bantuan luar negeri pak obaja berkat bukan pak bukan dari luar negeri tapi dari luar angkasa dari tingkap tingkap langit yang dibukakan dan darinya dicurahkan berkat damai sejahtera dari tuhan jadi segala percepatan gereja termasuk gereja keluarga allah di jogjakarta berasal dari tuhan yang melihat ketaatan hati untuk memberi selalu kepada gereja kesaksian yang baru pertama kali disaksikan oleh pak jonathan yaitu bahwa dari 100 berkat yang dia peroleh sejak delapan tahun yang lalu dia serahkan 80 nya kepada tuhan ini dia saksikan pada jemaat bukan untuk gagah gagahan melainkan agar jemaat bisa belajar dari pengalaman dia 10 dari 80 itu dia gunakan untuk persepuluhan dan 70 untuk kegiatan sosial membantu gereja lain dan pendeta lain jadi dengan 20 pun tuhan tetap memberkati dia hingga sekarang ini komitmen dia dari sejak awal
2824882 kesaksian pak jo bahwa ia dulu pernah merasakan listriknya diputus karena tidak mampu bayar biaya listrik juga sempat suatu malam memutuskan untuk tidak makan sebelum seseorang pelayan tanpa mengetahui hal itu menelpon dan mengajaknya makan puji tuhan banyak orang yang tidak percaya akan hal ini tapi itu benar benar terjadi

2824910 i thought it was disappointing that part when he was pointing his finger at fitzy
2824911 i thought he showed him no respect and if anyone deserve respect its him
2824912 fitzy doesnt normally question the referees unless its deserved or whether he feels pretty passionately about the call because hes a passionate person fitzy
2824913 i think it goes both ways you look at hodges getting suspended for a couple of weeks for showing disrespect
2824914 we just didnt get a chance there we lost every 50 50 so added all together with our lacklustre energy we deserved to be beaten by a mile i reckon
2824915 im not going to spend the whole time talking about the referee but it was disappointing
2824916 but who doesnt want to see south africans and new zealanders beat each other up in sub zero temperatures while an egg shaped abomination bounces around at awkward angles nobody going once twice three times i
2824917 i just want to sleep on it and talk to jordan and see how hes feeling
2824918 its just not a normal situation the boys only 16 years old and its easy to say yeah i want to play weve just got to make sure hes 100 per cent ready
2824919 hes just young hes a boy and its a mans game so ive just got to make sure im comfortable in my mind that im not doing the wrong thing by him
2824920 ill have a chat with him over the next 24 hours and well make a decision tomorrow
2824921 i dont think i wouldve been ready for it at 16
2824922 i dont think i was ready for it at 18 so i am sure we will send some blokes at him and see how he goes
2824923 any three wins in a row would be sensational because we havent done that since ive been here at the knights and that for obvious reasons would help with confidence
2824924 but who doesnt want to see south africans and new zealanders beat each other up in sub zero temperatures while an egg shaped abomination bounces around at awkward angles nobody going once twice three times i
2824925 oh joe with your crazy super heroes and whatnot that have little to no meaning
2824926 during the week we were all pretty honest with ourselves as players and pretty much conceding that weve been letting each down over the last few weeks
2824927 regardless of whether we won or lost today i was very proud with the way the boys played and stuck together as a team
2824928 one good game doesnt really count for much youve got to do it every week
2824929 it was huge they made a break up the middle hes made that tackle and then hes turned up on the line
2824930 hes phenomenal hes been tremendous all year for us and what he did in that last five minutes is just indicative of his whole season the way he just keeps turning up and tries his heart out every week
2824931 we just didnt get a chance there we lost every 50 50 so added all together with our lacklustre energy we deserved to be beaten by a mile i reckon
2824932 but who doesnt want to see south africans and new zealanders beat each other up in sub zero temperatures while an egg shaped abomination bounces around at awkward angles nobody going once twice three times i
2824933 we had a cracker of a break there was a bit of stuff going on
2824934 so we sat down and thought right we can keep going through the rest of the year toing and froing or we can really set ourselves to make an impact on the year
2824935 its a credit to the boys that theyve turned that around and played some very consistent footy
2824936 we sorted those things out and the whole playing group has been able to redirect the ship in the right direction
2824937 but who doesnt want to see south africans and new zealanders beat each other up in sub zero temperatures while an egg shaped abomination bounces around at awkward angles nobody going once twice three times i
2824938 hally is contracted until the end of 2009 so we dont have any fears about him leaving before that
2824939 i wouldnt think he is seriously entertaining that nfl players are always curious about different things
2824940 but the reality is i am contracted to the swans next year and i intend to fulfil that
2824941 while ill listen to any opportunity for the future my focus is on the swans
2824942 weve been approached by some nfl clubs to talk to barry to see if hes interested in coming over
2824943 but who doesnt want to see south africans and new zealanders beat each other up in sub zero temperatures while an egg shaped abomination bounces around at awkward angles nobody going once twice three times i
2824944 its not a tip sheet its a review of the referees performance which every coach every week gets
2824945 its a review to say yeah this referee got this decision right that referee got that decision wrong
2824946 its more or less a check for them coaches as well to fix up areas in their game that we believe in the debrief came up
2824947 so to call it a tip sheet when it suits you is probably a little bit disappointing
2824948 you can call it what you like but thats not what it is
2824949 the bottom line of it all is the referee on occasion does have issues but so does the discipline of football teams in general
2824950 itd cost me a lot of money if we had have got beaten because i wouldve unloaded
2824951 it refereeing is a tough job but theyre making it tougher for themselves by having these stupid tip sheets
2824952 they pick a couple of little things in the game previously which they so call review and they knit pick their way through a game
2824953 but who doesnt want to see south africans and new zealanders beat each other up in sub zero temperatures while an egg shaped abomination bounces around at awkward angles nobody going once twice three times i
2824954 we now believe the economic weakness in the u s will likely worsen
2824955 i was the one who suggested give herbie a kick
2824956 i feel very very bad about it i had no idea and campo gave me the evil eyes when he walked into the dressing shed
2824957 theres not a real lot to say theres a lot to feel about it
2824958 we all played a part in it attitude thats probably a big part of it
2824959 we talked about having a defensive focus at half time
2824960 if we have got 17 men out there that are willing to work hard for each other and theyre focused on what they need to do then you can get a result and certainly things clicked today
2824961 but who doesnt want to see south africans and new zealanders beat each other up in sub zero temperatures while an egg shaped abomination bounces around at awkward angles nobody going once twice three times i
2824962 when the pressure is on i know that everything i have trained for and practiced for
2824963 when the pressure is on i know that everything i have trained for and practiced for is coming to that point in time
2824964 but who doesnt want to see south africans and new zealanders beat each other up in sub zero temperatures while an egg shaped abomination bounces around at awkward angles nobody going once twice three times i
2824965 you would actually admit to and agree with someone who said your own child is ugly
2824966 recuerden c mo comenz la primera guerra mundial ese escenario puede repetirse en el c ucaso
2824967 im more than happy i did tell them during the week do it on your own time
2824968 be focused and everyone has to be seen that were focusing on the job at collingwood of getting into the finals
2824969 its not good to read in the paper that three of your coaches are being interviewed for jobs
2824970 but i dont mind it happening its just a perception issue and a logistical issue
2824971 i told them i dont want you doing interviews at 12 oclock or one oclock in the afternoon and thats fine thats what happened
2824972 dean laidley was approached by the kangaroos in grand final week
2824973 he came up to me and said i wont go for the interview because were in grand final week and i owe it to the club
2824974 but who doesnt want to see south africans and new zealanders beat each other up in sub zero temperatures while an egg shaped abomination bounces around at awkward angles nobody going once twice three times i
2824975 obviously you arent a responsible parent who cares about those childrens needs just some kind of baby making factory
2824976 you must be a selfish parent who either doesnt trust god enough to take care of your concerns or someone who prefers dollar signs instead of souls
2824977 this subject is too near and dear to my heart to trust my head to engage
2824978 commodities are coming back to earth the stock market looks ok and bernanke is starting to look a little better
2824979 you have to stand back and say for the time being it looks to be a pretty successful combination of moves that have worked
2824980 the labor market is starting to deteriorate and income growth is barely keeping pace with inflation these are all pretty negative omens for whats to come
2824981 this is pretty much what it looks like heading into recession
2824982 its a bad number for the fed this is something that might keep them cutting rates

2825000 our task is clear we must find the means for an immediate ceasefire accepted by both sides
2825001 we must talk about negotiations and a political solution there is no military solution
2825002 we must move quickly this is not a diplomatic exercise its an exercise of survival

2825037 i had grapes plums apricots almonds on the other side of the fence
2825038 they took it away about five years ago they said it was for security
2825039 i used to just prune my trees for a month and a half every year now i get two days access in total
2825040 he and others tried to gain access to the land but he said they were met by armed settlers who turned them away and since then he has become despondent about trying again
2825041 in the last six months not a single request by residents to access their land in the area was denied
2825042 they took away my income when they took my land
2825043 i got the beehives about five months ago and this is the first batch
2825044 i spend my time with the bees i have no land but i have something
2825045 this is a contribution to helping people be self sufficient
2825046 they are in a very vulnerable position because they have lost access to their land have little access to water or have lost their job
2825047 there are lots of rosemary bushes in the settlements and this is good for the honey
2825048 in the winter i want to plant my own rosemary
2825049 we have had lots of water problems in the last three years it wiped us out
2825050 we brought in an expert who found water underground we would have to dig about 30 meters to get the water
2825051 if i had access to the water id invest more in agriculture and give the rest of the water to my neighbors
2825052 too bad i cant get on it it would sink
2825053 it has been pressing since the end of last season
2825054 we like to operate with four strikers and we have not been able to do that
2825055 i cant answer the question because i dont have the right answer
2825056 it is possible i will sign someone this week we are trying and we are looking at one or two options
2825057 wes only missed two games last season and was absolutely outstanding
2825058 it is certainly a dilemma looking at it i dont think gary will play all the time if we get 35 games out of him i would be delighted so wes brown can do a job there
2825059 gary could play in a friendly that would not be a problem because he needs games
2825060 but i would like him to play a few with us before he got to that crucial moment when you get back into international football
2825061 gary had an hour today which was perfect for him
2825062 when you think about the length of time gary has been out for to come back the way he has is remarkable waynes world

2825069 we started well against monaco and it is a shame we have lost because i think we deserved to take at least a point
2825070 we really wanted to start off with a win but we mustnt slacken off
2825071 we are going to work hard to bounce back next saturday when bordeaux visit
2825072 the truths in football are obviously not apparent in the first few matches
2825073 we took him out a little early the other night
2825074 he was getting stiffer and stiffer as the game progressed it was getting hard to get loose he was still throwing great
2825075 were trying to not have this thing get to the point where it did last year
2825076 el mercado institucional ser atendido con medicinas que llevar n el nombre gen rico y no la marca de nuestro laboratorio
2825077 felt good some at bats a little tardy on other ones
2825078 hopefully its going to be best for him because he was having a problem with range of motion of his shoulder
2825079 hes playing and not really being himself as far as swinging the bat maybe this will give him a chance to get some more range of motion and maybe get the old scotty back here
2825080 the rehab is pretty intense digging pretty deep into the shoulder and the capsule trying to loosen up some tissue
2825081 when doing that and trying to play and swing a baseball bat at the same time were kind of counteracting what were doing if we give it time to cool down a little bit and get in there and dig and get after that without having to swing the bat and undo it thats hopefully going to help it recover a little better
2825082 im just going to try and take it easy on him for a while so we dont lose him again
2825083 i wont be stealing any bases but aside from that ill be all right
2825084 maybe it will change here or there but thats where i want him to hit
2825085 he was in that spot before he got hurt and well just put him back in there
2825086 todo el mundo est desmoralizado qui n tiene 3 500 millones de pesos haciendo nada porque esa plata hay que tenerla en el bolsillo no puede estar invertida en nada muchos van a salir del mercado

2825094 en su momento advertimos que no era adecuado que los supermercados entraran a realizar esta intermediaci n pues este es un negocio supremamente sensible y se requiere asesorar a los clientes dado que el mercado es complejo esa asesor a no la daban en la red de fenalco y en todas partes del mundo se entiende que para eso est n los comisionistas
2825095 pero las responsabilidad con los accionistas queda en el aire
2825096 por qu los comisionistas no pusieron una nota de aviso ante la superfinanciera antes de que todo comenzara est n manejando una doble moral porque ahora cuando pasa todo esto se lavan las manos
2825097 son desafortunadas coincidencias que lamentablemente se dieron en el mismo mes pero lo que nosotros vemos como reguladores es que cada vez hay mejores pr cticas dado que cada vez se expulsan o se sancionan menos personas
2825098 estos ex menes de certificaci n no solo miden los conocimientos del operador sino tambi n su condici n tica pues se debe adjuntar el pasado judicial y las sanciones o multas que hayan recibido en el pasado por su actividad en el mercado de valores incluso deben advertir si tienen conflictos de inter s

2825151 you know i was kidding it was the longest eight days of my life
2825152 because it felt like an eternity to me i dont think i could have lasted another day without you
2825153 you can get reacquainted with joel on the trip home
2825154 of course it would have been a bit more enjoyable without carrie counting down the days until we returned she missed you
2825155 thanks again for agreeing to pick us up at the airport
2825156 carrie let the poor young man go so that we can get home
2825157 im tired and there is all the unpacking to do
2825158 i havent seen him in over a week and youre not going
2825159 but that hasnt nothing to do with the way i feel about you
2825160 because this vacation made me realize just how much i love you too
2825161 i even missed the scent of your perfume and shampoo i didnt realized how addicted to them ive become since we started dating
2825162 its getting late and you both have school tomorrow youre father is already in bed
2825163 i love you so much and want to show you
2825164 and god knows i love the way you show it but dont you think its a little dangerous with your parents in the house

2825167 so do you think your big cock is wet enough to squeeze into my tight ass

2825170 right now i want to feel your big cock fill my ass
2825171 it one of the things i like best about you
2825172 i wonder what your parents would think if they saw us like this
2825173 my mother is such a prude that i cant see her allowing anything as big and long as your cock in her ass
2825174 then i guess im lucky i fell in love with you and not her
2825175 because i love the feel of my cock buried in your ass
2825176 that was also some work out my poor legs not to mention my ass
2825177 you know weve been dating a while now and i think our relationship is continuing to grow and strengthen
2825178 every day i think i love you as much as any man could love a woman and then the next day comes and i find that i love you even more
2825179 i think its almost time for another sick day ill have to talk to tara and see when she can get us a room at her uncles hotel again

2825188 temos muita qualidade mas isso tem que aparecer sem a bola devemos ser um time de oper rios com todos se ajudando de maneira compacta quando estamos com a bola preciso jogar

2825193 she is a broken lady but its a good place to be to welcome jesus into your life
2825194 because i usually don t hit the ball hard to right i knew that if i could drive the ball that way i could get it past her
2825195 but it probably really did help us it really brought us together
2825196 are you sure my german isn t of much use here
2825197 i am trying to focus more on performance outcomes doing more analysis justifying things with facts and figures
2825198 as opposed to doing things fast and based on assumptions
2825199 we have to be able to step up to the plate we have to show we can do it
2825200 and in my opinion you have to do better if you can t do better why even make the change
2825201 in some ways it s harder because you re so involved in what they do

2825207 i want to have the ability to have my spouse and or children have these educational benefits because one of my greatest fears about staying in is being able to afford education for them

2825210 that medley relay is the toughest thing to get to be a part of and to be part of that team would be awesome im going to give it my best
2825211 with the rivalry with libby and myself its always great to have that competition in australia its very healthy and it just is maintained in the pool outside of the pool we are great friends and we do go to parties and things with each other so its definitely not anything we take outside of the pool but it is great to have that in the pool it helps us be the fastest in the world
2825212 i was extremely proud of the performance but frustrated we lost
2825213 when we have several gilt edged chances against that type of opposition you have to score them
2825214 the boys worked extremely hard and carried out the game plan so well it took a world class goal to beat us
2825215 we frustrated them to the point they were putting balls out of play but we had to take one of our chances

2825241 in a response from players and fans alike pfc decided now was the time to launch an interactive forum where we can get some fun filled discussions and debates going on
2825242 weve noticed that nobody was commenting on the articles on the official website for whatever reason but a forum provides a more interactive discussion and allows the players and fans alike to start discussion it should be a great experience for all

2825250 were more than capable of doing that obviously the champions league is probably asking too much
2825251 but theres no reason we cant be among the clubs going for a uefa cup place
2825252 there was little point for me in playing in a team playing with one man up front and battling for second balls all the time
2825253 it seemed in most games we were fighting not to lose it was a real struggle
2825254 one of the big factors in me coming here was that the team here want to play football
2825255 there was talk of bolton signing me permanently but there would never have been a choice anyway once newcastle came in
2825256 the key for us will be to get a good start
2825257 obviously weve got a couple of tough trips to begin with but weve also some home games in the first few weeks which are very winnable
2825258 i cant wait to run out at a full st james park the place should be a fortress for us
2825259 not this season perhaps for now id like to play regularly for newcastle and win a regular under 21 place but maybe the season after that
2825260 but being here and playing under a manager like kevin keegan can only help me
2825261 i was at liverpool for seven or eight years i grew up there so to leave for anywhere else is a big change
2825262 but i can see very big similarities between here newcastle and there
2825263 you can judge the size of a football club by its fans and the attitude of the city and the people here to football is so similar to liverpool
2825264 this is a football city its the main topic of conversation everyone has an opinion on it
2825265 but the thing here is that everyone is obsessed with just one club rather than two like in liverpool or manchester
2825266 that the way the ground sits looking down on the town the amount of people walking around in black and white shirts everything about it is big
2825267 kevin keegan is just brilliant to work with as soon as i met him we got on
2825268 even in training he is so positive that players just spark off him its a pleasure to come in every day
2825269 i just cant wait to be in the dressing room before the manager gives his team talk and i walk out at a full st james park
2825270 i always hoped it would happen for me there even as recently as a few months ago having done well at bolton
2825271 but they liverpool have got a lot of players in central areas and the gaffer wanted to strengthen again this summer
2825272 as i say it still needed a good offer for me to want to leave
2825273 give your all every time danny lad and youll always have home in newcastle good luck
2825274 weve done it weve found someone with a bit of flair alot could rest on this lads shoulders next season

2825279 uno de los principales or genes de divisas para argentina son las exportaciones agr colas que tienen precios excepcionales

2825281 enfri ndola de la peor manera por el menor consumo de los que cobran salarios en pesos
2825282 se crecer menos este a o y mucho menos en 2009
2825283 el principal problema de la econom a argentina es la inflaci n y que el gobierno no la reconozca
2825284 el gobierno crea en un organismo estatal que manipula los datos
2825285 la gente trata de cubrirse aumentando los precios el salario subi un 24 en 12 meses pero en esa cifra est impl cita la inflaci n
2825286 esta inflaci n vino por un fuerte incremento de la demanda una oferta estrecha y por los oligopolios que existen
2825287 en argentina estar amos c modos con un 10 de inflaci n aunque ya el 18 ser a aceptable porque el crecimiento genera presiones inflacionarias en la medida en que el gobierno reconozca la inflaci n y dise e un plan contra ella el problema ser a manejable
2825288 veo que el gobierno tras la crisis del campo ha sufrido una ca da muy fuerte en su imagen de ahora y hasta las elecciones legislativas de medio turno de 2009 tratar de recuperarla con m s gasto con subidas de jubilaciones y salarios lo que tendr consecuencias para 2009 porque caer en forma importante el super vit fiscal adem s desaparecer el super vit de cuenta corriente porque crecen las importaciones y los precios de las materias primas no ser n tan favorables

2825330 when we moved here some of our neighbors thought we were amish once the word got out that we were going to farm with horses some of the others probably thought we were crazy
2825331 some people have started to come around and ask what wed charge to cultivate their tobacco with the horses
2825332 with the price of gas i really think theres a growing interest in horses as a supplement to tractors
2825333 we sort of look at the farm as a small country and that we have to balance the exports and imports so that hopefully we come out on the positive side
2825334 we take organic sustenance away from the land when we produce cattle and hay but we try to put back just as much organic value as we take away and ideally put back even more
2825335 the pigs do a really good job of converting brushy areas
2825336 they kind of disc and cultivate the soil for us and we sow grass seed behind they as they go
2825337 theyre leaner and healthier because theyre eating what their bodies were designed for
2825338 when we lived in town we were both stressed out with our jobs always running around and always busy and never getting anywhere

2825364 hes playing and not really being himself as far as swinging the bat maybe this will give him a chance to get some more range of motion and maybe get the old scotty back here
2825365 the rehab is pretty intense digging pretty deep into the shoulder and the capsule trying to loosen up some tissue
2825366 when doing that and trying to play and swing a baseball bat at the same time were kind of counteracting what were doing if we give it time to cool down a little bit and get in there and dig and get after that without having to swing the bat and undo it thats hopefully going to help it recover a little better
2825367 im just going to try and take it easy on him for a while so we dont lose him again
2825368 i wont be stealing any bases but aside from that ill be all right
2825369 maybe it will change here or there but thats where i want him to hit
2825370 he was in that spot before he got hurt and well just put him back in there
2825371 they poked us and stabbed us with the machetes and they were asking for money specifically dollars

2825386 the secretary general is profoundly concerned over mounting tensions in the abkhaz zone of conflict including the bombing of the upper kodori valley and the ongoing military buildup along the security zone
2825387 thats hard to do were just trying to pick up the slack it was a good day all the way around
2825388 we said people have to step up today is a prime example that were capable of doing it
2825389 everything i threw was right over the middle of the plate early on especially in the first inning they were sitting on my slider thats definitely not the way i wanted to come back
2825390 its like a broken record getting behind by a lot early
2825391 i cant remember a clean 1 2 3 first inning its been a while it makes for a long day and a long week
2825392 you get behind and you get the ball up and theyre whacking it
2825393 stemmed from a momentary misunderstanding as to the exact location of the u s mexican border

2825395 theres no line painted in the sand or anything like that
2825396 were working with the mexican government to make sure that this doesnt happen again this cant be happening
2825397 it seems that there are dissimilar versions of what happened and both countries are trying to clarify it together
2825398 law enforcement operations have led from time to time to innocent incursions by both u s and mexican law enforcement personnel and military units into the territory of both nations and in particular along the non demarcated areas of our border

2825400 se ha visto un sentimiento del pueblo boliviano hacia la democracia y un sentimiento de profundizar este proceso de cambio

2825419 whenever bjp is in trouble bomb blasts take place in the country when tehelka issue rocked parliament parliament was attacked jaipur blasts take place when karnataka elections were on and recently when bjps not trust motion was defeated bomb blasts take place in ahmadabad
2825420 why do blasts take place when bjp is in trouble
2825421 we will have to seek how to deal with the amarnath land issue we will definitely make efforts that it is resolved in a manner in which it does not hurt the sentiments of people of jammu as well as people of kashmir
2825422 we will compensate the near and dear ones of those who have been killed those who have suffered grievous injuries will also be compensated
2825423 mukherjee had promised the people during that agitation that he would either get the permit system abolished or sacrifice his life today we seem to have turned a full circle
2825424 they say how can you give land to outsiders in kashmir jammu and kashmir is an integral part of india and whoever raises questions about this issue will have to pay for it
2825425 i am hopeful of a solution more discussions must be held with the agitators at no point regional or communal preferences should not be allowed to take an upper hand
2825426 the problem needs to be resolved we are going back to submit a report for resolving the issue we believe there is a solution
2825427 there are some people with minor injuries so far and there is at least one person unaccounted for
2825428 it was just a tremendous explosion and blew all the windows out of the house just blew the house up and i just managed to get out of there in time

2825430 people in long term relationships sometimes crave excitement and stimulation but dont know how to get it with their partner
2825431 but you can get that in your current relationship by pushing your regular comfort zone
2825432 the anxiety you feel about trying something new mimics what happens when youre with somebody new so if you can create that feeling within the confines of an intimate close trusting relationship you will keep reenergizing what you have
2825433 when you communicate a desire to your partner and ultimately try it youre taking a big risk together
2825434 some couples think everything has to feel perfect or you both have to be in a sexual mood to have sex but if everyone waited for that sex wouldnt happen very often at all
2825435 sex is the one activity a couple has that excludes other people
2825436 my husband always wants to do it but as a new mom im tired all the time
2825437 but when i make the effort i always feel closer to him afterward even if the sex is mediocre it feels like weve come together and nothing can get in the way of our relationship
2825438 doing it sometimes when im not in the mood keeps me geared up for something much hotter other times
2825439 sound that both of you would like to forget as mortifying as a moment like this may be even with someone youve been with for a long time it is a good reminder that sex is a raw discovery channel kind of act its not
2825440 sex is full of smells and sights and sounds its natural
2825441 youre having sex with human bodies and they do funny things sometimes and thats okay
2825442 true intimacy is about being able to feel comfortable and real with each other in awkward embarrassing situations
2825443 when my boyfriend pulled out i had my first queef moment if i can use that word
2825444 wed been together two years by then but we were both stunned and didnt know what to say finally i said whoops and we just carried on i was almost relieved like it was this big hurdle we finally got out of the way and because hey its normal
2825445 my husband and i had the best vacation sex recently in hawaii
2825446 we were on the top floor of the resort so we knew no one was above us to see or hear us and the room had these huge floor to ceiling windows overlooking the ocean it felt like we were having sex outdoors but without the nuisance of the sand going up our butts
2825447 on vacation youre at your most carefree which means you can try new things you wont have to be accountable for at home
2825448 head to a hotel downtown and call it a vacation
2825449 you can look forward to it and build it up beforehand for even better sex
2825450 even acknowledging that you want your partner is important whether or not you follow through
2825451 i love you so much and i want you just saying it out loud that counts for a lot too
2825452 in many ways make up sex restores a level of closeness that you may feel was fractured by the argument
2825453 some people pick fights in order to be able to make up
2825454 it can stimulate those early feelings you had toward someone in the beginning and it reminds you what youre capable of as a couple
2825455 people think the steamy stuff only happens before you are married or pre kids but we are going on 25 years of marriage and still have passionate hot sex
2825456 id just finished cooking dinner and no kids were home when my husband came in he said he was going upstairs to change but as he kissed me it evolved from just talking about the day to sex on the kitchen counter it was totally spontaneous and unexpected
2825457 it requires a lot of intimacy to let your partner see you in the throes of sexual abandon
2825458 when you display that side of yourself you have to deal with questions like
2825459 pasear por el laberinto de chartres es como ir a jerusal n
2825460 shout out a villian you want in the next film and hell be in it

2825471 tropic thunder is an r rated comedy that satirizes hollywood and its excesses and makes its point by featuring inappropriate and over the top characters in ridiculous situations the film is in no way meant to disparage or harm the image of individuals with disabilities

2825488 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2825489 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2825490 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2825491 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2825492 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2825493 this is true with a couple of interesting facts the college of western idaho is funded by tax dollars tvcc is funded with tuition and private enterprise with no tax dollars being used for the caldwell campus their classes with be geared to areas needed in the labor section first ones out of the gate will be welding which is already going on now a joint program with vallivue and tvcc fireman education and nursing are on the horizon tvcc has been going for several years at the mercado in caldwell by larry miller with over 1 500 students the college of western idaho is still struggling to get going and has had to scale back their efforts because they promised to use only a certain per centage of tax dollars they have found it very difficult to get buildings etc ready to go even with an initial infusion of several million dollars from the state to start they are a long ways from being viable the city has been working on tvcc for over 5 years tvcc has been slow to come around because they are an oregon institute and must stand on their own with funds etc in idaho they get no support from idaho tax dollars or from oregon thus they have been test driving the waters for the last several years and are now ready to proceed the biggest drawback we have as to having business locate here is our labor force so this will be a great boost for all i could go on and on but this is probably more than you want to know this is very positive and wont cost you money there is so much demand for this schooling that there is room for both schools and more oh yes the college of idaho is very much in favor of this happening if you want to know more email again and i will give you a call with the rest of the story the guardian is a spin paper that spins stuff to create readership most of it is not accurate or does not explain the whole story
2825494 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2825495 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2825503 patients with ptsd had significantly more difficulty recovering from their injuries and their depression
2825504 that increased attention to treating ptsd as a primary focus in the rehabilitation of patients with chronic pain and comorbid depression is important when prior treatment efforts for pain and depression have not been successful

2825520 below are some highlights of the nearly 4 hour performance
2825521 get a life look around you and what are you doing to make it better
2825522 i really surprised to see the ceremony how u chinese people spent us 1 400 billion in only 1 day as the world is in worst food crises
2825523 a great man shows his greatness by the way he treats little men

2825527 how can we see something true when the chinese government does not support a free and open press to show us the true things
2825528 sure china will come up with a sparkling show that will divert everyone from the problems they are having
2825529 you guys develop too fast and you are using our resources
2825530 its a shame the chinese government is supporting the genocide in dar fur
2825531 how do you say in chinese b o r i n g
2825532 its amazing that these same people slaughtered 51 million of their own in the 1950s and rule over their own people now with a sledge hammer free tibet
2825533 there has been no progress towards fulfilling these promises only continued deterioration
2825534 the authorities have used the olympic games as pretext to continue and in some respects intensify existing policies and practices which have led to serious and widespread violations of human rights
2825535 china really needs to be releasing human rights activists in order to be showing its following through with its promises
2825536 sending a message that it is acceptable for a government to host the olympic games in an atmosphere characterized by repression and persecution
2825537 china is the last country on earth barring myanmar that deserved to be selected to host the olympics shame the ioc didnt wait until the chinese authorities learned to behave in a civilized fashion towards all of their people spectacular display however albeit the soulless regimentation comes over as a bit creepy i wonder how many walmart sweatshop workers got to see it
2825538 you have the right to keep yourself away from any made in china goods and i strongly encourage you to do so if you cant do that just shut your mouth up
2825539 you can do anything you set your mind to when you have vision determination and an endless supply of expendable labor
2825540 wow not a single latino white or black face in the ceremony is diversity a strength as so many pandering politicians parrot as often as possible or is it a neutral ask the chinese would the opening ceremony in beijing have been better if every single performer didnt look just like every other
2825541 even if the last picture is showing a typical family in china what i can see is the spirit in the childrens eyes their joy and pride after watching such an impressive ceremony hosted by their own country
2825542 hey kids cant you read this one is for colored thats for white only thats the one you should use
2825543 boykott og in nations like china its a dictatorship no real human rights
2825544 its a pleasure to welcome friends from far away we chinese ppl welcome all friends from all over the world to come visit china

2825555 absolutely theres a lot of truth to what the president said and in terms of wall street there was too much leverage in the system and more leverage than was appropriate and more than people recognized because the leverage came into the system in the form of highly complex structured products which were difficult to understand
2825556 there is no question about it wall street got drunk
2825557 thats one reason i asked you to turn off your tv cameras
2825558 the question is how long will it take to sober up and not try to do all these fancy financial instruments
2825559 we have of course one priority getting through this period with as little damage as little negative impact as possible on the economy but the second part is to take steps to reduce the likelihood of these sorts of things happening in the future
2825560 i will do everything i can to make for a smooth transition to work closely with my successor in treasury to do everything i can to help out but im focused on getting everything done i can get done between now and january 19th
2825561 we sized that program to say how could we do something that will be meaningful this year but not so big that it would jeopardize some of our long term priorities and our fiscal priorities in balancing the budget so again my view would be lets see how this program works in the third quarter
2825562 an hour with a book would have brought to your mind the secret that took the whole year to find the facts that you learned at enormous expense were all on a library shelf to commence
2825563 radio buttons to respond without having to scroll to those buttons just bugs the hell out of me but i generally put up with it i guess i should learn to be more tolerant in other areas as well
2825564 an hour with a book would have brought to your mind the secret that took the whole year to find
2825565 explanation of what problems were identified and give the applicant a chance to respond to that
2825566 vendors need to name their products theres no question about that and theres unfortunately product specific taxonomy but broad terms like cloud computing those are canvasses that we should all be able to paint our piece of the mural on
2825567 the application was to protect the use of the term cloud computing as it relates specifically to our offering
2825568 at the time when we announced our solution it was not quite as pervasive a term we sought to protect our intellectual property and we certainly respect the intellectual property of other people and would not infringe on that of others

2825573 were an enabler for the cloud computing businesses so wed have a hard time talking about the space were in and the specific product we deliver
2825574 rather than thinking about what a customer needs marketers have to think long and hard about the words they use what a waste of time

2825623 as handheld devices become more like full fledged computers in their own right the question of whether business travelers might be better served by leaving their laptops at home is again being asked by it managers and end users alike but that still appears to be more of a future goal than a current reality

2825628 he opened his eyes on his own and looked at rhonda she called his name and he opened his eyes and nodded to her she smiled at him and told him dont leave me im waiting for you to come back he shrugged his shoulders and she said thats when she knew he was tired he signaled to her that his body was tired
2825629 they tried to resuscitate him two times one time he came back for about an hour then he went into cardiac arrest the second time
2825630 he told his wife non verbally that he could breathe on his own and he wanted the ventilator out he motioned that he wanted it out
2825631 but because he had it his immune system was compromised he had an infection he was on a new medication that suppresses the immune system and thats where the pneumonia came from

2825658 there are more eyes looking over apple products for vulnerabilities
2825659 it has slowly been growing as a target people are more and more interested in
2825660 there are a lot more people getting into it and really getting their hands dirty
2825661 ive been seeing a lot of reverse engineering on the apple platform
2825662 windows developers take their code and make it work on apple
2825663 they could take potential vulnerabilities with them or possibly create new ones because they are working on an entirely different platform
2825664 it shows people are getting proficient at analyzing apple software
2825665 there are people looking at the iphone we pass vulnerabilities on to vendors and when i communicate with apple the first thing they ask is if weve tested it on the iphone they dont want to be surprised
2825666 there are more eyes looking over apple products for vulnerabilities
2825667 it has slowly been growing as a target people are more and more interested in

2825674 he thinks its some kind of game for him im very angry with him ive had a partnership with black hat for three years
2825675 the design of the network was to isolate it from the rest of the public network its not designed to isolate it from one computer in the press room to another computer in the press room
2825676 there are lots of notices that the wi fi network is a hostile network and is actively being monitored
2825677 people are aware that its going on the important distinction is what the expectations are in the media room
2825678 there are more eyes looking over apple products for vulnerabilities

2825686 it has a disproportionate influence on the space in terms of its overwhelming smell the cultural idea of it and the operational problems created by the mess it produces
2825687 but i am saying there is no way in which it fits with the culturally sophisticated brand i wish to sell
2825688 popcorn is a contentious issue lots of people absolutely hate it and have asked us to ban it so were going to do exactly that
2825689 if its a success and ive no reason to suspect it wont be well roll it out across all our cinemas and make it a permanent fixture
2825690 the fact that we are around and there is a place that people can go will give them some confidence
2825691 unfortunately there are some companies that take a dim view of some peoples freedom to tinker
2825692 in my experience the smaller the company the worse they are
2825693 the one thing that theyre looking for is larger accounts that they can clean out
2825694 they havent automated the money transfer part of the process so theyre looking for the biggest accounts to get the most money the quickest
2825695 and thats a conservative estimate of what they could get
2825696 this was only a fraction of the accounts they had stolen
2825697 the fact that theyve been in operation for over six years shows theres not a whole lot of risk to them
2825698 but we need a lot more effort and cooperation to do anything about this
2825699 there are more eyes looking over apple products for vulnerabilities
2825700 it has slowly been growing as a target people are more and more interested in

2825707 those who have had the honour of knowing master cpl roberts describe him as the embodiment of a brother in the truest sense of the world
2825708 truth honour and loyalty were not mere words to josh but the unspoken creed which he lived his life by
2825709 sadly the sun has set on the life of another true canadian son dear friend and soldier let us never forget his sacrifice
2825710 josh was a soldier he had always wanted to be a soldier and he loved what he did
2825711 he felt strongly in what he was doing and the family is hopeful canadians will understand and appreciate the sacrifice josh has made for all canadians and the sacrifice of all families of military personnel serving in afghanistan
2825712 hes the kind of guy we would describe as a soldiers soldier and i know thats a coined phrase but in actual fact he was one of those real guys
2825713 always carrying his share and more and always looking out for his buddies and comrades any which way quite often they may not have realized it but he was looking after them one way or another
2825714 organising something on the scale of the lambeth conference will inevitably result in a small deficit sometimes
2825715 the archbishops council met last week to propose a solution
2825716 too bad i cant get on it it would sink
2825717 this is the first time ive been proud of my country
2825718 for the moment nothing legally would prevent them junta members from running
2825719 but whether the members or the president run it all depends on what the future dictates
2825720 for now we have other problems to surmount and the main one is holding elections as soon as possible
2825721 what he had done risked driving the country toward catastrophe
2825722 he was acting like a dictator like somebody who wants to ruin the nation
2825723 we told him thats not the way to do things the military chiefs have arms and munitions they have men under their command they are responsible for securing the country and you cannot just fire them all like that
2825724 we are a moderate muslim country we dont want terrorism here
2825725 but we cant release him now for the security of the country
2825726 the palestinian leadership has been working on establishing a palestinian state within the 67 borders
2825727 if israel continues to oppose making this a reality then the palestinian demand for the palestinian people and its leadership would be one state a binational state
2825728 i want america to know that im like totally ready to lead
2825729 it would be pink on the outside pink carpets pink furniture pink jammies the men on her staff would be cool with be shirtless chippendale types with names like leon
2825730 instead of a bowling alley in the basement of the white house paris would have a pilates studio and oh yeah shed have foam parties in the oval office for the white house staff and old girlfriends from boarding school
2825731 she would answer all questions while walking and posing for a wall of photographers and theyd be yelling out paris look here
2825732 the first half of every conference would be about what shes wearing paris would realize that as president she would have to tone it down a little shed lean toward prada
2825733 what would happen is rihanna would step off the plane in fishnet stockings music would blare and whole countries would melt at the sight of her
2825734 it would be like bush at the crawford ranch she would be in l a more than she would in washington d c
2825735 fascism should more appropriately be called corporatism because it is a merger of state and corporate power
2825736 calling italy fascist for upholding a retarded law does not make italy fascist
2825737 fascism should more appropriately be called corporatism because it is a merger of state and corporate power
2825738 what i was saying is that italys leader tends to allow his political goals and power be directly influenced by his corporate ties making him
2825739 you two are arguing so i dont trust either of you
2825740 refers to obamas march 2008 vote for a non binding budget resolution that would have set general revenue and spending targets for congressional tax writing and appropriations committees the resolution does not contain a specific provision to raise tax rates but rather assumes that most of the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts expire as scheduled in 2011 it also bears no relation to obamas proposed economic plan in fact obama has stated repeatedly that his plan would increase taxes only for those making more than 250 000 per year
2825741 the most comprehensive nonpartisan analysis of obamas tax proposal available is the tax policy centers comparison of mccains and obamas economic plans that analysis mostly supports obamas claim that his plan wont raise taxes though it says that families earning between 169 480 and 237 040 would see an average tax increase of 486 under obamas plan all those earning less than 169 480 would see tax cuts in fact that hypothetical taxpayer with the 32 000 in taxable income would get a 502 tax cut under obamas plan mccains plan by contrast would leave that persons taxes unchanged
2825742 as we have described before budget resolutions basically set targets for appropriations committees to use they are more like guidelines than actual rules and like many budget resolutions this one passed on a party line vote with just one democrat and two republicans crossing party lines
2825743 budget resolutions merely set targets for tax writing and appropriations committees and dont alter the tax code directly
2825744 the budget resolution is not not a law not binding
2825745 i used to say that barack obama raises taxes i stand corrected
2825746 take this one for instance the choice in this election is stark and simple john mccain said at recent denver event repeating a phrase that is a staple of his stump speech
2825747 one of the issues around looking at the impact of seizures is that were not quite sure what impact they have because the issue of stockpiling
2825748 we know with a range of other substances like heroin and amphetamines that theres a high level of stockpiling that goes on so when there is a seizure it doesnt necessarily translate to reduced access to the drug on the street
2825749 our sense is that yes this is a big seizure we need to watch it very carefully in terms of the impact but our past history would tell us that the impact at the street level will be minimal if anything
2825750 people would not be sending this quantity of product to australia without a realistic expectation that they stand to be able to move all of this product
2825751 so what youre looking at is a truly phenomenal demand in australia for these sorts of drugs in the modern era
2825752 the military institution says it is ok to kill and use the most horrible weapons and that killing the enemy is heroic
2825753 i respect dick for having humanity over his military obligations
2825754 the regular people and the government wanted to surrender but the military people didnt want to surrender
2825755 i believe it is the stubbornness of the military people that caused the bombing of japan
2825756 he translated the pain of the palestinians in a magical way
2825757 he made us cry and made us happy and shook our emotions
2825758 today i have come bearing an olive branch and a freedom fighters gun do not let the olive branch fall from my hand
2825759 he created a national palestinian identity that no other poet could achieve
2825760 since the burmese military has ignored the call of the internal national community to begin an inclusive political process and unilaterally imposed a constitution designed to consolidate military rule it is imperative to review the international approach towards burma
2825761 a full blown castigation of the burmese generals could have caused considerable discomfort for bangkok which has just assumed the chair of asean which includes burma

2825813 but he chose me and i agreed to marry him right away
2825814 at least 20 percent of the families on the island have been lifted out of poverty
2825815 we were angry at each other in a quiet way
2825816 a marriage that is not based on love often brings problems
2825817 how can you live happily ever after when you met your husband three weeks before the wedding
2825818 any country will do ill take anyone who will accept me

2825824 there is a place in this world for satire but there is a time when satire ends and intolerance and bigotry towards religious beliefs of others begins
2825825 they poked us and stabbed us with the machetes and they were asking for money specifically dollars
2825826 we had a few quetzales guatemalas currency but we had no dollars with us on the boat
2825827 i said we need help i said my husband was not moving
2825828 felt good some at bats a little tardy on other ones
2825829 hopefully its going to be best for him because he was having a problem with range of motion of his shoulder
2825830 hes playing and not really being himself as far as swinging the bat maybe this will give him a chance to get some more range of motion and maybe get the old scotty back here
2825831 the rehab is pretty intense digging pretty deep into the shoulder and the capsule trying to loosen up some tissue
2825832 when doing that and trying to play and swing a baseball bat at the same time were kind of counteracting what were doing if we give it time to cool down a little bit and get in there and dig and get after that without having to swing the bat and undo it thats hopefully going to help it recover a little better
2825833 im just going to try and take it easy on him for a while so we dont lose him again
2825834 i wont be stealing any bases but aside from that ill be all right
2825835 maybe it will change here or there but thats where i want him to hit
2825836 he was in that spot before he got hurt and well just put him back in there
2825837 you put the ball on the ground you have to run and thats the way when we talked about it he wanted it and thats the way i wanted it
2825838 its more of a team unity thing nick and i ran it i told eric day 1 that unless i pass out i am going to try to do everything that everyone else does
2825839 im no different aside from being a little gray headed and a little bit older
2825840 you get used to a new guy and it takes a little bit of time and usually you get the luxury of doing it in the spring where no ones really around or cheering for laps
2825841 i need to call my mom and have her tape espn
2825842 hopefully i got on there today with a penalty lap it was weird because its a penalty lap and youre running it because youve done something wrong and people are cheering it was a little different
2825843 you have to get used to a guys voice his placement of his hands how quickly hes getting out you try to make it look as effortless as possible
2825844 i think its kind of funny but yet serves its purpose i think things like that are important in the fact that everyone is involved in it
2825845 when you come out here and the fans are going crazy and having fun it just helps you get through the day
2825846 weve just got to make sure were handling everything around him so we have the chemistry we need to have before the season starts
2825847 the ball comes out hard and fast and straight and long so thats always good
2825848 its been a whirlwind for him and theres a lot of new information going in were progressing quickly
2825849 until i can see the cadence and see the mechanics
2825850 brett had his two hard boiled eggs a little bit of orange juice
2825851 there was a garnish i think and some hashbrowns and i can take you through minute by minute after that
2825852 the eggs were mixed with the hashbrowns so i dont know which one actually hit his mouth first ill film it next time
2825853 i concluded that an active sexual relationship between two people of the same sex might therefore reflect the love of god in a way comparable to marriage if and only if it had about it the same character of absolute covenanted faithfulness
2825854 i was starting to swing the bat a little better the team is playing good
2825855 it was just a big disappointment for something like this to happen
2825856 yeah probably could be thats why im going back to tampa
2825857 there have been a lot of big hits hes had hitting in the three hole for us
2825858 one thing about carl he has a propensity to come through in those moments thats what ive seen thee last couple of years this guy gets big hits
2825859 we have the mechanics within what we have right now if we choose to do something else we can do that also
2825860 these are not naughty postcards from the beach they are undoubtedly porn pure and simple some of it is quite dark with animals committing fellatio and girl on girl action its quite unpleasant
2825861 the kafka industry doesnt want to know such things about its idol
2825862 hawes an oxford graduate and university lecturer emphasises his total admiration for the literary kafkaesque genius who wrote brooding classics such as the metamorphosis
2825863 kafkas interest in pornography which left traces in such works as the metamorphosis

2825892 large numbers of these people really seem to think that an obama election would benefit them hugely
2825893 obama wins demo nomination a black flag for white america
2825894 will be a clear signal for millions of our people
2825895 obama is a visual aid for white americans who just dont get it yet that we have lost control of our country and unless we get it back we are heading for complete annihilation as a people
2825896 it doesnt really matter if obama wins the election or mccain wins the election
2825897 neither of them are going to try to fight to preserve the white race or heritage
2825898 those were the good old days for straight white males but for everyone else it was a pretty raw deal
2825899 the revolution if you will in 1776 brought the 13 colonies together against the king and the same thing can happen now against martin luther king with the 50 states
2825900 see richard doesnt really mean what he says its popular for him to say it thats the way he makes a living
2825901 same as jesse jackson some more of our black revolutionaries who make a living off of keeping things emotional

2825903 im concerned that once he gets in office that he wont be recognized as an american president

2825957 the push into petrochemicals is to finance a new economy and new society
2825958 that places greater demand on other transformers and other substations

2825960 that transformer has been sitting in california for nearly two months now
2825961 we do have to watch the system closely in the summer
2825962 these areas are undeveloped because drilling there would not yield high enough profits to maintain oil companies record earnings
2825963 we changed the way we tax gas in the state to give us a budget that could grow
2825964 the continued fall in crude oil and commodity prices has knocked the wind out of the aussies sails
2825965 there are some people with minor injuries so far and there is at least one person unaccounted for

2826030 and i hate how much i miss jefferson i hate that im so attached to him ive started getting jealous and i would never get jealous before and i would always insist that he wasnt a boyfriend and i didnt see him like that but now i sorta am now that ive started opening up to him about me and counting on him for emotional support stupid stupid stupid i know i cant think of him as a boyfriend i cant i really feel like i shouldnt love him as much as i do im scared of getting hurt one day i should just shut up now
2826031 i hate sitting at home by myself all the time knowing hes more than likely with someone i hate it even more when i actually know i hate it i hate it i hate it its killing me i dont know what id do without jefferson though im so happy i have him right now and im so appreciative of everything he does for me even if it isnt much but even when he just says something nice or like how he helped me with my art history paper it means everything to me and when he said he loved me in that e mail instead of his usual just saying it after i say it oh man i was so happy
2826032 i want some kind of proof im special that i stack up against all the other women that im even more special than some random hook up or someone he met after me i want him to tell me that im beautiful and sexy i want him to tell me that he loves me without my having to say it first i want him to want to be with me just because its me and not because he doesnt like being alone and i want all these things to actually be true but what if im not that special what if he thinks better of all his other girlfriends what if he doesnt actually love me what if im really just forcing all this just imagining he feels the same way about me he tells me after that he had a nice time or whatever which i guess is true of course were not like fighting or doing something boring or having some awful time im insecure i know i cant help it how could anyone help it in this situation i shouldnt have fallen in love i should have been better about keeping my emotions in check and guarding the real me the ugly parts cause now im just stripped bare and have nothing to hide behind i should stop caring when hes too busy to respond to e mails i should stop writing so many i should stop wanting to be his girlfriend god i cant believe i admitted to that how does he juggle so many relationships i dont get it he cant give everything to everyone and thats disappointing on the womens end and he has to give so much to everyone and thats got to be draining on his end and i try not to want much from him i want him to love me and keep room open to see me once a week thats all i feel is reasonable to ask for id really like to see him more than once a week or at least more than 4 hours at a time but thats just silly to ask for i do like when we leave together and we hold hands as we walk to the subway and i love when we kiss goodbye i press him against the wall and everyone passing by stares at us and the high school kids who get out of school at that moment go eww lol i love jefferson and i love being with jefferson and i love all the things we do together i just want to feel more secure about everything really thats all
2826033 i dont know how to do this anymore i dont know if i can i love him so much too much really and im so happy when i see him but im a wreck waiting for him to return e mails and im a wreck thinking about him fucking other girls its even worse when i feel ignored jefferson does what he wants to do and i know that i just wish maybe hed take 5 minutes in the day to think about me ill bet he doesnt even think about me and im always talking and thinking about him all my roommates and parents here are jefferson this and jefferson that god im such a fucking moron what the hell was i thinking
2826034 last night was the party at jeffersons and everything was really great actually all the people there were awesome
2826035 im still feeling kinda indifferent to jefferson im not so anxious to see him though im in a cuddling mood so i did e mail him to see when i can see him but pretty much just for that reason so i talked to him about how i felt wednesday morning i told him how when i said i wanted him to be nice i really meant it and that i was just in the mood for cuddling and kissing since so much happened the night before he said he was sorry and that he was just going on my e mail the week before saying that things were a little too sweet its true i can see why he would have been confused i had wanted him to be less tender and when we were together friday it was awesome and perfect but i didnt say anything about his drinking i just know he wont listen to me about that it may not really be an issue though if i cant get the spark back i miss the spark its kinda been diminishing for a few weeks at least on my end i still have a hard time really believing he loves me or that im anything remotely special to him
2826036 im so annoyed with jefferson right now its taken basically a week a week tomorrow to schedule a time to see him i think im done i dont feel like i can do this anymore i just dont fit into his life theres no room for me im composing an e mail about how i feel well see if i send it gah i sent it shit damn i have an easier time making gyno appointments than with you lately i suppose that joke is lost on guy boy i dont know about this anymore i dont know if i can keep doing this with you for much longer im like at my wits end with everyone and little frustrations like how long it takes to get an e mail back from you arent really helping it just feels like i dont really fit in your life anymore youre too busy for me and i hate dealing with busy people i gave up even on my own sister and i cant imagine youre going to be less busy ever so i dunno and you know i love you and love being with you but im just tired of getting so frustrated with no solution seemingly in sight but maybe you have a solution i cant think of thats good right now we just have to see how long it takes for him to respond sigh didnt have to wait too long actually heres the rest of our exchange jeffersons in bold im sorry it can be hard im not in town now and so not online very much plus i aint got my calendar but anyway im sure friday can work im sorry life is throwing you curve balls at least it sounds like there are cute people at work to keep you distracted i dont want a appology i want a solution i know youre out of town thats the magic of statcounter but when youre not out of town youre busy with work kids other people i just really feel like i dont fit in anymore you do as you do and i know better than to ask you to do anything differently so maybe there isnt any soution oh were not quitting now its a rough patch but like you say id prefer finding a solution yeah um in case you havent noticed i dont do well with rough patches you may be tougher than you think yeah im pretty much a big wuss you are a sweet candy with a soft center in other words a wuss lol and dont be thinking making me smile is gonna go fixin how i feel then consider this a purely gratutious smile you really are being generous lately an extra very easy fucking and now a free smile i guess christmas is coming a little early this year okay i am off to slumber take some kisses lover
2826037 i dont know what else to do it doesnt matter what i say what i ask for i want to give up he wants to keep going i dont know what to do anymore i dont want to keep saying things but these things keep happening and theyre happening more and more frequently monday morning he says well make it work and save for a couple of e mails about porn i havent heard from him since including no response to an e mail about when we could get together this week so this week is shot for getting together even though we talked about trying to spend more time together psh huh
2826038 im not really cut out for this it goes against my nature whatever kind of relationship you want to call it that i have with jefferson not that i go against nature since hes the only guy in my life right now and i do the best i can i really do and at my age im willing to make those sacrifices because i love him and want to be with him in whatever way i can for now because sooner or later im gonna be wanting that forever kind of love
2826039 im sure im gonna suck it up until after the concert but then again another month and itd be 1 year thatd be a nice milestone i dunno
2826040 i broke up with jefferson today i couldnt take how much being in the relationship hurt me and i knew if i stayed too much longer id only end up hating him and i didnt want that at all i love him too much ive been crying on and off all day i expect to be sad for awhile but im hoping ill stop crying in a week or so i shouldnt be that sad though cause were still friends its not goodbye really were just not gonna have sex anymore ugh see that does make me sad lol you know whats also sad the fact that i dont know when im going to have sex again i dont really think im going to be up to meeting new guys for awhile and i really do kinda hate meaningless casual sex with some strange dude its gonna be awhile before im ready to be with anyone again i can tell i wish circumstances could have been different and i do wish i could have been stronger and have been able to handle that kind of relationship better god i still love him so much i wonder if hes sad too he hasnt shown it if he is i know i made him happy though i could tell from the way he looked at me i concentrated on soaking up as much of his as i could the way he feels the way his hands brush my cheeks how his arms wrap so tightly around me the way he smells and tastes his laugh his smile i can still smell him on me i can still feel his lips on mine i can still hear him telling me he loves me as we said goodbye
2826041 im positvely miserable about this break up im so conflicted with dealing with everything i hated about jefferson and every awful thing that came with being with him and also how much i love him and care about him and how good he could make me feel i just want to feel better about things already i was constantly unhappy reading all the other blogs and reading the stories on his and dealing with the 1 000 other women but i still read the blogs and i still see the stories and all i can think about is the 1 000 other women having what i still want its a total lose lose situation
2826042 maybe ive changed my mind oddly enough because i bitched about everything that pissed me off in the relationship in therapy today but maybe because i vented it made me want to get back with jeffferson i dont want to jerk him around and hurt him though with changing my mind and all though he has such a laissez faire attitude its impossible to tell if i actually am hurting him he makes it completely available to come and go as i please so why shouldnt i take advantage of that i miss him a lot god im gonna go crawling back with my tail between my legs
2826043 i hate him i hate him i hate him who take a wild fucking guess i had to find out on the god damn internet hes going to be a presenter at d o which is on the weekend of my birthday and as well as our 1 year anniversary not that that has a lot of meaning anniversary psh huh im really ready to blow a fucking gasket god damn mother fucking bitch bastard freaking a man excuse me why i go cry because of him again
2826044 its not fair i just feel like everyone else in the world gets to see him except me its just me he never has time to see
2826045 but and this may sound silly but part of me is hoping that maybe if he sees me in a new situation one where im in my own element back with my family and him seeing me more than just as a lover that maybe hell love me like i love him
2826046 i nearly threw up from crying too hard i made a mistake and i dont know if i can fix it i wish i could disappear and purge everything from my life i dont know what to do i almost want to see harry because i know he could at least hurt me worse than i can do myself im glad my roommates gone so i can cry all weekend and not leave my bed i dont know how to survive this
2826047 i bought junk food for the first time in forever yesterday krispy kremes and pepperidge farm cookies yum there was just no way i was going to get through this heartache without it though im not abandoning my weight loss efforts so thats all im limiting myself to im not going to gorge forever the last thing i need is to be upset and gain weight though i think i scared my period away with all this duress ive been under this week it like sorta came and then is not sure if its really wanting to be here i totally understand though id hide under a rock and stay there for awhile if i could as it is ive been cozily stationed in my bed most of the weekend did some darkroom work friday for my assignment due tuesday then made a quick run to the grocery store for said junk food and in a little bit ill head back to the darkroom to press my prints was supposed to go home but i just cant i cant bear to be around my parents when im still so distressed about jefferson i dont even know what i want half of me wants to hightail it out of there like id intended this summer the other half of me cant even imagine life anymore without him in it in some way i also feel like if i were to leave him id leave this whole life behind i mean is it really even feasible that i could stay in this circle when they were all his friends first yes there are some people who are enough of my friends that it wouldnt really affect those relationships but i mean more like group events tea parties pleasure salons well those dont really concern him big events im already thinking of backing out on winterfire i wont feel secure or confident if were on bad terms i really dont know whats going to happen with jefferson it doesnt help that i cant make up my mind it also doesnt help that he doesnt have the time of day to talk to me about it right now i have to wait i always have to wait if its not one thing its another yet i still havent stopped caring i sent him a stupid e mail about all the things that worked for my cold since it seems he caught it or at least im assuming he caught it i think im on my way to not caring though im having a very hard time admitting affection for him this is the worst thing the two of us have gone though i really dont think were going to get through this i think this is finally the end of jefferson and avah maybe i should be relieved
2826048 grr day 5 now so im pretty confident hes not talking to me now i sent an e mail saturday night explaining that ive been acting so nuts because i didnt know how to deal with his anger and it was also making me insecure and nada since of course he could not be at the computer so i just sent an e mail asking if he was ignoring me or just not answering e mail though if hes just not checking his e mail its kinda lost but i think i would have an answer anyways cause i think he would at least tell me that hes not responding to me right now god i feel like this is a fight i wouldve had with my boyfriend in the 6th grade feeling 12 is uncool so is being in limbo like this its just weighing me down so much i just want to move on to either fixing this or just walking away i dont want to keep going through the day wondering if hes ever going to talk to me again excuse me while i bang my head on my desk until i need to get to my 1pm class
2826049 ok so i had this whole post typed out about it being wednesday morning and i still hadnt heard from him except in the middle of writing it he called me
2826050 things with jefferson and me feel like theyre fizzling and im not sure if its temporary because hes busy with so much stuff or if its just where our relationship is going were not kinky any more havent been for almost a year now
2826051 i dont think i can get over my jealousy all i want to do is cry and throw up
2826052 seeing jefferson this week was good i was worried i wouldnt be able to connect but i was
2826053 well im tired so i wont go too much into it
2826054 day 3 of shibaricon starts in a few minutes im having a lot of fun with the rope and really learning a lot skipped morning sex today because if i have another day of vanilla sex im going to scream and not in the good way guess its time to wake jefferson classes start in 20 minutes

2826056 big deep sad sigh from the bottom of my heart god i miss him yes jefferson i miss him so terribly much tonight for the first time in a long time i really really miss him i miss all the good times all the great things that we shared the love and kisses and tenderness i left all that behind as well when i broke up with him its not just the bad that is gone now the good has been gone for a really long time already january basically but its just hard knowing that its gone for good and there isnt even a chance of getting it back it doesnt help that im terribly heartbroken over what hes going through right now and for anyone else that may even entertain the idea dear god people i really had nothing to do with it ive been bad reading over posts about us on my blog i just felt like it i half wish i could tell him this right now but its pointless its better if he doesnt know he doesnt have the time to worry about it anyways i wish i didnt have these feelings why cant i just walk away from him id fucking give anything to be curled up with him just for tonight

2826060 hes pissed because he doesnt think about repercussions he just thinks about action and then more
2826061 the next rate increase will most likely be the maximum under the law
2826062 the way the cpi consumer price index is going you could be looking at periodicals rates going up 5 or 6 percent for some publications about double the 2 9 percent increase we saw in may
2826063 this requires that we significantly accelerate process improvements and the realignment of resources in order to achieve long term financial success
2826064 failure to do so will threaten our ability to meet our mission of providing universal service at affordable prices
2826065 if you have a price cap you do what you can with costs but service will be affected

2826110 isnt it not just for wall street but for the entire country we were on a binge
2826111 absolutely theres a lot of truth in what the president said and in terms of wall street there is too much leverage in the system and more leverage than was appropriate and more than than people recognized because the leverage came in into the system in the form of highly complex structured products which were difficult to understand

2826132 the voter registration officials simply take the word of the registrant with no follow up
2826133 some states that require some backup documentation merely ask for a utility bill or a drivers license neither of which prove citizenship in other words legal or illegal aliens can easily register to vote in local and national elections
2826134 while the news media perpetuated the assertion that bush and the gop stole the election it could very well have been illegal aliens voting in florida that made the outcome so close
2826135 bush may have beaten gore by more votes if illegals were excluded since immigrants tend to vote for democrats or gore could have won decisively had there been prior screening before people were allowed into the voting booths
2826136 there was absolutely no mention in the mainstream media regarding suspected voter fraud by illegal or legal aliens it was much easier for the agenda driven newspeople to accuse republicans of stealing the election
2826137 florida is not unique thousands of non citizens are registered to vote in some states and tens if not hundreds of thousands in total may be present on the voter rolls nationwide these numbers are significant local elections are often decided by only a handful of votes and even national elections have likely been within the margin of the number of non citizens illegally registered to vote
2826138 there is no reliable method to determine the number of non citizens registered or actually voting because most laws to ensure that only citizens vote are ignored are inadequate or are systematically undermined by government officials those who ignore the implications of non citizen registration and voting either are willfully blind to the problem or may actually favor this form of illegal voting
2826139 americans would be shocked to discover that hundreds of thousands of general election voters are illegal aliens green card immigrants and criminals whove murdered raped and robbed us citizens and guess which political party benefits the most from their votes the one thats pushing for amnesty and a bag full of free goodies
2826140 to keep non citizens from diluting citizens votes immigration and election officials must cooperate far more effectively than they have to date and state and federal officials must increase their efforts to enforce the laws against non citizen voting that are already on the books
2826141 while the liberal media and the liberal establishment ignore what is a huge scandal american voters are having their rights violated when an illegal aliens or felon or other person prohibited by law to vote their votes cancels out those of american citizens
2826142 liberals want illegal aliens and felons to vote they benefit from such rampant fraud
2826143 its the first big unequivocal test about what this possible president really thinks
2826144 youve got to be sure that you get the right person the person has got to be of presidential stature has got to be someone you can be comfortable with work with and help you as president compatibility is very crucial
2826145 the chemistry between us had been correct but not warm
2826146 you dont want it to be a reason for people to question your judgment
2826147 i called my partners and said i think i just met a future president of the united states
2826148 i went from being a senator a young senator to being considered for vice president running for president being a vice presidential candidate and becoming a national public figure
2826149 all of which fed a self focus an egotism a narcissism that leads you to believe that you can do whatever you want youre invincible and there will be no consequences
2826150 he could have been a force in american politics for a very long time
2826151 the fact that he had not spent his life in politics was his greatest asset people at the time were saying he didnt have enough experience and hadnt been tested actually hed been tested in ways other people had not
2826152 if youre an incumbent one of your nightmares is a fresh face coming out of the woodwork with the resources to be competitive
2826153 has shown a remarkable disrespect for his office for the moral dimensions of leadership for his friends for his wife for his precious daughter
2826154 i suspect the first thing he thought about is im going to protect myself politically he was worried about his family finding out he was worried about the rest of the staff finding out he was worried about the press finding out
2826155 consistent moderation placed edwards among the center right of senate democrats
2826156 he climbed onto the slab at the funeral home laid there and hugged his body and promised that hed do all he could to make life better for people to live up to wades ideals of service
2826157 as he told me later edwards had recounted the exact story to him almost in the exact same words a year or two before and with the same preface that hed never shared the memory with anyone else
2826158 he wanted to be vice president and said what he had to
2826159 the thing that would surprise me is if he doesnt continue to serve in some way hes been underestimated many times
2826160 im not sure i had a political career for the future anyway
2826161 im not sure that politics was what i wanted to spend my life doing
2826162 i dont know whats possible and whats gone i dont think anythings ended i see no end my lord and my wife have forgiven me so im going to move on

2826166 id like to hear the governor and legislative leaders tell the voters where the shortfall is coming from and unless i hear that im not sure we ought to take a gamble
2826167 education funding is very important part of our economy has to be based on attracting and keeping good paying jobs and we cant do that without a well educated work force
2826168 our dependence on foreign oil means that we are buying from our enemies
2826169 how bout some friends and a few a holes that better
2826170 the american people know something is wrong as far as energy is concerned
2826171 i hope he grabs that part of middle america that we failed to reach

2826174 people had splashed water all over the counters thrown paper towels on the floor and boone pickens couldnt stand to see his investment in disarray so without a word he started picking up the paper towels and wiping down the counters himself
2826175 i think the rest of us were so embarrassed we started to clean up quietly around him
2826176 its like magical thinking with no one bothering to scratch the surface
2826177 full on pander mode flailing around looking for anything that has traction in polls
2826178 saying that we can drill our way out of it this idea that every little bit helps is denying reality
2826179 it may not be good politics but its not fair to the electorate to let them think that a few little tweaks are going to fix the problem
2826180 if we want to enable the technologies of tomorrow like plug in electric cars we need electricity to plug into
2826181 state capitalism with direct intervention in a large sector of the economy
2826182 if wall street sees 4 8 plants built with important federal support over the next seven years on cost and on schedule i think youre going to see robust support from the financial sector
2826183 thats just not a feasible or responsible thing to say
2826184 if were going to cut down on greenhouse gases we have to find a way to sequester them and emissions in general
2826185 i have been an oil man my whole life but this is one emergency we cannot drill our way out of
2826186 on this issue i think that americans are ahead of the candidates of both parties
2826187 our energy economy is undergoing a transformation and were just in the early stages
2826188 the jonah factor 13 spiritual steps to finding the job of a lifetime
2826189 hey im changing so i can get votes in texas or arizona
2826190 an anonymous secondhand quotation from sen barack obama at a closed house democratic caucus meeting on july 29 caused an uproar among partisans it is an excellent example of how the pernicious use of unnamed sources so pervasive in washington can backfire on journalists and sources
2826191 this is the moment that the world is waiting for i have become a symbol of the possibility of america returning to our best traditions
2826192 in response to what one of the house members prefaced the question by
2826193 said i wish i could take credit for that but i cant because its not about me its about america its about the people of germany and the people of europe looking for a new hope new relationships as we go forward in the world so he expressly said that its not about me
2826194 lots of people are reading the quote about obama being a symbol and getting it wrong his entire point of that riff was that the campaign is not about him
2826195 the post left out the important first half of the sentence which was something along the lines of it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all
2826196 it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all its about america i have just become a symbol
2826197 anonymous quotes should be used sparingly this one wasnt worth it if you werent there be careful about judging the context
2826198 i have become the symbol of america returning to our best traditions
2826199 it scared me to see how the mainstream media were propping up george bush while faithfully reporting every stupid lie that the bush campaign made up about al gore
2826200 ill use every talent i possess and all my energy to try to bring back tolerance decency and generosity to the country i love
2826201 a silent but all reaching coup is taking place within the united states this coup is not being directed by bomb laden muslim terrorists nor will it ever be covered by the mainstream media the seditious act is being carried out by our very own elected officials with president bush leading the insurrection
2826202 john and i will tell you there were interesting races four years ago and eight years ago but in many ways this is one of the most interesting races in all of american history we have a chance to lift our country to a new way of thinking this can be a transformative election but make no mistake its close closer than it should be
2826203 mccain has promised and reaffirmed his commitment to continue the same policies weve had these past eight years for another four
2826204 we cannot do that barack obama has lifted our spirits and led us to believe yes we can solve the global climate crisis address the other issues we have to take on and has said we can come together and create a new century with bright hope
2826205 you want some advice make iraq the 51st state and lets get the hell out of there
2826206 these are not normal times the relationship between the planet and ourselves has been irrevocably and dramatically altered were a bull in a china shop today as the sun sets we will have put another 70 million tons of global warming pollution into the atmosphere
2826207 just so you all know we did set a record
2826208 ive been involved in fundraising a long time and to have two incredible men who were nominees and both should have been president and also the fact i got a nobel prize winner and an academy award winner this is too much even for me
2826209 he promised america it would be a campaign of respect of ideas not insults and the american people wanted a better campaign and he gives you paris hilton and britney spears
2826210 if he cant keep his word about the campaign and he cant keep his word about the issues that are really important to the american people and he makes the wrong judgments about how to protect america then his candidacy is in fact dangerous in terms of americas security and you cant trust it and you cant trust him thats what this is about
2826211 senator lieberman supports both democrats and republicans and he gave to the committee as a senior member of the caucus
2826212 want to continue flying in your private jet and air conditioning your 16 000 square foot mansion and not worry about hurting the environment then send us your money and well offset the damage youre doing by planting trees
2826213 there are good muslims and bad muslims that i have to admit just like there are good and bad jews
2826214 no this was their place first they could take the hot weather and some of them went far in this world theyre not lazy
2826215 i know hes smart i dont think hes a dummy like bush
2826216 im fine i have to go for blood work again they keep me waiting for an hour im all sunburned like a berry i get in the water and i forget to get out i get in conversations
2826217 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
2826218 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view
2826219 we are pleased to note ofcom has vindicated the ipccs claim against channel 4 in spirit and in substance
2826220 it is entirely appropriate people should bear a cost if only of unpopularity and criticism for speaking freely however the cost should be reasonable and not disproportionate there should not be in the words of a famous supreme court decision a chilling effect on free speech
2826221 tensions and hostilities between georgians and ossetians are in no way justification for russian troops crossing an internationally recognized border
2826222 russia to immediately and unconditionally withdraw its forces from the territory of georgia
2826223 the consequences for euro atlantic stability and security are grave
2826224 talks among all sides and said the united states the u n security council and other parties should try to help bring about a peaceful resolution
2826225 its both sides fault both have been somewhat provocative with each other
2826226 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
2826227 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
2826228 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
2826229 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
2826230 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
2826231 this boat is going to be the toyota prius of the houseboat business
2826232 it is the most eco friendly houseboat anywhere in the country
2826233 gore will consume a lot more fuel driving to and from the lake than he will ever use cruising on this houseboat
2826234 climate confusion how global warming hysteria leads to bad science pandering politicians and misguided policies that hurt the poor
2826235 we are a debt relief agency amp have proudly helped people file for bankruptcy for over 30 yrs
2826236 we have regular exchanges with malaysian diplomats in washington on a number of subjects including with the malaysian charge daffaires yesterday
2826237 anwar ibrahims case was one of the topics of conversation
2826238 we take note of the many serious questions raised within malaysia including by the malaysian bar council concerning this case
2826239 for the second time gore is goring us repeating the 1998 goring
2826240 we hope he will stop goring as it is about time he re examines the goring process within himself and his country
2826241 there is no way other countries should look down on us in the administration of our own laws our criminal procedure code and the penal code emanate from the common law
2826242 therefore there is no reason whatsoever for any other power in the world to criticise us in administering justice and the rule of law
2826243 it is a scary story made more scary by the fact that most people in america dont understand what the problems are
2826244 we have to free ourselves from the domination of the big oil companies that have the ability to manipulate the price
2826245 sitting next to someone on a senate committee has sparked more than a few deep friendships
2826246 obviously my name was linked to it but other than that theres nothing that can be said
2826247 he was a governor who tried to not ruffle feathers
2826248 as a debater i felt like i was in the twilight zone show you want to reach over and slit the arm to see if theres flesh and blood or just wires
2826249 one of my big accomplishments was at one point in the debate he started to sweat
2826250 is it boring to win five times as a democrat in a state thats overwhelmingly republican
2826251 obviously the people of indiana think theres something exciting about him
2826252 both obama and mccain need to make their running mate choices very carefully because after all the influence that cheney and gore developed people are going to analyze their choices very carefully
2826253 we will never go back to the days when the vice presidency held little influence the national government is involved in too many things for a president not to have a strong partner standing at his side
2826254 even selecting himself as the running mate something that has never been done in history
2826255 theres something healthy in the vice presidency becoming a separate entity
2826256 in the next month one man either the democratic presidential nominee or the republican presidential nominee will choose the next vice president of the united states
2826257 their choice will be ratified by their party conventions and we the people will accept it but the idea that one person will select somebody who has a one in three chance of becoming president of the united states is to my mind very problematic
2826258 presidential candidates usually get vetted for a couple of years but the vice president just gets picked by one guy
2826259 its kind of weird process if you stop and think about it
2826260 it ought to be a more competitive process at the early stages
2826261 maybe people should run for vice president i dont know but we should be talking about it because the process now is fundamentally unhealthy it is not democratic for one man or woman to be able to pick the next president of the united states
2826262 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
2826263 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that
2826264 i urge your colleagues to take even bolder steps toward solving the climate crisis
2826265 we have an historic opportunity to shift to a clean energy economy and in the process create new sustainable jobs to support the development and deployment of these new technologies
2826266 im afraid right now that we are more concerned about the business climate than the earths climate
2826267 until we realize they are not mutually exclusive we wont be able to address these issues
2826268 but it should be clear to anyone who has been watching the session that weve already
2826269 under governor patrick massachusetts joined the regional greenhouse gas initiative and became the first state in the nation to require greenhouse gas analysis and mitigation in major real estate projects
2826270 comprehensive energy legislation the oceans management bill and pending biofuels legislation all put massachusetts into a leadership position nationally we support the creation of an economy wide cap as the next step in reducing greenhouse gas emissions but many details remain to be worked out with the legislature
2826271 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
2826272 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
2826273 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
2826274 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
2826275 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment
2826276 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations
2826277 our country needs a new energy policy that reinvests in america and it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy
2826278 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
2826279 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
2826280 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
2826281 we have been drilling for more oil and the prices have gone up
2826282 a lot more oil has been found a lot more has been produced
2826283 the exploding demand for oil especially in places like china is overwhelming the rate of new discoveries by so much that oil prices are almost certain to continue upward over time no matter what the oil companies promise
2826284 john mccain enters the offshore drilling debate with voters favor
2826285 wants the government to act to address the immediate price consequences and to act now for achieving energy independence in the medium and long term
2826286 produce every kilowatt of electricity through wind sun and other earth friendly energy sources within 10 years this goal is achievable affordable and transformative
2826287 there is strong disagreement with many of the legal analytical economic science and policy interpretations
2826288 is a deeply flawed and unsuitable vehicle for reducing greenhouse gas emissions
2826289 will not only harm the us economy but will fail to provide an effective response to the global challenge of climate change as the president observed in april decisions with such far reaching impact should not be left to unelected regulators and judges
2826290 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
2826291 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront the issue as president next year
2826292 wait a second if youve gotten to the point where youre sheepish about us doing well i cant vote for you
2826293 hey jimmy were only guys we show up at 11 30 we tell the jokes thats what pretty boys do all night
2826294 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
2826295 the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
2826296 this is an investment that will pay itself back many times over
2826297 its an expensive investment but not compared to the rising cost of continuing to invest in fossil fuels
2826298 for decades al gore has challenged the skeptics in washington on climate change and awakened the conscience of a nation to the urgency of this threat i strongly agree with vice president gore that we cannot drill our way to energy independence but must fast track investments in renewable sources of energy like solar power wind power and advanced biofuels and those are the investments i will make as president its a strategy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and cannot be outsourced and one that will leave our children a world that is cleaner and safer
2826299 windmills should be installed in every uninhabited windy place in this country
2826300 bridging the worlds of environmentalism finance technology and politics together mr gore is ideally suited to speak to this audience of innovators striving to integrate green building practices and leading edge technology into the 21st century in a way that is both smart and sustainable
2826301 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
2826302 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
2826303 we want to jump on this bandwagon we have to
2826304 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
2826305 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
2826306 the price mccain paid for his partys nomination has been to reverse himself on position after position
2826307 that doesnt meet my definition of a maverick you cant be a maverick when politically its important for you but not a maverick when it doesnt work for you
2826308 weve been through two very tough elections at the national level and its very easy to lose confidence
2826309 theres frustration there because theyre watching these childish ad campaigns and they know exactly how to answer it but theyre powerless to do so
2826310 despite all the talk about sexism in the presidential campaign the majority of women voters laid the blame for hillarys loss squarely on her and her strategists shoulders they largely reject gender as a cause of her demise
2826311 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
2826312 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
2826313 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
2826314 i am now here spreading the word about the climate project and what we can do in india and elsewhere to help
2826315 we are expected to give 10 inconvenient truth presentations within a year
2826316 the reason why the global warming message is a success is that ordinary people are involved in it who are spreading the word
2826317 move quickly and boldly to shake off complacency throw aside old habits and rise clear eyed and alert to the necessity of big changes
2826318 to commit to producing 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
2826319 to be sure reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years will require us to overcome many obstacles
2826320 to those who say the costs are still too high i ask them to consider whether the costs of oil and coal will ever stop increasing if we keep relying on quickly depleting energy sources to feed a rapidly growing demand all around the world
2826321 reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years
2826322 provide funding and global business building expertise to a range of businesses both public and private and to entrepreneurs
2826323 an oil and gas exploration and production e amp p company
2826324 has already dug 100 wells around the world and is in the processing of raising additional capital
2826325 it would be ironic to say the least if kleiners first green jackpot turns out to be a company that actually drills for oil
2826326 designs microbes that when injected into oil wells increase oil production and decrease use of water
2826327 al gores carbon crusade the money and connections behind it
2826328 well im voting for barack obama hell help with global warming
2826329 it would take as long as 15 years that is until 2023 to go from starting a pilot plant to proving the technology will work
2826330 we have to store radioactive waste for 250 000 years
2826331 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
2826332 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
2826333 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
2826334 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
2826335 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
2826336 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
2826337 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
2826338 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
2826339 could easily be described as hell so hot so deadly that only a handful of the teeming billions now alive will survive
2826340 with an almighty crash the ice split right between my feet and a 300 tonne block broke off fortunately i fell on to the main part of the chunk but now it started turning round so i ended up in the water i began swimming around the chunk hoping to find a point of access to the ice there was none i was not afraid of being so close to drowning but of deserting inge and our two kids and i was furious at having agreed to do the job without proper surveillance
2826341 the benefits of strong and early action far outweigh the economic costs of not acting
2826342 a degree of warming that would surely yield dangerous climate impacts
2826343 sea level changes of several metres per century occur in the palaeoclimate record in response to forcings slower and weaker than the present human made forcing this indicates that the ice may disintegrate and melt faster than previously assumed and that the warming may be delayed less by the ice than assumed
2826344 if humanity wishes to preserve a planet similar to that on which civilisation developed and to which life on earth is adapted palaeoclimate evidence and ongoing climate change suggest that co2 will need to be reduced from its current 385ppm to at most 350ppm
2826345 low cost solar power geothermal energy some non intrusive climatic engineering or genetically engineered carbon eating trees
2826346 that about 8 of the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is absorbed by vegetation and returned to the atmosphere every year
2826347 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet
2826348 carbon tax alone wont solve climate change but we cant solve climate change without carbon pricing
2826349 areas where the sun shines and the wind blows to the cities in the east and west that need the electricity
2826350 alberta and saskatchewan for example have some of the best wind and solar resources and could benefit from better interconnections with b c and manitoba respectively
2826351 without transmission and without storage a utility cannot put more than a few new percentage points into the system
2826352 nuclear power is not renewable power its mined out of the earth and its toxic
2826353 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
2826354 its certainly technically and technologically doable and this is the sad thing it may not be politically doable
2826355 i just want to see an understanding that gore was right about the first inconvenient truth global warming but we have to recognize the second inconvenient truth which is that we dont have the means to do it right now
2826356 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
2826357 the un secretary general has not uttered a word meaning that he respects our laws and justice system why should a lesser mortal from the us say that malaysia is not up to their standards
2826358 why should gore and the us president give their evaluation of a country does he not know the meaning of the udhr universal declaration of human rights and the un charter respect for the internal affairs of a country
2826359 but if they have any substantive legal problem that they would like to highlight internationally they are welcome to discuss it with us but in a manner that is judicious careful and respectful
2826360 this will give the true picture so there will be no misconceptions that can hurt malaysias image
2826361 any judgment or directive by a court or the legal department should be upheld foreign countries should understand the malaysian legal system and that we do uphold the rule of law
2826362 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
2826363 i think he should concentrate on his environmental pursuits instead of interfering anyway he has gore d us before
2826364 various departments are engaged in this exercise the home minister will be annexing certain documents and i believe the home ministry will also be producing certain reports to augment the submission
2826365 a thirst for oil comes back to haunt a nation of gas guzzlers
2826366 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
2826367 if a person is too safe and conservative hes not likely to come up with great ideas
2826368 pick your failure apart as if you were a commentator at a golf tournament
2826369 being fired teaches you that your workplace doesnt define you as much as you thought it did
2826370 dont be too blas too self blaming or too defensive
2826371 my expectations about my previous job were off and i also lacked some of the resources i needed
2826372 we tend to overreact to failures and ignore the successful aspects of these experiences
2826373 we have to live with our feet very much rooted in reality
2826374 were pursuing renewables as well but you cant simply take away half of your energy base
2826375 to be sure reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years will require us to overcome many obstacles
2826376 it would be difficult for north carolina to meet a 10 percent renewable portfolio standard with only new north carolina renewable supply resources by 2021
2826377 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
2826378 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
2826379 in 1970 the u s imported 24 percent of its oil by 1990 it was 42 percent and today its almost 70 percent we import 70 percent of our oil at a cost of us 700 billion a year four times the annual cost of the iraq war ive been an oil man all my life but this is one emergency we cant drill our way out of but if we create a new renewable energy network we can break our addiction to foreign oil
2826380 when president john f kennedy challenged our nation to land a man on the moon and bring him back safely in 10 years many people doubted we could accomplish that goal
2826381 but eight years and two months later neil armstrong and buzz aldrin walked on the surface of the moon
2826382 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now
2826383 i have never seen an opportunity for the country like the one thats emerging now
2826384 at the least the have a lot of hatred of anybody who is enjoying life
2826385 when you connect the dots it turns out that the real solutions to the climate crisis are the very same measures needed to renew our economy and escape the trap of ever rising energy prices
2826386 because the sun doesnt shine and the wind doesnt blow all the time
2826387 the country is not going to be able to go cold turkey
2826388 we have a hundred years of infrastructure with trillions of dollars of investment that is not simply going to be made obsolete
2826389 sex science and stem cells inside the right wing assault on reason
2826390 is because as the fall elections approach i wanted to let the american public know how health policies must be based on sound science the united states is based on separation of church and state and federal public health programs ought to be based on science not on religion
2826391 the book is not targeted at opponents because frankly i dont think i will ever convince them
2826392 i wrote it for the 87 percent of americans who think public health policy should be based on sound science
2826393 thats why it angers me to think of george w bush sitting up there in the white house deciding that the welfare of a bunch of frozen embryonic cells is somehow more important than the welfare of my child or any child for that matter
2826394 there are thousands and thousands of parents just like me whose kids have diabetes or cancer or muscular dystrophy who feel the same way and there are thousands and thousands of adult children whose parents have alzheimers or parkinsons or a stroke together were counting on those embryos to see us through and take some of that weight off our shoulders and set our world right once again
2826395 bush his brainwashed flock are thee most pompous arrogant stoopid assholes ever
2826396 what seems radical to one person might appear conservative to another
2826397 sex science amp stem cells inside the right wing assault on reason
2826398 were coming to you although we feel that weve been stymied in the state legislature with a message of hope that there is an opportunity to do something very positive for the state together
2826399 what happens with this restriction that we have on embryonic stem cell research in michigan is that we are basically saying we are not going to compete nationally or globally in research
2826400 we are losing our research scientists to other states and to other places
2826401 we would go to jail for doing things that states of california and maryland and new jersey and new york and massachusetts and connecticut and other states are actually funding with state taxpayer dollars
2826402 what this proposal allows for is completely unregulated unrestricted experimentation and it would put anybody associated with this public or private beyond the law and thats just wrong
2826403 ask yerself 1 question this election do any of yer family or friends suffer from any of these deadly diseases that could be helped or cured by embryonic stem cell research
2826404 watch the disease progress in a dish that is to watch what goes right or wrong
2826405 i think well see in years ahead that this opens the door to a new way to treating degenerative diseases
2826406 do u want to be cured by a religious holy man witch doctor or a scientifically trained university educated doctor take yer pick bush yer brainwashed idiotic taliban like flock
2826407 represent a collection of degenerative diseases for which there are no good treatments and more importantly no good animal models for the most part in studying them
2826408 the hope is that this will accelerate research and it will create a climate of openness
2826409 bush his brainwashed flock are a complete utter fucking disgrace to humanity
2826410 at least for the foreseeable future and i would argue forever they are going to be extremely valuable tools

2826412 when youre looking at who to vote for this year be it president or members of congress you really need to think about science when drafting public policy

2826416 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
2826417 oh yeah but hes not as good as al gore if only al gore had won did i tell you how much i like al gore
2826418 its no good running a pig farm badly for 30 years while saying really i was meant to be a ballet dancer by then pigs will be your style
2826419 barr conceivably could be to john mccain what ralph nader was to al gore in 2000 ruinous
2826420 you have in ralph naders candidacy a genuine arab american who has a lot of notoriety and publicity it would be detrimental to obamas candidacy
2826421 obama cannot take the peace vote for granted there are peace candidates running from across the political spectrum
2826422 on the right are bob barr and chuck baldwin on the left are cynthia mckinney and ralph nader he needs to earn the vote of americans opposed to further war
2826423 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of that has got to change
2826424 gore backed his case for renewable electricity with logical case studies
2826425 the global warming climate change issue is so important that people on both sides of the issue including policymakers should be fully informed before policy is actually formulated tragically thats not happening in the global warming issue
2826426 many things we thought we knew about the climate system just a few years ago are now proving to be uncertain or quite mistaken
2826427 its become quite news worthy to go out and tell people that we are about to have an apocalyptic climate change and the moment you make that announcement its easy to go around the world and find things to support that viewpoint
2826428 the ipcc is a political organization setup by the un to provide evidence to support the framework convention on climate change its entirely political they made up what they were going to do beforehand and choose whatever science they ipcc could find to support their theory
2826429 this cuts at the heart of national sovereignty of the u s we would be saying that we would allow an international body to come in and dictate to our industries our businesses our people what they can do and what they cant do the use of what energy the sources of energy the cost of energy etc
2826430 carbon dioxide gas co2 lags behind temperature changes in history by 800 years co2 doesnt cause temperature change
2826431 based on the evidence of ice core studies at the polar ice caps it shows that co2 follows temperature not the opposite so the fundamental assumption of the whole theory of climate change by human intervention of co2 emissions causing temperature changes is wrong
2826432 human intervention accounts for a small fraction of co2 of the atmospheric gases in the atmosphere that water vapor accounts for about 97 of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere co2 accounts for 1 9 therefore man is responsible for less than 3 of all greenhouse effect in the atmosphere globally
2826433 0 55f 0 30c cooler than the 1971 2000 average
2826434 my concern is that we may be moving away from an irrational lack of concern about climate change to an equally irrational panic about it
2826435 the problem is that in this panic we are going to spend our money unwisely we will take actions that are counterproductive and we will fail to do many of those things that will benefit the environment and ourselves for example right now the clearest threat to many species is habitat destruction take the orangutans for instance one of those charismatic species that people are often fascinated by and concerned about they are endangered because of deforestation in our fear of global warming it would be sad if we fail to find funds to purchase those forests before they are destroyed and thus let this species go extinct at the heart of the matter is how much faith we decide to put in science even how much faith scientists put in science our times have benefited from clear thinking science based rationality i hope this prevails as we try to deal with our changing climate
2826436 co founder of ipcc al gore is trying to be a climate change profiteer essentially he wants to make a fortune by creating a new market for a product that he is attempting to create by legislative fiat if he succeeds and carbon emissions trading comes to the united states al gore will be uniquely positioned to cash in hes made sure of that
2826437 gore himself is chairman and founder of a private equity firm called generation investment management gim he says the london based firm invests money from institutions and wealthy investors in companies that are becoming environmentally friendly to use green parlance gim appears to have considerable influence over major carbon credit trading firms the u s based chicago climate exchange ccx and the u k based carbon neutral company cnc ccx appears to be the only firm in the u s that claims to trade carbon credits as a politician gore speaks warmly of transparency but as gim chairman gore has not been forthcoming little is known about his shadowy firms finances where it gets funding and what projects it supports

2826439 the consensus in kyoto as outlined in the ipcc report will bind america to reduce energy consumption by 25 which will have a devastating effect on the american standard of living and the u s economy it will continue to drive more industries out of america for a more global economy

2826455 the larger theme is how environmentalism seems to harm the poorest people in the poorest places on the planet
2826456 its looking at how the hysteria around global warming will affect people on low or fixed incomes it asks is there a disease and is the cure worse than the disease the science isnt settled global warming was invented five or 10 years ago
2826457 the film al gore and hollywood dont want you to see
2826458 i dont think it would be a bad thing for this earth to warm up
2826459 greenpeaces claims are based on science and the science is very clear the latest report from the uns leading scientists says that climate change is happening human activity is causing it and its a huge threat to our species
2826460 but we can prevent the worst if we act immediately to slash emissions and kickstart an energy revolution with a massive expansion of renewables and improvements in energy efficiency

2826481 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
2826482 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
2826483 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song

2826487 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here

2826579 there are more eyes looking over apple products for vulnerabilities
2826580 it has slowly been growing as a target people are more and more interested in

2826582 ive been seeing a lot of reverse engineering on the apple platform
2826583 windows developers take their code and make it work on apple
2826584 they could take potential vulnerabilities with them or possibly create new ones because they are working on an entirely different platform
2826585 it shows people are getting proficient at analyzing apple software
2826586 there are people looking at the iphone we pass vulnerabilities on to vendors and when i communicate with apple the first thing they ask is if weve tested it on the iphone they dont want to be surprised

2826596 there is a place in this world for satire but there is a time when satire ends and intolerance and bigotry towards religious beliefs of others begins
2826597 has no problem and hes cashed plenty of checks with our show making fun of christians
2826598 felt good some at bats a little tardy on other ones
2826599 hopefully its going to be best for him because he was having a problem with range of motion of his shoulder
2826600 hes playing and not really being himself as far as swinging the bat maybe this will give him a chance to get some more range of motion and maybe get the old scotty back here
2826601 the rehab is pretty intense digging pretty deep into the shoulder and the capsule trying to loosen up some tissue
2826602 when doing that and trying to play and swing a baseball bat at the same time were kind of counteracting what were doing if we give it time to cool down a little bit and get in there and dig and get after that without having to swing the bat and undo it thats hopefully going to help it recover a little better
2826603 im just going to try and take it easy on him for a while so we dont lose him again
2826604 i wont be stealing any bases but aside from that ill be all right
2826605 maybe it will change here or there but thats where i want him to hit
2826606 he was in that spot before he got hurt and well just put him back in there
2826607 we took him out a little early the other night
2826608 he was getting stiffer and stiffer as the game progressed it was getting hard to get loose he was still throwing great
2826609 were trying to not have this thing get to the point where it did last year
2826610 why do i let it keep happening over and over again

2826923 we said people have to step up today is a prime example that were capable of doing it
2826924 everything i threw was right over the middle of the plate early on especially in the first inning they were sitting on my slider thats definitely not the way i wanted to come back

2826942 children from well off families who attend private schools learn most and achieve the highest scores and low income children attending municipal or subsidized private schools present the lowest levels of educational performance
2826943 the main point we want to express today is that we reject having the profit motive inserted into education on any level elementary high school and in the university education reform is the only means we have for solving the social problems in this country

2826970 we saw a need in the area for more apartments and rental opportunities for people and wanted to build something on the north side of town
2826971 weve seen a real increase in demand from people who maybe could own a home but at this point just want to rent and want something nice
2826972 we feel like the demand is real strong and are looking forward to getting people moved in

2826984 personally if you ask me everyone enters into long term contracts why should they the iron ore miners resist it if the terms are good
2826985 our job is to put the case of mining sector we will work with the steel industries and not take any confrontationist views
2826986 there is no shortage of iron ore in the country even after exports if the steel producers want to enter into long term contracts one has to see what the proposals are
2826987 we had made our case and the government in its wisdom decided to impose the duty only time will say whether the duty served its purpose and for that an evaluation has to be made
2826988 iron ore exports have become unviable and volumes can fall by as much as 50 if the duty is not withdrawn
2826989 the pace at which they nhai are proceeding simply speaks of their interest the request for proposal rfp has to be done within three days announcement of the shortlisting it does not look like the nhai has done that abiding the norm
2826990 this leaves an uncovered net shortfall of rs 60 122 crore to be met out of the issue of special oil bonds by the government
2826991 under the nelp scheme the government stands to gain from the so called profit or revenue petroleum and natural gas which will typically accrue to the government towards the second half of the productive life of the oil or gas field

2827001 there was massive bombing of gori all evening and now we are getting reports of an imminent attack by russian tanks said spokesman shota utiashvili

2827006 gori is being bombed massively from the air and from artillery as well
2827007 there are critics though and i am one of them that think perhaps investors are not quite getting what they expect for a start the holdings in the index funds are market capitalisation weighted this sounds sensible of course except when you consider just how much the biggest companies dominate the portfolio the top one hundred stocks in america representing just 3 of the number of stocks in the index funds actually account for over 60 of the funds invested in vanguards fund
2827008 when you get down to the genuinely small capitalisation stocks there is actually very little money invested in each stock which is why it probably isnt surprising that over long periods of time the wilshire 5000 index performs pretty much the same as the big capitalisation growth stock dominated s amp p500 index
2827009 the art of creating a good portfolio is not about owning everything in market weighted proportions as the total market index does but in having significant exposure to every asset class and rebalancing the portfolio at an appropriate frequency
2827010 so if you want to take advantage of the rebalancing effect you are going to need to have a much larger small cap value exposure in your portfolio than just a couple of percent
2827011 while s amp p 500 index and total market funds make for effective pieces on an investment pie they should only be slices not the whole pie they just dont provide sufficient diversification as stand alone vehicles
2827012 the notion that compared with their large and mid cap counterparts small cap active equity managers are more likely to outperform their market segment

2827028 a picture equals thousand words in this collection of rare photographs of a rare individual history of an idea unfolds it is also a window into british india at its last stages book itself is tastefully produced and photographs are of excellent quality i strongly recommend this book gandhis letter to hitler is poignant particularly in the light of recent developments in the world where war is looming large
2827029 a brief biography along with the finest most extensive collection of gandhi photos ever published a real treat
2827030 this coffee table publication deserves to be in the library of every indian university and embassy abroad it would be one way of keeping alive the ideals and principles of the one indian with whom india is identified more than by anyone else
2827031 i have read many books about and by m k gandhi and what was lacking for me was what r he has brought to us a fantastic pictorial history i saw the book advertised in a yoga magazine and i couldnt wait to get online to order it from amazon the book is wonderful r hes love of and dedication to gandhi shines through this book and i wasnt disappointed i found the book very inspiring and moving it helped to consolidate all that i have read about gandhi otherwise my image of gandhi would have remained as a man in a loin cloth with glasses and a shaven head the pictures of his younger days are a joy to see if you also love gandhi and his ideals then i recommend that you buy this book and keep it close to hand youll never grow tired of it if anything it will inspire you and make you want to find out more about him it would also be an excellent choice for a school college or university library for me the book brought bapu to life and if i could praise r he in person i would
2827032 this book is an amazing compilation of photographs in chronological order telling you about the life and philosophy of gandhi the pictures tell the story themselves and help you get a feeling of how things really were and the true magnitude of the movement for an independent india
2827033 le bilan provisoire de la production c r ali re pour la campagne 2008 a enregistr une nette baisse en s tablissant jusquau 10 ao t en cours 17 millions de quintaux
2827034 cette importante baisse est due essentiellement aux insuffisances pluviom triques notamment dans la r gion de louest du pays o plus de 1 7 million dhectares ont t affect s par la s cheresse
2827035 pour savoir combien nous allons importer de c r ales il faut se r f rer la quantit produite ainsi qu la quantit de c r ales consomm e annuellement qui est de lordre de 60 80 millions de quintaux
2827036 vous devez fournir des efforts pour doubler voire tripler votre production c r ali re
2827037 il faut une prise de conscience collective que la s curit alimentaire est une question de souverainet nationale
2827038 nous voulons une mobilisation g n rale et les coop ratives ont un r le important jouer dans la mise en uvre de la politique de renouveau de l conomie agricole et rurale vous tes les fers de lance de cette nouvelle vision
2827039 il ne faut pas oublier que ce sont lagriculteur et l leveur qui sont les cr ateurs de richesses il est donc imp ratif que les coop rative se mobilisent pour lib rer les initiatives
2827040 la coop rative qui fuit les agriculteurs nest pas une coop rative une coop rative qui est contre les agriculteurs nest pas une coop rative cest quelque chose quon nacceptera pas
2827041 cette nouvelle vision ne doit pas tre lotage de bavardage et de racontars vous devez vous entendre sur lessentiel qui est celui de la s curit alimentaire et sortir d finitivement des d bats vaseux
2827042 je suis bien plac pour conna tre vos capacit s et vos aptitudes vous disposez dun potentiel et vous avez tous les moyens votre disposition y compris financiers
2827043 je rendrai la consid ration aux coop ratives mais cette consid ration ne sera possible que si les responsables des coop ratives sont convaincus que la s curit alimentaire est lenjeu principal
2827044 quand on dit que la s curit alimentaire est une question de souverainet nationale ce nest pas un discours creux ou de circonstance m me avec votre argent vous ne pourrez pas acheter les produits
2827045 descendez donc sur le terrain pour voir les choses mobilisez et aidez les agriculteurs

2827051 the major question historians will ask is not why the republicans surrendered but why they fought such a futile long war
2827052 it has not been unconditional surrender and it has been infinitely better than continuing to fight a futile war for the sake of honouring irelands dead yet producing only more of them but let us not labour under any illusions that the conditions were good
2827053 party leader david ford claimed today that the dup and sinn fein do not want the minister to be a member of the executive meaning he or she would have no role in wider issues like the budget
2827054 so called breakthrough over the department of justice amounts to very little
2827055 apparently all the dup and sinn fein have proposed is a minister who would not even be a member of the executive
2827056 how could anyone fulfil a role as important as justice minister in those circumstances
2827057 should be a runaway winner an eye for detail humour and history i want to be him

2827059 a brilliant mix of humour politics and insightful analysis not just of ni but of british left politics and beyond where else do you get postings in what i assume is serbo croat beside gail walker watch and the photos attaching to the stories are usually hilarious although a disappointing absence of girls aloud as naughty schoolgirls of late
2827060 for its unusual socialist outlook on northern ireland and wider politics his is the perspective of someone who feels not unreasonably that the present party political system leaves his left wing views unrepresented as such he stands aside from the traditional ni partisan discussions a refreshing interesting and nicely written blog
2827061 is written with a certain amount of linquistic flair this is a blogger who clearly enjoys his english he also enjoys reading and gives us book reviews and cultural pieces his political position is self described as liberal unionist but his views are not entirely predictable and the items rather eclectic including a fascination with and dislike for ethnic nationalism in its east european manifestations
2827062 chekov really has a penchant for writing in a way that really grasps the reader
2827063 i hate to say it but chekov does write well
2827064 passionate unionism epitomising the pan uk unionist approach oneill synthesises an incredible amount of material for this blog a blogger with a genuine grasp of his subject
2827065 for the fact that he is in public office and combines council business and interesting outlooks generally
2827066 but only since pol omuiri came on board since then it has moved beyond a party political platform to something more considered and interesting
2827067 a group blog fairly closely associated with an identifiable political party is quite a good thing as it provides a picture of that partys id as well as a space for them to develop their thinking about issues that they will sometimes have to answer for their stance on soonish
2827068 a wee part of the blogosphere where i can be found and i shamelessly do so because it will permit me to state that the blog in question has been nominated four times in political blog categories and lost four times
2827069 i agree with its tone and attitude regarding the north of ireland situation
2827070 ignited has a grasp of the nuts and bolts of politics which i envy reading his pieces always make me view my own stuff as a bit conceptual and airy fairy a blog which is in touch with the unionist grass roots
2827071 fair deal is one of the very few bloggers delivering a dup standpoint in a thoughtful manner i rarely agree with what he says but hes always worth reading damian oloan is an excellent new addition writing coherent and temperate analysis from a liberal nationalist perspective an encouraging indication that moderation is not dead
2827072 fair deal damian oloan tom griffin patrick corrigan and very occasionally ian parsley all are delivering thoughtful and coherent articles analysing different areas of political life here
2827073 almost intimidating erudition from brian crowe as he examines the world from communitarian conservative perspective
2827074 where language literature and politics intersect some thoughtful musings on identity in relation to northern ireland from an irish ex pat
2827075 a tyrone ex pats whimsical blog where politics is viewed through the filters of sport travel identity and more recently fiction
2827076 a new collaborative venture by a number of bloggers braodly on the left it deals in political social and cultural issues as well as some humour
2827077 possibly the most impressive blog there are serious and thoughtful pieces virtually every day on a huge range of topics
2827078 serving up an interesting mix of investigative journalism and local interest
2827079 david vance really out posts the other contributors and hes from the north though id say that his focus is a good deal wider but his stuff on ni is quite astute
2827080 the ira have clearly gone off the stage and have done so since 2005 but theres still attempts being made by some people to drag them back on and i think thats silly
2827081 if were trying to build a normal modern democratic european society there is no excuse for holding onto weapons and ive already started that debate
2827082 i have asked that they produce an ad hoc report clarifying its assessment of the completion of the transformation of pira as set out in its 18th report
2827083 the notion that there has been a steady increase in favour of women taking an equal role in the workplace and away from their traditional role in the home is clearly a myth
2827084 creationism is not for the re class because i believe that it can stand scientific scrutiny and that is a debate which i am quite happy to encourage and be part of the issue for the current education minister caitriona ruane is that she tells us shes all for equality surely if that is the case you cant have one set of interpretations being taught at the expense of others
2827085 the use of the word theory can mislead those not familiar with science
2827086 this is due to an increased disillusionment with current sinn fein strategy i no longer share the belief that this strategy will lead to irish unification it is not just solely about policing i am disillusioned with the current political strategy

2827100 sophisticated optical devices that are mechanically robust yet fully biodegradable biocompatible and implantable dont exist today
2827101 such systems would greatly expand the use of current optical technologies in areas like human and livestock health environmental monitoring and food quality
2827102 for example at a low cost we could potentially put a bioactive silk film in every bag of spinach and it could give the consumer a readout of whether or not e coli bacteria were in the bag before the food was consumed
2827103 we have optical devices embedded with enzymes that are still active after almost a year of storage at room temperature this is amazing given that the same enzyme becomes inactive if forgotten and left unrefrigerated for a few days
2827104 we see huge potential in this area and want to participate in the growth of this east region the acquisition enables brenntag to enter the market in the ukraine and substantially increases our presence in russia furthermore this cooperation is an ideal foothold to enhance brenntags attractiveness for suppliers and customers in fields such as food cosmetics construction paint amp varnish and oil amp gas we are very excited about this acquisition and we are looking forward to future development

2827147 absolutely theres a lot of truth to what the president said and in terms of wall street there was too much leverage in the system and more leverage than was appropriate and more than people recognized because the leverage came into the system in the form of highly complex structured products which were difficult to understand
2827148 there is no question about it wall street got drunk
2827149 thats one reason i asked you to turn off your tv cameras
2827150 the question is how long will it take to sober up and not try to do all these fancy financial instruments
2827151 we have of course one priority getting through this period with as little damage as little negative impact as possible on the economy but the second part is to take steps to reduce the likelihood of these sorts of things happening in the future
2827152 i will do everything i can to make for a smooth transition to work closely with my successor in treasury to do everything i can to help out but im focused on getting everything done i can get done between now and january 19th
2827153 we sized that program to say how could we do something that will be meaningful this year but not so big that it would jeopardize some of our long term priorities and our fiscal priorities and balancing the budget so again my view would be lets see how this program works in the third quarter
2827154 whats this fellow trying to do theres so much space to go through
2827155 a year ago you were skin and bones wahhh trained alot
2827156 its not often that a man comes along that gives so much to his community mr bradley has had a career of giving that has spanned generations with his experience on the school board as a legislator and as the bartow county court clerk for many years
2827157 he made efforts to improve situations when he stood a good chance of being penalized by those that were in control
2827158 he made a real contribution to the community he treated everybody alike and he ran a very efficient office
2827159 i remember him as someone who thoroughly enjoyed people very dedicated to the county to making sure that records and history of the county were preserved
2827160 to me he was the same every day every time you saw him he was friendly he was helpful he was outgoing he took time to sit and visit or he took time to sit and listen
2827161 to see what is in front of ones nose needs a constant struggle
2827162 his domestic diaries show that orwell was a very enthusiastic and conscientious gardener and farmer
2827163 he would detail the state of the weather what he had planted what needed to be pruned etc
2827164 they expose his tremendous hungry empiricism revealing the keen alert ever noting ever observing facts writer he was
2827165 is one of the tools that produces the extraordinary political independence of mind that people value him for
2827166 one would get a very puzzled view as to what sort of person he was and one would miss all the strength of his political criticism all the strength of his literary criticism
2827167 they make the decision who makes the team and who sits on the bench we hope they exercise that power to get this problem stopped
2827168 this is so much larger a problem than the general public is aware of
2827169 our first objective is raising awareness about how big of a problem it really is and not just continuing to deny that it is not going on in my school or district second is to educate parents coaches and teachers about how dangerous this drug really is
2827170 it is not typical of what we usually run into with the coaching community nationally
2827171 the kids sometimes dont like to hear it because its hard work to do it the right way and coaches are sometimes hesitant to deal with the steroid problem because that might be their starting quarterback or whatever hopefully we left them with the message that it can be a life or death issue
2827172 a champion for working families and one of the most effective and empathetic voices in the country today
2827173 because i know from just what im hearing that theres incredible pent up desire and i think that people want to feel like ok its a catharsis were here we did it and then everybody get behind sen obama that is what most people believe is the best way to go
2827174 i think what were looking for is energy and excitement
2827175 all i wanted to do was make it to tomorrow to conserve energy and make it to the final
2827176 i need to bank as much rest as possible and as much sleep as i can and not get run down
2827177 i kind of expected that with the preliminaries at night and the finals in the morning
2827178 subconsciously you are trying really hard because it is night
2827179 a champion for working families and one of the most effective and empathetic voices in the country today
2827180 because i know from just what im hearing that theres incredible pent up desire and i think that people want to feel like ok its a catharsis were here we did it and then everybody get behind sen obama that is what most people believe is the best way to go
2827181 i think what were looking for is energy and excitement
2827182 its kind of disappointing when you talk it up and talk it up and then nothing happens
2827183 the houston area got most of the rain today two to four inches
2827184 with instability caused by the low pressure we could still see a 50 percent chance of rainfall throughout the day
2827185 luckily the subprime mortgage bubble in the us pricked the bubble in the making for the philippine stock market
2827186 opportunities will arise on selected stocks that have strong fundamental value with stable returns and hold growth potentials
2827187 if i havent lost my hearing and my voice by the end of the night then i havent done my job and if you havent lost yours well then
2827188 i cant believe we dont win a race in three or four weeks and were in a slump
2827189 it was a big hit for a bunch of guys
2827190 we were ready to attack i know with nine to go you get up on the wheel and push hard pushing and shoving is ok but that was crazy i guess there wasnt much place to go they kept pushing and shoving

2827200 it is extremely important to maintain the security and integrity of the fare media systems
2827201 with an insecure compromised system even basic revenue controls to name one example become significantly challenging
2827202 if you prevent legitimate researchers from talking about their findings its not going to stop people from finding vulnerabilities its going to stop the good guys from talking about them and from learning from each other
2827203 the bad guys are still going to be looking for the vulnerabilities and still be finding them
2827204 this is going to be quick and dirty today no cute cartoons no philosophizing we havent time for any of that today
2827205 its not every day you can say you topped the charts at the cup level
2827206 i wanted to go 4 03 i didnt know if i would
2827207 to be honest i didnt really feel that great and then going into the ready room i started getting chills up my body right then and there i was starting to get more and more excited i mean i was pretty emotional after that race and im pretty excited to have that first one under my belt
2827208 i wasnt comfortable after the first 200 after seeing everybody so close together
2827209 thats usually not how it as after the first 200 i think it made my breaststroke a lot stronger and at that point it was all adrenaline
2827210 i knew i had to go out fast in order to be in the race
2827211 if i was like a couple tenths slower on the backstroke i think i wouldve had a better shot i think that backstroke kind of took a lot out of me i did my best and i cant ask for anything else
2827212 i saw him after the race and he nodded and waved the american flag
2827213 its a pretty special feeling i waved and nodded my head back
2827214 i think were really happy with silver because i dont think we were even expecting to get that
2827215 i felt great i felt like i had more energy so im really psyched about my 50
2827216 i wanted to go 4 03 i didnt know if i would
2827217 to be honest i didnt really feel that great and then going into the ready room i started getting chills up my body right then and there i was starting to get more and more excited i mean i was pretty emotional after that race and im pretty excited to have that first one under my belt

2827235 the main reason for the armed resistance is the american military presence
2827236 if the american military begins to withdrawal there will be no need for these armed groups
2827237 i can assure you hand on heart that i know nothing of this whatsoever
2827238 i think the national party is trying to divert this onto who did it
2827239 essentially pollution reaches peoples lungs even if they stay inside on high pollution days
2827240 there is no escape from wood smoke pollution particularly in older wooden houses during winter temperature inversions in christchurch or anywhere else
2827241 although the health impact isnt great there were small decreases in lung function during very high pollution days for boys with asthma
2827242 this is the first time that this urine test has been used to detect exposure to wood smoke pollution in new zealand
2827243 its the hoary old work for the dole when actually weve focussed on getting people into real jobs and thats why even in a year of slow down weve just had employment figures come in which are still under four percent its a complete waste of time trying to enforce work for the dole
2827244 the real way to help children out of poverty is to help their parents get a good job and move up the employment ladder that helps them and the children as well
2827245 but then thats what the whole investigation is looking at and from the reading ive been doing asbestos exposure can take many years to come through

2827259 wir haben milit rische intervention von milosevics serbien in den anderen ehemaligen jugoslawischen staaten zum schutze der serbischen pass inhaber nicht akzeptiert und wir haben grund uns daran zu erinnern wie hitler genau dieselbe doctrin wenig mehr als vor einem halben jahrhundert verwendete um wesentliche teile zentraleuropas zu untergraben und anzugreifen
2827260 die eu und die nato m ssen die initiative ergreifen
2827261 prelude to a major aggression by nato eu and u s in the caucasus
2827262 j erusalem owns a strong interest in caspian oil and gas pipelines reach the turkish terminal port of ceyhan rather than the russian network
2827263 we did not accept military intervention by milosevics serbia in other former yugoslav states on the grounds of protecting serbian passport holders and we have reason to remember how hitler used this very doctrine little more than half a century ago to undermine and attack substantial parts of central europe
2827264 the eu and nato must take the initiative and stand up against the spread of imperialist and revisionist policy in the east of europe by all available means the russian federation has overstepped a red line
2827265 optakt til en omfattende aggression af nato eu og usa i kaukasus den russiske regering styrker sine tropper i abkhasien da i flg deres efterretninger natokandidaten georgien aktivt forbereder en invasion og har trukket 1500 soldater sammen i kodori dalen
2827266 jerusalem har en st rk interesse i at kaspiske olie og gasledninger n r den tyrkiske terminalhavn i ceyhan snarere end det russiske net intense forhandlinger er i gang mellem israel tyrkiet georgien turkmenistan og aserbajdsjan om r rledninger der n r til tyrkiet og derfra til israels olie terminal i ashkelon og videre til dets r de hav havn i eilat herfra kan supertankere transportere gas og olie til fjern sten gennem det indiske ocean
2827267 vi accepterede ikke milit r intervention af milosevics serbien i andre tidligere jugoslaviske stater for at beskytte indehavere af serbiske pas og vi har grund til at huske hvordan hitler brugte selvsamme doktrin for mere end et halvt rhundrede siden for at underminere og angribe v sentlige dele af centrale
2827268 eu og nato m tage initiative t og st op mod spredningen af imperialistisk og revisionistisk politik i steuropa med alle til r dighed st ende midler den russiske f deration hars overskredet en r d linie
2827269 i tell you again and again my brethren that in the lords garden are to be found not only the roses of his martyrs in it there are also the lilies of the virgins the ivy of wedded couples and the violets of widows on no account may any class of people despair thinking that god has not called them
2827270 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2827271 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2827272 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2827273 alertar os condutores para a import ncia de uma condu o atenta e para as consequ ncias nefastas que ac es como fumar usar o telem vel e consumir lcool podem provocar quando se conduz
2827274 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2827275 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2827276 does the 48 kilogram division mean they weigh 48kg or that they lift 48kg
2827277 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2827278 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2827279 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2827293 todays decision is unacceptable and an insult to the people of lesbos and their three thousand year long history
2827294 the decision means that we will appeal instantly to a higher court and at the appropriate time to the european court of human rights
2827295 the controversial words at stake should not be seen as an insult to an individuals personality nationality or social standing and should not be taken as an individual or collective insult the people of lesbos
2827296 the decision by the court will not stop the effort of hundreds of thousands of lesbian islanders to fight for the right to maintain their name separately from a that of a sexual deviation it is a misguided ruling so we have decided to take the matter to the highest courts both in greece and europe
2827297 they can do what they want with their bodies and they can call themselves what they want but not lesbians
2827298 claiming that the word insults their history is racist and ridiculous
2827299 it is a word that has evolved harmlessly from history and mythology and under no circumstances is intended to offend the islanders or those many people around the world who originate from this island

2827313 the party workers claimed that the number of marathi people allowed to appear in the test was less in terms of percentage as compared to those from other states
2827314 they knew about the venue as it was advertised three months ago in newspapers

2827316 women suffering from postpartum psychosis lose touch with reality and might have hallucinations and hear imaginary voices they suspect those around them and may also have thought disorders which include violent behaviour and irrelevant incoherent talk

2827330 the fundamentals of the euro area are sound and the euro area does not suffer from major imbalances
2827331 look through the volatility in quarter on quarter growth rates and monthly indicators
2827332 im very upset at the case the fact that there could have been problems with this gentlemans care
2827333 but i dont want them to break any laws either
2827334 we believe unapologetically that veterans do deserve to be taken care of first
2827335 wed stop buying equipment stop doing much needed maintenance and divert money to maintain employment
2827336 the cadre of people who were working as facilities directors knew that that was the way of life so we adapted to it but it was a very unfortunate situation for the veteran population
2827337 all were asking them to do is fund va at the level that is needed not at the level the government wants to spend
2827338 i dont think anyone is suggesting that we stiff our veterans but there is a level of flexibility that you need to have in the discretionary budget
2827339 theres no psychology involved in this its just elbow grease thats all it is action
2827340 they want to show their appreciation for the sacrifice these troops are making and they want to do it in an honest way not a patronizing way
2827341 we work very hard at what we do and we like to pass some of that knowledge on to the next generation
2827342 this right here is a simple silly little way to get a point across that you can accomplish something
2827343 im going to show you two things a straight line and a curve and you can go into any museum in the world and all the masterpieces started with that
2827344 this technique is not going to make you a master but its going to get you in the ballpark
2827345 id see things out of the corner of my eye id see shadows
2827346 id be suspicious of things they were out of place i didnt sleep well
2827347 you dont talk about anxiety thats not part of the culture
2827348 the medication were using is the same numbing medication that has been used for decades for pregnant women during labor and delivery
2827349 i found that one part of the brain that works on hot flashes and ptsd is the same the insular cortex
2827350 it resets the nerve system the way god built it
2827351 its a treatment for anxiety that comes out of ptsd
2827352 i noticed i wasnt tense i wasnt looking around i was just calm
2827353 after seeing many of the servicemen and women struggle financially in the service i knew this was a path i needed to follow
2827354 the fact that kristen is a female is very exciting because the makeup of the military is changing and includes more females now
2827355 being a female veteran is just going to help ensure amesbury veterans are represented as best as they can be
2827356 i at least have some basic understanding of where he is coming from not only his frustrations but the positive experiences he may have had
2827357 what i lack in combat experience i make up for in my energy and my knowledge and resourcefulness
2827358 im very very confident that these attributes will serve me well and the veterans and their families
2827359 the two requirements for the position are to be an honorably discharged veteran and to have at least a high school diploma
2827360 in kristens case she is an honorably discharged navy veteran who happens to also have a masters degree in social work and extensive experience working with the homeless population
2827361 she has brought a new level of professionalism to what the veterans service officers duties require and demand
2827362 what i really love about the amesbury position and the position of veterans service officer is that there are so many different avenues that i can explore to help veterans
2827363 im able to provide one on one case management im able to advocate for veterans on the larger scale and i can communicate with key members of the community on veterans issues its just everything rolled into one
2827364 part of the frustration some of the veterans feel is that they are not being heard
2827365 when you are depending on a system to provide benefits and not feeling like you can get an answer from that system its really frustrating
2827366 i just want to wake up at 6 a m every day go to a job and come home to my family i just want to be normal again
2827367 i remember my younger sister savannah was born at 6 29 p
2827368 he said at his canton home on a recent furlough
2827369 but i met someone i grew up with and i didnt know his name
2827370 when i woke up i didnt know my last name my rank or what a square was
2827371 he had lost 40 pounds and was still black and blue
2827372 we were numb our son was the shell of who he had been
2827373 i say come spend a few days with us and you will see
2827374 his problems didnt bother me they drew me to him even more
2827375 i thought she would think i was stupid because i stuttered
2827376 i told her once that she needed to leave i didnt deserve anyone
2827377 i tell them to focus on respect compassion and love for each other
2827378 i told him that he came out pretty darn good though and people look up to him for his honors
2827379 the treadmill was running but he was unresponsive lying on the floor
2827380 they could go to the bathroom they could get a sandwich or whatever
2827381 the rappers have gone in and created a lot of hit music based upon my influence
2827382 i knew nothing about the business or trends and things like that
2827383 i think it was a matter of timing i didnt know what was unfolding
2827384 a person that speaks his mind hes sensitive enough to care for children hes wise enough to not be put into the whack category like everybody else in town and he l o o o o ves the ladies
2827385 there is a place in this world for satire but there is a time when satire ends and intolerance and bigotry towards religious beliefs of others begins

2827391 da wir mit dem kardinal bei hrdlicka waren und ihn den gr ten zeitgen ssischen sterreichischen bildhauer gebeten haben ein auftragswerk der seligen maria restituta zu machen
2827392 im dom oder schon etwas entt uscht rund um den dom
2827393 er hat sich selber gewundert da es nicht vorher schon rger gab und ich bei meiner er ffnungsrede versucht habe dieser provokation dieser blasphemischen darstellung einen ort zu geben
2827394 hrdlicka sagt ja immer so stolz und provokativ ich bin stalinist ich bin kommunist mit derselben berechtigung zur provokation k nnte ich sagen f r mich ist hrdlicka nat rlich ein christ
2827395 wenn er nicht ganz eng am christlichen leben dran ist wer ist es dann
2827396 aber in der ausstellung waren vierzig werke hrdlickas aus dem gro en uvre das sich mit religi sen themen befa t
2827397 aber ich mu z hneknirschend akzeptieren da es f r ihn der als erzbischof f r das ganze stehen mu letztlich doch nicht in frage kam
2827398 wir sind in ein sehr ernsthaftes gespr ch mit ihm eingetreten hatten ihn fast berzeugt aber ich mu z hneknirschend akzeptieren da es f r ihn der als erzbischof f r das ganze stehen mu letztlich doch nicht in frage kam das bild h ngenzulassen
2827399 ich wei wie tief hermann nitsch das religi se das christliche opfer der eucharistie verstehen kann
2827400 ich freue mich wahnsinnig da wir f r so einen gewaltigen k nstler wie alfred hrdlicka ansprechpartner sind
2827401 wenn hermann nitsch die monstranz aus einem geschlachteten lamm herausnimmt und ausstellt ist es genau das was ich jeden tag bei einer messe sage und tue seht das lamm gottes
2827402 wenn ich auf einen gekreuzigten den gottesknecht sehe dann bin ich bei hrdlicka gut aufgehoben da erfahre ich diese spur des menschlichen leidens nicht ohne sinn
2827403 ich wei wie tief er das religi se das christliche opfer der eucharistie verstehen kann
2827404 wenn er die monstranz aus einem geschlachteten lamm herausnimmt und ausstellt ist es genau das was ich jeden tag bei einer messe sage und tue seht das lamm gottes

2827409 laura and i just had the great joy and privilege of worshipping here in beijing
2827410 you know it just goes to show that god is universal and god is love and no state man or woman should fear the influence of loving religion
2827411 america stands in firm opposition to chinas detention of political dissidents and human rights advocates and religious activists
2827412 we press for openness and justice not to impose our beliefs but to allow the chinese people to express theirs
2827413 this trip has reaffirmed my belief that men and women who aspire to speak their conscience and worship their god are no threat to the future of china

2827420 another letter also come to me from mr hater committed by the council this afternoon to the gate house upon the misfortune of having his name used by one without his knowledge or privity for the receiving of some powder that he had bought up to court about these two and for the former was led up to my lady castlemaynes lodgings where the king and she and others were at supper and there i read the letter and returned and then to sir g carteret about hater and shall have him released to morrow upon my giving bail for his appearance which i have promised to do sir g carteret did go on purpose to the king to ask this and it was granted

2827434 anakin did some really horrible things leading up to becoming darth vader
2827435 but at the end of the one with luke he saved luke from the emporer he thought about it and wanted to save him
2827436 yes he did in the end he had just enough good left inside him that he was able to choose to save his son
2827437 but in empire strikes back he cut off lukes hand luke didnt know he was his father and darth vader told him he knew
2827438 i know honey he had become evil he was a very bad person thats why it is so important for us to learn how to handle our anger and other emotions in good ways and not lose control
2827439 we also have to be careful that we do what we think is right no matter what our friends tell us or what they are doing if we dont do our best to choose right over wrong we can begin making bad choices that can affect how we live the rest of our lives but darth vader also shows us in the end that no matter how bad we have been or become we can always choose to do the right thing and become good again

2827481 theres no doubt in my mind ill out run the bear out weave the bear i wont run in a straight line i can imagine the bear running 30 40 miles an hour and is probably somewhere between 700 and 1 000 pounds im not getting caught by this bear
2827482 i have great respect for this man but he is wrong the fastest human ever clocked ran 27 miles an hour a black bear can run 30 miles an hour a grizzly bear can run 35 miles an hour theyre not big predators they dont have the body form for a lot of dodging on four legs they can do better than a person on two legs
2827483 for the sake of fun here lets say the bear does try to catch him and he tries to dodge and get around the bear then he has the dash to the goal line with the bear able to outmaneuver him with four legs
2827484 this might sound insane but at some point you have to attack the bear if you know hes coming after you
2827485 you have to go right at him and then dodge him i know the bear runs 30 40 miles an hour but dr rogers that fastest person was not running for his life im running from this bear the minute i feel like the bear is close to me im zigging and zagging
2827486 if hes coming toward the bear and the bear is coming toward him i would not be surprised if antwaan could dodge him the first time
2827487 rumors followed everywhere we went keeping a secret became hard when there wasnt a secret to start it turned out a picture of the two of us had been leaked to the redskins christy was fired from cheerleading two weeks after we started dating since her big paycheck 75 a game had come to an end at least the sneaking around was over as we moved through the season i fell in love with her we went through a lot of weird stuff but it never fazed either of us maybe her dad brainwashed me one of the nights i passed out at her house because no matter what happened i was crazy about her more likely it was her mom since i was usually trying to impress the old man by drinking him under the table

2827557 obviously there are going to be some significant changes within the shadow ministerial make up and thats something that i will be announcing later on this week

2827581 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
2827582 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
2827583 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
2827584 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
2827585 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
2827586 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
2827587 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
2827588 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
2827589 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
2827590 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
2827591 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
2827592 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
2827593 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas

2827596 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
2827597 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
2827598 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
2827599 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
2827600 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
2827601 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
2827602 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
2827603 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
2827604 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
2827605 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
2827606 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
2827607 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
2827608 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
2827609 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
2827610 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
2827611 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
2827612 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
2827613 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
2827614 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
2827615 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence

2827621 honestly just who are trying to keep in in these places
2827622 the correct questions are in no particular order what do you want to know
2827623 figured we might as well aim for first base too
2827624 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
2827625 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
2827626 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
2827627 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
2827628 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
2827629 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
2827630 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
2827631 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
2827632 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
2827633 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
2827634 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
2827635 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
2827636 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
2827637 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
2827638 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
2827639 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
2827640 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
2827641 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
2827642 i havent gone on about her too much have i
2827643 cant be nothing rose what do you want to know

2827647 ten number ten hello pleasure to make your acquaintance rose tyler
2827648 youre closer to thirteen and its all because of me
2827649 not your fault you saved the world rose least i could do really
2827650 but dont you i dont think you regret it for a moment do you i think it never even crossed your mind
2827651 what let you die let the tardis burn you out not for a second not for a nanosecond youre worth a thousand lives
2827652 should really get up there and dust one of these days think we picked up a spider in the 1600s
2827653 tomorrow that is you just watch me do it tomorrow
2827654 joan miss redfern miss joan naw well i never really knew her did i
2827655 i cant believe you never thought of falling in love
2827656 whereas love is something youd never come across in a million years
2827657 i dont know rose but i know you and doctor
2827658 nothing at all and anyway it doesnt matter does it shes gone
2827659 rose is here in this room every day you have to know you never stop thinking about her not for a moment do you and how can you not realise that shes everywhere and you dont love her
2827660 course i love rose and i love you and but there was a time a long time ago when it was rose and me i was so different then martha you wouldnt have liked me and she saved me oh saved me a thousand times over id have done anything for her anything at all whatever she asked me for all of me i was hers
2827661 she was so happy and she saved me and now ive lost her and i cant even remember how it
2827662 so its not just that you were turning human that you didnt think to plan for it
2827663 its that you really truly thought you couldnt fall in love again
2827664 that cant be right i cant have oh martha whats happened to me
2827665 why dyou follow me out here why do you always come with me when i ask
2827666 because you take me places and show me things that id never learn in twenty lifetimes
2827667 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
2827668 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
2827669 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
2827670 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
2827671 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment

2827675 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
2827676 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
2827677 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
2827678 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
2827679 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
2827680 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
2827681 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
2827682 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
2827683 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
2827684 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
2827685 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
2827686 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
2827687 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
2827688 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
2827689 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
2827690 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
2827691 who are open to doing something on the production side
2827692 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
2827693 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
2827694 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
2827695 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
2827696 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
2827697 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
2827698 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
2827699 the territorial integrity of georgia must be respected the russian air attacks on georgian territory must stop immediately

2827704 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
2827705 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough

2827745 but we wouldnt have made the team final without her strong bars so she kept it together there
2827746 then on the beam where you need the most stability of course a little bit of tape just wasnt going to do it
2827747 they always say the strength of a team is not so much your superstars your no 1 or no 2 that the strength of a team is your numbers three four or five and those girls came through today

2827749 but we made it through to the team finals and its a clean slate i think in the team final well toughen up a little bit

2827837 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection
2827838 we had one that we used in a sting for school zones
2827839 hopefully well have the new one by the time school starts again
2827840 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
2827841 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
2827842 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
2827843 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
2827844 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
2827845 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
2827846 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
2827847 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
2827848 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
2827849 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
2827850 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
2827851 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
2827852 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
2827853 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
2827854 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
2827855 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
2827856 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
2827857 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
2827858 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
2827859 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that

2827868 assuming that one estimated the value of a piece of music according to how much of it could be counted calculated and expressed in formulas how absurd would such a scientific estimation of music be
2827869 never doubt that a small group of thoughtful committed citizens can change the world indeed it is the only thing that ever has
2827870 if you possess a thousand contradictory aphorisms you have knowledge if you know when to apply each one you have wisdom
2827871 the man who has no tincture of philosophy goes through life imprisoned in the prejudices derived from common sense from the habitual beliefs of his age or his nation and from convictions which have grown up in his mind without the cooperation or consent of his deliberate reason to such a man the world tends to become definite finite obvious common objects rouse no questions and unfamiliar possibilities are contemptuously rejected as soon as we begin to philosophize we find that even the most everyday things lead to problems to which only very incomplete answers can be given
2827872 as long as the world shall last there will be wrongs and if no man objected and no man rebelled those wrongs would last forever

2827885 that was a 0 0 ballgame at the time they get some runs there and you never know
2827886 usually it comes down to one big hit i think thats what it comes down to in most of my starts is one big hit that makes a big inning i didnt have that there was the bases loaded but we got out of it and i got the job done from there
2827887 we got some timely hits but it starts with pitching

2827910 no one has any time in their holiday schedule to explore anything else because clubs like space and privilege have sucked everybody up
2827911 people are now given less opportunity to think for themselves its like a shepherd and sheep mentality people follow each other and they feel like they have to have good time because of the amount of money theyve spent on their night
2827912 sometimes i find it frustrating trying to compete because theres such a reliance on advertising over here

2827929 georgia is a small country there is not much space a lot of people are very nervous because they have family in the military or who live in gori they say today they have bombed a country house who knows the situation is really very difficult
2827930 it feels like everyone is looking at us but they are not making a strong decision i think we expected a stronger decision from the west but i dont think russian is listening they dont listen to any international law because they are powerful they may finish suddenly but after this it will be the same thing russia will cut one part and then another part

2827965 when you discuss security issues if you are telling the truth that should be something protected at the core of the first amendment
2827966 if you are truthfully telling the world about a dangerous situation and it is a situation which is dangerous not because the security researcher exposes the vulnerability but because the person who made the product made the vulnerability then this should be core speech
2827967 knowingly causes the transmission of a program information code or command to a computer or computer system
2827968 the statute on its face appears to be discussing sending code or similar types of information to a computer
2827969 it does not appear to contemplate somebody who is giving a talk to humans nevertheless the court believed that the act of giving a presentation to a group of humans was covered by the computer fraud computer intrusion statute we believe this is wrong
2827970 basically what the court is suggesting here is that giving a presentation involving security to other security researchers is a violation of federal law

2827982 the georgians are euphoric because they have been equipped trained that they have gained military experience in iraq it feeds this revanchist mood how can south ossetia be demilitarized when all of georgia is bristling with weaponry and its only an hours ride by tank from tbilisi to tskhinvali
2827983 oh just the prospect of a larger regional war that could drag in russia
2827984 thousands are fleeing south ossetia to the russian region of north ossetia alania the united nations reported friday

2827995 it is dangerous to want a free press in russia
2827996 georgia returned the favor committing thousands of troops to the multi national coalition in iraq last fall the georgians doubled their contingent making them the third largest contributor to the coalition
2827997 they dont care about the ossetians all they see is the pipelines running across georgia and the oil under the ground

2828000 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2828001 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2828002 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2828003 the core name is and will be our flagship pc processor brand going forward
2828004 when you go to an integrated memory controller you reduce a substantial portion of the memory latency between the processor and the system memory and typically the initial access memory latency is a big determinant of performance
2828005 typically you can get a performance increase of anywhere between 10 and 25 percent when you fix that latency problem
2828006 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2828007 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2828008 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2828009 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2828010 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2828014 the teachings of christ suggest that we should begin our search for an eternal companion
2828015 indeed it may be our own capacity to give love that makes us most lovable
2828016 for intelligence cleaveth unto intelligence wisdom receiveth wisdom truth embraceth truth virtue loveth virtue light cleaveth unto light
2828017 see that ye bridle all your passions that ye may be filled with love
2828018 the greatest deception foisted upon the human race in our day is overemphasis of physical gratification as it is related to romantic love it is merely a repetition of the same delusion that has been impressed on every generation in ages past when we learn that physical gratification is only incident to and not the compelling force of love itself we have made a supreme discovery
2828019 as a righteous couple grow and mature in their love they will come to know that the fine blending of the spiritual and physical dimensions of their relationship forms a solid foundation for their eternal union
2828020 thou shalt love thy wife with all thy heart and shalt cleave unto her and none else
2828021 giving ourselves to one another in an eternal marriage is an unconditional giving of the whole person for the whole journey
2828022 when challenges come and our individual weaknesses are revealed the remedy is to repent improve and apologize not to separate or divorce

2828050 it was a dark grey object and it was flying parallel to the ground
2828051 i dont want to get as i said last night prematurely stressed about it
2828052 nobody can walk down the street and be safe that is be free from police interference
2828053 they know exactly whos doing the shooting the robbery but it seems like were never going to get any justice around here
2828054 we got kids down here they should lock up these young folks that have been doing the shooting dont put us hostage or on lockdown
2828055 i still treat him like a rookie and keep him low
2828056 i dont beat him up but i give him the least amount of praise
2828057 its been like that since day one he never gives me credit for anything
2828058 maybe two days ago i made a good play on an interception and he said this is the first time im putting
2828059 hes helped all three of us a ton he just seems to know every answer to every question
2828060 yeah it kind of feels weird because im a young guy but compared to the rookies i am pretty much the oldest one out there
2828061 those guys come to me asking questions and stuff like that ive been there so i know what theyre going through right now it just feels good to help those guys out
2828062 its just the ups and downs of the season in the league
2828063 you cant lean on what you did in the past youve got to keep building each and every year you never know what the stats are i dont try to look into the stats or anything i just try to go out there and give it my all
2828064 these players expect you during the course of the game to make calls according to what you see
2828065 if you know it dont be afraid being a safety that position tells you that you have to dictate even though you might feel uncomfortable because the guys on the outside the cornerbacks might be older than you if you know what the call is and its what its supposed to be you have to be strong in your convictions to know that were going to do it this way and this is how well play the guys will respect that and i think hes understanding that
2828066 lightning speed i would love to just get there i always feel like theres never enough time in the day like the day is moving too fast so if i was the superhero flash i would just go and be out
2828067 a champion for working families and one of the most effective and empathetic voices in the country today
2828068 because i know from just what im hearing that theres incredible pent up desire and i think that people want to feel like ok its a catharsis were here we did it and then everybody get behind sen obama that is what most people believe is the best way to go
2828069 i think what were looking for is energy and excitement

2828072 celebrities like that the most valuable thing they have is their time and for them to year after year come to north carolina in august to play golf is a commitment
2828073 im just happy that i can be a part of all this
2828074 ive always helped raise money because its a good cause but now when the cause hits you personally youve got to come got to be a part of it

2828076 it was totally the most incredible they did it so fast
2828077 time is muscle and we in the first quarter of 2008 saw no instances of congestive heart failure
2828078 in other words not only did we save lives but we saved patients ability to maintain muscle function and not be crippled with congestive heart failure
2828079 weve cut it down to 50 to 60 minutes at our most recent observation
2828080 they can prepare so it cuts down on having to repeat that same process and ask the same questions so we do it out in the field and dont have to worry about it when we get to the emergency department

2828087 kids will take a chance if they dont know theyll have a go theyre not afraid of being wrong if youre not prepared to be wrong youll never come up with anything original by the time they are adults kids have lost that capacity they have become afraid of being wrong but as they grow up in the classroom and the workplace we stigmatize mistakes we are now running national education systems where mistakes are the worst thing you can make the result is we are educating people out of their creative capacities why is this

2828102 the georgians are just getting on with things its business as usual its only some of the charity workers who have evacuated
2828103 they poked us and stabbed us with the machetes and they were asking for money specifically dollars
2828104 we had a few quetzales guatemalas currency but we had no dollars with us on the boat
2828105 i said we need help i said my husband was not moving
2828106 the lord is compassionate and gracious slow to anger abounding in love he will not always accuse nor will he harbor his anger forever he does not treat us as our sins deserve or repay us according to our iniquities for as high as the heavens are above the earth so great is his love for those who fear him as far as the east is from the west so far has he removed our transgressions from us as a father has compassion on his children so the lord has compassion on those who fear him for he knows how we are formed he rememberes that we are dust as for man his days are like grass he flourishes like a flower of the field the wind blos over it and it is gone and its place rememberes it no more but from everlasting to everlasting the lords love is with those who fear him and his righteousness with their childrens children with those who keep his covenant and remember to obey his precepts
2828107 you were shit when i saw you but a ladder did fall on your head
2828108 they were so real id wake up and take a real deep breath in like i was hitting the crack pipe
2828109 i had these dreams where im still going to get or use drugs but then the pee test guy starts showing up out of nowhere
2828110 every once in a while ill have a dream about using but i wont remember it until two or three days later now i go to sleep every night and wake up every morning and everythings clear
2828111 josh hamilton is the best baseball player to ever walk the planet
2828112 its amazing how many veteran scouts say hes the best player theyve ever seen
2828113 o k now the boy is starting to get the hang of it
2828114 in san francisco i went to mortons steak house two nights in a row
2828115 if i miss a third day im tested two days in a row
2828116 ill do it until mlb says i dont have to anymore it reassures the people who made the decision to let me back in the game that things are good
2828117 i seriously doubt that he wakes up and thinks about it most mornings but he knows he has to be humble and strong trust me he knows the devil isnt far away
2828118 i think character may have been the final determining factor you read so many bad things about professional athletes but i dont think you ever will about josh
2828119 it was because of where i was hanging out it was who i was hanging out with you might not do it at first but eventually if you keep hanging around long enough youre going to start doing what theyre doing
2828120 taken aback it was a significant blip on the radar screen
2828121 after cincinnati picked him up we kicked ourselves that we didnt do the same thing
2828122 tampa bay ran him through waivers during the 2006 season and anyone could have had him for 20 000 we considered it then we needed a centerfielder
2828123 they acknowledged a glut of outfielders on their part but hamilton wasnt their top candidate to move
2828124 i was like really wow theyre really doing their homework
2828125 id do what i do for josh for any of the players
2828126 hes a coach hes a friend i trust myself but you just never know having johnny there is a precaution and it puts my wife at ease i put her through absolute hell for a long time
2828127 im there for josh always when he gets antsy hell come up to me and say johnny lets do a devotional last year he would come talk to me about his struggles this year he hasnt brought it up once
2828128 i didnt care i went about my business spending time with the fans doing stuff that i was supposed to be doing and getting some media attention they blamed what they were pissed off about on narron i think they were just jealous they werent getting the attention
2828129 its the support group that i have here that makes staying clean easy
2828130 and i always refer back to the media too if i did something stupid something i shouldnt be doing it would be all over the nation i would be such a hypocrite id let everyone down thats why i go to the ballpark and i go home park home park home
2828131 i remember seeing him taking bp with the devil rays in 2000 during spring training and i was like whos that
2828132 he was 18 years old and hitting balls farther than anyone else i went up and introduced myself and i said thats one of the greatest swings ive ever seen i dont think ive ever done that with anyone else my whole career
2828133 the first week of spring training in arizona hes coming out onto the field with the music on the stadium speakers and he stops in front of the fans in the outfield and leads them in singing
2828134 i know how hard it is but youre headed in the right direction good going
2828135 the ball just sounds different coming off his bat almost like a gunshot
2828136 you watch him track down a ball you watch him throw a guy out at third then he hits a ball down the line and gets a triple and its like the guy can run too
2828137 and he can still go and get the ball like nobodys business
2828138 im amazed how well its held up i was amazed last year that i even played 90 games
2828139 i never get tired of telling it i know just how fortunate i am

2828144 this is a very sad day for many of us who knew and loved bernie he brought so much joy to so many he will be missed but heaven just got funnier

2828146 how much blood was spilled by those who created your rockefeller
2828147 duh mel next tell us the sky is blue who doesnt already know that
2828148 the story is a long complicated one winding its way from china to france by way of the first world war the oil cartel the pharmaceutical cartel and iraq to its final destination a syringe full of something claiming to be a vaccine against the newly deadly avian flu
2828149 our best intelligence estimate is that pandemic avian flu has already been created through genetic engineering in the united states fusing the deadly genome of the 1918 pandemic misnamed the spanish flu with the dna of the innocuous h5n1 virus in a growth medium of human kidney cells according to the national institutes of health and the vaccines manufacturer some virologists believe that this would insure that the man made mutant virus recognizes human cells and knows how to invade them
2828150 a basic virological fact that the public has not been told is that it is impossible to make a vaccine against a virus that does not yet exist public relations efforts to the contrary if a vaccine is being made against the avian flu virus in its pandemic form that means that the pandemic virus must already exist period end of discussion so the fact that the avian flu vaccine is already being manufactured in china by a wholly owned subsidiary of the french arm of the cartel is not only peculiar but at the very least sinister
2828151 we can see that the pharmaceutical industry and us government are actively preparing for an avian flu pandemic through their own promotional literature and propaganda
2828152 the manufacturers website contains a document which clearly illustrates their business model and how the company successfully capitalizes on the immensely profitable worldwide vaccination market
2828153 were not a good side unless weve got everyone working hard
2828154 we havent got the superstars of some teams to be able to turn it on like a switch we cant
2828155 we need our better players and all players to work hard we didnt have that

2828161 why wont america and nato help us if they wont help us now why did we help them in iraq
2828162 they told us to come out i dont know why but some of our guys are still out there in the fields
2828163 i want to go back if we lose south ossetia now it wont be for ever because we will never surrender our land
2828164 there is a lot of panic many people have left and i am thinking of joining them my bags are already packed
2828165 we are afraid that the russians will come here and kill us people would not go if we had a strong army but they dont believe in our army any more
2828166 i have left everything i dont even have another shirt if the russians stay then i can never return were afraid of what the russians can do
2828167 the russians will be here tomorrow they want to show us and the world how powerful they are tomorrow it will be ukraine and nobody in the west is doing anything to stop them why were our soldiers in kosovo and iraq if we dont get any help from the west now
2828168 we are operating normally nobody has disturbed us at all
2828169 i know that lots of my neighbours are dead i have no idea who is left
2828170 the situation was very bad there but we were ready to stay russia is the enemy of the world

2828178 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
2828179 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
2828180 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
2828181 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
2828182 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
2828183 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
2828184 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
2828185 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
2828186 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
2828187 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
2828188 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
2828189 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
2828190 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
2828191 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
2828192 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
2828193 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
2828194 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
2828195 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
2828196 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
2828197 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
2828198 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
2828199 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
2828200 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
2828201 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
2828202 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
2828203 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
2828204 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
2828205 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
2828206 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
2828207 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
2828208 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
2828209 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
2828210 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
2828211 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
2828212 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
2828213 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
2828214 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
2828215 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
2828216 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
2828217 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
2828218 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
2828219 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
2828220 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
2828221 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
2828222 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
2828223 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
2828224 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
2828225 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
2828226 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
2828227 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
2828228 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
2828229 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
2828230 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
2828231 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
2828232 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
2828233 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element

2828240 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
2828241 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
2828242 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
2828243 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy

2828246 i think manufacturers who make money should do all they can to make their products safe

2828258 air supremacy over japan could have exerted sufficient pressure to bring about unconditional surrender and obviate the need for invasion based on a detailed investigation of all the facts and supported by the testimony of the surviving japanese leaders involved it is the surveys opinion that japan would have surrendered even if the atomic bombs had not been dropped even if russia had not entered the war and even if no invasion had been planned or contemplated
2828259 no effort was made and none was seriously considered to achieve surrender merely in order not to have to use the bomb
2828260 to browbeat the russians with the bomb held rather ostentatiously on our hip
2828261 there was never any illusion on my part that russia was our enemy and that the project was conducted on that basis

2828292 we walked the course over the weekend and it was great
2828293 were quite pleased given all the rain northern nsw and southeast queensland have endured in recent times
2828294 weve had no hesitation whatsoever in rating it good and continued fine weather forecasts should keep it that way
2828295 hes courted a fair share of bad luck lately including an abscess under his jaw which really knocked him around
2828296 but weve got him back on track now and his last run at eagle farm was better than it looks on paper
2828297 i expect him to do very well from here and darron coleman knows how to get the job done
2828298 hes only been out of the money a few times in twelve starts and he is certainly a fair horse
2828299 he missed the start at ipswich a few runs ago and he still managed a decent run
2828300 hes up in grade against some nice open class types but if theres any pace on early he should do very well at the business end of the race

2828305 the rappers have gone in and created a lot of hit music based upon my influence
2828306 i knew nothing about the business or trends and things like that
2828307 i think it was a matter of timing i didnt know what was unfolding
2828308 a person that speaks his mind hes sensitive enough to care for children hes wise enough to not be put into the wack category like everybody else in town and he l o o o o ves the ladies
2828309 but there is a time when satire ends and intolerance and bigotry toward religious beliefs of others begins
2828310 has no problem and hes cashed plenty of checks with our show making fun of christians
2828311 liriano was a freak before he got hurt he was throwing 98 mph and there was not a comfortable at bat against him now hes still finding it im sure hell get a little better
2828312 i was feeling better today my body and my arm was feeling better
2828313 i was trying to make some perfect pitches in there sometimes i rushed too much but i feel way better than last time
2828314 he had a better changeup and breaking ball than fastball tonight but he also pumped his fastball in when he needed it
2828315 when it gets close to your head you dont know whats going on
2828316 i dont think we really need stuff like that to fire us up
2828317 but that adds on stuff like that really lights a fire always has always will
2828318 whatever it did it did a good thing for us

2828343 the idea that a computer could be more accurate than a physician is difficult for providers to accept despite numerous studies which have shown that algorithms and computers do outperform most doctors on some tasks
2828344 critics of clinical decision support maintain a computer cannot understand the nuances of medicine even when the technologies have been shown to improve efficiencies and outcomes while a fundamental shift in culture is not impossible it will take time as well as an increase in provider education and pressure from patients payers and c level hospital executives
2828345 without clinical decision support electronic health records are not much more than a compilation of paper records in an electronic format
2828346 although the technology needs to be adapted slightly for clinical data the main components remain the same
2828347 i dont think any of them have been validated enough to say they can be used by an untrained person
2828348 its true the club is trying to land julio baptista
2828349 we believe that the potential of baptista would be useful for us and the club are trying to land him
2828350 but we are very calm expecting that anything could happen
2828351 we are looking to bring in important players who know how to make a difference
2828352 baptista interests us and the sporting director is in discussions about him we have to see if he will succeed in bringing him to roma
2828353 baptista is a flexible player who has speed physical strength skill and therefore will easily fit into the team

2828358 he tried to reach for him and he slipped and chico went all the way down to the air vent
2828359 we tried locating where the heater vent went to and turns out it dropped down into the garage area
2828360 we can take a look and see if we have any victims in any void spaces in collapsed structures
2828361 the puppy was definitely scared from all of the banging so when we pulled him out he was shaking

2828365 i know that lots of my neighbours are dead i have no idea who is left
2828366 i dont want to be standing here helpless but we have nowhere else to go
2828367 they bombed us were being driven away we dont know where were running to
2828368 wholl take us in the place was in flames and we couldnt stay
2828369 they were very close it felt like they were right above our heads and we could hear firing coming from somewhere although the helicopters werent firing at us
2828370 where can i go i have the children here i have no car i will stay
2828371 i heard the sound of planes flying over zugdidi sometime between six and seven in the morning
2828372 i heard at least six explosions within the space of half an hour people are afraid but theres no panic were staying inside
2828373 the outskirts of zugdidi were bombarded by the russians we peaceful citizens are feeble and helpless
2828374 we caused lots of disruption and weve really highlighted the folly of going ahead with this new power station
2828375 the atmosphere in the camp is very celebratory but well only claim victory once we know weve definitely scuppered e ons plans to build a new coal fired power station at kingsnorth

2828393 a lot of things have been appearing in local dailies alleging that narayan sindhi is involved in exorcist activities following this we decided to call him for questioning to see if he has any role in the deaths of the two children
2828394 so far we do not have any evidence against him
2828395 we have no faith in the government as they dont care for us
2828396 its a tough task for the security forces to venture deep into the forests particularly in the hilly areas as the maoist guerillas attack from hilltops
2828397 i think the administration should extend the relaxation to calm the people
2828398 the people are fixing up their day to day schedule very cleverly during the curfew
2828399 during the relaxation hours they prefer to shop for essential goods than to protest as soon as the curfew is re imposed the protestors take to the streets again
2828400 formal instructions to this effect are likely to issued shortly
2828401 for instance we plan to have cctvs equipped with software which allow recording and storing of images similarly we are proposing high end vehicle scanners to scan the vehicle floors as soon as they enter the main gate of a station
2828402 the very next day he called us said he was with his uncle though his uncle assured us that he will bring the boy back he didnt turn up
2828403 when we came to know of his plans we kept a close vigil on him and even changed our place of stay but he still managed to escape through the fire exit
2828404 we will see what action we can take legally in this matter
2828405 road mortality is a significant factor of influencing snake populations around the world
2828406 in southern alberta its particularly important because the snakes arent moving very fast across the roads and there is a huge amount of development
2828407 were trying to learn how we can design roads and plan for roadways that are going to have less of an impact on snakes
2828408 the split decision overturned a previous court ruling and has temporarily denied attempts by tribes and environmental groups to stop arizona snowbowl ski resort from expanding development and making fake snow from treated sewage effluent on the holy mountain
2828409 the cultural survival of more than 13 indigenous nations is directly intertwined with the environmental integrity of the holy san francisco peaks
2828410 todays decision not only places these ways of life in peril but sets the stage for an ecological and public health catastrophe we have no choice but to uphold our commitment to protect the holy san francisco peaks
2828411 only effect of the proposed upgrades is on the plaintiffs subjective emotional religious experience that is the presence of recycled wastewater on the peaks is offensive to the plaintiffs religious sensibilities the diminishment of spiritual fulfillment serious though it may be is not a substantial burden on the free exercise of religion
2828412 the court places itself in the position of judging the legitimacy of native american beliefs and practices it becomes the arbiter of religion which is not the proper role for the courts the evidence clearly shows that the peaks are important to 13 of the tribes in the southwestern united states and that using sewer water to make snow on them constitutes a significant burden on the tribes ability to practice their religion
2828413 in this country native americans have no first amendment rights when it comes to government land use decisions
2828414 the federal government likely holds thousands of acres of land that tribes hold sacred this case was the last best chance for the tribes to be able to provide some legal protection to those lands in a nation that prides itself on religious liberty it is unconscionable that native american beliefs are not respected under the law or the constitution we anticipate petitioning the u s supreme court for review of this matter
2828415 this ruling sets a negative precedent that impacts the future of native american religious practice
2828416 religious exercise invariably and centrally involves a subjective spiritual experience
2828417 the majoritys misunderstanding of the nature of religious beliefs and exercise as merely
2828418 rfra was passed to protect the exercise of all religions including the religions of american indians if indians land based exercise of religion is not protected by rfra in this case i cannot imagine a case in which it will be i am truly sorry that the majority has effectively read american indians out of rfra
2828419 this decision is a painful affirmation of the lack of protection for our religious freedom
2828420 it is a bitter reminder that not all citizens are equal in this country but just as the civil rights movement did not give up when courts delivered blow after blow we will not give up until our rights are fully upheld we the youth will continue to stand up for our cultural survival
2828421 federal land management policies are inconsistent when addressing native american religious practice relating to sacred places this case underscores the fact that we need legislative action to guarantee protection for places held holy by native american tribes
2828422 the deeply held religious beliefs of hundreds of thousands of citizens of this country have been trumped by a single for profit private business operating on public lands
2828423 eight of eleven judges decided to completely ignore the issue of what happens if a child were to eat this snow
2828424 the court dismissed the whole health issue on a procedural error thereby refusing to comment on the true health impacts of this fake snow which has been proven to contain harmful pharmaceuticals and personal care productions on our children the court has obviously cast off this responsibility and we will continue to demand accountability for our children and the land
2828425 we obviously disagree with ruling snowmaking with sewage is still plainly a bad idea
2828426 well keep fighting along side our partners this ruling only emboldens our resolve
2828427 indigenous peoples have the right to manifest practice develop and teach their spiritual and religious traditions customs and ceremonies the right to maintain protect and have access in privacy to their religious and cultural sites the right to the use and control of their ceremonial objects and the right to the repatriation of their human remains
2828428 georgia expresses its readiness to immediately start negotiations with the russian federation on cease fire and termination of hostilities
2828429 the georgian gambit of trying to push the russians out of its breakaway border territories seems to have had the opposite effect of consolidating russian control
2828430 and its still unclear whether this crisis can be contained with only the destruction and loss of life it has caused so far
2828431 we heard a plane go over and then a big explosion
2828432 the attacks are occurring in regions of georgia far from the zone of conflict in south ossetia they mark a dangerous escalation in the crisis
2828433 president bush has talked with french president sarkozy whos also the head of the eu right now and officials say that the two men are on the same page and that sort of gives us a sense of the parameters of what they expect to have happen
2828434 they say that what they must see in georgia right now is a cease fire a de escalation on the part of the russians and respect for georgias territorial integrity so that gives you some sense of what the us and the wests position will be as they start to engage with the russians
2828435 the deployment is quite natural we dont want a repeat of what happened in south ossetia
2828436 if the disproportionate and dangerous escalation on the russian side continues that this will have a significant long term impact on u s russian relations
2828437 whatever side is used to bomb civilians and the positions of peacekeepers this side is not safe and they should know this
2828438 the reports from people is that its an absolute nightmare two kids delivering food made it out of south ossetia but their parents didnt and they dont know if they are alive or dead because phones are down
2828439 the mere fact that it happens annually is something great
2828440 the coin must have been done by a professional the work is impressive

2828446 there were days when we got promising news and days when we got not so encouraging news
2828447 but we decided to stick it out until the end and it paid off
2828448 our motto was lets just go until they tell us to stop
2828449 there were moments where you were just being watched very closely
2828450 we still did what we wanted to do but i was hurrying it up saying come on come on lets go it was a subconscious thing
2828451 jon always has a very good sense of whats in good taste and bad
2828452 and well try to stay within the bounds of what we think is good taste we didnt go in there to make fun of the

2828530 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2828531 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2828532 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2828533 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2828534 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2828697 theres been no other research for us to look at so we cant predict what we will see we are not really setting out to find out something in particular we are going out there to gather information
2828698 we will be able to extract some information from it and then be able to feed that back into whoever is involved in working dogs
2828699 the overall aim is to increase the dogs longevity and performance

2828705 its almost unheard of summer doesnt usually afford films that much of a wide open playing field
2828706 it has taken on a life of its own and in doing so got so much positive press and word of mouth that older audiences who normally dont rush out to see movies or maybe only see two three movies a year are coming out in large numbers

2828715 verily the number of months with allaah is twelve months in a year so it was ordained by allaah on the day when he created the heavens and the earth of them four are sacred
2828716 time has completed its cycle and is as it was on the day when allaah created the heavens and the earth the year is twelve months of which four are sacred three consecutive months and muharram and the rajab of mudar which comes between jumaada and shabaan
2828717 the postponing of a sacred month is indeed an addition to disbelief thereby the disbelievers are led astray for they make it lawful one year and forbid it another year in order to adjust the number of months forbidden by allaah and make such forbidden ones lawful
2828718 then when the sacred months have passed then kill the mushrikeen wherever you find them

2828722 may allaah have mercy on abu abd al rahmaan the prophet sallallaahu alaihi wasallam never did umrah but he witnessed it i e he was present with him and he never did umrah during rajab

2829094 i do believe knol does solve a search problem the problem we have unlocking what people know and bringing it online this is another tool to help release some of this knowledge
2829095 knol may be used to complement your blog blogs are great for quickly and easily getting your latest writing out to your readers while knols are better for when you want to write an authoritative article on a single topic the tone is more formal and while its easy to update the content and keep it fresh knols arent designed for continuously posting new content or threading except for the different format youll get all the things youve come to expect from blogger in knol like blogger knol has simple web authoring tools that make it easy to collaborate co author and publish it has community features as well your readers will be able to add comments and rate your article and if you want theyll be able to suggest edits that you can then either accept or reject and just like in blogger you can also choose to include ads from adsense in your knols to perhaps make a little money one other important difference between knol and blogger is that knol encourages you to reveal your true identity knols are meant to be authoritative articles and therefore they have a strong focus on authors and their credentials we feel that this focus will help ensure that authors get credit for their work make the content more credible all in all we think knol will be a great new way for you to share what you know inform people about an issue that is important to you raise your profile as an expert in your field and maybe even make some money from ads
2829096 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2829097 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2829098 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2829099 bloomington mayor steve stockton said he would like to hold a discussion about juvenile crime and what the city can to do help solve the problem but he added it wont happen monday nobody has talked to us about getting on the agenda
2829100 they should call ahead with something like this so we can schedule time for them to speak
2829101 this quote from bloomington mayor steve stockton saturday is certainly accurate that council agendas need to be structured in advance and adhered to but perhaps could have been better stated or follow up statements added that meetings will or are being planned to address the publics concerns etc
2829102 for a number of reasons i was dismayed to read the article in the pantagraph this morning regarding the citizens who have concerns about the rising youth crime and how we can address this
2829103 oh what was that great site with the cool design oh thats right here it is in the design block
2829104 i dont want to have to go to memeflow and click add item every time i want to simply add a link
2829105 our birthdays are feathers in the broad wing of time
2829106 obviously there are going to be some significant changes within the shadow ministerial make up and thats something that i will be announcing later on this week
2829107 but it is important that ive taken this time to look at the individual skills of shadow ministers and where they can better fit in particular portfolios
2829108 what i want to be able to do is to match people most appropriately with portfolio responsibilities that i want them to have as we go into government in queensland
2829109 as we get closer to people having to people having to make decisions about nominating in preselections i would expect that some people would be making a final decision
2829110 no hay ninguna satisfacci n en ahorcar a un hombre que no se oponga a ello
2829111 i think hes going to make an intensely political choice not a governing choice
2829112 hes going to view this through the prism of a candidate not through the prism of president that is to say hes going to pick somebody that he thinks will on the margin help him in a state like indiana or missouri or virginia hes not going to be thinking big and broad about the responsibilities of president
2829113 with all due respect again to governor kaine hes been a governor for three years hes been able but undistinguished
2829114 i dont think people could really name a big important thing that hes done he was mayor of the 105th largest city in america
2829115 so if he were to pick governor kaine it would be an intensely political choice where he said you know what
2829116 we are feeling very very good about where the senator is in the polls and we obviously expect as america the american electorate turns their attentions even more to this race in connection with the conventions we expect to do to do quite well
2829117 i mean it was funny but wearing a clown suit and juggling would be funny too but it doesnt connect with the concerns americans have about gas prices about the war about the economy
2829118 so i think on things like that shoot i hope the mccain camp does more of those ads and well just let them do those ads
2829119 senator mccain is running the same old negative karl rove style ads that were all tired of
2829120 with a restive electorate with an economy thats sort of chugging along with a war in the background at the end of eight years of republican rule in the white house obama should be way ahead
2829121 the fact that he isnt says that there are grave doubts about senator obama
2829122 i would make the argument that part of the reason why senator obama is in the shape he is in today is because hes failed to run a positive campaign
2829123 hes run a negative campaign hes claimed to be something new and different and yet given these you know it is really beyond the pale to sit there and insinuate that senator mccain is somehow going to attack him for being black which is what he did for over a month
2829124 copy of the entire presentation was entered as evidence in publicly available court records
2829125 das ist mir wirklich zu bl d das lese ich doch lieber ein buch
2829126 it was an advantage to be more anxious in a dangerous environment
2829127 this single gene variation is potentially only one of many factors influencing such a complex trait as anxiety
2829128 still to identify the first candidates for genes associated with an anxiety prone personality is a step in the right direction
2829129 it might be possible to prescribe the right dose of the right drug relative to genetic makeup to treat anxiety disorders

2829139 for the first few years after the government started developing the land for industry the scenario did not look impressive but after 2005 when the deal with tata motors was sealed there was a rush among companies to invest here the tatas had helped investors overcome the psychological barrier
2829140 initially some local leaders led by mohan pathak a student activist from nainital tried to stage dharnas and blocked the roads
2829141 but pathak got isolated because a near consensus on the project was arrived at also he did not get the kind of publicity that mamatas protests got in bengal
2829142 the tax breaks drew several corporate groups to this city raising the demand for housing and commercial complexes
2829143 the teeth come from a creature very close to the root of the lineage that eventually gave rise to modern monkeys apes and humans
2829144 the new fossils from india are exciting because they show that the anthropoid lineage is much more ancient than we realised
2829145 the new discovery clearly highlights the importance of the indian fossil record in tracing the centre of origin and migration patterns of anthropoids and related primate groups
2829146 the teeth came from a geological layer between 54 and 55 million years old
2829147 we knew they belonged to an old creature it turned out to be an ancestral primate

2829153 bollywood films are very physically demanding we have to do action comedy and dance and we might have four or five songs per day it requires a lot of stamina and you have to be fit i dont drink or smoke with action sequences you need to take extra care

2829161 we work every day so theres little chance of a holiday evenings we spend as a family talking or watching tv or a film i like to have at least one meal a day with them we rarely go out to dinner when we do we have chinese italian indian food
2829162 if colleagues invite us to a premiere we go i can go about mumbai i dont need to go incognito but i dont go out on the streets i am a hindu and i go to the temple when i feel like it its not regimented i have a little temple in the house i dont have a special god god is omnipresent

2829165 they are now saying adhikary fell accidentally during a scuffle but they still insist he had harassed the girls
2829166 the nature of the head injuries suggests he fell headlong which could result from a push
2829167 one of us opened the door the man was drunk and abusive we called some of the male contestants from the second floor
2829168 by the time we reached the third floor where the 18 girls were staying the man was in his room on the terrace he came out and abused the girls we called the producers when they threatened him he tried to escape by jumping off the terrace
2829169 hotel staff and neighbourhood people attacked us with empty beer bottles and
2829170 he is running a high temperature and has respiratory problems he is yet to regain consciousness
2829171 the state government has decided to move the centre to probe the issue by the cbi and see to it that the culprits are booked so that indian sport can be saved from the clutches of dirty politics
2829172 if they thought they could take jammu for granted forever they thought wrong this outburst is actually a consequence of taking them for granted and making them feel theyre impotent but we have a problem too now face it
2829173 the clever monkey in the story of the two cats had the luxury of distributing justice between cats here we have two panthers pouncing and we quite truly are clueless monkeys and not to forget frightened too things are fast slipping out of hand
2829174 if you think you can find a way to amarnath without talking to us please go ahead and do it
2829175 after all they have to be an intrinsic part of any agreement
2829176 and closing the doors on them in this fashion no matter what the differences will not help positions are getting calcified on both sides and that is not a good sign
2829177 mehbooba mufti is nobody to pronounce judgement on us or decide out fate
2829178 she is our enemy number one at the moment she talks of dual currency in india she talks of opening kashmir to pakistan she constantly challenges the unity and integrity of india even though she is oath bound as a member of parliament she doesnt have a leg to stand on
2829179 thats for the government of india to find out can it not see that the very people it has pampered all these years are threatening to secede from the country new delhi has to deal with these leaders and assert itself i am an indian if the government cannot ensure rights for me in kashmir who will i dont have any hopes of the kashmiri leadership i have seen enough of them my only appeal is to the government of india
2829180 hundreds of people from his gohpur constituency will be brought here to accord him a rousing welcome as he steps out of the guwahati airport we want to show that he is still a mass leader and the conspiracy against him failed to diminish his support base

2829191 my son and daughter in law were staying on rent in our apartment in balewadi empire estate since 2003 in october 2006 her parents and sister moved in showing no intention of leaving
2829192 at our sons insistence we also came and started living in the two bedroom apartment along with them however on jan 25 2007 they started shouting at us and threatened to get us arrested under some women protection act we got scared and left our own home the next day
2829193 the police and the advocates are hand in glove we want the police to lend us an ear when it comes to women protection acts nobody wants to listen they are too eager to put you behind bars

2829247 make no mistake about it change was always saul d alinskys code word for creating a socialist revolution even if the methodology meant radicals would cut their hair put on business suits and run for political office alinsky taught community organizers like obama to hide their true intentions in the words they spoke
2829248 theres another reason for working inside the system dostoevsky said that taking a new step is what people fear most any revolutionary change must be preceded by a passive affirmative non challenging attitude toward change among the mass of our people they must feel so frustrated so defeated so lost so futureless in the prevailing system that they are willing to let go of the past and change the future this acceptance is the reformation essential to any revolution to bring on this reformation requires that the organizer work inside the system among not only the middle class but the 40 per cent of american families more than seventy million people whose income range from 5 000 to 10 000 a year in 1971 they cannot be dismissed by labeling them blue collar or hard hat they will not continue to be relatively passive and slightly challenging if we fail to communicate with them if we dont encourage them to form alliances with us they will move to the right maybe they will anyway but lets not let it happen by default

2829276 while such initiatives should be a part of the corporate social responsibility some affirmative action may help initiate this process the report said

2829297 no one can serve two masters either he will hate the one and love the other or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other you cannot serve both god and money
2829298 then all the churches will know that i am the one who searches out the thoughts and intentions of every person and i will give to each of you whatever you deserve
2829299 but the lord said to samuel do not consider his appearance or his height for i have rejected him
2829300 but just as he who called you is holy so be holy in all you do for it is written
2829301 for god knew his people in advance and he chose them to become like his son so that his son would be the firstborn among many brothers and sisters
2829302 then god gave these commandments as a guideline form them to follow people all these instructions
2829303 you must not make for yourself an idol of any kind or an image of anything in the heavens or on the earth or in the sea
2829304 you must not bow down to them or worship them for i the lord your god am a jealous god who will not tolerate your affection for any other gods
2829305 but i lavish unfailing love for a thousand generations on those who love me and obey my commands
2829306 you must not misuse the name of the lord your god the lord will not let you go unpunished if you misuse his name
2829307 remember to observe the sabbath day by keeping it holy
2829308 you have six days each week for your ordinary work but the seventh day is a sabbath day of rest dedicated to the lord your god
2829309 honor your father and mother then you will live a long full life in the land the lord your god is giving you
2829310 you must not covet your neighbors house you must not covet your neighbors wife male or female servant ox or donkey or anything else that belongs to your neighbor
2829311 for what the law was powerless to do in that it was weakened by the sinful nature god did by sending his own son in the likeness of sinful man to be a sin offering and so he condemned sin in sinful man in order that the righteous requirements of the law might be fully met in us who do not live according to the sinful nature but according to the spirit those who live according to the sinful nature have their minds set on what that nature desires but those who live in accordance with the spirit have their minds set on what the spirit desires the mind of sinful man is death but the mind controlled by the spirit is life and peace the sinful mind is hostile to god it does not submit to gods law nor can it do so those controlled by the sinful nature cannot please god
2829312 for it is god who works in you to will and to act according to his good purpose
2829313 i john am the one who heard and saw these things
2829314 do not do it i am a fellow servant with you and with your brothers the prophets and of all who keep the words of this book worship god

2829317 do not be afraid go and tell my brothers to go to galilee there they will see me
2829318 faith that doesnt show itself in obedience to gods word is no faith at all it is dead and useless
2829319 for it is by grace you have been saved through faith and this is not from yourself it is the gift of god not by works so that no one should boast for we are gods workmanship created in christ jesus to do good works which god prepared in advance for us to do
2829320 a dead man cannot keep his promises only a living person could keep his promises
2829321 i am the alpha and the omega the beginning and the end i will give to the one who thirsts from the spring of water of life without cost he who overcomes shall inherit these things and i will be his god and he will be my son but the cowardly and the unbelieving and abominable and murderers and immoral persons and sorcerers and idolaters and all liars their part will be in the lake that burns with fire and brimstone which is the second death
2829322 for i am convinced that neither death nor life neither angels nor demons neither the present nor the future nor any powers neither height nor depth nor anything else in all creation will be able to separate us from the love of god that is in christ jesus our lord
2829323 whoever has my commands and obeys them he is the one who loves me he who loves me will be loved by my father and i too will love him and show myself to him

2829326 that not only did they not fear our war on drugs they actually counted on it on one undercover tape recorded conversation a top cartel chief jorge roman expressed his gratitude for the drug war calling it a sham put on the american tax payer that was actually good for business
2829327 yeah we know the police and military battles against drug gangs dont work but we sold the plan up and down the potomac
2829328 the hugely expensive antidrug campaigns we are waging around the world are basically futile
2829329 even as i write these words it is virtually certain that somewhere on the streets of washington d c an eighteen year old white kid from the maryland or north virginia suburbs is buying a stash of drugs from an eighteen year old black kid the white kid is going to take that stash back to the suburbs and make some quick money by selling it to other kids
2829330 look back on his drug use just as recreational and joke about it just one more little rebellion on the way to adulthood
2829331 will enter a hell from which he may never recover
2829332 prison life will change the black kid harden him mess up his mind and redefine his self image and after he is released from prison the black kid will be dragging an invisible ball and chain behind him for the rest of his life by the time the white kid reaches fifty years of age he may well be a judge by the time the black kid reaches fifty he will likely be permanently unemployable will be ineligible for many government assistance programmes and will not even be able to vote
2829333 but at the very least tribes should issue photo ids
2829334 ukb tribal members are not getting fair treatment in health care or contract services mainly because of the contract for contract services

2829338 it is a quick scoring ground and if we get our heads down and bat well then we should certainly knock off 197
2829339 it has been a good week for kev so far and we can make it a very good week for him
2829340 the oval pitch doesnt deteriorate massively if we can get a good start and bat well then we should win this game

2829342 the hundred was never an issue this is my fifth time out in the nineties i dont really mind putting the team out of trouble is what i wanted to do
2829343 across our courses its added 150 000 to the gate
2829344 the challenge is getting 10 per cent of them to go racing again but anything that attempts to do that has got to be a good thing what were finding is that it can create a great atmosphere and a lot of first time punters are having a bet usually small amounts on the tote
2829345 weve found you need to get a good band instead of a tribute act the return is much better a good band costs roughly 100 000 which includes stage and production the risks are the weather and you need to book a band nine months out whats popular now might not be next summer

2829359 no no no their offers should not charm us their evil gifts would harm us
2829360 good folk i have no coin to take were to purloin i have no copper in my purse i have no silver either and all my gold is on the furze that shakes in windy weather above the rusty heather
2829361 dear you should not stay so late twilight is not good for maidens should not loiter in the glen in the haunts of goblin men do you not remember jeanie how she met them in the moonlight took their gifts both choice and many ate their fruits and wore their flowers plucked from bowers where summer ripens at all hours but ever in the moonlight she pined and pined away sought them by night and day found them no more but dwindled and grew gray then fell with the first snow while to this day no grass will grow where she lies low i planted daisies there a year ago that never blow you should not loiter so
2829362 nay hush my sister i ate and ate my fill yet my mouth waters still to morrow night i will buy more
2829363 have done with sorrow ill bring you plums to morrow fresh on their mother twigs cherries worth getting you cannot think what figs my teeth have met in what melons icy cold piled on a dish of gold too huge for me to hold what peaches with a velvet nap pellucid grapes without one seed odorous indeed must be the mead whereon they grow and pure the wave they drink with lilies at the brink and sugar sweet their sap
2829364 the sunset flushes those furthest loftiest crags come laura not another maiden lags no wilful squirrel wags the beasts and birds are fast asleep
2829365 o laura come i hear the fruit call but i dare not look you should not loiter longer at this brook come with me home the stars rise the moon bends her arc each glow worm winks her spark let us get home before the night grows dark for clouds may gather even though this is summer weather put out the lights and drench us through then if we lost our way what should we do

2829367 nay take a seat with us honor and eat with us

2829369 but one waits at home alone for me so without further parleying if you will not sell me any of your fruits though much and many give me back my silver penny i tossed you for a fee
2829370 did you miss me come and kiss me never mind my bruises hug me kiss me suck my juices squeezed from goblin fruits for you goblin pulp and goblin dew eat me drink me love me laura make much of me for your sake i have braved the glen and had to do with goblin merchant men

2829378 if the economy stays like this its going to put a lot of guys out of business
2829379 theres probably going to be some people fishing this year who arent going to be around next year the guys that have low debt will survive and the ones that have debt wont
2829380 it puts a real strain on your business youre operating at a very slim margin
2829381 so the lobsterman gets squeezed because hes got the cost going up and hes got a product he has to get rid of because if you do raise the price too high it shuts off the markets
2829382 pretty soon restaurants take it off the menu and say call me when it gets more reasonable
2829383 the average family isnt going out for a lobster dinner this summer with the high cost of fuel and everything else

2829493 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2829494 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2829495 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2829496 jai ton nom et ton adresse je te choperai au moment o tu ty attendras le moins
2829497 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2829498 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2829499 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2829500 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2829501 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

2829513 i understand why you would call it a quote shift i say it is a lesson learned about what the american peoples priorities are and their priority is to secure the borders
2829514 senator john mccain likes to present himself as the candidate of the straight talk express who does not pander to voters or change his positions with the political breeze but the fine print of his record in the senate indicates that he has been a lot less consistent on some of his signature issues than he has presented himself to be so far in his presidential campaign
2829515 has also expressed varying positions on immigration torture abortion and donald h rumsfeld the former defense secretary
2829516 it sounds like hes trying to have it both ways and its not convincing anyone
2829517 neither party should be defined by pandering to the outer reaches of american politics and the agents of intolerance whether they be louis farrakhan or al sharpton on the left or pat robertson and jerry falwell on the right
2829518 an olive branch to christian conservatives who could impede his presidential ambitions
2829519 a fter mccain accepted the invitation critics accused him of pandering for political purposes
2829520 of course the president bears the ultimate responsibility but he was very badly served by both the vice president and most of all the secretary of defense
2829521 look weve got to get everybody on board in order to get progress in this country im not going to you know take retaliation or retribution against anybody whether theyre democrats or republicans

2829540 to run it we just need power networking and water
2829541 weve taken the fans out of the individual servers and replaced them with central fan bases
2829542 at this stage well be looking at giving the government and the fire service another opportunity to come back to us with a revised position that is worth considering
2829543 should they decide not to then we will seriously consider the introduction of industrial action at the point in time
2829544 weve put the members in the picture of the ramifications of any type of industrial action but the members again are overwhelmingly in support of the state committee and management should state committee and management decide to proceed with industrial action
2829545 my whole aim in this whole process is for a negotiated settlement

2829548 the overall goal of this program is to help our children understand the importance of being successful and being very active in school because if they are active in school they will be successful
2829549 schizophrenia is an extremely large market and one that currently lacks the availability of any real or accurate blood tests
2829550 if you treat them early on in the disease you improve the outcome
2829551 two of the most important things are the small sample size and the cost effectiveness of our service
2829552 with conventional testing and competing technologies it requires so much more blood and fluid to run the test
2829553 everyone was saying decoding the human genome was going to solve all of our problems
2829554 you couldnt look at many proteins at the same time because the technology required too much sampling and it was too expensive
2829555 oftentimes early in the drug development process and up through the phase i human clinical trial they will use the whole panel or a big part of it to look very comprehensively at a particular drug candidate to see if they can tell what are the good and not so good effects of that drug
2829556 have been progressively refined and tested and at times debated in the biomedical and scientific community
2829557 as medicine has moved from being an empirical based science where you are looking at external systems to a more molecular based system this has resulted in a natural explosion of biomarker testing
2829558 its important if there is going to be a problem later on the earlier they can find it in drug development
2829559 they would have spent that extra money taking it all the way through clinical trials
2829560 i could very easily see a time in three to five years where our diagnostic initiatives will be the biggest part of our business

2829610 in 2006 i made a serious error in judgment and conducted myself in a way that was disloyal to my family and to my core beliefs i recognized my mistake and i told my wife that i had a liaison with another woman and i asked for her forgiveness although i was honest in every painful detail with my family i did not tell the public when a supermarket tabloid told a version of the story i used the fact that the story contained many falsities to deny it but being 99 honest is no longer enough i was and am ashamed of my conduct and choices and i had hoped that it would never become public with my family i took responsibility for my actions in 2006 and today i take full responsibility publicly but that misconduct took place for a short period in 2006 it ended then i am and have been willing to take any test necessary to establish the fact that i am not the father of any baby and i am truly hopeful that a test will be done so this fact can be definitively established i only know that the apparent father has said publicly that he is the father of the baby i also have not been engaged in any activity of any description that requested agreed to or supported payments of any kind to the woman or to the apparent father of the baby it is inadequate to say to the people who believed in me that i am sorry as it is inadequate to say to the people who love me that i am sorry in the course of several campaigns i started to believe that i was special and became increasingly egocentric and narcissistic if you want to beat me up feel free you cannot beat me up more than i have already beaten up myself i have been stripped bare and will now work with everything i have to help my family and others who need my help i have given a complete interview on this matter

2829660 the ibm was no better or worse than other computers at the time really people chuckled at the ibm pc a little when it first came out it was designed in a very ad hoc fashion outside of traditional ibm practices
2829661 everything in the 5150 was made with off the shelf parts compared with what apple was doing at the time it seemed very basic
2829662 the success of the 5150 had a lot more to do with branding that technology ibm was the most established name in office equipment so suddenly the guys whod been sneaking computers in the back door could bring them right through the lobby all because of those three little blue letters on the case
2829663 the transition of big business to pcs was difficult because it was a big leap psychologically to give workers so much control over their jobs its like mainframes were the catholic church very centralized authority and pcs were like the protestant reformation suddenly everyone could interpret their software for themselves
2829664 having a company like ibm behind that move may have made it easier for companies to relax control
2829665 its much easier to reconfigure a pc to meet a workers needs
2829666 switching or updating a program was a big hassle and the program had to be right for everyone now if you dont like a program you can just switch it out
2829667 for all the hype the ibm wasnt that innovative or powerful when compared to the other machines of the time
2829668 still it holds a place in peoples hearts its part of the march of progress the beginning of the pc era for a lot of people
2829669 ibm definitely made a splash with the pc but it was the clones of the pc that really found their way into the hands of the individual users primarily because of price an ibm labeled pc was expensive
2829670 but it was relatively easy to produce a clone of the ibm pc and many companies did only then did individual users really start to adopt the pc in large numbers

2829675 the action sequences kind of tie it all together and the story moves through the big battle scenes its very fast paced i know the live action star wars movies are pretty fast paced but the prequels were kind of longer feeling than the old style movies theres more of a serialized feeling in empire strikes back the clone wars are a little bit more in that classic sensibility where the story moves quickly its faster paced and the characters kind of develop on the go

2829778 but i think his remark when the little girl asked him why he decided to run for president and he gave this response america is uh is no longer uh what it could be what it once was and i say to myself i dont want that future for my children as you watch the video its clear that he formed his words carefully and was thinking about how to answer the little girl im wondering when is the time that obama thinks that we were what we could be it couldn t have been when we had slavery so that takes us to 1865 it couldn t be when we had states divided by terrible jim crow laws that segregated society and disenfranchised an entire race so that takes us to the mid 1960s it probably wasn t when we were divided and torn apart by the vietnam war and racial violence so that takes us to the 1970s i doubt that it was when we were suffering devastating stagflation and seeing our hostages being paraded in front of the cameras so that takes us to 1980 were left with the reagan bush years is obama yearning for morning in america many conservatives remember that period with nostalgia does obama share that feeling no certainly not the 1980s that decade of greed
2829779 as the chart shows obamas give and take tax policy results in marginal tax rates of 34 percent to 39 percent in the 31 000 to 45 000 income range for this family
2829780 while obama has publicly embraced a tax rate of 40 percent for couples earning over 350 000 his tax policies would result in a staggering 45 percent effective marginal rate in the 110 000 to 120 000 income range for this family that is 11 percentage points higher than under current law
2829781 unfortunately senator obamas proposed tax cuts for the middle class are actually marginal rate hikes in disguise

2829797 senator obamas policy of diplomacy to build international support for our goals makes sense
2829798 right now iraqis are agreeing with sen obamas position to have a timeline for when to pull out he also wants to safely bring home troops in a timely manner from the iraq and focus on terrorism in afghanistan

2829804 they proposed that clinton from a position of strength immediately after her wins challenge obama to accept michigan and florida revotes such a move preempts obamas reiteration on march 5 that they are still up 100 plus delegates and that we cant win they noted the press will love the rematch like rocky ii

2829890 the price has come down but more important what im hearing is the supply side to supermarket retailers is better because tourist consumption is down in maine
2829891 ive never seen anything like it where im able to promote lobsters at a reasonable price
2829892 if the economy stays like this its going to put a lot of guys out of business
2829893 theres probably going to be some people fishing this year who arent going to be around next year the guys that have low debt will survive and the ones that have debt wont
2829894 it puts a real strain on your business youre operating at a very slim margin
2829895 so the lobsterman gets squeezed because hes got the cost going up and hes got a product he has to get rid of because if you do raise the price too high it shuts off the markets

2829899 meth users are saying its really hard to get meth when before it was everywhere
2829900 i think this is a testament to what happens when the community comes together and shows what we can do to protect our neighbors
2829901 we are going to keep our foot on the pedal until meth is eradicated because it can easily mushroom back
2829902 kids are saying meth is a dirty drug and there is a lack of glamour in it
2829903 what happens is that one drug hits the scene so hard and we all notice it and its a big issue
2829904 we will always have a problem with drugs and i dont like the term war on drugs because it sounds like there is a beginning and a middle with a victory at the end
2829905 when the war is over youre done but thats not the way it is in this business
2829906 im glad to hear people recognize the risks of meth and dont meth around with meth

2829940 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2829941 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2829942 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2829943 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2829944 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2829945 ive heard some crazy talk in my time but the fear surrounding the large hadron collider lhc at cern has really surprised me
2829946 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2829947 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2829948 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2829951 our grand old musharraf has not been passing on all the 1billion a year the americans have been giving for the armed forces the army has been getting 250 300 million reimbursement for what they do but wheres the rest
2829952 they claim its been going in budget support but thats not the answer were talking about 700million a year missing the rest has been taken by mush for some scheme or other and weve got to find it
2829953 i think i have to get it back to at least even par to have a chance to win
2829954 i am putting nicely so if i can just keep driving it well i will probably be a little more aggressive with my irons to give myself some birdie opportunities
2829955 you could shoot a really good score this afternoon to shoot a three or six under youre going to have to play well but its out there because the greens are softer
2829956 everythings softer because of all the rain yesterday so you can be more aggressive with your approach shots
